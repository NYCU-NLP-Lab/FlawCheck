{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the percentage of illegal immigrants who came in on an airplane and overstayed their visa. The claim states that about 40 percent of U.S. illegal immigrants fit this description, but it is possible that the actual percentage is higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the assertion that 40 percent of U.S. illegal immigrants entered on an airplane and overstayed their visa. It relies on a quote from a congressman and mentions previous studies, but does not provide concrete evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all illegal immigrants who entered on an airplane and overstayed their visa have never gone home. This assumption may not be accurate as some individuals may have left the country at a later time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of illegal immigrants in the U.S. It focuses solely on those who entered on an airplane and overstayed their visa, without considering other methods of illegal entry or overstay.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any established facts. However, the lack of specific data or comprehensive study on the topic makes it difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim."}
