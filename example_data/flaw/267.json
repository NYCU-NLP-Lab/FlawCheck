{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that \"almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent\" without providing enough evidence to support this statement.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by cherry-picking data to support the idea of Americans working longer hours, rather than considering a broader timeframe.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Americans are working longer hours for lower wages and that almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in income for the top 1 percent is directly related to the lower wages and longer hours worked by the general population, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in income inequality, such as changes in economic policies or technological advancements."}
