{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Gov. Carl Sanders allocated the state budget to education by stating that it was 56 percent, a figure that has not been achieved since.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to verify the accuracy of the 56 percent figure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that allocating a high percentage of the state budget to education is an indicator of progress or success in education.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Georgia's education spending has fallen in recent years, as mentioned in a study by a national education organization.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the current level of education funding in Georgia by implying that it has not reached the level achieved under Gov. Carl Sanders."}
