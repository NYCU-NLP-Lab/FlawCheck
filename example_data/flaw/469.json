The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations, such as the possibility of positive effects of NSAIDs on the virus, which contradicts the claim that ibuprofen worsens COVID-19 symptoms.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence to suggest that ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs worsen COVID-19 cases.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a strong and reliable basis for its assertion that ibuprofen worsens COVID-19 symptoms."}
