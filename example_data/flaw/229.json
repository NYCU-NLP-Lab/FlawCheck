{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential punishment for sexting in Texas by stating that it can mean up to 10 years in prison. The expert's verdict mentions that under the proposed law, minors could face a year in county jail and up to a $4,000 fine, but there is no mention of a potential 10-year prison sentence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or statistics to support the statement that sexting is a felony sex offense for teenagers in Texas. The expert's verdict mentions that no Texas law specifies sexting as a crime.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that sexting being a felony sex offense for teenagers is a problematic situation that needs to be addressed. However, this assumption may not be universally agreed upon.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential punishment of sexting in Texas. The expert's verdict mentions that prosecutors can either bring sexting cases under strict child pornography laws or do nothing, suggesting that there may be alternative approaches to addressing the issue."}
