{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of children paralyzed due to a polio vaccine, as there is no evidence to support the claim of 496,000 paralyzed children.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible news reports to support the assertion that 496,000 children were paralyzed due to a polio vaccine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Gates Foundation tested a polio vaccine in India between 2000 and 2017, leading to the paralysis of children, without providing any evidence or substantiation for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been only 17 cases of vaccine-derived polio in India since 2000, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have originated from a conspiracy theory spread by anti-vaccine advocates, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and subsequently covered by websites known for publishing misinformation, suggesting an alternative explanation for the claim."}
