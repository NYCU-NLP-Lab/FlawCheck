{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the video by stating that it shows the top Shiite leader Ayatollah Sistani in Iraq marking the Ashura walk. The video itself does not provide clear evidence of Ayatollah Sistani's presence or participation in the event.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is authentic and accurately represents Ayatollah Sistani's involvement in the Ashura walk. However, there is no concrete evidence or verification provided to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to validate the assertion that Ayatollah Sistani is shown in the video. The video itself is not conclusive, and there is no additional corroborating information or sources provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a possibility that the person shown in the video is not Ayatollah Sistani but another Shiite leader, such as Sayid Sadiq Shirazi, as indicated by the comparison of screenshots and additional information provided. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Ayatollah Sistani had advised against participating in traditional Ashura gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. The claim implies that Ayatollah Sistani was personally involved in the Ashura walk, which goes against his own guidance.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the significance of the video by not providing enough context or clarification about its authenticity. It presents the video as clear evidence of Ayatollah Sistani's involvement without acknowledging the doubts and alternative explanations that exist."}
