{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that President Ramaphosa and ANC members did not wear masks at a birthday party during lockdown. The evidence provided shows that the pictures used in the claim were from previous years and not during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of mask-wearing by President Ramaphosa and ANC members at a birthday party is contradictory to the instruction for the South African public to wear masks. However, there is no evidence provided to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that gatherings are prohibited under South Africa's lockdown regulations, except for places of worship with limited capacity. The evidence suggests that the pictures used in the claim were not recent and predated the COVID-19 outbreak.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the importance of wearing masks and following social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence provided does not support the claim that mask-wearing is unnecessary or that the virus can only be transmitted through bacteria injected via the flu vaccine.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for the lack of mask-wearing by President Ramaphosa and ANC members at the birthday party could be that the event took place before the COVID-19 pandemic or during a time when gathering restrictions were not in place. The evidence suggests that the pictures used in the claim were from previous years."}
