{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Biden's changes to immigration policies on the migrant caravan. The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Biden's actions would have directly impacted the caravan's experience at the U.S.-Mexico border.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the migrant caravan was headed to the U.S. solely because of President Biden's changes to immigration policies. The expert's verdict mentions that the caravan's motivations were multifaceted, including factors such as worsening economic and living conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and hurricanes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the migrant caravan's decision to head to the U.S. was solely motivated by President Biden's changes to immigration policies. The expert's verdict highlights that the motivations of the caravan members were influenced by various factors, and it is misleading to conflate their decision solely with Biden's stance on immigration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation to the claim by stating that the migrant caravan's motivations were not solely based on Biden's changes to immigration policies but also on worsening economic and living conditions, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and hurricanes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the migrant caravan had reportedly dissipated by the time President Biden took office and signed executive orders on immigration. The expert's verdict mentions that the caravan had already passed through Guatemala and its size had decreased significantly by the time Biden's actions were taken.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at times."}
