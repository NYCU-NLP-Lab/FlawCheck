{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by President Trump that he \"never said Russia did not meddle in the election\" is found to be false. The expert's verdict states that Trump has expressed the opinion that Russia did not hack the DNC's computers and has dismissed the Russian hacking as a \"so-called 'Russian hacking'.\"", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump has indeed denied or doubted Russia's involvement in the hacking since it became public in June 2016.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is contradicted by Trump's own past statements and actions regarding Russia's interference in the election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's revisionist remarks about his past comments on Russia are accurate, despite evidence to the contrary.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that Trump has alternately claimed that Russia did not or may not have interfered in the election, sometimes in the same interviews."}
