{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support its assertion that the US led the world in the percentage of 25-34 year olds with college degrees in 1990. The expert struggled to find accurate and comparable data from that time period.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in the US ranking from 1st to 12th place is solely due to a decline in the percentage of college-educated individuals, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of measuring college attainment and comparing it across different countries and time periods. The expert highlights the challenge of finding comparable data and the limitations in making an apples-to-apples comparison.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the change in the US ranking. Factors such as changes in population demographics, educational policies, and global trends in higher education could also contribute to the shift in rankings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the US currently ranks 12th in the percentage of 25-34 year olds with college degrees, as confirmed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data. However, the lack of comparable data from 1990 makes it difficult to determine if the claim contradicts the fact that the US led the world in college degree attainment at that time.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate and reliable data to support its assertion, as evidenced by the expert's struggle to find suitable data from 1990 and the limitations in making a direct comparison.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the decline in the US ranking by presenting it as a significant drop from 1st to 12th place without providing context or considering other factors that contribute to the rankings."}
