{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Target.com or Target blocked Israel from accessing and shopping their website. The only evidence provided is anecdotal accounts from a few individuals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Target.com or Target intentionally blocked access from Israel without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the temporary outage, such as technical issues or server problems, which were reported by a local news source.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the temporary outage by presenting it as a minor issue that was quickly resolved. However, the frustration expressed by individuals who experienced the \"Access Denied\" message suggests that it may have had a greater impact.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting conflicting information. While some individuals reported being unable to access the website, others reported that it was accessible and fully operational.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Target.com was accessible and fully operational on December 7, 2016, according to Twitter users based in Israel.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the issue by suggesting that Target blocked all Israeli computers from viewing their website, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim."}
