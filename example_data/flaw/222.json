{"Lack enough support": "The claim made on Twitter does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that no elections will be conducted using EVMs for constituencies with more than 100 candidates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that EVMs cannot handle more than 100 candidates, which is not supported by the official spokesperson of the Election Commission of India (ECI). The assumption is based on misinformation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the latest EVMs can accommodate up to 384 candidates, including NOTA, as clarified by the spokesperson of the ECI.", "Understate": "The claim understates the capabilities of EVMs by suggesting that they cannot be used for constituencies with more than 100 candidates, whereas they can actually handle a much larger number.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the need for using ballot papers instead of EVMs by urging people to get as many candidates as possible nominated in their constituencies. This exaggeration is based on the false assumption that EVMs cannot handle more than 100 candidates.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by spreading misinformation and creating uncertainty about the use of EVMs for elections with more than 100 candidates, despite the clarification provided by the official spokesperson of the ECI."}
