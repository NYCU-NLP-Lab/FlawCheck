{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between Robert Maxwell and Mitt Romney, suggesting that Maxwell gave Romney his first $2M investment and started him in business.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Maxwell's investment was not the first in the fund and that Romney had already established himself in business before receiving Maxwell's investment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the alleged connection between Romney and Epstein, as Robert Maxwell died before his daughter began working with Epstein.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct link between Maxwell's investment in Romney and Romney's later political career, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Maxwell's investment in Romney's fund, such as purely financial motivations, rather than any specific intention to start Romney in business."}
