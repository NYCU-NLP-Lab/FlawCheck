{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the level of support from the auto industry for the Obama administration's fuel standards, implying that they thought it was a \"good idea\" when in reality they reluctantly agreed to the proposal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or quotes from auto industry executives to back up the assertion that they thought the fuel standards were a \"good idea.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the auto industry did not agree with President Trump's proposal to roll back the fuel standards, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the auto industry's reticence towards Trump's plan, stating that it is mostly tied to the failure to reach an agreement with California on uniform fuel standards.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that auto executives have repeatedly implored Trump to revisit and relax the fuel standards, arguing that the current market makes them unfeasible and could lead to job losses.", "Understate": "The claim understates the reluctance of the auto industry towards federally mandated fuel efficiency standards, implying that they were more supportive of the Obama administration's proposal than they actually were."}
