{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the miraculous opening and closing of the statue's eyes. The video is dark, blurry, and low-resolution, making it difficult to determine the authenticity of the event.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the opening and closing of the statue's eyes are a miraculous event without providing concrete evidence or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Social media users and skeptics have suggested that the video could be an optical illusion or a result of Photoshop manipulation. The fact that officials of the Diocese of Saltillo declined to view the video or issue a statement about its authenticity also raises doubts.", "Falters at times": "The expert points out that the timing of the video is suspicious, and the sequence of the statue opening and closing its eyes appears more like a cheesy special effect in a low-budget horror film than a genuine miracle.", "Contradict fact": "The expert highlights that alterations in other areas of the image occur at the same moments the eyes open and close, suggesting that the video has been doctored.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the video by presenting it as a miraculous event without sufficient evidence or support."}
