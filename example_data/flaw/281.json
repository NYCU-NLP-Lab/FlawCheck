{"Understate": "The claim may understate the gender pay gap by stating that women make 77 cents for every dollar men make. Other data suggests that the gap may be smaller when comparing men and women of similar education levels, job titles, time on the job, and other factors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that women make 77 cents for every dollar men make. It is unclear where this statistic comes from.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the gender pay gap is solely due to gender discrimination. The expert's verdict mentions that the gap can be influenced by factors such as specific occupation, time on the job, and education level, which suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the gap.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the gender pay gap, such as differences in hours worked between men and women. This implies that the claim may overlook these alternative explanations and attribute the entire gap to gender discrimination."}
