{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that Scott Walker's funding cuts to local governments in Wisconsin contributed to the \"second-largest increase in violent crime\" in the Midwest. The expert's verdict mentions that Burke's claim lacks evidence to support this significant increase in crime.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that Burke does not provide evidence to support the claim that Walker's funding cuts led to significant cuts in law enforcement agencies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between Scott Walker's funding cuts and the increase in violent crime in Wisconsin, without considering other factors that may have contributed to this increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that while Walker cut shared revenue to local governments, his Act 10 collective bargaining reform law helped many local governments absorb some of the cuts by requiring public employees to pay more for their benefits. Additionally, Walker's campaign argued that the state has taken other anti-crime measures, such as increased funding to fight domestic violence. These alternative explanations suggest that there may be other factors influencing the increase in violent crime.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the size of Milwaukee's police force remained steady during Walker's tenure, indicating that the claim may falter in suggesting significant cuts to law enforcement agencies."}
