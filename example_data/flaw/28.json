{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which mostly Democrat states refused to hand over data. While it is true that some Democrat states did not comply with the commission's request, not all Democrat states refused, and some Republican states also rejected or didn't comply.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that mostly Democrat states refused to hand over data. It does not provide specific examples or numbers to back up the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the possibility that states from both political parties, including Republican states, also rejected or didn't comply with the commission's request. It presents a one-sided view by solely blaming Democrat states and implying that they are the only ones resisting the commission.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the challenges faced by the voter fraud commission, such as infighting, multiple lawsuits, and pushback from many states. It simplifies the reasons for the demise of the commission by solely attributing it to Democrat states' refusal to hand over data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the refusal of mostly Democrat states to hand over data is evidence of election fraud. It does not provide any evidence or justification for this assumption, and it disregards the fact that instances of voter fraud are generally considered isolated and rare by national experts."}
