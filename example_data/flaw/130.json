{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided in the expert's verdict to directly support the claim that the video shows the funeral procession of Congress politician Ahmed Patel.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video indeed shows the funeral procession of Ahmed Patel without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts the claim by comparing the coffin seen in the misleading posts with the coffin seen in the official video of Ahmed Patel's funeral procession, showing that they do not match.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by mentioning a video published by Hindustani Reporter that shows a similar casket as seen in the misleading posts, but it is associated with the funeral of politician Jamil Shaikh, not Ahmed Patel."}
