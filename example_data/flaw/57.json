{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that the \"vast majority\" of Wisconsin students cannot read, write, or do math at grade level. The evidence provided shows that around 39.3% of students were rated as proficient or advanced in English Language Arts and 40.1% reached those levels for math, indicating that a significant portion of students do meet grade level standards.", "Understate": "The claim may also be seen as understating the situation by not acknowledging the percentage of students who are proficient or advanced in English Language Arts and math. While the provided evidence shows that there is room for improvement, it does not support the claim that the \"vast majority\" of students are not at grade level.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that the \"vast majority\" of Wisconsin students cannot read, write, or do math at grade level. The evidence provided only shows the proficiency levels for English Language Arts and math, which do not encompass all subjects or grade levels.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being proficient or advanced in English Language Arts and math is equivalent to being at grade level. However, the expert's analysis suggests that the definition of \"proficient\" has changed in Wisconsin and may not align with the traditional understanding of grade level.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the proficiency levels observed in the provided evidence. Factors such as variations in teaching methods, resources, and student demographics could contribute to the results and should be taken into account before making a sweeping statement about the abilities of Wisconsin students."}
