{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Obama separated families and kept children in cages, as there were major differences between the immigration policy during the Obama era and the child detention centers under Trump.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that families were indeed separated under Obama's deportation policies, as children born in the United States were allowed to stay while their parents were forced to leave.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Obama separated families in the same way as Trump, as it only provides a photograph of protesters holding a sign without further evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph of the protesters holding a sign is evidence of Obama separating families, without considering the context and differences in immigration policies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the photograph, such as the protesters advocating for a change in immigration policies rather than directly blaming Obama for family separations."}
