{"Understate": "The claim may understate the changes in public opinion on same-sex marriage by stating that the polls are not dramatically changing, despite evidence of significant shifts in attitudes towards gay marriage nationally and within Wisconsin.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert only points to two polls from 2014, neither of which provide Wisconsin-specific data, and one poll conducted by St. Norbert College that shows a substantial drop in support for the 2006 amendment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that if public opinion has shifted in favor of same-sex marriage, advocates should put the issue to another statewide referendum. This assumption may not be valid as public opinion can change without the need for another referendum.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of dramatic change in polls, such as the possibility that the polls are not accurately capturing shifts in public opinion or that the sample sizes of the polls are too small to accurately reflect the population's views."}
