{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Indians in Spain are celebrating the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, based on a video of a dhol procession. There is no evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the dhol procession in Spain is specifically related to the construction of Ram Mandir.
