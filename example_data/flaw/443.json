{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Tony Evers' stance on giving in-state tuition and driver's licenses to \"illegal aliens\" based on his statement supporting legislation that would allow DACA students to have in-state tuition.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting in-state tuition for DACA students equates to supporting it for \"illegal aliens,\" which may be a problematic assumption as DACA recipients have a different legal status.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to conclusively prove that Tony Evers wants to give in-state tuition and driver's licenses to \"illegal aliens\" as it only provides a statement from Evers supporting legislation for DACA students' in-state tuition.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Evers' statement, such as supporting in-state tuition for DACA students but not for all \"illegal aliens,\" which the claim does not consider."}
