{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of a \"strong security wall\" on ending illegal crossings.", "Understate": "The claim understates the previous safety of El Paso and the decrease in violent crime rates before the construction of a border fence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that a security wall almost completely ended illegal crossings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ending illegal immigration would also end human trafficking, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for human trafficking, such as people being smuggled through legal ports of entry."}
