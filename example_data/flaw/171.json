{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the CDC has not confirmed any mortality rate for COVID-19. The Facebook posts draw on a range of estimates published by the CDC, but it does not provide a confirmed death rate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CDC has confirmed a 0.2% death rate for COVID-19, which is not true. It is based on misleading and false information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CDC has not established a mortality rate for the disease. The posts on Facebook mislead the public by suggesting a confirmed death rate.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual mortality rate of COVID-19. Health experts project that the mortality rate is likely closer to 1%, which is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on misleading and false statements regarding the CDC's confirmation of a 0.2% death rate. It fails to provide accurate information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, which is that the CDC's estimates range from 0.2% to 1%, with a \"best estimate\" of 0.4%. This suggests that the mortality rate may vary and is not confirmed at 0.2%."}
