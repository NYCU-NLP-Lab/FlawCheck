{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CDC did not make a statement that 85% of people who wear masks catch the coronavirus.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the findings of the CDC study, which actually stated that 85% of COVID-19 patients surveyed reported wearing a mask \"always\" or \"often\" in the 14 days before illness onset, not that they caught the virus because of wearing masks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details about the statement it refers to.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by the CDC supports the idea that wearing masks increases the risk of catching the coronavirus, which is not accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the CDC study's findings, such as the higher risk associated with eating in restaurants or drinking in bars, which were identified as potential factors for COVID-19 transmission."}
