{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that a woman found human ashes in a $2 blue heart ornament. The information provided is based on a viral online advertisement and a news report, but there is no additional verification or direct evidence presented.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ashes found in the ornament are human, but it is stated that it is unknown if they are from a human or animal. This assumption may be problematic as it is not supported by concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that the ornament may have ended up in the thrift store due to someone cleaning out an estate or emptying a relative's house without realizing what they were giving up. This alternative explanation raises the possibility that the ornament was not intentionally left with the ashes inside.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it is based on a viral online advertisement and a news report. Viral content and online advertisements are often associated with misleading stories, which may raise doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of facts in the provided claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear exaggeration in the provided claim.", "Understate": "There is no clear understatement in the provided claim."}
