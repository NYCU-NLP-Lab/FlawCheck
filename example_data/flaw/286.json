{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or research to back up the tips for avoiding contracting the swine flu. It only mentions that the tips have been circulated on the internet and attributed to various doctors, but it does not provide any scientific evidence or studies to support their effectiveness.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tips provided in the list are valid and useful for avoiding contracting the swine flu. However, without any supporting evidence or scientific backing, it is a problematic assumption to make.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that the list of tips may not have been written by a doctor at all and that various names were added to lend it credibility. This alternative explanation raises doubts about the authenticity and reliability of the tips provided in the list.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that it is almost impossible to avoid coming into contact with H1N1 (swine flu) in a global epidemic of this nature, despite all precautions. This contradicts the claim that the provided tips can effectively avoid contracting the swine flu.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the seriousness and potential risks of contracting the swine flu. It focuses more on simple steps like hand-washing and avoiding touching the face, rather than addressing other important preventive measures such as vaccination, wearing masks, and practicing social distancing.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing enough information or clarification on certain points. For example, it mentions that gargling with salt water has the same effect as using Listerine, but it does not explain what the effect is or provide any further details."}
