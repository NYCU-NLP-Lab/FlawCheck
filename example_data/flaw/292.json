{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that New York election law prohibits wearing candidate shirts or hats within 100 feet of polling places. It only mentions that voters will be turned away if they wear shirts endorsing specific candidates, without mentioning the legal restriction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the assertion that polling hours have been deliberately shortened to suppress primary votes. The expert's verdict mentions that primary voting in some counties has historically been shorter than for general election voting, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim of deliberate suppression.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voters wearing shirts endorsing any candidates will be denied the right to vote, without providing evidence or specific instances where this has occurred. The expert's verdict mentions the provision of \"passive electioneering\" in New York State voting laws, but there is no reason to assume that it would affect only those casting ballots for a particular candidate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the rumors and concerns about voter suppression, such as confusion in the system and the enforcement of laws against passive electioneering. This suggests that there are alternative explanations for the claim and undermines its validity.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that primary voting in some counties has historically been shorter than for general election voting. The claim implies that the shortening of polling hours is a deliberate effort to suppress primary votes, while the expert's verdict suggests that it is a historical pattern.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting rumors and concerns as definitive evidence of voter suppression. The expert's verdict mentions that the 2016 primary election in New York was rife with rumors, indicating that the claim may not be entirely reliable."}
