{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the Redskins Training Camp deal by stating that it generated $40 million in new private investment in the city. The expert's verdict mentions that very little private money has been spent so far and construction has not yet begun on certain projects.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to substantiate the $40 million figure. The expert's verdict mentions that the investments are based on taxable improvements, but it does not provide detailed evidence or breakdown of how this figure was calculated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $40 million in private investment is directly attributable to the Redskins Training Camp deal. The expert's verdict mentions that the investments are based on taxable improvements, but it does not explicitly establish a causal link between the training camp deal and the private investment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the private investment may not be solely due to the Redskins Training Camp deal, as construction has not yet begun on certain projects and the contracts can be voided. This implies that there may be alternative explanations for the private investment in the city."}
