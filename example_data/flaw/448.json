{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that Ted Cruz said he literally talks to God. The provided sources do not include any direct quotes or credible citations attributing this statement to Cruz.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ted Cruz made the statement about talking to God based on a circulating meme and quotes found on various websites. However, there is no concrete evidence or proof linking Cruz to this statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Ted Cruz frequently invokes the word of God during his political speeches, but there is no record of him specifically stating that he \"literally\" speaks to God. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Cruz's religious beliefs or his use of religious language in his speeches."}
