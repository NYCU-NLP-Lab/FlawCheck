{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that President Reagan raised the debt ceiling 18 times and President George W. Bush raised it 7 times, without providing any context or comparison to other presidents.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that President Reagan and President George W. Bush raised the debt ceiling the specified number of times.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim suggests that President Reagan and President George W. Bush were solely responsible for raising the debt ceiling, there may exist alternative explanations or factors that contributed to the need for raising the debt ceiling during their presidencies."}
