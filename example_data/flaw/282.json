{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of homeless children and youth in West Virginia, as it states that over 10,000 have been identified as homeless for the 2018-2019 school year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that over 10,000 children and youth have been identified as homeless.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of homeless students is unacceptably large without providing a clear benchmark or comparison.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the increase in the number of homeless students, such as the opioid epidemic and floods mentioned by Rebecca Derenge.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a comprehensive understanding of the issue, as it does not mention that students in foster care are not included in the homeless student count."}
