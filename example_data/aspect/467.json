{"The claim made by President Donald Trump is that the Democrats are responsible for the policy of breaking up families entering the country illegally due to": "bad laws\" they gave.", "The expert": "s verdict states that there is no such law that mandates the separation of families. Instead, it is the Trump administration's decision to criminally prosecute all immigrants crossing the border illegally that leads to the separation.", "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen directed her department to refer all unauthorized immigrants who cross the U": "S. border to federal prosecutors, in accordance with the Department of Justice's \"zero tolerance\" policy on illegal immigration. This policy results in parents being sent to federal court and placed in detention centers, while their children are transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services for placement in juvenile facilities or foster care.", "The expert also mentions that since the administration of George W": "Bush, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has held many parents and children who crossed the border seeking asylum in family detention centers, keeping them together until they go before an immigration judge. This suggests that the current policy of separating families is not a result of existing laws but a change in enforcement approach by the Trump administration."}
