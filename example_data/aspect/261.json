{"The Oregon": "kicker law\" is a refund law that requires a refund to taxpayers if the state collects more money in taxes than economists projected, by at least 2 percent. This law is often a subject of political debates over spending and taxes.", "Former state Rep": "Brent Barton, a Democrat, wrote a guest column urging the state to divert the kicker and use the money to build a savings fund that could boost Oregon's credit rating. He claims that the ratings agencies recognize that the state's financial instability is largely due to the kicker system.", "Steve Buckstein of the Cascade Policy Institute argues that without the kicker": "legislators would spend all available funds on pay raises and new programs. He believes that the pressure not to spend is necessary and beneficial.", "The Oregonian": "s Harry Esteve highlighted a potential issue with the kicker system. If the state economist sets a low revenue figure, and then the economy rebounds, the state could end up sending millions of dollars back to taxpayers while making deep cuts to services. This occurred during the last recession."}
