{"The claim was based on a video published by the Facebook page": "Planet Paws\" that alleged Milk-Bone dog treats contained the canine carcinogen BHA.", "The video cited the unreliable health site Mercola as a source": "raising concerns about the credibility of the claim.", "A blog about dogs also made similar claims about BHA being a canine carcinogen": "but it only linked back to its own posts and did not provide any documentation from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support the claim.", "The NIH": "s 1991 report on possible carcinogenic effects of BHA stated that the available data from epidemiological studies were inadequate to evaluate the relationship between human cancer and BHA exposure. Additionally, the report mentioned experimental animals (presumably rats or mice) but did not include dogs, and the FDA listed BHA as a \"generally recognized as safe\" additive with no evidence of being a carcinogenic substance."}
