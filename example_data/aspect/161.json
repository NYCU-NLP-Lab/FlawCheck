{"The claim made by Kellyanne Conway is that the No": "1 source of income into Mexico is Mexicans working in the United States and sending money back.", "The expert": "s verdict states that while remittances from individuals in the United States do contribute significantly to the Mexican economy, they are not the country's No. 1 source of income.", "The expert mentions that Mexican exports to the United States": "including manufactured goods, oil, and agricultural products, generate a much larger amount of money than remittances. In 2015, the United States imported Mexican goods totaling $295 billion, which is more than 10 times the amount of remittances.", "Another aspect mentioned is the foreign direct investment by the United States": "which totaled $28 billion in 2015. This amount is higher than the projected remittances for 2016 and the total remittances for 2015."}
