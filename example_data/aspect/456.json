{"Border agents": "statement: The expert's verdict mentions that border agents have stated that \"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\" This statement serves as a claim that needs to be verified for its authenticity.", "Drug seizures data": "The expert's verdict mentions that the most solid federal data available concerns drugs seized on the border. The fact-checkers interpreted Rep. McKinley's comment to refer to the amount of drugs being seized at the border. They used data from Customs and Border Protection on drug seizures, including cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and fentanyl.", "Approximation of drug value": "Since the drug seizures data is measured in pounds and not value, the fact-checkers had to approximate the value of the seized drugs. They used data from various sources, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the University of Colorado, to estimate the value of different drugs. For fentanyl, they used a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange County sheriff's office.", "Comparison of estimated value": "After converting the pounds of seized drugs into grams and approximating their value, the fact-checkers concluded that the total value of seizures in fiscal year 2019 was about $44.2 million per week. This value is slightly lower than the $53 million figure cited by Rep. McKinley but falls within a reasonable range considering the fluctuating street value of drugs."}
