{"The claim states that Congress has an 11 percent approval rating": "which was verified by looking at the approval ratings from various pollsters such as Fox News, CBS News, CNN/ORC, ABC News/Washington Post, and NBC News/Wall Street Journal. The average approval rating was found to be 14 percent, slightly higher than the claim but still in the same ballpark.", "The claim states that 96": "4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected in 2014, which was verified by counting the number of incumbents who ran for re-election in the House and Senate.

The meme states \"11% approval ratings. 96.4% re-elected\" and is accompanied by a photograph of the House chamber. This visual representation adds to the authenticity of the claim and reinforces the discrepancy between approval ratings and re-election rates."}
