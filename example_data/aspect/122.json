{"Discrepancies in names and details": "The expert's verdict highlights that the names of the bakery owners mentioned in the claim (Melissa and Ben Morgan) are incorrect, as the real owners are Aaron and Melissa Klein. This inconsistency in names raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Incorrect information about the fine": "The claim states that the bakery owners were fined $135,000, but the expert's verdict clarifies that the actual fine imposed on the Kleins was $135,000, not $165,000. This discrepancy in the reported amount further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Lack of evidence from the real Melissa Klein": "The expert's verdict mentions that the real Melissa Klein, upon being contacted, denied the truth of the story and stated that they do not play the lottery. This response from the actual person involved in the situation adds to the evidence against the claim's authenticity.", "Verification through official sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Oregon State Lottery page was checked, and there was no record of an Aaron or Melissa Klein winning a $3 million lottery in January 2018. This verification from an official source further discredits the claim."}
