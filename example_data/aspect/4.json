This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Unrealistic details": "The claim describes a 4-year-old boy hacking into the FBI's databases and bypassing all firewalls and security systems within minutes. This unrealistic portrayal raises suspicions and questions the credibility of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in the story": "The expert's verdict mentions that it is unclear how the boy learned to use a computer since his mother is described as an uneducated hairdresser with little computer skills. The presence of a computer in the house only since last Christmas, when the mother's ex-boyfriend gave her a laptop, adds further inconsistencies to the story.", "Admission of fabrication by the source": "The expert's verdict mentions that World News Daily Report, the source of the claim, openly admits that their articles are completely false and that they assume responsibility for the satirical and fictional nature of their content. This admission undermines the credibility of the claim and confirms it as a fabrication."}
