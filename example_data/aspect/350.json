{"The CDC": "s preliminary estimate for seasonal flu deaths for the 2018-19 season is about 34,200, again contradicting the claim of 80,000 deaths.", "The 80": "000 figure mentioned in the claim was a preliminary estimate provided by the CDC in September 2018, but the final figure for the 2017-18 flu season was lower than that.", "The methodology used by the CDC to estimate flu deaths involves looking at in": "hospital deaths and using death certificate data, as not all flu deaths occur in the hospital. This model accounts for the possibility that many deaths are due to flu but aren't coded as such, indicating that the number of flu deaths may be underestimated."}
