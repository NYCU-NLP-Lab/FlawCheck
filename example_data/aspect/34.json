{"Different assumptions in calculations": "One aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the fact that different researchers make different assumptions at the onset of their calculations, which can lead to varying estimates of the impact of the Paris Agreement on global average temperature. This suggests that the claim made by President Trump and his top environmental official may not be entirely accurate.", "Other studies showing greater reductions": "Another aspect is the existence of other studies that have shown greater reductions in global average temperature as a result of the Paris Agreement. These studies contradict the claim made by Trump and his official, indicating that their statement may be misleading or incomplete.", "Lack of response from Gore": "s office: The fact that Al Gore's office did not respond to requests for support of his statement also raises questions about the authenticity of the claim. It suggests that there may be a lack of evidence or data to back up Gore's assertion that the Paris Agreement gives tremendous momentum to reducing global warming.", "Reference to MIT report": "The White House and EPA spokespersons referred to a 2015 MIT report to support their claim that the impact of the Paris Agreement on the climate would be negligible. This aspect highlights the reliance on specific research to justify the claim, but it also raises the question of whether other studies or evidence contradict the findings of the MIT report."}
