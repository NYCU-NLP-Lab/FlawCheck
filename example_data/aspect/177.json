{"The lines on the Solo cup were not originally intended for measurement": "According to Margo Burrage, director of communications for Dart Container Corporation, the parent company of Solo's cups, the lines were a purposeful part of the design for other reasons such as making it easier to sip, preventing cups from sticking together, and providing a sturdier grip.", "Despite not being intended for measurement": "the lines on the original Solo cup do roughly correspond to 1, 5, and 12 ounces. However, the meaning of these measurements varies for different individuals. For some, it may represent a responsible pour at a tailgate, while for others, it may provide a more secure grip while manning the grill at a BBQ.", "The claim that the lines on the Solo cup designate specific measurements has been circulating as a viral social media rumor for years": "It recently resurfaced on Facebook and gained significant attention with over 2,700 shares, 1,000 reactions, and numerous comments in just a few days.", "Solo Cup Company addressed the rumor in 2012 by posting a playful graphic on its Facebook page": "revealing the \"real\" use of the lines on their cups. This indicates that the company acknowledges the existence of the rumor but clarifies that the lines were not intended for measurement purposes."}
