{"Testimony from AMAC political liaison Ellen Cora": "Cora stated in an email that she recalls AARP bulletins speaking positively about Planned Parenthood, implying that AARP may have supported federal funding for the organization.", "The 2011 report": "Behind the Veil: The AARP America Doesn\u2019t Know\": This report, prepared by U.S. Representatives Wally Herger and Dave Reichert, claimed to expose the conflict between AARP's drive for profits, the best interests of its members, and its tax-exempt status. It was released as a House subcommittee opened a hearing examining AARP's tax-exempt status, suggesting that there were concerns about AARP's activities.", "CNN report on Republican targeting of AARP": "CNN reported that Republicans were targeting AARP due to its support of then-President Barack Obama's health care bill. This suggests that AARP's support for the bill may have been seen as controversial and could potentially include support for federal funding for Planned Parenthood.", "Information from 2ndVote": "com: The website 2ndVote.com, which describes itself as a conservative watchdog for corporate activism, claims that AARP is a corporate supporter of the National Women's Law Center, a pro-abortion organization. They provide links to the center's report showing AARP's contribution and a fact sheet about marriage equality produced by the center. This implies a connection between AARP and organizations supporting abortion rights."}
