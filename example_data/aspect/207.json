{"The claim is based on a meme shared by the liberal Facebook group Occupy Democrats": "which accuses House Republicans of passing a bill that allows single mothers to be fired by their employers.", "The meme refers to the First Amendment Defense Act": "HR 2802), introduced by Republicans in response to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize gay marriage. The bill aims to protect religious institutions from potential consequences of opposing same-sex marriage.", "The First Amendment Defense Act does not mention single mothers or women at all": "focusing solely on protecting religious or moral convictions regarding marriage and sexual relations.", "Emily Martin": "vice president and general counsel of the National Women's Law Center, highlights the concern that the wording in the bill about sexual relations being reserved for heterosexual marriage could potentially be used to discriminate against single mothers or women in general. However, it should be noted that this concern is not directly addressed or supported by the bill itself."}
