{"The claim is based on a tweet by U": "S. President Donald Trump, which states that Sean Connery was instrumental in helping him secure approval for a \"big development in Scotland.\" This tweet serves as the primary source of the claim.", "The claim is supported by a quote from Trump during a visit to the UK in 2018": "where he mentioned that he met James Bond (referring to Connery) and got all his approvals for his controversial golf course in Turnberry. This statement provides additional evidence for the claim.", "There are reports from the Sunday Times stating that Trump told former UK Prime Minister Theresa May that Connery helped him win approval for his Turnberry golf course": "These reports add credibility to the claim as they suggest that Trump had previously mentioned Connery's involvement in securing approvals.", "Trump himself stated during the promotion of his Trump International Golf Links in Balmedie": "Aberdeenshire, that Connery had been instrumental in securing approval for that project. This statement from Trump further supports the claim and indicates a consistent pattern of him attributing Connery's involvement in obtaining approvals for his golf course developments."}
