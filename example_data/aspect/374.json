{"The claim is supported by statistics and data": "The expert's verdict provides several statistics and data points related to mental health in Nigeria, such as the number of neuropsychiatric hospitals, the rate of depression, the frequency of suicide, the number of psychiatrists, and the percentage of mentally ill Nigerians with access to care. These statistics help verify the claim about doctors leaving Nigeria.", "Comparison with international standards": "The expert's verdict compares Nigeria's physician-patient ratio with the World Health Organization's recommended ratio. By highlighting that Nigeria's ratio is six times smaller than the recommended ratio, it reinforces the claim that doctors are leaving the country for better opportunities elsewhere.", "Budget allocation for healthcare": "The expert's verdict mentions that Nigeria allocated only 3.95% of its budget to funding the Ministry of Health. This information indicates a lack of sufficient resources and investment in the healthcare sector, which could contribute to doctors seeking employment abroad.", "Testimonies and personal experiences": "While not explicitly mentioned in the given expert's verdict, it is possible that the authenticity of the claim was also verified through testimonies or personal experiences of doctors leaving Nigeria for the UK. Such firsthand accounts can provide additional evidence to support the claim."}
