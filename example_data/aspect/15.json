{"Schwarzenegger": "s claim on Twitter and Facebook: The expert's verdict mentions that Schwarzenegger made a claim on social media platforms about the average margin of victory in the House of Representatives being 37% for both Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 election. This claim serves as the basis for the verification process.", "Evidence from ballotpedia": "org: Schwarzenegger's spokesman cited ballotpedia.org as a source for the claim. The website is described as an independent, online encyclopedia of American politics and elections. It lists the average margin of victory for House members at 37.1%, which supports Schwarzenegger's claim.", "Analysis by Professor Pitney": "Professor Pitney crunched the election numbers and found a 39% margin of victory for House members. Although slightly different from the figure cited by Schwarzenegger and ballotpedia.org, Pitney confirms that the point about House members winning by big margins is essentially correct. He attributes the large margin to deliberate gerrymandering and increasing polarization among constituents.", "Example of California": "s redistricting commission: Supporters of California's redistricting commission argue that it has created more competitive districts. The case of California's 49th Congressional District, where incumbent Republican Darrell Issa faced a tough reelection campaign, is cited as an example. This example further supports the notion that gerrymandering and polarization contribute to the large margin of victory in House races."}
