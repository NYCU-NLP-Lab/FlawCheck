{"The claim is based on a statement made by Oklahoma State Rep": "Justin Humphrey, where he referred to a pregnant woman as a \"host\" for the fetus she carried. This statement was reported by various sources, including The Intercept and The Gaily Grind.", "The claim was verified by examining the original sources where Rep": "Humphrey made the statement. It was found that he did indeed use the term \"host\" to describe a woman in the context of pregnancy and abortion.", "The timing of the statement was also verified": "The claim initially created the impression that it was describing current events, but it was discovered that Rep. Humphrey made the remarks in February 2017, generating outrage at the time.", "The legislative actions taken by Rep": "Humphrey were examined to further verify the authenticity of the claim. It was confirmed that he introduced House Bill 1441, which aimed to require written consent from the fetus's father for an abortion. Although the bill did not pass into law, it was supported by the State Legislature's Public Health Committee."}
