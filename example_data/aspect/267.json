{"The claim states that": "almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent.\" The expert verifies this aspect by referring to a background graphic from a 2013 Pew Research blog post, which shows skyrocketing income among the top 1 percent. However, the expert notes that the labeling indicating the data cover 1917 to 2007 is missing from the Sanders commercial.", "The claim suggests that Americans are working longer hours": "The expert challenges this aspect by citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows that the average work week has been declining over the past five decades. The expert mentions that while workers may perceive longer hours based on their own experiences, Gallup data from most of this century does not show a significant change in the work week for full-time employees.", "The claim implies that Americans": "wages are lower. The expert refers to a 2011 Brookings Institution study, which concludes that income for the middle 10 percent of families increased by 23 percent since 1975. However, the expert clarifies that this increase is primarily due to family members working 26 percent more hours, rather than an increase in wages.", "The expert addresses the overall message of the claim": "which is that hard-working people have been falling behind economically. The expert acknowledges that the claim attempts to make this point, but does not provide specific evidence or data to verify or refute it."}
