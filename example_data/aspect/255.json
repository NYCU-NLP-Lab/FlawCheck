{"The claim alleges that": "political interference\" from Scott Walker's administration has led to the gagging of DNR scientists, preventing them from commenting on proposed legislation. The expert's investigation reveals that there have been reports of DNR testimony being absent from a legislative hearing regarding chronic wasting disease and the baiting/feeding of white-tailed deer. This suggests a potential restriction on scientists' ability to comment on proposed legislation.", "The claim also states that": "we're letting polluters write their own permits\" under Walker's administration. The expert's analysis shows that the DNR explicitly denied these accusations, specifically regarding dairy producers being allowed to write their own permits. However, it is found that the DNR has implemented initiatives aimed at streamlining the permitting process and shifting some permit-related paperwork to credentialed contractors.", "The expert": "s analysis includes a report from Scientific American with the headline \"How Scott Walker dismantled Wisconsin's environmental legacy.\" Although the specific details of this report are not mentioned, the headline implies that there may be evidence supporting the claim of political interference and its impact on environmental policies in Wisconsin."}
