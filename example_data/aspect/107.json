{"The claim is based on a Facebook post that includes an image comparing death tolls in the US over a five": "year period, ranging from 2.7 million in 2015 to 2.9 million in 2019, compared to 2,487,350 \"as of November 16th 2020.\"", "The numbers used in the graph are real and come from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention": "CDC), which regularly publishes statistics on mortality in the US.", "However": "the comparison made in the claim is misleading because it compares deaths across different time periods, which is not statistically sound. A proper comparison would require comparing the number of deaths occurring in the first 44 weeks of 2020 with the numbers of deaths occurring over the same weeks of previous years.", "By adjusting for the proper comparison": "it is found that there have been more than 310,000 excess deaths in 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019. Two-thirds of these excess deaths are attributable to Covid-19."}
