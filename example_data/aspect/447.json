{"Confirmation from a spokesperson for Republican Ken Cuccinelli": "Brian Gottstein, a spokesperson for Cuccinelli, confirmed that Mark Warner provided the critical vote in 2009 that prevented a Senate filibuster on the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Gottstein stated that \"Mark Warner provided that vote\" and that \"60 votes were needed to avoid a filibuster and allow the legislation to pass.\"", "Senate voting records": "On December 23, 2009, the Senate voted 60-39 to halt debate on Obamacare, with Warner joining all of his fellow Democrats and two independents in voting to stop a threatened Republican filibuster. The next day, the Senate passed Obamacare with an identical 60-39 vote. These voting records confirm Warner's support for the ACA.", "Comparison to other claims": "The expert's verdict mentions that Republicans and conservative groups across the country have accused several Democratic senators of casting the key vote that passed Obamacare, including Bill Nelson, Sherrod Brown, and Jeanne Shaheen. This comparison suggests that the claim about Warner being the tiebreaking vote is not unique and has been made about other senators as well.", "Analysis of the term": "tiebreaking vote\": The expert's verdict raises the question of whether Warner's vote can truly be considered the tiebreaking vote. While Warner's vote was crucial to ending the debate, it is noted that there were 59 other senators who also played a role in breaking the filibuster. This analysis provides a nuanced perspective on the claim's authenticity."}
