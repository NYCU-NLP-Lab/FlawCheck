{"Rosie O": "Donnell tweeted an \"offer\" of two million dollars each to Senators Flake and Collins if they voted \"no\" on a GOP tax bill.", "The claim that O": "Donnell broke federal law by posting her tweet is based on a largely superficial and incomplete legal analysis.", "O": "Donnell's tweet was obviously a hypothetical bit of humor intended to make a point, and neither Flake nor Collins voted against the bill.", "Despite the suggestion that O": "Donnell had broken federal bribery laws, it is highly unlikely that a case against her would make it very far based on the standard of evidence required for conviction."}
