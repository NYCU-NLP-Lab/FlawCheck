{"Ernst": "s belief in state-driven policy: Ernst consistently emphasizes the importance of state-driven policy and believes that the state knows best how to protect resources. This aligns with her call to shut down the EPA, further confirming the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of response regarding Pell Grants": "The ad claims that if Ernst is elected, 213,000 Iowa students would lose their federal Pell Grants. The fact that the Ernst campaign did not respond to inquiries about her plan for Pell Grants suggests that the claim made in the ad is accurate."}
