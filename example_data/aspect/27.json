{"Testimony of Rep": "John Carter: The claim is supported by the statement made by Rep. John Carter, who stated that about 40 percent of illegal immigrants entered the US on an airplane with a legal visa and overstayed their visa without returning home. This provides a direct source of information supporting the claim.", "General Accountability Office": "GAO) report: The GAO report mentioned in the expert's verdict confirms that each year, millions of visitors come to the United States legally on a temporary basis, and some of them overstay their authorized periods of admission. This report provides evidence that supports the claim that a significant number of illegal immigrants enter the US through overstaying their visas.", "Previous PolitiFact research": "PolitiFact has previously found substance to similar claims, stating that visitors who overstay their visas range from about one-third to roughly half of all the country's illegal immigrants. This previous research provides additional evidence that supports the claim made by Rep. John Carter.", "Unmatched arrival records": "The Department of Homeland Security has more than 1 million \"unmatched\" arrival records, indicating individuals who checked in with immigration officials upon entering the country but have no record of checking out upon departure. This suggests that there is a significant number of individuals who have overstayed their visas and adds further weight to the claim."}
