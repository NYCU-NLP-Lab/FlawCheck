{"Statistical claim made by Tammy Baldwin": "The claim states that \"83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent of individuals and large multinational corporations\" under the Republican tax reform law.", "Analysis by the nonpartisan Urban Institute": "Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center: The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on an analysis conducted by the Tax Policy Center, which found that by 2027, the law would deliver 82.8 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of the income spectrum.", "Variation in distribution of benefits over time": "The expert's verdict highlights that while the claim refers to the overall percentage of benefits going to the top 1 percent, the distribution of benefits would vary over the years. In 2018, the analysis projected that only 20.5 percent of the benefits would go to the top 1 percent, and by 2025, it would be 25.3 percent. This indicates that the claim's figure of 83 percent is not accurate for all years.", "Impact of tax provisions and inflation calculation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the distribution of benefits changes over time due to the expiration of certain tax provisions and changes in inflation calculation. This suggests that the claim's percentage of benefits going to the top 1 percent may be influenced by these factors and may not remain constant throughout the implementation of the tax law."}
