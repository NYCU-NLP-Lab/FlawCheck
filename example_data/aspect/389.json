{"The claim is based on the statement made by state Rep": "Joaquin Castro during a Texas Tribune Festival discussion, where he claimed that Texas has gone the longest without electing a Democrat statewide since 1994.", "The last Democrats elected statewide in Texas were Lt": "Gov. Bob Bullock, Attorney General Dan Morales, and State Comptroller John Sharp in 1994. This information verifies the claim that it has been since 1994 that a Democrat has been elected in Texas.", "The Associated Press reported in a news article on July 30": "2012, that \"Texas Democrats have the longest losing streak in the nation in statewide elections.\" This report supports the claim that Texas Democrats have been shut out of statewide office for a significant period of time.", "A comparison was made with other states to determine if Texas has the longest current stretch of statewide Democratic losses": "Through this comparison, it was found that there are three states potentially more long-lastingly difficult for Democrats running statewide than Texas: Idaho, South Carolina, and Utah. This aspect provides a broader context and perspective on the claim."}
