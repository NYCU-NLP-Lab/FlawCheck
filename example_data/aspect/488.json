{"The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office": "CBO) estimated that by 2017, there would be the equivalent of about 2 million fewer workers than there would be in the absence of the health care law. This number was projected to grow to about 2.5 million by 2024.", "House Speaker John Boehner": "along with many Republicans and conservatives, highlighted the CBO's finding that the health care law is expected to result in the loss of 2.3 million jobs.", "Critics of the claim argued that the word": "destroyed\" used by Boehner was misleading, as it implied that jobs were being eliminated by businesses. The CBO report actually referred to workers who would choose to leave the workforce due to new options for purchasing health insurance outside of their job.", "Economists": "such as Gary Burtless from the Brookings Institution, pointed out that workers who have access to less expensive health insurance through Medicaid or federal tax credits may choose to work fewer hours after the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The CBO estimated that the ACA would result in a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent hours worked by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent from 2017 to 2024."}
