{"The claim was made by State Rep": "Jeremy Thiesfeldt during a Republican statewide weekly radio address, highlighting the need for improvement in education in Wisconsin.", "Thiesfeldt": "s staff pointed to the most recent Wisconsin Student Assessment System results, specifically the Forward Exam for grades three to eight and ACT-related tests for grades nine to 11, as evidence for the claim. The results showed that 39.3% of students were rated as proficient or advanced in English Language Arts, and 40.1% reached those levels for math, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.", "The term": "grade level\" was used by Thiesfeldt to refer to how students perform relative to a standard set by officials. However, it was noted that the definition of \"grade level\" changed in 2013 when Wisconsin raised the achievement level needed to reach the \"proficient\" threshold in alignment with the National Assessment of Educational Progress. This raises questions about whether \"proficient\" can still be equated to grade level.", "Alan Borsuk": "a senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University Law School, suggested that combining the categories of \"basic,\" \"proficient,\" and \"advanced\" could provide a rough measure of whether students are on grade level. Using this approach, approximately three-quarters of Wisconsin public school students would be considered on grade level."}
