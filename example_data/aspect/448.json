{"Lack of citation": "The initial claim circulating on the internet did not include a citation indicating when and where Ted Cruz allegedly made the statement about talking to God. This lack of a proper source raises doubts about the authenticity of the quote.", "No major publication attribution": "Despite the claim appearing on various websites, no major publication could be found that attributed the quote to Ted Cruz. The absence of reputable sources supporting the claim further questions its authenticity.", "Quote origin": "The quote in question first appeared on a blog in October 2013, but no evidence was provided linking Ted Cruz to the statement. The lack of proof connecting Cruz to the quote diminishes its credibility.", "Cruz": "s response: During an interview with Fox host Megyn Kelly, Cruz was asked if he had received a word from God about his presidential run. In his response, Cruz mentioned being blessed to receive a word from God through reading the scriptures, but he did not claim to \"literally\" talk to God. This contradicts the specific claim made in the circulating quote."}
