{"The ad from BornAliveTruth": "org criticizes Barack Obama's votes on abortion when he was a state senator in Illinois.", "The ad features Gianna Jessen": "a woman who was born after a failed abortion, speaking about Obama's opposition to a law that would protect babies left to die after failed abortions.", "The ad refers to Illinois legislation put forward in 2001": "2002, and 2003, which aimed to require doctors to provide immediate life-saving care to infants surviving intended abortions.", "Obama did vote against the laws": "but the older Illinois law already required medical care for viable fetuses, so Jessen's claim that she wouldn't be here if Obama had his way is incorrect."}
