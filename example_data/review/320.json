They summarized their findings this way:", "\"The Constitution does not directly address whether Congress may impeach and try a former President for actions taken while in office,\" the six-page brief said. \"Though the text is open to debate, it appears that most scholars who closely examined the question have concluded that Congress has authority to extend the impeachment process to officials who are no longer in office.\"", "Some key points the publication lists in support of a trial for a former president:", "In 1876, the Senate ruled a former secretary of war could face an impeachment trial for actions taken in office even though he had since resigned (more on this in a bit).", "The U.S. impeachment process was set up with the British system in mind, where former officials could be impeached. The framers made many \"highly specific decisions about the impeachment process that departed from the British practice\" but \"chose not to explicitly rule out impeachment after an official leaves office.\"", "Many scholars have argued simple logic dictates impeachment remain an option. If impeachment didn\u2019t extend to someone no longer in office, any official could elude punishment by simply committing offenses late enough in the term, or by resigning once the impeachment process began. And Congress could never bar an official from holding future office as long as that person resigns first.", "In the only discussion of the timing of impeachment at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, most members took it for granted that the President would be impeachable after he left office.", "Former President John Quincy Adams clearly interpreted this as a non-expiring penalty.

The judgement is both, not either or.\"", "We\u2019ll note this and/or argument falls flat, however, as it flies in the face of history.

No Senate vote was taken because Nixon resigned after an impeachment vote from the House.", "The remaining possible penalty \u2014 a ban from holding federal office \u2014 didn\u2019t apply since Nixon had already served two terms, making any Senate action moot. That also makes the situation a poor analogue for the pending Trump impeachment.", "An 1876 case provides clearer parallels, however.", "William Belknap, secretary of war under President Ulysses S. Grant, was brought up for impeachment by the House, but he hastily resigned hours before the House voted to impeach him.", "When the matter moved to the Senate, Belknap argued the Senate had no jurisdiction since by the time the impeachment vote came up he \"was, (and) ever since hath been, and now is, a private citizen.\"", "The Senate disagreed. By a roll-call vote of 37-29, the Senate ruled Belknap was \"amenable to trial by impeachment for acts done as Secretary of War, notwithstanding his resignation of said office before he was impeached.\"", "In the end Belknap was acquitted, with 22 of the senators who supported acquittal saying they did so on the grounds that his resignation barred impeachment. So the Senate conclusion was not unanimous or unambiguous, but it was passed and supported by the majority of the body.", "Applying Belknap to the present situation, there\u2019s a case that the argument for trying Trump is even stronger than for Belknap, since Trump was impeached by the House while he was still in office, noted Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University, who wrote a 2001 paper on the subject.", "But there\u2019s an even simpler argument for this being constitutional: The current Senate said so.", "In a similar vote to that on Belknap\u2019s objection, the Senate on Jan. 26 voted 55-45 to table an objection from Paul that a trial of a private citizen violates the Constitution.", "Constitutional matters in this vein are traditionally left to the branches of government to interpret on their own, rather than relying on the courts, the Congressional Research Service says.
