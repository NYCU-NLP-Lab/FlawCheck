["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "A recent statement by state Attorney General Sam Olens had PolitiFact Georgia musing on the quirks of our digital age.\n\nThanks to the Internet, you can track your ex\u2019s new girlfriend on Facebook. You can watch a YouTube video of recording artist Nicki Minaj\u2019s wardrobe malfunction, over and over again. You can even buy a 1963 Studebaker on eBay while reclining in your Barcalounger.\n\nBut email your county commissioner? That\u2019s not so simple, Olens told attendees at an Atlanta Press Club breakfast Aug. 4. \u00a0\n\nThe subject came up as Olens talked about the state\u2019s open records and meetings laws, which journalists use to ferret out government corruption. It\u2019s a bad idea to require all governments to use the Internet to inform residents about meetings, Olens told breakfast-goers. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"[K]eep in mind, we still have cities and counties where the elected officials don\u2019t have email addresses, where there are no websites,\" Olens said.\n\nNo emails or websites? Surely, Olens jests. Nowadays, even pet cats have their own websites. Really.\n\nIt so happens that the Association County Commissioners of Georgia, a group that represents county governments, conducted a survey in July \u00a0to see which counties lacked websites. They found 30.\n\nThe state Attorney General\u2019s Office sent us a list of those counties, as well as information from the Georgia Municipal Association, which represents cities and towns statewide. The GMA lists 217 municipalities that don\u2019t have their own websites.\n\nSome of these governments have a Web presence on a local chamber of commerce or regional development website but do not control or operate them, said Beth Brown, a spokeswoman for the ACCG. \u00a0\n\nThey often don\u2019t have enough staff or money to run a website, spokeswomen for both groups told us. Others are so remote they can\u2019t get high-speed Internet access.\n\nConsider Taliaferro County. In 2009, an estimated 1,812 residents lived in all of its 195.4 square miles, according to census and state data. Their commissioners work part time, so officials don\u2019t see a need to spend the resources to give them their own accounts, the county clerk told us. \u00a0\n\nBacon County gives email addresses to elected officials who ask for them, but not all of them in this county of about 10,600 do. Their one-man IT department hopes to get the county\u2019s official website up soon. It just takes a lot of manpower to get it done, he said.\n\nThe city of Walthourville, population 4,000, just started its website this year and is in the process of assigning email addresses, the city clerk said. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo Olens is right. Not only are there counties and municipalities in Georgia that don\u2019t have websites or whose elected officials don\u2019t have government email. State organizations place their numbers at more than 200.\n\nOr, to put it differently, the cats of certain pet-obsessed owners have pounced across the digital divide well ahead of scores of Georgia governments. \u00a0\n\nOlens earns a True.", "Atlanta Press Club breakfast, \"Open Records and the Atlanta Public School Cheating Scandal,\" Aug. 4, 2011\n\nEmails and telephone interview, Lauren Kane, spokeswoman, Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, Aug. 5 and 8, 2011\n\nEmails and telephone interview, Beth Brown, director of communications, Association County Commissioners of Georgia, Aug. 8, 2011\n\nEmail interviews, Amy Henderson, public information manager, Georgia Municipal Association, Aug. 8 and 9, \u00a02011\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"Milton County vote likely,\" Feb. 16, 2010\n\nTelephone interview, Ruby Randolph, county clerk, Taliaferro County, Aug. 9, 2011\n\nTelephone interview, Juanita Johnson, Walthourville city clerk, Aug. 9, 2011\n\nTelephone interview, Brad Williamson, network administrator, Bacon County, Aug. 9, 2011\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, Population Finder, accessed Aug. 10, 2011\n\nWebsite, I Am Maru, accessed Aug. 9, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
