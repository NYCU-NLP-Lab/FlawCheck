["President Donald Trump cast Democrats as supporters of MS-13 gang members and uninterested in fighting crime.", "Trump routinely brings up brutal crimes committed by MS-13 members while highlighting his administration\u2019s goal to incarcerate or deport them from the United States.", "At the May 22 Susan B. Anthony List\u2019s Campaign for Life Gala, Trump claimed Democrats want open borders and don\u2019t want to stop illegal immigration.", "\"And the other day \u2014 just the other day \u2014 Nancy Pelosi came out in favor of MS-13,\" Trump said. \"That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard that. She wants them to be treated with respect, as do other Democrats.\"", "Trump repeated the charge against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on May 23 during a roundtable discussion on MS-13, saying: \"I noticed recently where Democrats, Nancy Pelosi as an example, are trying to defend MS-13 gang members. I called them animals the other day and I was met with rebuke. They said, \u2018they are people.\u2019 They are not people. These are animals.\"", "We wondered about Trump\u2019s claim that Pelosi \"came out in favor of MS-13\" and that she has defended gang members.

(Here\u2019s the full context.)", "Some interpreted Trump as saying all immigrants are \"animals.\"", "Trump went on Twitter May 18 to fight back that assessment: \"Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants, or Illegal Immigrants, \u2018Animals.\u2019 Wrong! They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as \u2018Animals,\u2019 a big difference - and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong, as usual!\" Trump tweeted.", "Pelosi clearly chose the interpretation of Trump\u2019s words at the roundtable that was least favorable to Trump. But that doesn\u2019t mean she was embracing violent gang members.", "At a May 17 press conference, the day after Trump\u2019s \"animals\" comment, Pelosi said \"calling people animals is not a good thing\" and defended \"undocumented immigrants.\" She did not mention MS-13 gang members.", "Pelosi said \"we're all God's children\" and spoke about \"a spark of divinity in every person on Earth.\"", "\"And so when the president of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, \u2018These aren't people. These are animals,\u2019 you have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person? \u2018These are not people. These are animals.\u2019 The president of the United States,\" Pelosi said.", "White House spokesman Steven Cheung said in an emailed statement, \"Pelosi either is peddling an out-of-context quote that mainstream media outlets have corrected or retracted (AP and CNN), or defending MS-13 gang members whose motto is rape, control, and kill.\"", "The White House said the \"animals\" term is language Trump has used before when talking about MS-13 gang members.", "Still, Pelosi did not defend MS-13 gang members or come out in their favor, as Trump claimed.
