We will base our rating on that specific claim.", "Background On Mortality Figures", "On March 3, the World Health Organization announced that 3.4% of confirmed coronavirus patients around the world had died. That figure is what epidemiologists call a \"case fatality rate.\"", "The ratio is \"crudely calculated by dividing the number of reported deaths over the number of reported confirmed cases,\" Carla Drysdale, a WHO spokeswoman, told PolitiFact National in March. She also said the ratio would change over time and vary from place to place.", "But the mortality rate, or \"death rate\" as the Facebook posts terms it, is much more difficult to determine. It is calculated by dividing the number of people who die from COVID-19 in a certain geographic area by the total estimated number of people infected. It doesn\u2019t rely solely on confirmed deaths and infections.", "The biggest problem is the denominator. Many who develop mild cases of COVID-19 or show no signs at all are never tested and thus aren\u2019t counted, skewing the ratio.", "Did The CDC Really \u2018Confirm\u2019 A 0.2% Death Rate?", "The Facebook post\u2019s claim that the CDC \"confirmed\" a 0.2% death rate draws on information in a planning document the federal agency published in May. The 0.2% figure is included, but it\u2019s the lowest in a range of five estimates.

It also places the number of asymptomatic cases between 20%-50%, with a 'best estimate' of 35%.
