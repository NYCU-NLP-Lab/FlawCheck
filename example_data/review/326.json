["Even after Joe Biden was sworn in on Jan. 20 as the nation's 46th president, many conspiracy theorists and social media users have continued to promote baseless claims of widespread election fraud to argue that the election was stolen.", "As some of former\u00a0President Donald Trump's most loyal\u00a0supporters hang on to false claims surrounding the 2020 election,\u00a0a viral social media post of\u00a0alleged statistics based on a failed lawsuit\u00a0has surfaced\u00a0and suggests that voter fraud\u00a0tilted Nevada's six electoral votes to Biden.", "A Feb. 2 Facebook post includes a screenshot with a list of various claims about Nevada's election: 42,000 people voted more than once; 19,000 didn't live in Nevada; 15,000 votes were cast from a commercial address; 8,000 voted using a non-existent address; 4,000 ineligible noncitizens voted; and 1,500 dead people voted.", "In a Facebook comment,\u00a0the author of the post points to a Dec. 2\u00a0article from the Washington Examiner regarding a previous lawsuit from the Trump campaign that attempted to overturn the election results in Nevada. The same article was shared to Facebook on Dec. 3 by Trump.", "The article's headline reads, \"Nevada 'fraud': 1,500 \u2018dead\u2019 voters, 42,248 voted \u2018multiple times,\u2019 RV camps as 'homes.'\"", "USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user for further comment.", "All the figures\u00a0in the claim stem from allegations made in December by a\u00a0Trump campaign lawyer who unsuccessfully attempted to challenge the certification of Nevada's 2020 election.\u00a0We'll assess each claim in detail.", "Fact check: Myanmar's November election had hand vote count; Dominion does no work there", "The claim that 42,000 people voted more than once in Nevada is false.

Muller, a professor at the\u00a0University of Iowa College of Law, analyzed\u00a0the origins of Binnall's 42,000 figure and found that the claim stemmed from a report\u00a0by the\u00a0Republican National Committee's chief data officer, Jesse Kamzol. The report lacked overall methodology and underlying data.", "Carson City District Judge James Russell ruled against the Trump campaign's request to block the certification of Nevada's presidential election results in early December.", "The court\u00a0concluded that the Kamzol's data\u00a0was not credible, and Russell\u00a0wrote that his\u00a0methodology \"had little to no information about or supervision over the origins of his data, the manner in which it had been matched, and what the rate of false positives would be.

He wrote that the voters were identified by comparing lists of voters with the U.S. Postal Service's National Change of Address database.", "In regards to the allegation that out-of-state residents voted in Nevada, Russell wrote there is no evidence to \"support a finding that election officials counted mail ballots from voters who also voted in other states.\"", "A case used to support this claim included a person seeing voters arriving to vote with out-of-state license plates. However, Russell wrote that this was not\u00a0evidence proving that those voters were not eligible to vote in Nevada, or that the voter had also cast a ballot in a different state.", "Fact check: Nancy Pelosi will not resign if Donald Trump is acquitted in impeachment trial", "Claims that Nevada voters were registered at commercial addresses and nonexistent\u00a0addresses\u00a0are false and again originate from\u00a0Binnall's testimony in the Trump campaign's\u00a0case.", "Binnall claimed\u00a0that experts purportedly found 15,000 votes cast from commercial or vacant addresses by analyzing U.S. Postal Service records that flag nonresidential addresses and addresses vacant for more than 90 days. The 8,000 voters with nonexistent addresses were allegedly found by cross referencing voters with the Coding Accuracy Support System.", "However, the court found no evidence to support claims that \"election officials counted ballots from voters who did not meet Nevada residency requirements.\"", "In his ruling, Russell further wrote that the Postal Service did not deliver mail-in ballots to \"addresses where the addressee of the ballot was known to be deceased, known to have moved from that address, or had no affiliation with that address at all.\"", "Fact check: Meme of fake email perpetuates conspiracy theory", "Binnall's claim\u00a0that almost 4,000 noncitizens voted\u00a0was purportedly found by comparing official DMV records of noncitizens to 2020 voter rolls.", "DMV spokesman Kevin Malone told the Nevada Independent that\u00a0it provided the Trump campaign with a list of the names and addresses of people who obtained a driver's license or driver authorization card using immigration paperwork within the last five years.", "However,\u00a0Malone said the list provided was not definitive proof of citizenship or noncitizenship because individuals could obtain citizenship and legally vote after obtaining a driver authorization card.", "Michael Kagan, director of the UNLV Immigration Clinic, also noted to the Nevada Independent that \"someone might have been a noncitizen three years ago when they got their driver's license, and they then got citizenship, voted legally, and haven't renewed their license with a new document yet.\u201d", "The Nevada Secretary of State\u2019s Office \"Facts vs. Myths\" page addresses this claim as well and states that it is a felony for noncitizens to register to vote or cast a ballot in Nevada and as of Dec. 18 the office has \"not been presented with evidence of noncitizens voting in the 2020 election.\"", "USA TODAY has also previously debunked claims that voter turnout from noncitizens affected the popular vote in the 2020 presidential race in battleground states.", "Fact check: Chatham County, Georgia, stopped counting votes when staff ran out of ballots", "Binnall's claim that\u00a0dead people voted in Nevada's presidential election has\u00a0been repeatedly debunked by election officials.", "The district court said this claim was unfounded\u00a0based on\u00a0Nevada Deputy Secretary of State for Elections Wayne Thorley\u2019s testimony on the process to \u201cmaintain voter rolls, including removing confirmed deceased voters.\"", "USA TODAY has debunked a similar\u00a0claim that thousands of ballots\u00a0were sent to dead people and pets\u00a0in Nevada.\u00a0Multiple experts and studies have also confirmed that mailing ballots to dead people is possible but extremely rare.
