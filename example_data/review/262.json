["About this rating", "On 7 February 1986, facing a domestic populist revolt and international pressure to step down, embattled President of Haiti Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier, fled his country for exile in France onboard a United States Air Force jet. A New York Times obituary from 4 October 2014 described his rule over Haiti as one of \u201cbloody brutality\u201d, widespread corruption, and lavish excess:", "When he fled Haiti, American officials said he held $200 million to $500 million in foreign bank accounts and had a reputation for giving family members million-dollar vacations at luxury resorts, as millions of Haitians lived in squalor and scrounged for food.", "Once he fled, a new government in Haiti attempted recover these assets, which they believed the Duvalier regime had looted from the government and people of Haiti. A 14 July 1986 story in New York Magazine first reported that one of the assets the government of Haiti was trying to seize was an apartment in Trump Tower purchased in August 1983 through a shell corporation:", "Investigators working for the new government of Haiti have uncovered what they believe is almost $5 million worth of New York real estate owned by interests linked to the family of deposed president Jean-Claude Duvalier.", "These assets consist of five Manhattan apartments, including a fifty-fourth-floor Trump Tower condominium bought in August 1983 for $1.65 million. This is the first reported instance of Duvalier assets being discovered in the United States.", "The apartment in question, 54K, was purchased by \u201cLasa Trade and Finance\" and \u2014 at the time of the 1986 article \u2014 was occupied by a friend of the Duvaliers named Jean \"Johnny\" Sambour.", "Serendipitously, thanks to a combination of late telephone bills and several checks issued to Sambour by the Treasury of Haiti, a United States law firm hired by the Government of Haiti was able to ascertain that, indeed, the apartment was owned by the Duvaliers.", "Recounting his experience hunting down the assets of the Duvaliers in a 2009 New Yorker profile, prolific corporate intelligence investigator Jules Kroll (who had been hired by the U.S. law firm retained by the Haitian government) said that Duvalier\u2019s looting from the Haitian treasury was far from subtle:", "Baby Doc, Kroll said, was \u201cnot the sharpest nail in the box.\u201d He had looted the Haitian treasury by writing big checks. \u201cApartment in Trump Tower?\u201d Kroll made a show of laborious penmanship. \u201c \u2018Trump . . . Tower.\u2019 Even we could figure that one out.\u201d", "In March 1987, President Ronald Reagan signed an executive order freezing any U.S.-based Duvalier assets, which included \u2014 according to the New York Times \u2014 Trump Tower apartment 54K.", "The tale of Duvalier\u2019s ownership of a Trump Tower apartment gained renewed interest in January 2018, thanks to a BuzzFeed News investigation of possible money laundering by the Trump Organization, combined with Trump\u2019s alleged derogatory comments about Haiti.", "That BuzzFeed report investigated every U.S. sale of a Trump Organization or Trump-branded property since 1980 to see how many fit the U.S. Government\u2019s criteria for possible money laundering, finding that a full 21 percent could fit that bill:", "Trump condo sales that match Treasury\u2019s characteristics of possible money laundering totaled $1.5 billion, BuzzFeed News calculated. They accounted for 21% of the 6,400 Trump condos sold in the US. Those figures include condos that Trump developed as well as condos that others developed in his name under licensing deals that pay Trump a fee or a percentage of sales. [...]", "The property records analyzed by BuzzFeed News would not by themselves reveal money laundering \u2013 only warning signs.", "That story does mention the Duvalier incident, reporting that Trump himself signed the deed of sale for Apartment 54K in 1983, but notes that there is no evidence that the Trump Organization, or Trump personally, participated in any untoward money laundering scheme in this case.", "However, as Donald Trump did sell an apartment in Trump Tower to Duvalier through a Panamanian shell corporation in 1983, we rank the claim as true.", "Moody, John. \u00a0 \"Haiti: Bad Times for Baby Doc.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Time. \u00a0 10 February 1986.", "Archibold, Randal C. \u00a0 \"Jean-Claude Duvalier Dies at 63; Ruled Haiti in Father\u2019s Brutal Fashion.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Times. \u00a0 4 October 2014.", "Dorfman, Dan. \u00a0 \"On The Trail of Baby Doc.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Magazine. \u00a0 14 July 1986.", "Margolick, David. \u00a0 \"Law Firm, in Pursuit of Haitian Property, Finds the Chase Can Be Tedious and Frustrating.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Times. \u00a0 27 October 1989.", "Finnegan, William. \u00a0 \"The Secret Keeper.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New Yorker. \u00a0 19 October 2009.", "Sciolino, Elaine. \u00a0 \"Reagan Orders Assets of the Duvaliers Frozen.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 20 March 1987.", "Frank, Thomas. \u00a0 \"Secret Money: How Trump Made Millions Selling Condos To Unknown Buyers.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 BuzzFeed News. \u00a0 12 January 2018.", "Dawsey, Josh. \u00a0 \"Trump Derides Protections for Immigrants From \u2018Shithole\u2019 Countries.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Washington Post. \u00a0 12 January 2018.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
