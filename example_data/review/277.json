That estimate was based on COVID-19 deaths so far, data on hospital capacity and use and more detailed coronavirus hospitalization data available in some localities.", "The institute estimates the pandemic would peak nationally around mid-April and result in more than 80,000 deaths, a summary of the study said.", "The state-by-state projections were based on a statistical model \u2014 essentially a detailed formula that projects the future virus spread based on death rates and other data available to this point.", "And those projections moved a lot after the initial release.", "Four days after the original publication, on March 30, 2020, researchers added 1,730 nationwide deaths to the model and tweaked the methodology.
