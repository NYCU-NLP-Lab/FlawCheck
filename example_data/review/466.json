["With Republicans Charlie Crist and Marco Rubio dominating news coverage about Florida's U.S. Senate race, Democratic U.S. Rep.

Charlie Crist and former state House Speaker Marco Rubio that it's important to remember that either candidate still has to win a general election. Crist \u2014 back when Crist was seen as inevitable \u2014 was regularly leading likely Democratic nominee Rep. Kendrick Meek in the polls.
