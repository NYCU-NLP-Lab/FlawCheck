["By Lori Robertson and Robert Farley", "Posted on September 14, 2020 | Updated on September 14, 2020", "In campaign rallies in Nevada, President Donald Trump twisted remarks made by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and gave a disputed description of comments by Biden\u2019s former chief of staff.", "Trump made his claims in campaign rallies in Nevada on Sept. 12 and 13.", "Trump distorted Biden\u2019s quote on law enforcement. The former vice president\u2019s full comments show he was talking about the perception of law enforcement in a community if police show up in military armored vehicles.", "Here are Biden\u2019s comments in a July 8 interview with activist Ady Barkan. Biden rattled off several policing initiatives he supported and actions taken by the Obama administration when Biden was vice president, and he said:", "Biden, July 8: Surplus military equipment for law enforcement: they don\u2019t need that. The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood; it\u2019s like the military invading. They don\u2019t know anybody; they become the enemy. They\u2019re supposed to be protecting these people.", "In 2015, the Obama administration adopted the recommendations of a working group to limit surplus military equipment and supplies that are provided for free to state and local law enforcement agencies under what\u2019s called the\u00a01033 program. Items under a \u201cprohibited equipment list\u201d \u2014 which included tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft, grenade launchers, bayonets and firearms/ammunition of .50 caliber and above \u2014 could no longer be obtained by local law enforcement.", "Items on a \u201ccontrolled equipment list\u201d \u2014 including wheeled armored vehicles, riot shields and helmets, and explosives \u2014 could still be obtained, if police departments provided justification for them and proper training. Other items weren\u2019t on any list and faced no new restrictions.", "In 2017, one of the authors of a study on military aid to police told us the vast majority of the military equipment provided to police departments wasn\u2019t affected by the Obama administration\u2019s limits.", "On Aug. 28, 2017, Trump\u00a0issued an executive order\u00a0rescinding those limits.", "Now, Trump is distorting Biden\u2019s remarks on this issue, claiming in a Sept. 12 campaign rally in Minden, Nevada: \u201cBiden called law enforcement the enemy.\u201d", "The next day, at a rally in Henderson, Nevada, Trump repeated the claim, saying: \u201cHe even called law enforcement the enemy recently. You saw that? The enemy, until his polls started dropping. Then all of a sudden, he said, \u2018No, we love law enforcement.\u2019\u201d", "On Twitter a day after Biden\u2019s July interview, Vice President Mike Pence and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany similarly took Biden\u2019s words out of context. McEnany claimed that Biden \u201csays police have \u2018become the ENEMY.'\u201d", "But it\u2019s clear from Biden\u2019s full remarks that he was talking about communities perceiving police who arrive in \u201can up-armored Humvee\u201d as the enemy. It wasn\u2019t a comment about police generally.", "Update, Sept. 14: Biden campaign spokesperson Rosemary Boeglin told us in a statement: \u201cFor years,\u00a0Biden has opposed providing police with equipment that only belongs in war zones \u2014 and was remarking that doing so can create and\u00a0deepen divides between communities and the officers who serve them. That\u2019s why Biden has long advocated for community policing strategies that strengthen relationships and foster trust.\u201d", "Biden\u2019s former chief of staff, Ron Klain, said Trump is taking out of context comments he made in 2019 that the Obama administration \u201cdid every possible thing wrong\u201d during the 2009 H1N1 \u201cswine flu\u201d outbreak. Klain told us he was talking specifically about delays in the rollout of the vaccine, not the overall administration response.", "During his Sept. 12\u00a0Nevada rally, Trump cited the Klain quote as evidence that Biden \u201cwas a complete disaster on the swine flu,\u201d which the CDC estimates killed more than 12,000 people in the U.S.", "Trump, Sept. 12: When Biden was vice president, he was a complete disaster on the swine flu, which was a much easier thing to handle. Joe Biden\u2019s own chief of staff said that when Biden managed swine flu in 2009, they quote, \u201cDid every possible thing wrong.\u201d This is the guy that worked for him in charge of the swine flu. And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in a period of time. \u2026 He said it was just, we were lucky. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s just lucky that there weren\u2019t great mass casualties.\u201d Different kind of a disease, a little bit. And what he said is amazing. He said we did nothing right.", "Trump is referring to Klain\u2019s comments at a May 14, 2019,\u00a0Pandemic and Biosecurity Policy Summit. When the H1N1 \u201cswine flu\u201d pandemic hit the U.S. in 2009, Klain was serving as the vice president\u2019s chief of staff. He said he was not directly involved in the H1N1 response, but had a good view of it as a White House staffer.", "May 14, 2019: What I will say about it is a bunch of really talented, really great people working on it and we did every possible thing wrong. And it\u2019s, you know, 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time, and it\u2019s just purely a fortuity that this isn\u2019t one of the great mass-casualty events in American history. [It] had nothing to do with us doing anything right; just had to do with luck. And so, if anyone thinks that this can\u2019t happen again, they don\u2019t have to go back to 1918. They just have go back to 2009, 2010. Imagine a virus with a different lethality, and you can just do the math on that.", "Klain, a Biden campaign adviser, told us via email that Trump is continuing \u201cto selective quote and take my words out of context.\u201d", "\u201cI was talking about the vaccine, not the overall approach,\u201d Klain said. \u201cThe vaccine got delayed. The administration got testing up and going well, and a general public health response going well.\u201d", "Dissemination of a vaccine for the H1N1 virus\u00a0was\u00a0slowed in the fall of 2009 due to manufacturing delays,\u00a0CNN reported\u00a0at the time, and the vaccine was not available when it would have been most effective. According to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while a vaccine was produced, \u201cit was not available in large quantities until late November\u2014after the peak of illness during the second wave had come and gone in the United States.\u201d", "Klain\u2019s comments following his assessment that \u201cwe did every possible thing wrong\u201d focused solely on the rollout of vaccines.", "\u201cWhat did that [the experience in 2009] tell us? It told us that the vaccine will arrive late,\u201d Klain said at the pandemic policy summit. \u201cIt told us that if it\u2019s not prepared in advance, it will arrive late. We don\u2019t have the answer before, we\u2019re not going to get the answer in time. And it told us that our systems for deciding how to distribute and administer a vaccine at a time of crisis are going to be badly, badly tested.\u201d", "\u201cIt also told us one other thing,\u201d Klain said,\u201d that we really lack a global policy mechanism for dealing with these untested vaccines in an emergency situation.\u201d", "In worldwide distribution, he said, who would be liable if people got sick from the vaccine, and who would own intellectual property for the results from a vaccine?", "\u201cThe vaccine didn\u2019t arrive for us in time,\u201d Klain said. \u201cIt got in time to Europe, and then there\u2019s a big controversy over whether or not it could be administered. What was the regulatory approvals, so on and so forth? I mean, this has been a life or death situation. \u2026 The absence of policy would have killed people. \u2026 One thing we know for sure is, if we have to deal with it in the moment, it\u2019s going to be very bad.\u201d", "Those comments \u2013 which immediately followed the quotes cited by Trump and focused on rollout of a vaccine \u2014 lend credence to Klain saying his comments that \u201cwe did every possible thing wrong\u201d were about the vaccine.", "In an May article in\u00a0Politico, Klain said his comments were only about difficulties in manufacturing enough of a vaccine to match demand. \u201cThe Obama team, he says, quickly adapted to the situation, making choices that were starkly different from those the Trump administration would make 11 years later, such as quickly distributing emergency equipment from the federal stockpile, deferring to public health experts and having them take the lead on messaging,\u201d Politico reported.", "Klain has been extremely critical of Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
