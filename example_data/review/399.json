["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Top California Democrats like State Senate\u00a0leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n often claim that the state\u2019s economy is humming right along \u2014 and not weighed down by their ambitious new clean energy requirements.", "Critics, particularly the oil industry, consider the state\u2019s clean energy push detrimental to California\u2019s economy and job outlook.", "So, it\u2019s not a surprise that De Le\u00f3n, author of the state\u2019s most recent clean energy law, touted California\u2019s strong job growth during a recent speech abroad about climate change. De Le\u00f3n, D-Los Angeles, spoke about California\u2019s role as a leader in the fight against climate change to members of Parliament in the United Kingdom.", "He told them California has \"robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation, all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe,\" according to a November press release from the senator\u2019s office.", "California\u2019s employment picture has certainly improved from the Great Recession, when it lost more than a million jobs from 2007 to 2009. Economists credit a rebound in housing and construction jobs plus strong tech sector growth for the state\u2019s healthier employment figures.", "But, we wondered, is the state seeing job growth that truly \"outpaces the rest of the nation,\" as the senator claimed? Or did his statement exaggerate the state\u2019s good job news?", "We set out on a fact check limited to this question. We did not evaluate the additional question of how the state\u2019s clean energy rules have affected California\u2019s job growth.", "Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio", "Our research", "Economists we spoke with said De Le\u00f3n\u2019s statement, on its face, is correct.", "They said they took his statement to mean California\u2019s job growth rate was higher than the country\u2019s overall job growth rate. And it is.", "In 2014, California added jobs at a 3 percent clip compared with the previous year. That was more than a percentage point higher than the country\u2019s overall rate of 1.9 percent during the same period, according to data from Chapman University\u2019s Center for Economic Research.", "\"Overall, the statement is accurate,\" said Professor Esmael Adibi, the center\u2019s director. \"We are outperforming the U.S.\"", "And that\u2019s not a new trend, said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Point Loma Nazarene University.", "\"The state has actually outperformed the country as a whole for 44 consecutive months, which amounts to almost four years,\" Reaser said.", "Still, there\u2019s more to the nation\u2019s job picture. Fourteen other states in 2014 had a higher job growth rate than the country overall, according to data provided by the economists. California\u2019s accomplishment was hardly unique.", "Another interpretation of De Le\u00f3n\u2019s claim is that California\u2019s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states in \"the rest of the nation.\"", "Asked to clarify the senator\u2019s statement, De Le\u00f3n\u2019s office pointed to recent news articles that describe California adding more total jobs than any other state, and adding jobs at a faster pace than the nation overall.", "Still, the phrase \"rest of the nation\" is open to different readings, Abibi said.", "\"Is he talking about the U.S. as a whole or is he talking about Texas or North Dakota or Michigan?\" the professor asked.", "That\u2019s significant because five other states had a faster job growth rate than California\u2019s 3 percent last year. They were North Dakota at 3.8 percent; Nevada at 3.5 percent; Colorado at 3.3 percent; Florida at 3.2 percent and Texas with 3.1 percent, according to state and federal data.", "Senator Kevin\u00a0De Le\u00f3n addresses\u00a0members of the U.K. Parliament\u00a0in London.

Last year, the state\u2019s job growth rate was more than a percentage point higher than the country\u2019s.", "But a clarification is needed: California is far from the only state that\u2019s added jobs at a faster pace than the national average. Fourteen others accomplished the same feat.", "And there is another way to read the senator\u2019s statement. One could assume the senator meant California\u2019s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states. Yet, five other states had higher job growth rates in 2014. Those states are part of \"the rest of the nation,\" and would likely balk at the idea of California outpacing their job growth success.", "In the end, we rate the claim Mostly True.", "MOSTLY TRUE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.", "Click here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "Phone interview with Lynn Reaser, chief economist, Point Loma Nazarene University, Nov.\u00a030, 2015", "Phone interview with\u00a0Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman University\u2019s Center for Economic Research, Nov.\u00a030, 2015", "Los Angeles Times, \"California posts solid jobs growth; unemployment rate falls to 6.1%,\"\u00a0Sept.\u00a018, 2015", "Southern California Public Radio, \"What slowdown?
