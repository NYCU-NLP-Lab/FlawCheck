Today almost 100% are non-South African.\u201d", "The claim resurfaced in October 2020 when the Economic Freedom Fighters, South Africa\u2019s second-largest opposition party, called on businesses to ensure that at least 60% of their staff were South African citizens.", "Is there any evidence for Mboweni\u2019s claim?
