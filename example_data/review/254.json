Kamala Harris said, \u201cI like taking the guns early.\u201d She didn\u2019t say that, but President Donald Trump did.", "Dozens of conservative Facebook pages have been sharing a picture of Sen. Kamala Harris with a quote that says, in part, \u201cI like taking the guns early.\u201d", "But the quote isn\u2019t from Harris, who is the Democratic nominee for vice president. It\u2019s from President Donald Trump.", "Trump said it during a Feb. 28, 2018 meeting on gun violence, two weeks after 17 people were shot dead at a high school in Parkland, Florida.", "Vice President Mike Pence, seated across from Trump in the televised White House meeting, had explained one legislative option states can use for disarming potentially dangerous shooters. If family members or law enforcement officers are concerned that someone is a risk to himself or others, they can go to court and get an order \u2014 sometimes called risk protection orders or gun violence restraining orders \u2014 to confiscate that person\u2019s weapons, Pence said.", "Trump responded, saying: \u201cOr, Mike, take the firearms first and then go to court. Because that\u2019s another system, because a lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court, to get the due process procedures. I like taking the guns early. Like in this crazy man\u2019s case that just took place in Florida, he had a lot of firearms \u2014 they saw everything \u2014 to go to court would have taken a long time, so you could do exactly what you\u2019re saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second.\u201d", "The parts of that quote in bold are what appear in the Harris meme. Similar text has also appeared with a picture of Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a frequent target of false memes.", "When Harris was the attorney general in California, she supported the creation of a gun violence restraining order law of the sort that Pence described. But we could find no record of her making the suggestion that due process should be ignored.", "As we said, though, Trump has made that suggestion. The video showing his remarks is below:", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
