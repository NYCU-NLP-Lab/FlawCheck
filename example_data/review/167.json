(USA Today)", "Shortly after Donald Trump was elected president and again after his inauguration, it was reported that the 115th Congress, which was seated in January 2017, is the most racially diverse in history.", "So we wondered if U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan was correct when he painted a different picture in Metro Weekly, a Washington, D.C. publication that serves the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning) community.", "Asked in the April 7, 2017 article whether \"underrepresented groups, either minorities or women or LGBTQ people,\" will get more politically active, Pocan said he hoped so.", "The Wisconsin Democrat also recited a quote he attributed to the late Ann Richards, a Democrat who was the governor of Texas before George W. Bush: \"If you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re likely on the menu.\" And then he said:", "When you look at the floor of Congress, it\u2019s especially telling. On the Democratic side of the room, you\u2019ve got men and women of all different races. On the other side, you\u2019ve got a bunch of white men in dark suits, all over 55 or so. It\u2019s such a contrast. That\u2019s not representative of the country. We really need to get people making sure that everyone has a voice.", "What we found is Pocan is largely on target, in that Democrats are more diverse, although there are more than older white men among Republicans.", "Gender diversity", "We\u2019ll tackle Pocan\u2019s claim in three parts. We base our analysis primarily on a March 2017 report on the current makeup of the House and Senate by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which provides policy and legal analysis for Congress. Taking into account vacancies and independents, it lists 289 Republicans and 239 Democrats among the 535 voting members of the two chambers.", "The first part of Pocan\u2019s claim is about women. The report shows that Democrats, even though they are outnumbered by Republicans, have three times more women in the two chambers.", "Democratic women", "Republican women", "78", "26", "Racial diversity", "The contrast is even greater for racial diversity.

Its data shows that two-thirds of the Republican members of Congress (compared to about 40 percent of Democrats) are white males age 50 and over.", "Two parting notes from analyses done by the nonprofit Pew Research Center, which show women and minorities making gains in Congress as a whole:", "Gender: The share of women in Congress has reached an all-time high: Women now hold 104 seats, or 19 percent.", "Race: Congress remains disproportionately white when compared with the U.S. population, but is becoming more representative: Minorities account for 20 of 59 (34 percent) of the new members elected in November 2016.", "Our rating", "Pocan said: In Congress, \"on the Democratic side of the room, you\u2019ve got men and women of all different races; on the other side, you\u2019ve got a bunch of white men in dark suits, all over 55 or so.\"", "Democrats have several times more women and several times more minorities than Republicans do in the House and Senate combined.
