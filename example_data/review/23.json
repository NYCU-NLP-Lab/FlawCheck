["By Eugene Kiely and Robert Farley", "Posted on October 3, 2016", "Donald Trump\u2019s top surrogates took to the Sunday talk shows to put the best spin on a New York Times story about the GOP presidential nominee reporting a loss of $916 million on his personal income taxes in 1995. The large loss, the Times reported, could have allowed Trump to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years.", "But in defending Trump, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani made some false and misleading statements:", "The New York Times on Oct. 1 published a story that said it had obtained three pages of personal income tax returns that Trump had filed in 1995 with New Jersey, Connecticut and New York. The tax attorney who prepared and signed the tax returns for Trump verified the documents as \u201clegit.\u201d", "The documents show that Trump reported a net operating loss of $916 million in 1995, which the Times said \u201ccould have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years.\u201d That\u2019s because net operating losses under IRS rules \u201ccould be used to wipe out taxable income earned in the three years before and the 15 years after the loss,\u201d the paper reported.", "The Trump campaign has neither confirmed nor denied that Trump reported a $916 million loss in 1995, saying in a statement that he\u00a0\u201chas a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required.\u201d", "Giuliani went further on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d and on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d to claim that Trump could be sued for violating his fiduciary responsibility to investors.", "Giuliani on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Oct. 2:\u00a0If Donald Trump hadn\u2019t taken those losses, he could have been sued by his investors. He could have been sued by his business partners. When I run a business, and I run a business, if I don\u2019t take advantage of the five deductions that are available to me, even if you think those deductions are unfair, then I\u2019ve violated my fiduciary duty. So I have clients, and I have clients that take losses like that, and I advise them, \u201cYou have to take those losses. Otherwise, you\u2019re not doing your job.\u201d", "Giuliani on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Oct. 2: If he didn\u2019t take advantage of those tax deductions or tax advantages that he had, he could be sued, because he \u2014 his obligation, as a businessman, is to make money for his enterprise and to save money for his enterprise. It would have been insane for him not to take advantage of them. \u2026 the reality is, you are ignoring completely the fiduciary obligation that he has to all the people around him to run his business at the lowest possible expense.", "We wondered if Giuliani is right that Trump could be sued by his investors for\u00a0violating his \u201cfiduciary obligation\u201d to his company, so we contacted some experts to find out.", "Trump pays personal income taxes on his investment gains and losses because, as the Times story noted, he has set up partnerships, limited liability companies and other pass-through entities to conduct his business.", "Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, told us that \u201cstandard operating agreements require partners to pay their taxes, because the bankruptcy or legal liabilities facing one partner can impact the others.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthe agreements typically don\u2019t require\u201d each partner to make maximum use of tax benefits.", "Trump can be sued if he did not have the liquidity to meet the terms of the financial agreement with his investors because he paid too much in personal income taxes, Smetters said. But \u201ctechnically, a partner can\u2019t be sued as a fiduciary for paying too many taxes at the personal level, unless the operating agreement contained very non-standard language.\u201d", "Leonard Burman,\u00a0director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, was more direct:\u00a0\u201cTrump\u2019s investors have no stake at all in what he reports on his personal income tax return. The fiduciary responsibility argument is specious.\u201d", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8e006388-66e3-45b0-aca0-5d63d713aee1", "On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Christie made the point twice that Trump would change the law to fix the kind of situation highlighted by the New York Times.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no one who\u2019s shown more genius in their way to maneuver about the tax code as he rightfully used the laws to do that,\u201d Christie said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s already promised in his tax plan to change many of these special interest loopholes and get rid of them so you don\u2019t have this kind of situation.\u201d", "Later in the show, Christie said, \u201cAnd the genius that Donald Trump has been, to make sure he follows the law, which is exactly what he\u2019s done, and politically he has said that he\u2019s going to change these laws and that there\u2019s no one who\u2019s better suited to change these laws than someone like him who\u2019s been subjected to audit by the IRS year after year after year.\u201d", "In response to the New York Times story, Trump tweeted, \u201cI know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them.\u201d", "But the issue raised by the Times article \u2014 the possibility that Trump sustained a net operating loss in 1995 and could have carried over that loss for up to\u00a018 years \u2014 is not addressed at all in Trump\u2019s tax plan.", "\u201cNothing in Trump\u2019s plan would limit the tax breaks he takes advantage of,\u201d said Burman, of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, \u201cand he\u2019d also eliminate the estate tax, which is the backstop to the income tax, rationalized in part as a way to tax otherwise untaxed income. Clinton would increase the estate tax on people like Trump.\u201d", "At the heart of the issue raised by the New York Times is net operating loss reported by Trump in his 1995 personal tax returns.", "\u201cThe idea of carrying forward a Net Operating Loss is pretty simple,\u201d said Alan Cole, an economist with the Center for Federal Tax Policy at the Tax Foundation. \u201cIf you lose $50 in December but make $100 in January, pretty much everyone agrees that you made $50 in total. Carrying losses forward allows you to match your losses against income to get that result, even if the income and the losses initially fall in different reporting periods.\u201d", "Although both Christie and Giuliani referred to Trump\u2019s \u201cgenius\u201d in taking advantage of the tax code, Cole told us there\u2019s really not much genius in taking advantage of net operating loss. In fact, he said, it is pretty common.", "\u201cI\u2019d advise caution on the narrative about Net Operating Loss being an obscure, super-complicated strategy that only a handful of genius businessmen understand,\u201d Cole told us via email. \u201cTalk to any tax professional in law or accounting, and they\u2019ll tell you that Net Operating Loss is an ordinary thing that everyone knows about. What\u2019s unique about Trump\u2019s Net Operating Loss is its sheer size. Probably only a handful of people ever have had such a large loss. Over a million people do this every year. It\u2019s not a work of artistic genius.\u201d", "The law is simply intended to allow businesses to smooth out their operating losses over the years, said Andy Grewal, a professor of law at Iowa University and an expert in tax administration.", "Neither Trump nor Clinton has proposed any policy to amend the laws regarding net operating losses, he said. And he doesn\u2019t think they should.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem that needs fixing,\u201d Grewal said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a giveaway, like, say, the mortgage interest deduction.\u201d", "The law simply allows people to use losses to offset gains. If someone wanted to do away with that practice, Grewal said, \u201cyou would have destroyed the whole tax system.\u201d", "While neither candidate is proposing changes to the rules regarding net operating losses, Clinton has proposed limiting tax benefits of \u201clike-kind exchanges\u201d that are used to shield real-estate investments from capital gains taxes.", "\u201cOrdinarily, rising (real estate) value shows up as capital gains, which is taxable in principle\u2014albeit at much lower rates [than] other income,\u201d wrote Steven M. Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center in a blog post titled \u201cDoes Donald Trump pay taxes, ever?\u201d \u201cHowever, real estate investors often use special like-kind exchange rules to defer taxes. These rules apply to real estate, but not stocks or bonds. If a real estate investor exchanges property long enough, and dies, the gains are never taxed.\u201d", "But that change proposed by Clinton wouldn\u2019t affect the issue of net operating losses highlighted in the Times article.", "\u201cClinton\u2019s proposal wouldn\u2019t have stopped Trump\u2019s NOL (net operating losses), but would limit his ability to continually roll over untaxed gains,\u201d Burman explained.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0ee64113-d2cb-49e2-ab92-dac3b5ecf163", "On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Christie described the Times story as a \u201cvery, very good story for Donald Trump,\u201d because it shows how he fought back from business failures to \u201cbuild another fortune.\u201d But then Christie went on to say \u2014 falsely as it turned out \u2014 that the newspaper had no information \u201cthat says Mr. Trump did not pay taxes.\u201d", "Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace, Oct. 2:\u00a0Wait. You\u2019re saying it\u2019s a good story for Donald Trump that he failed to pay any federal income taxes \u2014 first of all, that he took a billion-dollar loss, and that he failed to pay any federal income taxes for years. That\u2019s a good story?", "Christie: Chris, first of all, you don\u2019t know he didn\u2019t pay federal income taxes for years. All the story said was that kind of loss can be used for up to 18 years. But if Mr. Trump made $600 million the next year, $600 million, that loss would be wiped out.", "So, let\u2019s be precise about what it said. The New York Times does not have any information in that story that says Mr. Trump did not pay taxes. All they did was quote the law which says if you have that kind of loss, you can use that kind of loss to offset income for up to 18 years.", "Christie is right that the story said that Trump could have used the $916 million in reported losses in 1995 to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years. But he is wrong to say, \u201cThe New York Times does not have any information in that story that says Mr. Trump did not pay taxes.\u201d", "Actually, the story indicates that Trump at the very least did not pay any federal income taxes in 1995, and it quoted Jack Mitnick, Trump\u2019s longtime tax attorney, as saying his client paid no taxes. Mitnick handled Trump\u2019s tax affairs for more than three decades, until 1996, and he\u00a0prepared and signed Trump\u2019s 1995 New Jersey income tax returns.", "\u201cHere the guy was building incredible net worth and not paying tax on it,\u201d Mitnick told the Times.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7f3203f9-3cd2-4dbf-84ba-24e1414e64a0", "Giuliani also got his facts wrong when he criticized the Times. On CNN, Giuliani\u00a0claimed\u00a0the paper did not say until \u201cabout 26 paragraphs\u201d into its story that what Trump did was perfectly legal.", "Giuliani, Oct. 2:\u00a0First of all, what you failed to leave out of what you said \u2014 and it\u2019s not your fault \u2014 it\u2019s the New York Times\u2018 fault \u2014 is that this is perfectly legal. And the Times makes that point about 26 paragraphs into the opinion.", "In fact, the Times said in its lead paragraph \u2014 known in journalism jargon as \u201cthe lede\u201d \u2014 that what Trump did was legal.", "New York Times, Oct. 1:\u00a0Donald J. Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns, a tax deduction so substantial it could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years, records obtained by The New York Times show.", "In the third paragraph, the Times supported its lede by citing tax experts as saying \u201ctax rules especially advantageous to wealthy filers would have allowed Mr. Trump to use his $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income over an 18-year period.\u201d", "Now, it is true that the Times\u00a0did not say until later in the story \u2014 paragraph 13 \u2014 that \u201cnothing in the 1995 documents suggested any wrongdoing by Mr. Trump.\u201d But it had already said in the first and third paragraphs that it would have been \u201cperfectly legal,\u201d to borrow Giuliani\u2019s term, for Trump not to pay federal income taxes for up to 18 years.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/25e70833-4dc8-4bc4-8a6e-e23ba560821f", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
