["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on October 31, 2019", "Social media posts distort the facts around an 11-year-old, dismissed DUI charge against Rep. Matt Gaetz. They also\u00a0leave the false impression that he \u201cstole from dying people.\u201d", "Posts about Rep. Matt Gaetz circulating on social media in recent days bend the facts to argue that the Florida Republican is part of the so-called \u201cswamp.\u201d", "\u201cRepublican Matt Gaetz has had numerous DUIs and his dad got him off each time,\u201d read the Facebook posts, accompanied by a mugshot of Gaetz. \u201cHe was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud. They stole from dying people. He is the swamp.\u201d", "Like many claims that gain traction on social media, the posts have some factual basis but are muddied by misrepresentation, exaggeration and speculation. We\u2019ll start with the first part.", "Court records and press reports show that Gaetz was arrested once, in 2008, on charges that he was driving while intoxicated \u2014 but the case was later dismissed, the Okaloosa County court docket shows. In other words, he was never convicted.", "The posts offer no evidence that Gaetz has \u201chad numerous DUIs,\u201d or that his father, Don, a Florida state senator from 2006 to 2016, \u201cgot him off each time.\u201d", "Here\u2019s what we know about the 2008 case: Gaetz, 26 at the time, was arrested in October 2008 while driving home from a nightclub \u2014 ironically, called the Swamp \u2014 on Florida\u2019s Okaloosa Island, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In reviewing the matter in 2014, the newspaper wrote:", "Tampa Bay Times, Feb. 18, 2014: Near midnight, Okaloosa County Deputy Chris Anglin clocked Gaetz going 48 in a 35 mph zone. Anglin later reported that Gaetz fumbled for his license and registration, his eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he swayed and staggered when he got out of the car.", "Smelling alcohol, Anglin asked Gaetz if he had been drinking. Gaetz replied no. Minutes later, he admitted he had consumed two beers. Twice, Anglin conducted an eye test. Twice, Gaetz\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t follow the prompt.", "Gaetz, who had recently begun practicing law, declined any field sobriety tests. He was arrested and refused the breath test.", "Weeks after the arrest, Anglin, the officer who arrested Gaetz, reportedly resigned amid several alleged infractions, including that he used excessive force against another DUI suspect soon after Gaetz\u2019s arrest.", "After Anglin quit, \u201cthe prosecutor asked to be taken off the case, because his stepson was friends with Gaetz. Then-Gov. Charlie Crist\u2019s office assigned the case to Steve Meadows, the state attorney for the neighboring circuit,\u201d according to the Tampa Bay Times.", "Gaetz\u2019s defense attorney, Drew Pinkerton, filed a motion to dismiss the case that December. According to a report at the time from the Northwest Florida Daily News, the defense claimed that Gaetz had answered \u201cno\u201d to the officer\u2019s question about whether he had too much to drink \u2014 not to whether he had anything to drink. Gaetz also claimed in an interview with that newspaper that he was not swerving and that the officer had said threatening things to him.", "The 2014 Tampa Bay Times report continued:", "Tampa Bay Times, Feb. 18, 2014: Less than a week later, Gaetz had his driver\u2019s license reinstated. A field officer for the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles declared there was no evidence that Gaetz refused a breath test. Yet the refusal was clearly documented in Anglin\u2019s affidavit and arrest report.", "It even was documented in Pinkerton\u2019s Dec. 18 motion to dismiss charges against Gaetz.", "This three-page document, which Gaetz signed, states there was no evidence that he had been impaired. There was no mention of many of Anglin\u2019s observations suggesting that Gaetz was impaired.", "It added a new detail: \u201cA civilian witness drove by who knew (Gaetz) and observed no indication of impairment.\u201d", "Yet the witness was not named, either in Pinkerton\u2019s document or other case records at the Okaloosa County Clerk\u2019s Office. Still, this anonymous testimony is all that contradicted Anglin\u2019s conclusion that there was probable cause to arrest Gaetz on DUI.", "Meadows accepted Pinkerton\u2019s motion and agreed to drop the case on Dec. 22, 2008.", "So, in short, we know that after the arresting officer quit amid internal allegations of improprieties and after the initial prosecutor transferred the case to avoid a conflict of interest, the new prosecutor dropped the case. There has been no evidence put forward to substantiate the claim that Gaetz\u2019s \u201cdad got him off.\u201d", "And while we found numerous traffic violations, such as speeding tickets, against Gaetz in Okaloosa County, we did not find any other cases in which Gaetz was charged with a DUI to support the contention that he has had \u201cnumerous DUIs.\u201d", "A spokesperson for Gaetz told FactCheck.org that it was \u201ccategorically false\u201d to say the congressman had \u201cmultiple\u201d DUI arrests, adding that Gaetz had \u201cnever been convicted of a DUI.\u201d", "Gaetz has acknowledged the arrest in public before: In 2014, while chairing a criminal justice subcommittee in the Florida House of Representatives, he talked about his booking photo\u2019s presence online.", "\u201cIf anyone Googles my name, the first image that will appear is my mugshot from my arrest,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m of the view that that is part of who I am. I made bad decisions and [that] resulted in arrest and that is sort of something that we all live with.\u201d", "Following the unsubstantiated claim of \u201cnumerous DUIs,\u201d the social media posts continue: \u201cHe was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud. They stole from dying people.\u201d As the post is structured, readers may interpret \u201che\u201d to reference Gaetz. In reality, the claim relates to a company his father founded and later sold.", "In 2017, Chemed Corporation and \u201cvarious wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Vitas Hospice Services LLC and Vitas Healthcare Corporation\u201d agreed to pay $75 million to settle federal charges that the companies submitted false claims for hospice services to Medicare, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.", "Vitas \u2014 which the Justice Department identified as \u201cthe largest for-profit hospice chain\u201d in the U.S. \u2014 was co-founded by Don Gaetz. Rep. Matt Gaetz\u2019s spokesperson said the congressman was never employed by Vitas.", "Federal prosecutors claimed that \u201cbetween 2002 and 2013 Vitas knowingly submitted or caused to be submitted false claims to Medicare for services to hospice patients who were not terminally ill.\u201d (Although the posts say \u201cthey stole from dying people,\u201d the company was accused of defrauding Medicare.)", "The lawsuit against the company was filed in 2013 \u2014 nine years after Don Gaetz sold the company to Chemed in 2004. It\u2019s true that at least some of the instances were alleged to have occurred before that sale date (dating back to 2002), but it\u2019s worth noting that Don Gaetz was not a party to the lawsuit. At the time of the lawsuit\u2019s filing, he denied that the matters in the complaint related to his work with Vitas.", "The elder Gaetz told the Northwest Florida Daily News that he was active in management until 2000. \u201cI told my partners I was interested in becoming superintendent of schools, and when I got elected I said I was stepping back,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave up all management responsibilities in 2000, though I continued as a shareholder and attended about four board meetings a year.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
