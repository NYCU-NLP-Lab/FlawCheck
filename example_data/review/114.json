["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on January 21, 2020", "Social media posts make a broad and misleading claim that \u201cDemocrats stood with\u201d the leaders of Venezuela, China and Iran rather than supporting oppressed people in those countries. The facts don\u2019t support that generalization.", "Dubious viral posts on Facebook accuse Democrats of supporting repressive regimes around the world and argue that President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has \u201cstood with\u201d the people of those countries.", "The claim, first spread by a pro-Trump Twitter user, feeds into and expands upon the erroneous narrative spread in recent weeks that Democrats have \u201cmourned\u201d the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike on Jan. 2.", "\u201cTrump stood with the people of Venezuela. Democrats stood with Maduro. Trump stood with the protesters in Hong Kong. Democrats stood with Communist China. Trump stands with the people of Iran. Democrats stand with Soleimani and the Ayatollahs,\u201d the posts read. \u201cNotice the pattern yet?\u201d", "But that broad assertion doesn\u2019t hold up after a review of public statements and legislative actions by Democrats on the national stage. We\u2019ll go through each component of the claim here.", "Venezuela and Maduro", "Early last year, Trump said the U.S. would officially recognize Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly president, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as the country\u2019s interim president \u2014 rather than Venezuela\u2019s president since 2013, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was widely considered illegitimate by other countries, including the U.S. Venezuela has endured a collapsing economy and human rights groups have said medicine and food shortages constitute a \u201chumanitarian emergency.\u201d", "Efforts by opposition forces, with U.S. support, to oust Maduro in 2019 were ultimately unsuccessful.", "But it\u2019s baseless to say that \u201cDemocrats\u201d \u2014 which implies most, if not all \u2014 \u201cstood with Maduro.\u201d", "Democratic leaders in Congress \u2014 including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2014 issued statements supporting the recognition of Guaid\u00f3 as interim president and rebuking Maduro.", "\u201cThe United States must respect legitimate democratic processes, and support the right of the people of Venezuela to protest and defend their human rights,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cNicolas Maduro\u2019s regime of repression and impoverishment for his personal enrichment continues to gravely violate human rights, and must be condemned swiftly by the full international community.\u201d", "A handful of Democrats in Congress did express opposition to a U.S.-forced regime change in Venezuela, and instead endorsed peace negotiations facilitated by other countries and the Vatican. But even one of those lawmakers, Rep. Ilhan Omar, wrote that \u201cNo one is defending Maduro.\u201d She later said, \u201cOpposition to intervention \u2260 support for a country\u2019s leader.\u201d", "In February, Democrats in Florida criticized presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders for not explicitly calling Maduro a dictator and recognizing Guaid\u00f3. But when the Council on Foreign Relations surveyed 18 Democrats running for president last year on the issue of Venezuela, including Sanders, none offered statements of support for Maduro.", "Instead, almost all explicitly condemned Maduro, supported Guaid\u00f3, or did both.", "Former Vice President Joe Biden called Maduro \u201ca tyrant, who has stolen elections, abused his authority, allowed his cronies to enrich themselves, and denied the delivery of food and medicine to the people he claims to lead.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Maduro is \u201ca dictator and a crook who has wrecked his country\u2019s economy, dismantled its democratic institutions, and profited while his people suffer.\u201d", "Many of the candidates called for the U.S. to assist Venezuelans, who were fleeing the country by the millions. And some of the candidates expressed reluctance for the U.S. to become entangled in regime change.", "The few who were less explicit in their criticism of Maduro largely cautioned the U.S. to not become involved militarily, or engage in tactics that could potentially be harmful to Venezuelans.", "Sanders, for example, said his \u201cadministration would support the negotiations between the Maduro government and the opposition, and work with other countries in our region, and the international community, to support the Venezuelan people\u2019s right to build their own future.\u201d He said he \u201cwould condemn the use of violence against unarmed protesters and the suppression of dissent\u201d and \u201clisten to the voices of Venezuelan activists themselves who warn against broad sanctions, such as the Trump administration\u2019s oil sanctions, that mainly punish the people, not the government.\u201d", "Sanders has more recently referred to Maduro as a \u201cvicious tyrant.\u201d", "Hong Kong Protests", "Demonstrators have taken to the streets in Hong Kong since the of summer 2019 to protest against a (now-scrapped) proposed bill that would have allowed extraditions from Hong Kong to China. Pro-democracy protesters also demanded changes to Hong Kong\u2019s election process, including the direct election of the city\u2019s chief executive, who is selected by a 1,200-member committee.", "During the December Democratic presidential debate, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has repeatedly expressed support for the protests, accused Trump of not making \u201ca peep\u201d in support of \u201cfolks out there standing up for democracy\u201d in Hong Kong.", "As we wrote at the time, Buttigieg\u2019s claim about Trump wasn\u2019t accurate; the president had signed two bills supporting Hong Kong protesters despite objections by the Chinese government.", "However, those two bills got to the president\u2019s desk with the help of most congressional Democrats.", "The first bill \u2014 S. 1838, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 \u2014 requires the U.S. to annually \u201cassess whether political developments in Hong Kong justify changing Hong Kong\u2019s unique treatment under U.S. law,\u201d including not being subject to tariffs levied upon China. It also features some human rights provisions.", "That bill was sponsored by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and passed by unanimous consent in the Republican-controlled Senate. It was then approved by the Democrat-controlled House. While a few representatives from both parties did not vote, the only member of the House who voted against it was Rep. Thomas Massie \u2014 a Republican.", "The second bill,\u00a0S. 2710, was sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley and prohibits the sale of \u201cspecified munitions,\u201d including tear gas, rubber bullets and handcuffs, to the Hong Kong Police Force. The bill was approved in both chambers and there were no votes against it.", "Pelosi and a bipartisan group of lawmakers also hosted pro-democracy activists from Hong Kong at the U.S. Capitol in September.", "And in addition to Buttigieg, other Democratic presidential candidates still in the race \u2014 such as Biden, Warren, Sanders and Sen. Amy Klobuchar \u2014 have publicly supported the protesters, too.", "Iran and Soleimani", "After the Jan. 2 killing of Soleimani, many leading Democrats criticized or questioned Trump\u2019s decision to order the airstrike on the Iranian military leader. Pelosi referred to the move as \u201cprovocative and disproportionate.\u201d", "But as we\u2019ve written, the House speaker didn\u2019t \u201cdefend\u201d Soleimani, as the president claimed. And, as PolitiFact found, it\u2019s also not the case that top Democrats were \u201cmourning\u201d his death.", "Instead, many have acknowledged his acts of terror \u2014 the Pentagon has attributed the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members to Soleimani, and said he was planning future attacks \u2014 even when criticizing or questioning Trump\u2019s decision to have him killed.", "For example, while Schumer said the Trump administration\u2019s \u201clack of advance of consultation and transparency with Congress can lead to hasty and ill-considered decisions,\u201d he also said Soleimani was a \u201cnotorious terrorist\u201d and that \u201cno one should shed a tear over his death.\u201d", "Days after Soleimani was killed, Iran shot down a Ukrainian passenger airplane, killing 176 people. After Iran initially denied responsibility, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani then blamed human error and said the plane was accidentally shot down \u2014 a revelation that prompted Iranians to take to the streets to protest the Iranian government.", "Trump publicly supported those protesters, warning Iran in a tweet that \u201cthe World is watching.\u201d", "While some prominent Democrats \u2014 including 2020 candidates Biden, Warren and Klobuchar \u2014 posted messages supporting the protesters, some\u00a0journalists and conservative media personalities highlighted an apparent reluctance by Democrats to be as vocally supportive of the Iranian protesters as Trump. A Washington Post columnist, urging Democrats to be more supportive even if criticizing Trump\u2019s policies, opined that their hesitancy stemmed from distrust of Trump and the possibility that \u201chis confrontational policies\u201d that \u201ccould drag us into another Middle Eastern conflict.\u201d", "Pelosi, for her part, was asked if she supported the protesters on ABC News on Jan. 12. She first acknowledged that previous protests have occurred \u2014 both against the regime and against the U.S. \u2014 and said that the Iranian government should be \u201cheld accountable\u201d for allowing commercial flights to take place at that time.", "Pelosi then added: \u201cOf course we would love to see the aspirations of the people of Iran realized with a better situation there,\u201d before warning against the U.S. \u201cescalating the situation \u2014 unless we\u2019ve exhausted every other remedy.\u201d", "Her response was hardly a defense of Soleimani or Iran\u2019s leaders.", "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has criticized House Democrats for not allowing a vote on a resolution he sponsored that condemned Iran and supported protesters. But that was a procedural vote \u2014 not one on the substance of the resolution \u2014 after Republicans had attempted to amend an unrelated bill to require immediate consideration of McCarthy\u2019s resolution. (Democratic Rep. Mark DeSaulnier countered that the maneuver was one to \u201chand over control of the House floor to the minority.\u201d He said \u201cCongress supports\u201d the people of Iran \u201cwho have stood up to their government demanding transparency and fighting for their rights.\u201d)", "Pelosi\u2019s spokesman, Drew Hammill, also told FactCheck.org in an email that Pelosi supports a resolution introduced in December by Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch that expresses support for protesters in Iran and condemns the country for \u201ca long history of violent repression of dissent,\u201d noting arrests and murders of protesters.", "\u201cCongress, on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, firmly supports the Iranian people in their struggle to have their freedoms and human rights respected by the Iranian regime and condemns Tehran\u2019s unprecedented, outrageous use of lethal force against the protestors,\u201d Hammill said. \u201cThe Speaker is proud to support H. Res 752, Chairman Ted Deutch\u2019s bipartisan resolution supporting the Iranian people\u2019s legitimate protests against the oppressive Iranian government. Congress wants to see the aspirations of the people of Iran realized, and will continue to urge the Administration to use diplomacy and America\u2019s economic might \u2014 not senseless military escalation \u2014 to bring accountability, freedom and peace to Iran.\u00a0 The violence must end now.\u201d", "We couldn\u2019t find instances of Democrats making statements \u201cstand[ing] with Soleimani and the Ayatollahs,\u201d as the social media posts argue. While cautioning against a war with Iran, Pelosi said during a press briefing on Jan. 9 that \u201cwe have no illusions about Iran, no illusions about Soleimani, who was a terrible person.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
