["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on May 22, 2018", "President Donald Trump wrongly blamed Democrats for a Trump administration policy that will separate parents and their young children caught entering the U.S. illegally.", "\u201cWe have to break up families,\u201d Trump claimed, because of \u201cbad laws that the Democrats gave us.\u201d But there is no such law. Instead, it\u2019s the administration\u2019s decision to criminally prosecute all immigrants who cross the border illegally that will cause children to be separated from their parents.", "In early May, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen directed her department to refer all unauthorized immigrants who cross the U.S. border to federal prosecutors. It\u2019s in accordance with the Department of Justice\u2019s new \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy on illegal immigration at the Southwest border.", "Parents would be sent to federal court under the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and then placed in a detention center, according to a DHS spokesperson. Their children, minors who cannot be housed in a detention center for adults, would be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services for placement in a juvenile facility or foster care if they have no other adult relative in the U.S. who can take them in.", "\u201cIt is the government\u2019s choice whether to criminally prosecute someone for illegal entry or reentry,\u201d Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C., told us.", "Trump made his remarks at a White House meeting on so-called \u201csanctuary city\u201d policies in California. He told Nielsen, who was in attendance, that Democrats were responsible for the \u201ctough\u201d situation involving immigrant families.", "Trump, May 16: I know what you\u2019re going through right now with families is very tough. But those are the bad laws that the Democrats gave us. We have to break up families. The Democrats gave us that law. It\u2019s a horrible thing. We have to break up families.", "The Democrats gave us that law and they don\u2019t want to do anything about it. They\u2019ll leave it like that because they don\u2019t want to make any changes. And now you\u2019re breaking up families because of the Democrats. It\u2019s terrible.", "Since at least the administration of George W. Bush, a Republican president, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has held many parents and children who crossed the border seeking asylum in family detention centers. Those families have been kept together until they go before an immigration judge or are formally removed from the U.S.", "Prior to that, \u201cfamily units were hardly ever detained, but rather processed and released with a notice to appear at immigration court, especially if they met the credible fear of persecution criteria for a claim to asylum,\u201d according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank that promotes bipartisan policy solutions.", "So, to what Democratic law is Trump referring?", "A White House spokesman referred us to a DHS statement\u00a0regarding a 1997 legal settlement and 2008 antitrafficking law affecting minors who are apprehended without a parent present:", "(We wrote about\u00a0both when Trump also wrongly faulted Democrats for the so-called \u201ccatch and release\u201d policy that allows some immigrants caught in the U.S. without proper documentation to be released back into the U.S. while they await an immigration court hearing. See \u201cFactChecking Trump\u2019s Immigration Tweets\u201d for more details.)", "But neither the court settlement nor the 2008 law require the Trump administration to \u201cbreak up families.\u201d", "They require the government to release children from custody after a certain period of detainment, said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. But they don\u2019t require that parents continue to be held in immigration detention.", "\u201cThe government absolutely has the option to release the parents,\u201d as well, Pierce said. That\u2019s as long as they aren\u2019t a flight or safety risk, she added.", "Brown, of\u00a0the Bipartisan Policy Center, said the Trump administration\u2019s decision to bring criminal charges against the parents \u2014 rather than follow the civil removal process \u2014 will result in children being separated from their parents.", "\u201cIt is the government\u2019s choice whether to criminally prosecute someone for illegal entry or reentry,\u201d Brown wrote in an email to FactCheck.org. \u201cThat is the quintessential definition of \u2018prosecutorial discretion.'\u201d", "\u201cHistorically, most immigrants were not prosecuted, even when the law allowed for it, they were simply removed in civil proceedings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe significant uptick in criminal prosecution began under President George W. Bush, and continued through the early Obama administration.\u201d", "U.S Attorney General Jeff Sessions outlined the new enforcement actions on May 7.", "\u201cIf you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cIf you smuggle illegal aliens across our border, then we will prosecute you. If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law.\u201d", "Because minors cannot be kept in jails for adults, children would be separated from parents charged with committing a crime, Brown explained. Children would then be considered unaccompanied minors and turned over to the refugee resettlement office.", "In fact, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who was Homeland Security secretary before Nielsen, indicated in March 2017 that DHS was considering splitting up parents and children as a strategy to deter other families from illegally immigrating to the U.S.", "Other administration officials \u2014 including Nielsen and ICE\u2019s top official,\u00a0Thomas Homan \u2014 have since denied that is the intent.", "\u201cI want to be clear. DHS does not have a blanket policy on separating families as a deterrent,\u201d Homan, reportedly said at the press event with Sessions. \u201cEvery law enforcement agency in this country separates parents from children when they\u2019re arrested for a crime. There is no new policy. This has always been the policy. Now, you will see more prosecutions because of the attorney general\u2019s commitment to zero tolerance.\u201d", "Even so, the decision to prosecute all offenders is one that was made by the current administration. It is not a law that \u201cDemocrats gave us,\u201d as Trump said.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
