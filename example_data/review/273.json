["By Brooks Jackson, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley, Angelo Fichera, Jessica McDonald, Rem Rieder, Katie Busch and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on October 16, 2020", "In an Oct. 15 town hall on NBC News, President Donald Trump made false and misleading claims on the coronavirus, the economy and more:", "The NBC News town hall was held in Miami and hosted by \u201cToday\u201d show anchor Savannah Guthrie. Over on ABC News, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was answering questions in another town hall at the same time. We fact-checked that as well.", "Trump wrongly said the CDC \u201ccame out with a statement that 85% of the people who wear masks catch\u201d the coronavirus. Rather, among the COVID-19 patients surveyed in the study, 85% reported they \u201calways\u201d or \u201coften\u201d wore a mask in the 14 days before illness onset.", "Trump: I\u2019m OK with masks. I tell people, wear a mask. But just the other day they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it.", "The day before the town hall, the CDC released\u00a0a tweet\u00a0directly contradicting the president\u2019s claim, saying, \u201cthe interpretation that more mask-wearers are getting infected compared to non-mask wearers is incorrect.\u201d", "The major finding of the\u00a0CDC study, released Sept. 11, was that people in the survey with COVID-19 were twice as likely to have eaten at a restaurant, and that eating in restaurants or drinking in bars might be a higher risk activity. The report also found that people in the study with and without COVID-19 reported high levels of mask wearing in public. Among the approximately 150 COVID-19 patients in the study, 85% reported they \u201calways\u201d or \u201coften\u201d wore a face mask in the 14 days before illness onset.", "Although Trump offered a tepid endorsement of mask-wearing \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m OK with masks. I tell people wear masks\u201d \u2014 as we have written, Trump\u00a0often equivocates\u00a0on the subject, as he then did at the town hall, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve heard many different stories on masks,\u201d and, \u201cHey, Dr. Fauci said don\u2019t wear a mask.\u201d", "In the early months of 2020,\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,\u00a0and\u00a0other federal public health officials\u00a0did\u00a0tell\u00a0the general public not to wear face masks. However, as health officials learned more about the virus, and how often it was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, the CDC reversed course on April 3 and\u00a0recommended\u00a0that people begin \u201cwearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\u201d", "\u201cAnybody who has been listening to me over the last several months know that a conversation does not go by where I do not strongly recommend that people wear masks,\u201d Fauci said in\u00a0an interview\u00a0on Sept. 30 on ABC News\u2019 \u201cStart Here\u201d podcast.", "As the CDC\u00a0tweeted\u00a0on Oct. 14, \u201cMuch evidence shows wearing masks in public reduces transmission by blocking exhaled respiratory droplets.\u201d", "In\u00a0an interview\u00a0on Sept. 24 on the \u201cToday\u201d show, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the official messaging from the White House has been \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d in support of public mask-wearing since early April. But the president has continued to hold densely packed rallies where many supporters are not wearing masks. Trump has said little to discourage them.", "Trump insisted that his administration had done well and the coronavirus pandemic was taking a turn for the better.", "\u201cAnd what we\u2019ve done has been amazing. And we have done an amazing job,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s rounding the corner, and we have the vaccines coming and we have the therapies coming.\u201d", "Trump has professed that the U.S. is \u201crounding the corner\u201d on the coronavirus for\u00a0more than a month. But Fauci\u00a0is\u00a0on\u00a0record\u00a0disagreeing with that assessment.", "On Sept. 11, he told MSNBC that he was concerned that the U.S. still had too many infections as the weather turned colder.", "\u201cWe are plateauing around 40,000 cases a day and the deaths are around 1,000,\u201d he said, adding that especially as people start to spend more time indoors, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to start off already with a baseline that\u2019s so high.\u201d", "Since then, coronavirus cases have only increased. As of Oct. 15, the seven-day average of new cases is topping 53,000 a day,\u00a0per\u00a0the COVID Tracking Project, and an analysis from Johns Hopkins University\u00a0shows\u00a0cases are on the upswing in many states, especially in the upper Midwest.", "An Oct. 15\u00a0report\u00a0from the COVID Tracking Project concluded that a \u201cthird surge\u201d was underway, with cases and hospitalizations up \u201calmost everywhere.\u201d", "Johns Hopkins epidemiologist\u00a0Caitlin Rivers\u00a0told\u00a0the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0that the country is \u201cheaded in the wrong direction,\u201d and said the combined indicators of new cases, test positivity rates and hospitalization \u201cgive a very clear picture that we are seeing increased transmission in communities across the country.\u201d", "As has been the case\u00a0for\u00a0months,\u00a0the president warned of mail-in ballot fraud in the general election, citing\u00a0military ballots\u00a0\u2014 seven for him \u2014 that were found in a trash can in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. State elections officials have since said the ballots were discarded in error,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Times Leader of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.", "In a Sept. 30 story, the paper quoted Jonathan Marks, the state deputy secretary for elections, as saying military and overseas ballots sometimes are mailed in envelopes that are not clearly marked as ballots.", "When moderator Guthrie pointed out that \u201cyour own FBI director said there\u2019s no evidence of widespread fraud,\u201d Trump responded: \u201cOh, really? Then he\u2019s not doing a very good job. All you have to do is pick up the papers every day. 50,000 in Ohio, the great state of Ohio. 50,000 in another location, I think North Carolina. 500,000 applications in Virginia. No, no. There\u2019s a tremendous problem.\u201d", "Trump is wrong to cite Ohio, Virginia and North Carolina as examples of fraud. They were errors, and they have been or are being corrected.", "In Ohio, the Franklin County Board of Elections said in an\u00a0Oct. 9 press release\u00a0that \u201c49,669 voters received an inaccurate ballot,\u201d promising to have correct ballots mailed out in 72 hours. \u201cWe want to make it clear that every voter who received an inaccurate ballot will receive a corrected ballot,\u201d the board said. \u201cStringent tracking measures are in place to guarantee that a voter can only cast one vote.\u201d", "In Virginia, ABC7\u00a0reported\u00a0in August that 500,000 ballot applications were mailed to Fairfax County residents by the nonprofit Center For Voter Information with the wrong information. The center blamed a printing error. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this organization was acting maliciously, they just were not very diligent in their follow-through,\u201d Gary Scott, the county general registrar and director of elections, told ABC7.", "Similarly, 11,000 North Carolinians received inaccurate pre-filled voter registration applications \u2014 not actual ballots \u2014 from Civitech, a technology vendor that works with companies and campaigns to increase voter registrations, the North Carolina State Board of Elections said in an\u00a0Oct. 6 press release. Civitech Chief Operating Office Sarah Jackel apologized and promised to send out \u201ccorrected mailers with blank applications to all affected NC recipients.\u201d", "After Trump told an audience member that \u201cwe are going to take care of DACA\u201d if he is reelected, Guthrie offered some facts about the Trump administration\u2019s current approach to the\u00a0Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.", "\u201cMr. President, in point of fact, the DACA program, there are \u2014 under your administration \u2014 no new applicants are allowed and in fact the DACA recipients now have to renew every year as opposed to every two years. So in fact the DACA program has been curtailed by your administration,\u201d Guthrie said.", "Trump then falsely suggested that those changes were due to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "\u201cWell what happened is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front,\u201d he responded. \u201cMexico is heavily infected as you know and we\u2019ve made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic and other reasons, and crime.\u201d", "First of all, the DACA program isn\u2019t for new immigrants. As we\u2019ve\u00a0explained, the program was started in 2012, and it\u00a0was designed to defer deportation proceedings for two years for qualified individuals who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children. The program also provides those who are approved work authorization, and the approvals can be renewed. Among the\u00a0requirements\u00a0for the program, an individual has to have been living in the U.S.\u00a0continuously since June 15, 2007.", "The Trump administration began in 2017 an effort to \u201cwind-down\u201d the program. But\u00a0in June, the Supreme Court\u00a0blocked\u00a0the administration\u2019s termination of the program.", "Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, then\u00a0issued a memo\u00a0in July outlining \u201cimmediate changes to the DACA policy to facilitate my thorough consideration of how to address DACA in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\u201d", "Among them were the changes cited by Guthrie: \u201cno new initial requests for DACA should be accepted\u201d and \u201cgoing forward, renewals of deferred action and the accompanying work authorization should be granted for one-year, rather than two-year, periods,\u201d Wolf\u2019s memo said.", "Trump once again claimed that Biden wants to raise taxes on \u201ceverybody\u201d including \u201cmiddle income\u201d people, when in fact Biden has vowed he won\u2019t raise federal income taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year.", "Trump:\u00a0And if Biden comes in and raises\u00a0taxes on everybody, including middle income taxes,\u00a0which he wants to do.", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve explained before, Biden\u2019s tax plan would not directly increase federal income taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. But it would also raise corporate income taxes \u2014 which experts generally agree would have the indirect effect of holding down wages.", "However, Biden has also proposed a number of new tax credits for low- and middle-income earners. And those would offset even the indirect effect of increased corporate taxes. The\u00a0most recent estimate\u00a0(issued Oct. 15) by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, for example, calculates that the net result of all Biden\u2019s tax proposals would be, on average, an increase in after-tax income (in effect, a tax cut) for the bottom 80% of households, with the top one-tenth of 1% of earners bearing 70% of Biden\u2019s proposed tax increases.", "The business-supported\u00a0Tax Foundation\u00a0comes to a similar conclusion in its latest study, figuring that the middle 20% of earners would see a 1.4% increase in after-tax income in 2021. (However, the Tax Foundation also figures that the dynamic effects of Biden\u2019s tax proposals would eventually \u2014 over the long run \u2014 hold down economic growth by 1.5% and result in a 1.2% reduction in after-tax income for that middle quintile.)", "Trump painted a too-rosy picture of the economy, past and present.", "He boasted that before the COVID-19 recession, \u201cWe were up to 160 million jobs.\u201d Not true. At its peak in February,\u00a0payroll employment was 152.5 million.", "He spoke of gaining 11.4 million jobs. That\u2019s the number of jobs that have been regained in the six months following the loss of 22 million jobs in March and April. Even after that rebound, the U.S. still had nearly 11 million fewer jobs last month than it did in February \u2014 and 3.9 million fewer than in the month Trump took office.", "He said that gross domestic product \u201cis going through the roof\u201d and\u00a0predicted that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have a phenomenal third quarter.\u201d Maybe so, compared with the second quarter when\u00a0the economy\u00a0shrank at an annual rate of 31.4%, by far the worst since the government began keeping records. But 2020 is still expected to be a terrible year for growth overall. For example, the most recent forecast of the Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents,\u00a0issued Sept. 16, produced a median estimate of a 3.7% drop in real GDP in the fourth quarter, compared with the same quarter a year earlier.", "And he repeated his false claim that \u201cwe had the greatest economy in the history of our country\u201d before the recession hit. As we\u2019ve often pointed out, that\u2019s not correct. Economic growth and job growth have been faster, and the unemployment rate has been lower, at several other points in history. For example, GDP\u00a0grew 2.2% last year\u00a0and 3.0% the year before, which was Trump\u2019s best. It grew faster \u2014 3.1% \u2014 in 2015, which was then-President Barack Obama\u2019s best year.", "Guthrie asked Trump about QAnon and whether he would condemn the widespread conspiracy theory, which\u00a0hinges\u00a0in part on the unsupported notion that Trump is working to dismantle an elite child sex trafficking ring involving top Democrats.", "Guthrie: \u201cLet me ask you about QAnon \u2014 it is this theory that Democrats are a satanic pedophile ring and that you are the savior of that. Now can you just once and for all state that that is completely not true and disavow QAnon in its entirety?\u201d", "Trump responded: \u201cI know nothing about QAnon. I know very little \u2026 I do know they are very much against pedophilia.\u201d", "Later, when pressed again by Guthrie, Trump again said, \u201cI just don\u2019t know about QAnon.\u201d", "We don\u2019t know how much Trump knows or doesn\u2019t know about QAnon, but it\u2019s worth noting that the question was far from the president\u2019s first encounter with the high-profile conspiracy theory. The FBI in 2019 described the theory as a domestic terror threat,\u00a0according\u00a0to a memo obtained by Yahoo News.", "Trump has\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0shared\u00a0posts on Twitter from accounts that espouse the theory, and QAnon signage and\u00a0paraphernalia has\u00a0also\u00a0regularly\u00a0shown up\u00a0at Trump rallies.", "During a press briefing in August, a reporter\u00a0asked\u00a0Trump about his thoughts about the theory\u2019s growth, and he said he didn\u2019t \u201cknow much about the movement\u201d but had \u201cheard these are people that love our country.\u201d", "Trump, Aug. 19:\u00a0Well, I don\u2019t know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate, but I don\u2019t know much about the movement. I have heard that it is gaining in popularity. And from what I hear, it\u2019s \u2014 these are people that, when they watch the streets of Portland, when they watch what happened in New York City in just the last six or seven months \u2014 but this was starting even four years ago when I came here. Almost four years; can you believe it?", "These are people that don\u2019t like seeing what\u2019s going on in places like Portland and places like Chicago and New York and other cities and states. And I\u2019ve heard these are people that love our country, and they just don\u2019t like seeing it.", "In a follow-up question, the reporter explained to Trump the core gist of QAnon \u2014 as Guthrie did \u2014 telling him, \u201cMr. President, at the crux of the theory is this belief that you are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals. Does that sound like something you are behind or a believer in?\u201d", "Trump replied: \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t \u2014 I haven\u2019t heard that. But is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing? I mean, you know, if I can help save the world from problems, I\u2019m willing to do it.\u201d", "In an exchange with Guthrie about how well the U.S. has handled the coronavirus pandemic, Trump falsely claimed that \u201cwe\u2019re a winner\u201d on excess mortality.", "But the U.S. does not have an especially good record on excess mortality, or the number of people who died from any cause, relative to a \u201cnormal\u201d or expected number of deaths. The metric is an alternative way of estimating the impact of the coronavirus that avoids issues of miscounting or underreporting COVID-19 deaths.", "According to a\u00a0paper\u00a0published in the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association on Oct. 12 that compared the U.S. to 14 other countries, America had a higher rate of per capita excess mortality than all but two nations since the start of the pandemic through late July.", "Only two countries \u2014 Spain and the U.K. \u2014 had higher per capita rates for the entire pandemic, and when evaluating excess mortality after May or June, the U.S. had the worst record by far.", "Trump has previously bragged that the U.S.\u2019s excess mortality is significantly lower than Europe\u2019s. But\u00a0as\u00a0we\u2019ve\u00a0written, the best estimates suggest the American rate is higher, not lower, than Europe\u2019s.", "University of Oxford economists Janine Aron and John Muellbauer concluded in a\u00a0report\u00a0published last month that the U.S.\u2019s excess mortality rate is \u201csubstantially worse\u201d than Europe\u2019s.", "In updating our earlier analysis using figures from the\u00a0Human Mortality Database\u00a0to include data through Sept. 27, or week 39, we also find that America\u2019s excess mortality rate is 14.5% higher than normal, compared with a collective total of 12.2% for European countries that have data available through the same time period.", "And the U.S.\u2019s rate is higher than almost all of the\u00a035 countries included in the database. Only Spain, Chile, England and Wales, and Italy have higher excess mortality rates (Italy includes data only up to week 26).", "Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ve also brought down the price of Obamacare.\u201d Premiums for plans purchased on the Affordable Care Act exchanges have gone down in 2020 (by 3.5% for the lowest-cost \u201csilver\u201d level premium) and 2019 (by 0.4%), but that was after a double-digit increase for 2018 plans (up 29.7%).", "The large increase then was driven by the Trump administration\u2019s elimination of cost-sharing subsidies on the marketplaces and insurer uncertainty over the ACA\u2019s future. When insurers set marketplace premiums for 2019, the Urban Institute wrote in a January report, \u201cit became clear that many of them had overreacted to the tumult and uncertainty\u201d in pricing 2018 plans. So, those premiums, which do \u201cvary considerably across states,\u201d the report noted, have now dropped.", "Trump argued that the precautions his administration took to minimize COVID-19 spreading avoided an expected loss of \u201c2,200,000 people.\u201d", "\u201cWe did the right thing. We were expected to lose 2,200,000 people, and maybe more than that. We\u2019re at 210,00 people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOne person is too much, it should have never happened because of China. \u2026 But we were expected to lose, if you look at the original charts from original doctors who were respected by everybody, 2,200,000 people. We saved 2 million people.\u201d", "Trump has made this claim\u00a0numerous\u00a0times\u00a0in the past.\u00a0As\u00a0we\u00a0reported\u00a0before, the 2.2 million figure is based on a model from Imperial College London in March that predicted U.S. deaths if no mitigation measures were taken and no individual behavior changes occurred.", "The figure, therefore, was not intended to be a practical estimate of the true number of losses.", "Research does support the idea that lockdowns \u2014 which were instituted by states, not Trump \u2014 saved lives earlier this year, although it\u2019s hard to say how many.", "For instance, Columbia University researchers estimated\u00a0that if the U.S. had implemented social distancing one week earlier in March,\u00a036,000 fewer\u00a0people would have died.", "As of Oct. 16, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, there have been more than 217,000 deaths in the U.S.", "Trump repeated a false claim that the state of Michigan was in the midst of a lockdown.", "Trump: We won a big case in Michigan because that governor has a lockdown where nobody but her husband can do anything. He can go boating and do whatever he wants but nobody else can.", "The president had made a similar false claim in an interview\u00a0Oct. 8 with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, saying that the state was \u201cclosed,\u201d specifically and falsely mentioning churches and schools. But as we have\u00a0written, that is not the case.", "In fact, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat and a frequent target of Trump, on June 1 lifted the state\u2019s stay-at-home\u00a0order, which the governor issued in March to combat the spread of COVID-19. The vast majority of the state\u2019s businesses are open with some restrictions, as are churches and schools, although some of the latter are teaching remotely.", "The situation in Michigan was complicated on Oct. 2 when the Michigan Supreme Court\u00a0struck down\u00a0as unconstitutional the 1945 law that Whitmer had relied on in issuing her emergency orders on COVID-19.", "In the wake of the ruling, the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services, citing authority not covered by the state Supreme Court ruling, issued an\u00a0emergency order\u00a0replicating several aspects of Whitmer\u2019s orders. They include requiring wearing masks at indoor and outdoor gatherings; limiting the size of crowds at indoor and outdoor gatherings, with some exceptions; and requiring bars to close indoor common areas.", "The reference to Whitmer\u2019s husband and a boat goes back to an\u00a0embarrassing contretemps\u00a0for the couple late in May. Just before Memorial Day, when the governor was urging Michiganders not to crowd waterfront areas due to concern about COVID-19,\u00a0Whitmer\u2019s husband, Marc Mallory, called a marina in Northern Michigan to see if it could get his boat in the water for the holiday. When told that it was impossible, Mallory asked if the fact that he was married to the governor would help.", "News about the request triggered criticism of the Whitmers, particularly from people upset about strict stay-at home policies Whitmer had imposed. The governor said it had simply been an unsuccessful stab at humor on her husband\u2019s part.", "Trump repeated some false and misleading claims when answering an audience member\u2019s question about the response to COVID-19 and his purported \u201ctravel ban.\u201d", "\u201cI put on a travel ban far earlier than Dr. [Anthony] Fauci thought it was necessary, who I like, far earlier than the scientists,\u201d he said. \u201cI was actually the only one that wanted to put it on, and I did it actually against the advice of a lot of people.\u201d", "As we\u2019ve\u00a0explained\u00a0before, the travel restrictions were not a \u201cban\u201d; tens of thousands of people continued to fly to the U.S. from China.", "And Trump wasn\u2019t the \u201conly one\u201d who wanted the restrictions.
