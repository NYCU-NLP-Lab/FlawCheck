["By Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on March 1, 2021", "In his first public speech since leaving office, former President Donald Trump delighted his audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference with numerous false and misleading claims, many of them criticisms of his successor.", "Trump spoke on Feb. 28 in Orlando at the conclusion of the conference. We include here a sampling of his inaccurate claims.", "The former president made wildly off-target claims about Biden\u2019s immigration policies.", "For sure, Biden has\u00a0reversed\u00a0many of Trump\u2019s immigration policies. But the new president did not \u201ccancel border security,\u201d trigger record numbers of illegal border crossings and stop deportation of murderers, gang members and sex offenders, as Trump claimed.", "Trump, Feb. 28:\u00a0Joe Biden has triggered a massive flood of illegal immigration into our country, the likes of which we have never seen before. \u2026 So they\u2019re all coming because of promises and foolish words.", "There has been an increase in the number of people caught crossing the border illegally, but Trump is wrong to say it has been \u201cthe likes of which we have never seen before.\u201d", "In January, there were 75,198 southwest border apprehensions \u2014 a 6% increase from the prior month,\u00a0according\u00a0to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In a Feb. 9 interview, Deputy Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz estimated that the numbers were still rising in February with about 3,000 migrants a day, as the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in a Feb. 10 article on the increasing numbers.", "The CBP does not have February statistics available, but at 3,000 a day that would be 84,000 apprehensions \u2014 which is far short of the record high, contrary to Trump\u2019s claim. There were\u00a0more than 200,000\u00a0border apprehensions in February 2000, for example, in a decade when annual totals often topped 1 million.", "Trump also\u00a0misrepresented\u00a0Biden\u2019s enforcement and removal policy, falsely referring at one point to \u201cBiden\u2019s decision to cancel border security.\u201d", "Trump, Feb. 28:\u00a0He has effectively ordered a shutdown of ICE, halting virtually all deportations, everyone, murderers, everybody, no more. Let\u2019s not deport people.", "\u201cICE has not been shut down. Instead, the Biden administration has put into place priorities to focus ICE enforcement efforts,\u201d Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told us, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cThese priorities include noncitizens with serious criminal records.\u201d", "Here\u2019s what happned: On Biden\u2019s first day in office, Acting Homeland Security Secretary David Pekoske\u00a0issued\u00a0\u201ca 100-day pause on certain removals to enable focusing the Department\u2019s [enforcement] resources where they are most needed.\u201d Pekoske\u2019s memo also set interim priorities for enforcement, directing immigration officials to focus on national security and public safety threats as well as those apprehended entering the U.S. illegally after Nov. 1.", "The 100-day pause included exceptions \u2014 allowing for the deportation of those suspected of terrorism and those whose \u201cremoval is required by law.\u201d The 100-day pause, however, was quickly\u00a0blocked\u00a0by U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton\u2019s\u00a0temporary restraining order, allowing deportation proceedings to continue, Pierce said.", "In a\u00a0Feb. 2 letter\u00a0to the homeland security secretary, dozens of law professors and legal experts wrote that immigration officials \u201ccontinue to engage in enforcement activities, including deportations, that appear at odds with the policies issued.\u201d The letter argued that the Biden administration had the authority to halt deportations, despite the court ruling.", "On Feb. 18, Tae D. Johnson, the acting director of ICE, issued\u00a0interim guidance\u00a0for enforcement and removals until the department completes its review and the secretary issues new guidelines.", "The interim guidelines placed priorities on deporting those who pose a public safety or national security threat \u2013 including active gang members, suspected terrorists and those \u201cconvicted of an aggravated felony\u201d as defined by\u00a0section 101(a)(43)\u00a0of the\u00a0Immigration and Nationality Act. Those felonies include: murder, rape, drug trafficking, firearm trafficking and any \u201ccrime of violence\u201d that results in a prison sentence of at least one year.", "The memo \u201cdoes not eliminate immigration enforcement,\u201d Jennifer Minear, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time.", "\u201cPrioritizing enforcement doesn\u2019t mean disregarding it,\u201d Minear said. \u201cDespite what some critics may claim, this memo does not block immigration enforcement, but rather makes very clear that ICE officers retain discretion and that no one is completely off limits from apprehension, detention, or removal.\u201d", "We won\u2019t know the impact of Biden\u2019s immigration policies on enforcement or deportation for quite some time, at least until permanent policies are put into effect. But Trump distorts the interim policies when he says Biden \u201ceffectively ordered a shutdown of ICE\u201d and halted deportations of murderers and \u201cvirtually all deportations.\u201d", "Trump also twisted the facts when he suggested children being held in immigration detention facilities are getting a better education than U.S. students during the pandemic.", "Trump, Feb. 28:\u00a0The Biden administration is actually bragging about the classroom education they are providing to migrant children on the border. While at the same time, millions of American children are having their futures destroyed by Joe Biden\u2019s anti-science school closures. Think of it. We\u2019re educating students on the border, but our own people, children of our citizens, citizens themselves are not getting the education that they deserve.", "Trump\u2019s statement about Biden\u2019s \u201canti-science school closures\u201d is wrong. All decisions about whether to open or close U.S. schools during the pandemic are made at the state and local levels, not by the federal government. Biden has been\u00a0criticized\u00a0for not providing financial incentives to encourage school reopenings, but he cannot force schools to reopen and neither could Trump when he was president.", "Trump also exaggerated when he said that the U.S. isn\u2019t educating \u201cour own people\u201d in classrooms.\u00a0As we wrote, nearly two of three U.S. students \u2014 an estimated 66.1% of K-12 students \u2014 attend schools that offer either traditional in-person instruction every day or hybrid instruction. The rest are learning via virtual classrooms.", "As for teaching migrant children in detention facilities, Biden is merely following federal law \u2014 as past administrations have done, although the Trump administration was criticized for failing to provide adequate schooling.", "\u201cWhile the children are in federal detention centers, officials must provide shelter, food, and schooling, but leaders in some of the nation\u2019s largest states and school districts question whether the education needs of the children are being met,\u201d Education Week\u00a0wrote\u00a0in 2018 when Trump was president.", "The Biden administration last month\u00a0opened\u00a0the first center for children who crossed the border illegally without parents or a legal guardian. But the teachers are not in the classroom with the students. \u201cWhile youth attend class in a physical classroom, for the time being, teachers are providing live, virtual instruction \u2013 like many schools during the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0a Department of Health and Human Services press release on the Texas facility.", "Trump falsely blamed Democratic policies for an increase in gas prices since the election. The jump is due to a rise in crude oil prices, which has nothing to do with the Biden administration, experts say.", "As we\u2019ve written before, presidents, of both parties, often get blame or credit for changes in gas prices, but the reality is they have little influence. (Trump may have had a tad more, given his uncharacteristic involvement in oil matters, experts told us back in 2018.)", "In his speech, Trump claimed Democrats would cause an \u201cenergy disaster\u201d in the U.S., going on to falsely suggest the Texas power outages in February were due to wind power. He mentioned \u201cthe windmill calamity that we\u2019re witnessing in Texas,\u201d but, as we\u2019ve written, the outages were largely due to a sharp decline in energy from fossil fuels and nuclear power plants, according to Texas power grid operators.", "After critcizing wind energy as \u201cbad for the environment,\u201d Trump turned to gas prices. \u201cUnder the radical Democrat policies, the price of gasoline has already surged 30% since the election. And we\u2019ll go to $5, $6, $7 and even higher,\u201d he said.", "Trump starts the clock at the November election. Weekly gas prices have gone up 25% from $2.112 the week ending Nov. 2 to $2.633 for the week ending Feb. 22, the most recent figure from the Energy Information Administration before Trump spoke. It\u2019s unclear why Democrats would be responsible for gas prices while Trump was still president, and two days before Trump left office, the weekly price was $2.379.", "But regardless, experts say the recent increase is due to the market, not who is in the White House \u2014 as well as that cold winter weather that affected Texas.", "Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis and a co-founder of the\u00a0Oil Price Information Service, told us that so far under Biden, the \u201cnormal machinations of oil markets\u201d have affected gas prices.", "Most of the hike in prices at the pump \u201ccan easily be ascribed to crude oil prices going up,\u201d Kloza said.\u00a0The price per barrel was in the $40s in November and now tops $60. But nothing Biden has done in his short time as president has affected crude prices, he said.", "Why have crude prices jumped? Kloza points to \u201cmoney flow\u201d as investors buy oil as a commodity. Another issue was a surprise cut in output by Saudi Arabia, announced in January. But later this week, when the OPEC Plus countries meet, Kloza said it\u2019s likely Saudi Arabia will increase output. \u201cSo there\u2019s going to be more supply.\u201d", "Jeanette McGee, a spokeswoman for AAA, told us the higher crude oil prices were \u201cdriven by market optimism of the vaccine.\u201d And recent increases are due to the impact of winter weather.", "\u201cThe recent spikes (the last 2 weeks) are a direct result of the winter storm that hit Texas and took 26 refineries offline. Until refineries operations are back on track, we expect prices to continue increasing this month with the national average hitting at least $2.80/gallon,\u201d McGee said.", "In a Feb. 25 post, AAA said prices should stabilize: \u201cAs refineries restart and resume normal operations, supply is expected to increase in impacted areas and should bring stability to pump prices.\u201d", "Kloza, too, said he expects gas prices to peak at about $2.80.", "The Biden administration clearly has different energy policies than the Trump administration. For instance, on his first day in office, Biden ordered a review of fuel economy standards that Trump had instituted in rolling back standards set by then-President Barack Obama. That means gas mileage could improve. But Kloza noted such a change is a slow process.", "Trump repeated an old, misleading claim about the number of jobs created by the Keystone XL pipeline project. He said that Biden canceled the project, \u201cdestroying not the 8,000 or the 9,000 or the 11,000 jobs that you hear. But 42,000 great paying jobs on just about day one, right?\u201d", "As we wrote last month, Terry Cunha, a spokesman for TC Energy, the company behind the pipeline, told us that 1,000 unionized jobs would be lost in the subsequent weeks due to Biden\u2019s Jan. 20 cancellation of\u00a0a\u00a0March 2019 permit\u00a0for the pipeline, which was supposed to run from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska.", "Even those 1,000 jobs were temporary construction jobs.\u00a0\u201cThe project was prepared to hire 11,000 union workers during the construction of the project,\u201d Cunha said.", "As for Trump\u2019s 42,000 figure, the comes from a 2014 estimate from the State Department, which gave that figure for direct jobs, indirect jobs from suppliers and \u201cinduced\u201d jobs, created by the workers and suppliers spending money. But the number of permanent jobs, the State Department said, would be significantly lower. It\u00a0estimated the project \u201cwould generate approximately 50 jobs during operations,\u201d including 15 temporary contractors.", "In touting the rapid production of COVID-19 vaccines, Trump baselessly claimed this couldn\u2019t have happened under any other administration. \u201cWhat has taken place over the last year under our administration would have taken any other president at least five years. And we got it done in nine months.\u201d", "When he made the claim several months ago, he said it would\u2019ve taken two or three years under the last administration. But as we wrote then, there\u2019s no support for Trump\u2019s claim.", "He went on to accurately desribe the key idea behind Operation Warp Speed: to pay companies to start manufacturing a vaccine before it\u2019s approved so it can be distributed more quickly. Trump called it \u201ca calculated bet or a calculated risk.\u201d But that same strategy was used in 2009 for the H1N1 influenza vaccine.", "The COVID-19 pandemic involves a much larger effort, but there\u2019s no reason to think a different administration wouldn\u2019t have done the same.\u00a0In fact, other countries took the same approach.", "\u201cAll the major vaccine development efforts around the world are trying to do the same thing right now, and the major concept is doing the manufacturing before you do the trials,\u201d\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Nicole Lurie, a former assistant secretary for preparedness and response during the Obama administration, told us several months before any vaccine got approval in the U.S.", "Lurie also noted that the previous work and investments in science enabled the fast work on COVID-19 vaccines.\u00a0\u201cWhat the success is really due to is the success of science,\u201d she said.", "As we\u2019ve written, the technology behind the authorized COVID-19 vaccines has been studied for many years, and a focus on rapid vaccine methods was recommended by a presidential advisory group after the H1N1 pandemic.", "Trump repeated many of the misleading and outright false claims about alleged voter fraud in the 2020 election that he made in the months after the election.", "He\u00a0repeated\u00a0unsupported claims about\u00a0dead people\u00a0and \u201cillegal aliens\u201d voting; he talked about \u201ccorrupt mail-in voting\u201d; he advanced allegations of widespread \u201ccheating\u201d; and he made wild and unsubstantiated accusations about \u201ctens of millions of ballots \u2026 indiscriminately pouring in from all over the country.\u201d None of that is accurate.", "Here we\u2019ll dispatch with one of the more outrageous of his election fraud claims: that there were more votes than voters in Detroit and in Pennsylvania.", "Trump, Feb. 28: You take a look at the votes. When you have more votes than you have people, that\u2019s a problem, right? Is that a problem? We have a little problem adjusting in Detroit. We seem to have more votes than we have people, a lot more votes, an election-changing number. We\u2019re not talking about a number where you catch. \u2026 No, these are election-changing numbers. In Pennsylvania, they had hundreds of thousands of more votes than they had people voting. What\u2019s that all about? What\u2019s that all about? Cheating, they say. Yeah, I\u2019d say so.", "Let\u2019s start with the claim about Detroit.\u00a0We\u2019ve heard\u00a0this from Trump before. In a\u00a0video\u00a0he posted to social media on Dec. 2 \u2014 which he billed as perhaps \u201cthe most important speech I\u2019ve ever made\u201d \u2014 Trump similarly claimed that in Detroit \u201cthere were more votes than there were voters.\u201d", "Nearly 50% of the city\u2019s 504,714 registered voters cast a ballot,\u00a0according to the city\u2019s unofficial election results. And 94% of them voted for Biden.", "As we wrote back in early December, Trump appears to be talking about a minor issue with out-of-balance precincts. In Detroit, the number of ballots cast versus the number of voters checked into polling precincts differed by a mere 357, Mayor Mike Duggan\u00a0said\u00a0on Nov. 18. Such discrepancies, which aren\u2019t unique to this election, can occur through a scanner error or if a voter who checks in decides not to vote or spoils a ballot, meaning they ask to void the ballot and re-do their vote.", "Trump called the amount of such votes an \u201celection-changing number,\u201d but as we say, the number was 357. He lost the state by\u00a0more than 150,000 votes.", "Trump made the similarly bogus claim that in Pennsylvania, \u201cthey had hundreds of thousands of more votes than they had people voting.\u201d We\u00a0debunked\u00a0a similar claim from Trump in his Jan. 6\u00a0speech\u00a0at the \u201cSave America\u201d rally that preceded the storming of the Capitol.", "The claim is \u201cbased on incomplete and inaccurate data,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0the Pennsylvania Department of State.", "The claim\u00a0originated\u00a0with a group of Republican legislators in Pennsylvania who compared the total ballots reported as being cast with data contained in the Department of State\u2019s Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors, or SURE, system. But data in the SURE system was incomplete at the time because some counties had not yet finished entering voter histories.", "\u201cAt the time of the legislators\u2019 release, these counties included Philadelphia, Allegheny, Butler and Cambria, which would account for a significant number of voters, and other provisional voter histories in a number of other counties are also not yet complete,\u201d the statement from the Pennsylvania Department of State said.", "Arguing that Republicans need to fight back on free speech issues, Trump said Republicans have allowed Democrats to \u201cattack our businesses, and we don\u2019t attack their businesses.\u201d", "Trump, Feb. 28:\u00a0We\u2019re smarter than they are. We\u2019re tougher than they are. For some reason, we just don\u2019t. We don\u2019t get it done. We let them attack our businesses, and we don\u2019t attack their businesses. I believe your numbers are bigger than their numbers, but you\u2019re nicer than they are. You\u2019re not as vicious as they are.", "But Trump is no stranger to attacking businesses.", "Last August, Trump\u00a0called for\u00a0a boycott of Goodyear tires after a photo circulated on social media of what was purported to be a diversity training slide that noted that MAGA attire was inappropriate for the workplace.", "On Aug. 19, Trump tweeted, \u201cDon\u2019t buy GOODYEAR TIRES \u2013 They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS. Get better tires for far less! (This is what the Radical Left Democrats do. Two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!).\u201d", "The company later issued\u00a0a statement\u00a0saying the image did not come from the corporate office and that as part of the company\u2019s zero tolerance policy for harassment or discrimination, \u201cwe ask that associates refrain from workplace expressions in support of political campaigning for any candidate or political party.\u201d", "In August 2018, Trump tweeted support for those who planned to boycott Harley Davidson after the company announced it was moving its production of motorcycles for the European Union to its overseas facilities to avoid tariffs imposed there in retaliation for U.S. tariffs imposed by Trump.", "\u201cMany @harleydavidson owners plan to boycott the company if manufacturing moves overseas. Great! Most other companies are coming in our direction, including Harley competitors. A really bad move!
