In any event, Trump is wrong when he says it is \u201cless than 1%.\u201d", "When the debate shifted to a discussion about China, Biden said of Trump: \u201cHe has caused the deficit with China to go up, not down. With China, up, not down.\u201d That\u2019s no longer the case.", "The U.S. trade deficit with China in goods and services was a record $380 billion in nominal dollars in 2018,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Through the first six months of 2020, it was about $130 billion. That\u2019s lower than it was at that point in 2019 ($165 billion) and every other year since Trump has been president.", "Trump referenced a talking point he has used repeatedly in campaign rallies, saying that families were making \u201cmore money than they\u2019ve ever made,\u201d mentioning racial groups and saying, \u201cit\u2019s nine times greater the percentage gain \u2026 in three years than it was under eight years of the two of them.\u201d On the campaign trail, he has said:\u00a0\u201cAfrican American income grew nine times more than it did under the last administration.\u201d But the comparison relies on 2019 Census Bureau figures collected this March, during coronavirus pandemic shutdowns, that suffer from a higher-than-normal no-response rate, with\u00a0higher-income households more likely to respond\u00a0than those with lower incomes.", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve explained, Census said an apparent\u00a06.8% increase in 2019 median household income for all races, compared with the year before,\u00a0was actually about 4.1% higher\u00a0after adjusting for the nonresponse bias. Census didn\u2019t give such an adjustment for income by race. But the raw figures show the vast majority of the increase in inflation-adjusted median Black household income under Trump would have come in 2019. It went up by $3,328 from 2018 to 2019 but only $39 from 2016, the year before Trump took office, to 2018. (See Table H-5.)", "Trump\u2019s statistic comes from his\u00a0Council of Economic Advisers, which made adjustments to Census figures for changes to the survey in 2013 and 2017 but not for the lower response issue in 2019 that may have skewed the numbers.", "Trump made three false or misleading\u00a0statements\u00a0about Dr. Anthony Fauci.", "Trump: He did say, don\u2019t wear masks. He did say, as you know, this [the coronavirus] is not going to be a problem. I think he\u2019s a Democrat, but that\u2019s OK. He said, \u201cThis is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.\u201d", "Anthony said don\u2019t wear masks. Now he wants to wear masks.

So, when insurers set marketplace premiums for 2019, the\u00a0Urban Institute wrote in a January report, \u201cit became clear that many of them had overreacted to the tumult and uncertainty\u201d in pricing 2018 plans.", "We don\u2019t yet have complete information on premiums for plans for 2021, but based on the insurer filings so far, most of the premium changes are \u201cmoderate, with increases or decrease of a few percentage points,\u201d an Oct. 19 Kaiser Family Foundation report said. As is typical, rate changes vary widely among plans \u201cfrom a -42.0% decrease to a 25.6% increase,\u201d KFF said, \u201cthough half fall between a 3.5% decrease and 4.6% increase.\u201d", "Private insurance. Trump continued to falsely claim Biden supported getting rid of private insurance, as the Medicare for All plan proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders would do in favor of a Medicare system for everyone. Trump claimed Biden wanted to \u201cterminate all of those policies\u201d for 180 million people on private plans. That\u2019s not Biden\u2019s plan.", "The former vice president has proposed a Medicare-style public option as a choice, but also backs increased tax credits for individuals purchasing their own insurance. \u201cInstead of starting from scratch and getting rid of private insurance, he has a plan to build on the Affordable Care Act by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate,\u201d the plan says.", "Preexisting conditions. In talking about Trump\u2019s desire to get rid of the ACA, Biden said that \u201cover 110 million people with preexisting conditions, and all the people from COVID are going to have preexisting conditions, what are they going to do?\u201d A health care consulting firm did estimate in 2018 that 102 million people, not including those on Medicare and Medicaid, have preexisting conditions. And the ACA expanded preexisting condition protections, prohibiting insurers in all markets from denying coverage or charging more based on health status. But many of those with health conditions wouldn\u2019t be in a dire situation if the ACA were eliminated.", "Those\u00a0seeking coverage on the individual or nongroup market would be at risk of being denied insurance or charged higher premiums, but employer-based plans had some protections before the ACA. New workers couldn\u2019t be denied a policy pre-ACA; they could be denied coverage for some preexisting conditions for a limited period if they had a lapse in coverage.", "As he did in the\u00a0first debate, Trump wrongly attributed to Biden the use of the word \u201csuper-predators\u201d to refer to Black Americans when the then-senator was working on the 1994 crime bill. Actually, that was a phrase famously uttered by Hillary Clinton about some \u201cgangs of kids.\u201d", "Trump repeatedly referred to the 1994 crime bill spearheaded by Biden, saying it \u201cdid such harm to the Black community\u201d and \u201cput tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison.\u201d", "\u201cAnd he called them super-predators,\u201d Trump said, as Biden mouthed, \u201cNot true.\u201d", "\u201cI never, ever said what he accused me of saying,\u201d Biden later responded. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, in 2000, though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said the problem with the crime bill, there\u2019s not enough people in jail.\u201d", "As then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden did shepherd the\u00a0Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994\u00a0through the legislative process. Although the bill received bipartisan support at the time, it has been criticized for some of its provisions, such as mandatory minimum sentencing, and its impact on mass incarceration, particularly of Black men. As\u00a0we have written, the trend of increasing imprisonment began well before 1994, but experts told us the 1994 law exacerbated the issue.", "As\u00a0we have written, it was actually Hillary Clinton who used the phrase \u201csuper-predator\u201d in a 1996 speech\u00a0at New Hampshire\u2019s Keene State College in support of the 1994 crime bill, which was signed by her husband, then-President Bill Clinton.", "\u201cThey are not just gangs of kids anymore,\u201d\u00a0Clinton said. \u201cThey are often the kinds of kids that are called \u2018superpredators.\u2019 No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\u201d", "Interestingly, Trump often criticized Clinton during her 2016 presidential bid for using that term, and Clinton has\u00a0since acknowledged, \u201cLooking back, I shouldn\u2019t have used those words, and I wouldn\u2019t use them today.\u201d", "Speaking in favor of the crime bill in an impassioned\u00a0speech from the floor of the Senate in 1993, Biden used the term \u201cpredator\u201d in much the same context that Clinton used the term \u201csuper-predator.\u201d", "\u201cWe have predators on our streets that society has in fact, in part because of its neglect, created,\u201d Biden said, adding that many of them are \u201cbeyond the pale,\u201d and that \u201cwe have an obligation to cordon them off from the rest of society.\u201d", "But Biden is also correct that in Trump\u2019s 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d Trump\u00a0warned\u00a0of a coming crime wave and commented, \u201cNo, the problem isn\u2019t that we have too many people locked up. It\u2019s that we don\u2019t have enough criminals locked up.\u201d", "Meeting with Kim Jong Un.\u00a0Trump repeated his\u00a0unsubstantiated claim\u00a0that the Obama administration \u201ctried to meet with\u201d North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un but \u201che wouldn\u2019t do it.
