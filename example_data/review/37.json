The tweet drew the ire of outlets like The Christian Post and Breitbart.", "The tweet was deleted not long after it was posted, but an archived version shows that the tweet stated: \u201cIT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO TOP OUR TOPPER,\u201d with the hashtag #ProAbortion, #Abortions, and #Christmas.", "According to the Christian Post, this tree was put up in an abortion clinic.

As of this writing, he had removed CARE from his Twitter bio, and changed his Twitter handle.", "However, there is no clear evidence that this Christmas tree was put up at an abortion clinic.
