["About this rating", "On 12 January 2016, Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis was one of many individuals in attendance at President Obama's final \"State of the Union\" address. \u00a0Davis, who became nationally known over her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples following the Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges\u00a0decision, was the subject of a\u00a0Free Wood Post\u00a0article titled \"President Obama Makes Sure Kim Davis Surrounded By Same-Sex Couples At SOTU\":", "After Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis was invited to the State of the Union by some Republican putz who clearly thinks purposefully disobeying the United States Constitution is worthy of an invite, President Obama has made sure she doesn\u2019t forget her crime of refusing to treat everyone equally under the law.", "Surrounding Davis will be four happily married same-sex couples who were married in Kentucky.

(She\u00a0was.) Davis last made headlines when she \"met with the Pope\" during his 2015 visit to the United States.\u00a0 Later, it emerged that Davis was one of \"several\u00a0dozen\" people\u00a0at a mass meet-and-greet, and that she hadn't been granted a face-to-face Papal visit. She acquired her\u00a0ticket to the event under similarly confusing circumstances:", "Late Tuesday night, ahead of the president\u2019s address, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the leader of the House Freedom Caucus, came forward, saying that his office had provided Davis\u2019 ticket to the Family Research Council and Davis.", "The Huffington Post reported that the Ohio Republican did not know that his ticket went to Davis until after her announcement, and initially knew only that it was going to the Family Research Council.", "\u201cOur staff heard from the Family Research Council that Ms. Davis and her family hoped to attend the State of the Union address and so we offered a ticket,\u201d Jordan told ABC News in a statement later on Tuesday.", "Clearly, people\u00a0were confused about Davis' presence at the address, and\u00a0Free Wood Post's article exacerbated that confusion.
