["Pupils who both attend grammar schools and are entitled to free school meals represent one out of every thousand pupils generally.", "Correct.", "\u201cJust one in every thousand pupils is a child on free school meals in a grammar school\u201d.", "Lucy Powell MP, 19 October 2016", "It\u2019s worth studying this claim carefully. Ms Powell isn\u2019t saying that only one in every 1,000\u00a0grammar school pupils is on free school meals.
