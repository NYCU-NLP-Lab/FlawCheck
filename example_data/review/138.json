["When The Globe and Mail, one of Canada\u2019s top newspapers, was late to reach certain kiosks in Ottawa and Quebec on Saturday, October 5, several online sources began to attribute the cause of the delay to a gag order from Trudeau\u2019s office aimed at suppressing a sex scandal involving the prime minister and a former student.", "The Buffalo Chronicle, a US based online media known to peddle fabricated stories involving Canadian politics, went on to assert that The Globe story on the hypothetical Trudeau scandal never made it to press because of pressure on the investigation\u2019s main source.", "Together, the two articles were shared more than 10,000 times, according to CrowdTangle, a social media monitering tool.", "The claim that an injunction prevented The Globe from going to press on Saturday is false. Lanna Crucefix, communications manager for the newspaper, told AFP in an email that \u201cthere is no injunction against The Globe.\u201d", "She specified that \u201cthe Globe had technical press delays in the Montreal area plant,\u201d which prints The Globe for the Ottawa and Quebec markets.", "Patricia Lemoine, a spokesperson for Transcontinental, the company in charge of printing The Globe in those areas, confirmed to AFP in an email that \u201cthere was indeed technical breakage in our Transcontinental Transmag plant in Anjou,\u201d a Montreal borough on the city\u2019s eastern end.", "Lemoine confirmed that the technical failure occurred during the night of Friday October 4 to Saturday October 5, and that it was the cause of The Globe\u2019s publication delay in the areas it services on October 5.", "On Twitter, several photos show that The Globe did reach newsstands on time in other parts of the country. Some readers called out the rumour of an injunction as false, posting piles of newspaper as proof.", "No evidence supports claims of a sex scandal involving Trudeau during his time as a teacher at West Point Grey Academy, a private school in Vancouver where the prime minister worked in the early 2000-2001.", "At a campaign meeting on the morning of October 4 in Quebec City, Globe journalist Marieke Walsh asked Trudeau about \u201cunfounded rumours\u201d regarding his departure from his teaching position in 2001. Trudeau, who is seeking re-election on October 21, replied that he had simply \u201cmoved on\u201d from the teaching job. Pressed by Walsh about whether he signed a non-disclosure agreement with the school, Trudeau said no.", "Later that day, Warren Kinsella, a columnist at the Toronto Sun, a tabloid newspaper, began to indirectly suggest on Twitter that the Globe\u2019s October 5 edition may reveal the reason of Trudeau\u2019s departure from his teaching position. A few hours later, blogger James DiFiore suggested that Trudeau was fired from West Point Grey Academy for sleeping with a student, without mentioning sources or proof.", "When The Globe\u2019s Saturday edition did not reveal anything related to Trudeau\u2019s time as a teacher, several Twitter accounts and Facebook pages suggested the absence of a sex scandal in the paper\u2019s pages was due to an injunction from the government, inferences which Kinsella encouraged on Twitter. These social media posts were shared thousands of times.", "The still-unfounded rumour culminated with a press release sent to journalist on Monday, October 7 by the Conservative Party of Canada, in which the party demands to know the reasons of Trudeau\u2019s departure from the school in 2001, without mentioning any scandal.", "An October 4 tweet revealing an email from Clive Austin, the West Point Grey Academy principal the year Trudeau left the school, states that Trudeau left the private school in order to eventually return to Montreal to pursue his university studies, and parted on good terms with the school administration.", "For at least two weeks on the campaign, we\u2019ve been hearing murmurs about this, culminating in colleague @MariekeWalsh asking Justin Trudeau a question today.
