{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel airport in Ahmedabad has been changed to Adani Airports, when in fact, the name of the airport has not been changed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no news reports or official statements claiming that the name of the airport has been altered.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the addition of \"Adani | Airports\" on billboards at the airport signifies a change in the airport's name, when it is actually a representation of the Adani Group's involvement in the development and maintenance of the airport.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Airport Authority of India (AAI) handed over the operations of the airport to Adani, but the name of the airport remains the same.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the addition of \"Adani | Airports\" on billboards is a branding strategy by the Adani Group, rather than a change in the airport's name."}
