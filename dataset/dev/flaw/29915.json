{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that \"most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a study by the Guttmacher Institute, but it does not provide any specific details or data from the study to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of contraception by most women, including Catholic women, is a widely accepted and practiced behavior. However, this assumption may not be universally true, as there may be cultural, religious, or personal beliefs that influence women's decisions regarding contraception.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may influence the reported statistic. It does not explore other possible reasons for the reported high usage of contraception among women, such as access to healthcare, education, or socioeconomic factors.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the percentage of Catholic women who have used contraception. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a study by the Guttmacher Institute, which could imply that the actual percentage may be higher than 98 percent.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear if the claim contradicts any specific facts, as the expert's verdict does not provide any information regarding factual inaccuracies in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the prevalence of contraception use among women, especially by stating that \"most women\" have used contraception. Without specific data or evidence, it is difficult to determine the extent of exaggeration.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not provide any information indicating that the claim falters at times or is inconsistent in its presentation of information."}
