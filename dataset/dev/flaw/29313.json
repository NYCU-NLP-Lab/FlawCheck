{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential for the Massive Ordnance Air Blast to release toxic radiation into the atmosphere on a global scale. The expert's verdict states that the bomb is not radioactive and that the U.S. government cannot be trusted to reveal the true content of its bombs, but it does not provide evidence to support the claim that the bomb can release toxic radiation globally.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that the Massive Ordnance Air Blast is capable of releasing toxic radiation into the atmosphere on a global scale. The expert's verdict mentions that the bomb is not radioactive and that the U.S. government has been caught lying about the content of its bombs, but it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Massive Ordnance Air Blast is capable of releasing toxic radiation into the atmosphere on a global scale. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or information to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the Massive Ordnance Air Blast is a conventional bomb without any radioactive materials, as mentioned in the expert's verdict. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that the bomb can release toxic radiation globally."}
