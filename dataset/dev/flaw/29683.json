{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Chris Murphy's salary by stating that he was \"raking in $1 million in salary\" when in reality lawmakers are paid $174,000 a year.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using an unorthodox way of calculating salary, adding up multiple years of earnings and presenting it as a single year's salary.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to justify the statement that Chris Murphy was earning $1 million in salary. The evidence provided only shows cumulative earnings over a six-year period.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cumulative earnings over a six-year period can be considered as an individual's annual salary, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim is using the term \"salary\" loosely to refer to cumulative earnings, rather than the traditional definition of a fixed regular payment."}
