{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people working in the United States by stating that it is the highest ever, when in fact there have been multiple instances in the past where more people were employed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that there are more people working in the United States than ever before.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in employment is solely due to the regulatory and other reforms implemented by the Trump administration, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the increase in employment, such as the steady job growth that has been happening since early 2010, as stated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics."}
