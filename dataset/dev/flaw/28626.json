{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of Americans who are in jail solely because they are too poor to pay bail. The expert's verdict states that the number provided by Lieu is an overestimate and that no accurate count exists.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the specific number of 450,000 Americans. The expert's verdict mentions that the statistic Lieu is referring to is not nationally kept and that there is no way to fully verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 450,000 Americans mentioned are in jail solely because they are too poor to pay bail. The expert's verdict clarifies that the statistic includes various groups of people in jail before trial for different reasons, not just those who can't afford bail.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for why people are in jail before trial, aside from being too poor to pay bail."}
