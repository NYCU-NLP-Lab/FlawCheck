{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of new regulations added by President Obama in one day. The expert's verdict states that the pages published in the Federal Register were not indicative of the number of new regulations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that President Obama added a record 572 pages of new regulations in one day. The expert's verdict explains that the interpretation of page counts in the Federal Register as measures of total regulatory burden is unreliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an increase in the number of pages in the Federal Register equates to the addition of new regulations. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the Federal Register includes various types of documents, not all of which are associated with new regulations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the increase in pages published in the Federal Register could be attributed to non-regulatory activities, such as presidential documents and notices, rather than solely new regulations. This presents an alternative explanation to the claim's assertion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the pages published in the Federal Register on the specified date were not necessarily indicative of new regulations, as explained by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or expert's verdict faltering at times."}
