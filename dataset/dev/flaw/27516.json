{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"more than 100 years of natural gas\" may be an exaggeration as it is based on the Potential Gas Committee's estimate, which includes both proved reserves and technically recoverable natural gas.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on the estimate provided by the Potential Gas Committee, which is financially supported by the natural gas industry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the technically recoverable natural gas can be economically viable and extracted using current technology, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The United States Geological Survey and the Minerals Management Survey provide a different estimate of technically recoverable natural gas, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations and differing opinions on the available supply."}
