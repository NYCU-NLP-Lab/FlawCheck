{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the rights given to homeless people by stating that they have more rights than property owners. The expert's verdict clarifies that the policy does not regulate private property but allows camping in public areas bordering private property as long as certain conditions are met.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the policy does not allow homeless camps on private property, as clarified by the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate its assertion that homeless people have more rights than property owners. The expert's verdict provides information about the actual policy and its limitations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that allowing homeless camps on public sidewalks and business frontage is inherently giving more rights to homeless people than property owners. However, this assumption is not supported by the expert's verdict, which explains the specific conditions and restrictions of the policy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the policy change, such as addressing the issue of homelessness and finding alternative solutions. The expert's verdict mentions that the policy was adopted due to an influx of people staying in public places and that it aims to shift the focus of law enforcement from activities to conduct."}
