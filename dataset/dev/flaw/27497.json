{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of windmills in the Texas power grid, stating that it became \"totally reliant\" on windmills, which is not supported by the evidence. Wind energy only accounts for 10% of the winter energy supply in the Texas power grid.", "Understate": "The claim understates the role of other energy sources, such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear, in the outage. The failure of these sources played a larger role in the outage than wind energy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Green New Deal played a role in the outage. Experts strongly pushed back on this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Green New Deal was in effect in Texas and that it caused the reliance on windmills. However, the Green New Deal did not pass the House and would have been a non-binding resolution without the power of law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the outage, such as the failure of gas-fired plants and coal-fired plants due to freezing temperatures. The frozen windmills were not the sole cause of the outage."}
