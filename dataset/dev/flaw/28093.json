{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it states that \"all Maryland crabs are born in Virginia\" without providing sufficient evidence or support.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that all Maryland crabs are born in Virginia. The evidence provided only suggests that blue crabs mate in the middle of the bay and that the moment of conception and birth often occur in Virginia, but it does not specifically state that all bay crabs are born in Virginia.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the birthplace of a crab determines its origin, without considering other factors such as where the crab spends the majority of its life or where it is harvested.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that while crabs may be born in Virginia, they could still be considered Maryland crabs if they spend a significant portion of their life in Maryland waters or are harvested in Maryland.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it does not provide a clear and definitive answer to the question of whether all Maryland crabs are born in Virginia. The experts' statements indicate that the governor's claim is \"essentially correct,\" but also mention the possibility of crabs giving birth in Maryland under certain conditions, such as during droughts."}
