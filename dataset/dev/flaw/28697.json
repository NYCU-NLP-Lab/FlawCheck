{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the reduction in the number of tests from 17 to 8, as the Texas Education Agency spokesperson stated that the intended cut was from 17 to 11, not 8.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a commentary by state Rep. Jason Isaac and is not backed up by concrete evidence or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in testing will eliminate the overtesting of students in grades 3-8. However, the Texas Education Agency spokesperson mentioned that the reduction would only apply to students who performed well on exams, indicating that not all students would be affected.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim mentions that a federal waiver is needed for the changes to take place, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the reduction in testing, such as federal requirements set in place by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001."}
