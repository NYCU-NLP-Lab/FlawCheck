{"Lack enough support": "The claim of creating 1,525 direct jobs does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the number of jobs created.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 1,525 jobs were solely created as a result of the Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail Transit Project, without considering any alternative factors or influences.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the numbers have been revised, indicating a potential inconsistency or lack of accuracy in the claim.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim may be understating the actual number of jobs created, as it only focuses on direct jobs and does not account for indirect or induced job creation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict raises questions about whether the jobs would not have existed without the light rail project, suggesting the possibility of alternative explanations for the job creation."}
