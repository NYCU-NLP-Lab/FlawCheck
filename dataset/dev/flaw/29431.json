{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the incident by stating that the brother and sister were attacked by \"members of peaceful community\" and that they were beaten up mercilessly. There is no evidence provided to support these exaggerated claims.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify the incident or the identities of the perpetrators. It is based on a video that is being circulated on social media without any additional corroborating information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the victims were members of the Hindu community based on the slogan \"Jaago Hindu Jaago\" mentioned in the claim. This assumption is problematic as there is no evidence or context provided to support it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the incident, but the claim does not explore or provide any other possibilities. It immediately jumps to blaming a specific community without considering other factors or motives behind the attack.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts facts by stating that the brother resisted \"people belonging to the peaceful community\" from sexually assaulting his sister. However, there is no evidence or information provided to support this claim or confirm the motive behind the attack.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making sweeping generalizations about an entire community based on the actions of a few individuals. It uses derogatory language and stereotypes to refer to the Muslim community as the \"peaceful community,\" which is a biased and unfair characterization.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the provided claim."}
