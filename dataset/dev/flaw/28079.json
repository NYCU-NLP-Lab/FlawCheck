{"Exaggerate": "The claim of doubling the size of the company may be seen as an exaggeration, as the growth in revenue was a little bit more than double.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only focuses on the increase in revenue and does not provide information about other metrics such as market share or profitability.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that doubling the size of the company in terms of revenue is the only measure of success, disregarding other factors that contribute to the overall performance of a company.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The growth in revenue can be attributed to the major acquisition of Compaq, rather than solely to the leadership of Carly Fiorina."}
