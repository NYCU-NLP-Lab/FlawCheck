{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of students living in poverty in Cleveland public schools. The expert's verdict mentions that if the claim were true, all but about 13 students in the district would be considered poor, which seems like a stretch given the poverty rates in the city.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that 99.97 percent of the kids attending Cleveland public schools live in poverty. The expert's verdict mentions that the school district does not recall providing such an exact percentage, and the Ohio Department of Education also states that the numbers are not exact.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that poverty is the sole factor influencing the academic performance of students in Cleveland public schools. While poverty may be a significant factor, there could be other factors contributing to the academic struggles in the district.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the poverty situation in Cleveland public schools. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim seems to be a stretch, considering the poverty rates in the city and the district's student population.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the academic performance of students in Cleveland public schools. The expert's verdict mentions that there could be other factors besides poverty that contribute to the subpar academic performance."}
