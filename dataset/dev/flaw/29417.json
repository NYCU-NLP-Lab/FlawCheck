{"Understate": "The claim understates Will Hurd's actual stance on a border-long U.S.-Mexico wall, as he has expressed that it is not the most effective way to do border security.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Will Hurd unequivocally supports a border-long U.S.-Mexico wall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Will Hurd's statement of \"A wall absolutely makes sense\" refers to a border-long U.S.-Mexico wall, when in fact he was referring to heavily populated areas.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that Will Hurd's support for a wall is limited to heavily populated areas, rather than a border-long wall."}
