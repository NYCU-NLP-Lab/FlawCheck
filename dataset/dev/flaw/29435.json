{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the paper referenced in the claim was not peer-reviewed and did not constitute a study. The conclusions drawn from the paper were also described as shaky and unsupported.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that higher rates of gun ownership directly cause lower crime rates, which is a problematic assumption.

The expert's verdict suggests that the conclusions drawn from the paper were not well-supported.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing specific details about the study it references. The expert's verdict mentions that the article based on the study did not lead with the name of the study or provide a direct link to it.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the paper referenced was not a peer-reviewed study and its conclusions were described as shaky and unsupported. The expert's verdict provides evidence to contradict the claim's assertion of a proven correlation between gun ownership and crime rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the correlation between gun ownership and crime rates. The expert's verdict does not provide alternative explanations either.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations and flaws of the paper it references. The expert's verdict highlights that the paper was not peer-reviewed and misrepresented separate research."}
