{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that there are 24 states with voter ID or comparable restrictions, while the expert's verdict suggests that the definition of \"restrictions\" can vary and may not solely be limited to voter ID laws.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of providing specific evidence or data to back up the statement that there were only two states with such restrictions before Barack Obama was elected.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between the election of Barack Obama and the increase in voter ID or comparable restrictions. However, the expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in these restrictions, such as changing demographics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the increase in voter ID or comparable restrictions may not solely be attributed to the election of Barack Obama, but also to broader demographic changes and debates over voting rights.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in accurately representing the number of states with voter ID or comparable restrictions, as the expert's verdict indicates that the definition and categorization of these restrictions can vary.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and controversy surrounding voter ID laws and restrictions, as the expert's verdict highlights the ongoing debate over whether these rules are being used to exclude certain groups from voting.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear if the claim contradicts any specific factual information, as the provided information focuses more on the expert's verdict and the context surrounding the claim rather than directly addressing any factual inaccuracies."}
