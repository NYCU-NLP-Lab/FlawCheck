{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerated because it describes protesters throwing cans and bags of soup at police officers, which may seem unusual or extreme.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that protesters were actually throwing cans and bags of soup at police officers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the protesters are \"anarchists\" without providing sufficient evidence or justification for this categorization.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the violence and alleged assaults on police officers during the protests, such as the presence of agitators or individuals seeking to incite violence rather than genuine protesters."}
