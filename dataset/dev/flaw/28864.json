{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the nature of the crimes permitted in the show by stating that rape and murder are allowed. The expert's verdict clarifies that while contestants may sign waivers acknowledging the possibility of being raped or killed, the rules also state that police are free to arrest anyone who commits a crime on the show.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that crimes committed in the course of the show are prosecutable, as stated in the expert's verdict. The show does not actually permit contestants to commit crimes without consequences.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that the show permits rape and murder. The expert's verdict provides evidence from multiple sources, including the show's official ad and interviews with the show's creator, which clarify that crimes committed on the show are not allowed and will result in arrest.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make the problematic assumption that the show allows contestants to commit crimes, including rape and murder, without considering the legal and ethical implications. The expert's verdict highlights that the show's rules clearly state that crimes are not permitted and will lead to arrest.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There does not appear to be an alternative explanation bias in this claim, as the expert's verdict and available information do not suggest any alternative interpretation of the claim."}
