{"Falters at times": "The claim that \"I am a candidate. I have not withdrawn\" falters at times because the expert's investigation reveals that Mike Gravel is not on the ballot in most of the upcoming Democratic nominating contests and has zero delegates and minimal campaign support.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's investigation shows that Mike Gravel has virtually no fundraising and a small campaign staff.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being on the ballot in just one of the 10 remaining contests is sufficient evidence to support the candidacy, which can be seen as a problematic assumption given the lack of support and recognition for Mike Gravel's campaign.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that Mike Gravel is a candidate, as the expert's investigation reveals that he is pursuing candidacy with the Libertarian Party rather than the Democratic Party."}
