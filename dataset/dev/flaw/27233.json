{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of veterans who won't receive healthcare due to Perry's rejection of Medicaid expansion. The claim states that there are 40,000 veterans in Texas who won't receive healthcare, but it is not clear if this number is accurate or if it is an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that 40,000 veterans won't receive healthcare. The evidence provided is based on a study by the Urban Institute, but it is not clear if this study specifically addresses the impact of Perry's rejection of Medicaid expansion on veterans' healthcare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rejection of Medicaid expansion by Perry is the sole reason for veterans not receiving healthcare. It does not take into account other factors that may contribute to veterans not receiving healthcare, such as eligibility requirements or access to healthcare facilities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why veterans in Texas are not receiving healthcare, other than Perry's rejection of Medicaid expansion. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and solely attributes it to Perry's decision.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Perry has altered his stance on Medicaid expansion and directed the state health commission to seek alternative funding and criteria for determining eligibility. This suggests that the claim may not accurately reflect the current situation regarding veterans' healthcare in Texas.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact of Perry's rejection of Medicaid expansion on veterans' healthcare. Without further evidence or analysis, it is difficult to determine the full extent of the impact on veterans' access to healthcare."}
