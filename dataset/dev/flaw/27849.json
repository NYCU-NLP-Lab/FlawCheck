{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the death rate increase among white working-class men as being 20 percent, while the expert's verdict states that the actual increase is 7.8 percent.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by attributing the death rate increase solely to unemployment and resentment, without considering other factors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the specific statistic of a 20 percent increase in death rates among white men.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in death rates among white working-class men is the sole reason for resentment among Trump supporters, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the increase in death rates is not limited to white men but also applies to white non-Hispanics in general, and it is primarily seen among those with a high school education or less. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's focus on white working-class men specifically."}
