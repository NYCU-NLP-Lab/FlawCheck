{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as there is no credible evidence or official announcement provided to verify the imposition of a lockdown in Maharashtra from March 1 to 15.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the screenshot of a graphic plate from TV9 Marathi is genuine and accurately represents the announcement made by CM Uddhav Thackeray. However, there is evidence suggesting that the image may have been edited or manipulated.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a nationwide lockdown was imposed for the first time on March 25 last year, which raises doubts about the accuracy of the information provided in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the screenshots may have been edited using other TV9 broadcasts, which casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting conflicting information regarding the severity of the lockdown in Maharashtra. While it mentions a strict 15-day lockdown, it also states that the lockdown will not be as strict as previous lockdowns and night curfews will be in place.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the extent of the lockdown in Maharashtra by only mentioning a partial lockdown and not providing comprehensive information on the restrictions and measures implemented.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim as it does not make any exaggerated or sensationalized statements."}
