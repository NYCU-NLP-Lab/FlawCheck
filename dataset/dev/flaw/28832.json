{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that winning unaffiliated voters in every general election since 2010 is a significant achievement for Republicans, without considering other factors that may have influenced the election results.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Republicans have consistently won unaffiliated voters in every general election since 2010. The expert's verdict mentions exit polls and other polls, but it does not provide specific data or statistics to back up this claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no way to determine how individual unaffiliated voters cast their ballots due to the secrecy of the voting process. This suggests that the claim may falter in terms of providing concrete evidence for the assertion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the Republicans' success in recent statewide election results, such as changes in demographics, campaign strategies, or other factors that may have influenced voter behavior.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of unaffiliated voters in recent elections by simply stating that Republicans have won them without providing further analysis or context. It does not explore the potential impact of unaffiliated voters on election outcomes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact mentioned in the expert's verdict that the number of unaffiliated voters in North Carolina has surpassed the number of registered Republicans, indicating that Republicans may not have consistently won unaffiliated voters in every general election since 2010."}
