{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that \"over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care,\" without providing concrete evidence or specific time frame for these deaths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement that over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 300,000 deaths were directly caused by waiting for care, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the deaths.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the deaths of the veterans, such as pre-existing health conditions or other factors unrelated to waiting for care. The claim does not consider these possibilities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the report by the VA's Office of Inspector General states that the record-keeping system is inadequate, making it difficult to determine how many of the 307,000 individuals were actually waiting for care when they died.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim may actually understate the number of veterans who have died waiting for care, as the report mentions that the VA's record-keeping system is so shoddy that the actual number cannot be determined accurately."}
