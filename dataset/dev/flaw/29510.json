{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Joel Osteen was \"horrified\" at recently learning about Jesus' crucifixion. The evidence provided in the expert's verdict suggests that this is not a factual representation of Osteen's reaction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a satirical article from the Babylon Bee, which is known for publishing fictional stories.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joel Osteen was unaware of Jesus' crucifixion, which is not supported by any factual evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim is a satirical piece meant to criticize Osteen's teachings and beliefs, rather than presenting factual information."}
