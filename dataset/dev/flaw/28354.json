{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that President Obama \"ordered\" the school to allow a transgender boy to use the girls' locker room. The expert's verdict clarifies that the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights found evidence of non-compliance with Title IX requirements, but it does not mention an explicit order from President Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the transgender student in question is a \"mentally ill boy\" and refers to them using derogatory language. This assumption is not supported by the expert's verdict, which focuses on the school's failure to comply with Title IX requirements.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion that President Obama ordered the school to allow a transgender boy to use the girls' locker room. The expert's verdict provides information about the investigation and findings, but does not mention any specific order from the president.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a biased interpretation of the situation by suggesting that the purpose of Title IX was to force young women to look at the genitals of mentally ill boys. This alternative explanation is not supported by the expert's verdict, which focuses on the school's non-compliance with Title IX requirements.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the investigation and findings by not providing a clear explanation of the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights' determination of non-compliance with Title IX. However, this bias is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
