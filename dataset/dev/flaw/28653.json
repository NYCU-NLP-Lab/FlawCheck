{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"liberals at the University of Texas called for masculinity to be designated a mental illness.\" This is not true according to the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on misleading and sensationalist reports from right-wing and libertarian commentators.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the program at the University of Texas aimed to treat masculinity as a mental health issue, which is not the case according to the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the emphasis on \"mental health\" in the reports stemmed from the fact that the program was initiated by the Counselling and Mental Health Center, not because masculinity was being designated as a mental illness."}
