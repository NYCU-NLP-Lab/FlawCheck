{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it implies that Wisconsin passed one of the first COVID-19 bills in the entire country, which is contradicted by the fact that 36 states and territories had already adopted or enacted 174 COVID-19-related measures before Wisconsin's relief package was signed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that Wisconsin passed one of the first COVID-19 bills in the entire country.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the claim is based on a misunderstanding or lack of awareness of the COVID-19-related measures already adopted by other states and territories before Wisconsin's relief package.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered an understatement because it fails to acknowledge the significant number of COVID-19-related measures already enacted by other states and territories before Wisconsin's relief package.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that passing a COVID-19 bill empowers Governor Evers to act, but the expert's verdict mentions that Evers already had the authority to declare health emergencies, issue orders, and spend federal aid before the pandemic hit. Therefore, the assumption that the bill empowered Evers may be problematic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that 36 states and territories had already adopted or enacted 174 COVID-19-related measures before Wisconsin's relief package was signed, indicating that Wisconsin was not one of the first states to pass such a bill."}
