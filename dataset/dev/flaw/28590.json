{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in congressional salaries over the last 30 years by stating it as 231%, which is higher than the actual salary increases approved in that period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that congressional salaries have gone up 231% over the last 30 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the request for a $4,500 raise by Congress is unjustified, without providing evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the request for a raise, such as inflation or changes in the cost of living.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the financial struggles of Americans by stating that 80% of Americans haven't been able to keep up with the cost of living, while a 2017 report suggests that 78% of full-time workers live paycheck-to-paycheck.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by inaccurately stating that Congress voted to give itself a pay raise in 2018, when it actually did not.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that congressional salaries have not increased since 2009, which is different from the assertion of a continuous increase over the last 30 years."}
