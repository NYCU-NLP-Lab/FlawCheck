{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential raise for teachers by stating it would result in an average $10,000 raise, while the state's salary schedule shows a lower range of salaries for teachers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the proposed increase in teacher salaries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that directing more of the education budget to teacher salaries would automatically result in a $10,000 raise for teachers, without considering other factors or potential limitations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the expert's verdict, stating that while Dan Patrick talked about directing more funds to teacher salaries, he did not make a proposal affecting state spending overseen by lawmakers."}
