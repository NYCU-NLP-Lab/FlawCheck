{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of the school budget that is paid by local property taxes, stating it as 80 percent when it is actually 11 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funding of the school district is primarily reliant on local property taxes, which is not the case as the majority of the funding comes from state aid, grants, and entitlements.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Newark is paying 80 percent of the school budget from local property taxes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that local taxes account for only 11 percent of the Newark Public Schools' overall budget.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim may be based on a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the budget documents, as acknowledged by the state senator who made the claim."}
