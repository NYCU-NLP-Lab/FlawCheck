{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the negative impact of NAFTA on farmers by stating that they have been \"hurt so badly\" over a 15-year period.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that agricultural export values actually increased under the Obama administration, despite a decrease in the last two years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that farmers have been significantly hurt due to NAFTA.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in farm income and agricultural exports in the last two years of the previous administration was solely due to NAFTA, without considering other factors such as declining commodity prices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the decline in farm income and agricultural exports, such as changing market conditions and global economic factors."}
