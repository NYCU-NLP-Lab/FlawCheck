{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that FBI director Jim Comey placed a \"Trump/Pence 2016\" sign in front of his home. The provided evidence only shows that there was a sign outside of a house owned by Comey, but it does not establish who placed the sign there.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the presence of the \"Trump/Pence 2016\" sign. The expert highlights that it is unclear whether Comey had anything to do with the sign, suggesting that someone else may have placed it there.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the uncertainty surrounding the situation. The expert points out that it is unclear whether Comey still lives at the house and whether he had any involvement with the sign. This uncertainty is not fully reflected in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the ownership of the house in question has been on the market since June 2015. This raises doubts about whether Comey still lives at the house and therefore undermines the claim that he placed the sign there.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information that is not directly relevant to the assertion that Comey placed the sign. The expert mentions Comey's controversial role in the 2016 presidential election and his decisions regarding the investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails, which are not directly related to the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of the \"Trump/Pence 2016\" sign in front of Comey's house indicates his support for the candidates. However, this assumption is not supported by the evidence provided and is open to interpretation."}
