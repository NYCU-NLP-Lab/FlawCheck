{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the last income tax increase in Illinois by stating that it led to the largest exodus of middle-income families. The available data does not support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to prove the correlation between the last income tax increase and the exodus of middle-income families.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately referencing the specific tax increase it is referring to, as well as the income group affected (middle-income vs. low-income).", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the exodus of middle-income families is directly caused by the income tax increase, without considering other factors that could contribute to population changes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the exodus of middle-income families, such as economic factors, job opportunities, or cost of living, which are not addressed in the claim."}
