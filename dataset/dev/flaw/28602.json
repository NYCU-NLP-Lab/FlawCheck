{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the resemblance between a 12-week-old fetus and a full-term child.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it provides a hand-painted resin doll as an inaccurate depiction of a 12-week-old fetus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that showing a doll resembling a full-term child will educate women about what a 12-week-old fetus looks like, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents alternative explanations by mentioning the controversy surrounding the dolls and their distribution by a pro-life group."}
