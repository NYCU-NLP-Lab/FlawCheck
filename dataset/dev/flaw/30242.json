{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of tests that were promised by Matt Hancock. It states that he said there would be 25,000 tests a day by mid-April, but the current number is under 15,000.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of tests that were actually achieved. It mentions that 10,000 tests a day were achieved by the end of March, but it fails to mention that this was the goal set by the government.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the statement. It mentions the current number of tests, but does not provide additional evidence or data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that missing the target for the number of tests is a failure on the part of Matt Hancock and the government. However, it does not consider any potential challenges or obstacles that may have affected the ability to meet the target.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference between the promised and actual number of tests. It does not explore any potential reasons or factors that may have contributed to the gap."}
