{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the problem by stating that dead people received $1 billion in benefits in 2018 alone. The expert's verdict mentions that the improper payments for \"failure to verify death data\" added up to about $966 million, which is slightly below the claim's figure.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing enough context or explanation for the improper payments. The expert's verdict mentions that improper payments in 2018 amounted to about $151 billion, but it does not clarify how much of that is specifically attributed to dead people receiving benefits.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the $1 billion figure for benefits received by dead people. The expert's verdict provides some information on improper payments related to failure to verify death data, but it does not directly address the specific claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all improper payments related to \"failure to verify death data\" are payments made to dead people. The expert's verdict highlights that the category includes instances where the government fails to check if people are dead, but not necessarily that all of them are actually deceased.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Medicare and Medicaid payments are made to healthcare providers, not the beneficiaries. This suggests that the improper payments related to failure to verify death data may be due to errors or lack of verification on the part of the government, rather than intentional payments to dead individuals."}
