{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that leaked medical records, combined with viral images and videos, prove that Hillary Clinton is suffering from subcortical vascular dementia and has only one year to live. There is no concrete evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on forged medical records that were anonymously leaked online. The actual medical assessment of Clinton by her physician does not indicate any ongoing health conditions apart from hypothyroidism and seasonal allergies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton has vascular dementia without any factual basis. It proceeds from a false premise and attempts to use photographs and videos to support the assumption, which have been misused in the past to make similar claims about Clinton's health.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for Clinton's \"medical episode\" and subsequent diagnosis of pneumonia is provided, indicating that the claim's assumption of vascular dementia is unfounded.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the leaked medical documents are false and not based on any medical facts, as confirmed by Clinton's personal physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on conspiracy theories and apocalyptic prophecies from a YouTube channel specializing in such content, which undermines its credibility.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
