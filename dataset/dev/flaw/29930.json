{"Exaggerate": "The claim of a \"100% coronavirus test rate\" after the Trump Tulsa rally is an exaggeration. The actual data shows that not all tests came back positive.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all tests conducted in Oklahoma after the rally were positive.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misinterpretation of data by MSNBC host Chris Hayes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high number of positive tests immediately after the rally is solely due to the event, without considering other factors or the lag in reporting data.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a misleading headline that was later corrected.", "Alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the high number of positive tests, which is the lag in reporting data by the Oklahoma State Department of Health."}
