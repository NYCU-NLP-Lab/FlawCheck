{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the December 2020 findings were not a result of new research, but rather an editorial review of peer-reviewed research. This suggests that the claim may lack enough support from new and original research.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim assumes that the age at which alcohol is consumed is the primary factor influencing brain harm, while the amount of alcohol consumed may have a greater influence. This suggests a problematic assumption in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there may be other factors influencing brain harm in addition to age, such as the frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the observed effects on the brain.", "Exaggerate": "The claim states that alcohol may be most harmful to the human brain at three specific ages, implying a higher level of harm compared to other ages. However, the expert's verdict mentions that more research is needed to determine the extent of alcohol's negative effects at different points in life. This suggests a possible exaggeration in the claim.", "Understate": "It is not mentioned in the expert's verdict that the claim contradicts any fact or falters at times. Therefore, it can be inferred that these biases do not exist in the provided claim."}
