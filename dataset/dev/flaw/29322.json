{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the average age of newly appointed circuit court judges by stating that they are \"young, smart\" and 10 years younger than President Obama's nominees.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement about the average age of the appointed judges.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being younger and smarter is inherently better for circuit court judges without providing any justification or evidence for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump's judicial nominees have received a higher number of \"Not Qualified\" ratings from the American Bar Association compared to Obama's nominees, suggesting that the claim about the quality of the judges may be inaccurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the difference in average age between Trump's and Obama's nominees, such as the availability of qualified candidates or the priorities of the respective administrations."}
