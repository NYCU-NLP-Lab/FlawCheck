{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that people at Tejashwi Yadav's rally said they will vote for BJP in Bihar elections. The expert's verdict confirms that the video shared by BJP's Priti Gandhi is from last year and does not represent a recent event.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the support for BJP at Tejashwi Yadav's rally. The expert's verdict clarifies that the video clip shared by Priti Gandhi does not reflect the current sentiments of the crowd and is taken out of context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a clipped portion of an ABP News broadcast from last year. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the video is not recent and does not accurately represent the views of the crowd at Tejashwi Yadav's rally.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the crowd at Tejashwi Yadav's rally is only present for entertainment and that their vote is reserved only for PM Narendra Modi. This assumption is not supported by the evidence provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the people in the video clip may have been expressing support for BJP in a different context or for other reasons unrelated to the Bihar elections. The expert's verdict mentions that in the later part of the broadcast, people can be heard stating that they will cast votes for Tejashwi Yadav and advise others to do the same."}
