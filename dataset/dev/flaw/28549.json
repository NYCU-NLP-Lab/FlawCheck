{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of wealth loss and income decline for most Americans during the Obama presidency by stating that \"most\" Americans experienced these negative outcomes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to back up the assertion that most Americans lost wealth and had their incomes fall during the Obama presidency.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causation between the Obama presidency and the alleged wealth and income losses without considering other factors or external influences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for changes in wealth and income, such as the impact of the Great Recession that Obama inherited or the potential benefits of social security and Medicare for lower-income Americans.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that wealth actually increased for most income percentiles during the Obama presidency, as indicated by data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not considering the starting point for measuring wealth changes and by selectively focusing on certain income percentiles to support the argument."}
