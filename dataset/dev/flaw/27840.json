{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Virginia's financial situation by stating that it is \"headed towards another surplus this year, unlike most states.\" The expert's verdict explains that while Virginia may have a surplus, it is not necessarily unique among states in this regard.", "Understate": "The claim understates the challenges faced by Virginia's budget in recent years. The expert's verdict highlights the budget shortfalls and cuts that the state has had to overcome, as well as the use of federal stimulus money to close the gaps.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that Virginia is on track for another surplus. The expert's verdict mentions that the McDonnell administration has not publicly estimated the amount of left-over money it expects, indicating a lack of concrete evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having a surplus is a definitive sign of financial health. However, the expert's verdict points out that Virginia's surplus, even if supplemented by a 2011 windfall, is far smaller than the cuts made in previous years, indicating ongoing financial challenges.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Virginia's potential surplus. The expert's verdict mentions that the use of federal stimulus money and other one-time bookkeeping maneuvers contributed to closing the budget shortfalls, indicating that the surplus may not solely be a result of improved financial management."}
