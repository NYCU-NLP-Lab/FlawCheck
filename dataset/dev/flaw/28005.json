{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Preckwinkle's role in exposing the details of Laquan McDonald's shooting. Critics accused her of politicizing the incident and exaggerating her role for personal gain.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Preckwinkle \"called for the dash cam footage to be released.\" The article states that there is no evidence to support this part of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the city withheld video footage of the shooting for over a year and that it was investigative journalist Jamie Kalven who first broke the story behind the McDonald shooting.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Preckwinkle's role in making the autopsy public was significant enough to be credited for bringing the facts of the shooting to light. This assumption is criticized by opponents and community activists.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why Preckwinkle assisted in revealing the details of the autopsy, such as political motivations or personal connections with Kalven. However, this bias is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
