{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential harmful effect of fidget spinners on the Earth's center of gravity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence or support to back up the assertion made by the respected physicist.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the exponential growth of fidget spinners could throw the Earth's center of gravity out of alignment, without providing a solid basis for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that no amount of human fidget-spinning would have any appreciable effect on the Earth's center of gravity, rotation, or orbit.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the claim is fake news and part of a pattern of fabricated stories by the source.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its scientific reasoning by suggesting that fidget spinners, rotating in unison, could impact the rotation of the Earth without sufficient evidence or scientific consensus."}
