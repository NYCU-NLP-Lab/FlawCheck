{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of Ken Paxton being the only statewide official in the country under indictment, as it fails to consider other potential indicted officials in different states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Ken Paxton is the only statewide official in the country under indictment. The evidence provided only mentions the indictment of Missouri Governor Eric Greitens, but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all statewide officials in the country.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a possibility that there are other statewide officials in the country who are under indictment, but they were not found during the search conducted by the Nelson campaign. The claim does not consider this alternative explanation."}
