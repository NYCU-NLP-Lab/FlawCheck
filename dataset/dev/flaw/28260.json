{"Exaggerate": "It is possible that the claim may be exaggerating the benefits for businesses moving into Wisconsin by stating that they \"don't have to pay any taxes\" on their income for two years. The expert's verdict mentions that the deduction is equal to the amount of income taxes owed, suggesting that it may not be complete tax exemption.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement about businesses not having to pay any taxes for two years. The expert's verdict mentions the deduction available for businesses, but it does not provide further information or data to support or refute the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed law by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker allows businesses moving into Wisconsin to not pay any taxes on their income for two years. However, the expert's verdict mentions the deduction available but does not confirm or refute the claim's assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation bias present in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "Without further evidence or information, it is difficult to determine if the claim contradicts any specific facts. The expert's verdict does not provide clear evidence to contradict the claim but highlights the deduction available for businesses.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times or being inconsistent in the provided information."}
