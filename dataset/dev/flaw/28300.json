{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the difference in spending between Rhode Island and the national average by stating that Rhode Island spends \"52 percent more per capita on human service programs than the national average.\" The expert's verdict provides specific numbers that show a difference of $3,000 per capita, which is less than a 52 percent increase.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the source of the assertion that Rhode Island spends $1.52 for every $1 spent nationally is a presentation developed by the House Finance Committee. However, it does not provide any further details or evidence to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that one area often targeted for budget cuts is spending on human services, implying that there may be an assumption that such spending should be reduced. This assumption may bias the interpretation of the claim and the subsequent analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rhode Island spends more on optional Medicaid services compared to other states. This alternative explanation suggests that the higher per capita spending may be due to the provision of additional services rather than simply being more generous overall."}
