{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money borrowed by Woodrow Wilson for World War I. While the claim states that $30 billion was borrowed, the actual figure is closer to $37 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the money borrowed for World War I has not been paid back. The article states that there are still outstanding Liberty Bonds and Victory Notes, but these instruments have been mature since 1947 and have not earned any interest.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the ongoing interest payments. The article suggests that the interest payments may be related to other debts or financial instruments, but this is not explored further.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the interest payments mentioned are directly linked to the borrowing for World War I. However, the article suggests that there may be other factors or debts involved.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the amount borrowed for World War I, as well as the current status of the outstanding bonds and notes."}
