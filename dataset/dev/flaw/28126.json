{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the requirement for participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding. While it did factor into the application process and provided extra points, it was not a stipulation of winning a grant.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the level of commitment required for states to adopt the Common Core standards. While it was not a strict requirement, it did play a significant role in the grant application process and gave states an advantage if they had adopted the standards.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to conclusively prove that all participating states were required to adopt the Common Core standards. There is evidence that adopting the standards increased the chances of winning a grant, but it is not clear if it was a requirement for all states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that all participating states had to adopt the Common Core standards in order to receive federal funding. The evidence suggests that while it was a factor in the grant application process, it was not a strict requirement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may overlook alternative explanations for why states adopted the Common Core standards. While the grant application process may have influenced some states, it is possible that other factors, such as the desire for educational consistency nationwide, also played a role."}
