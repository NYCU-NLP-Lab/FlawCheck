{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that Donald Trump twisted the excerpts from Hillary Clinton's speeches in some cases, suggesting that he exaggerated the claims made about her wanting \"open borders\" with \"no controls over trade or immigration.\"", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the full speeches given by Clinton are not available, and the Clinton campaign has not confirmed the authenticity of the leaked emails. This lack of complete information may indicate a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict points out that Trump's interpretation of the excerpts is a distortion of what Clinton actually said. This suggests that there may be a problematic assumption made in the claim about Clinton's stance on immigration and trade.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for Clinton's statements, stating that she was talking about free trade between countries of the Western Hemisphere, not immigration policy. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim made about Clinton's stance."}
