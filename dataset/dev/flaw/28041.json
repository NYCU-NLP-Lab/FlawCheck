{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the similarity between Rosie O'Donnell's actions and Dinesh D'Souza's actions by stating that O'Donnell committed the same offense five times, while D'Souza was only prosecuted for it once.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Rosie O'Donnell committed the same offense as Dinesh D'Souza. The expert's verdict states that the two cases are very different.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a double standard in the treatment of D'Souza and O'Donnell, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the backlash to Trump's pardon of Dinesh D'Souza caused complaints of a double standard among conservatives. This alternative explanation implies that the claim's assertion of a double standard may be influenced by political bias."}
