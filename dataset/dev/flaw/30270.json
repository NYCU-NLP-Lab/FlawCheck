{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which carbon emissions are caused by nature by stating that \"94 percent of the carbon emissions...are caused by nature.\" This figure may not be supported by sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that they reached out to the campaign for the source of the 94-percent figure but did not receive a response. This suggests that there may not be enough supporting evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the majority of carbon emissions are caused by nature without providing clear evidence or considering alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for carbon emissions, such as human activities and industrial processes, which are known to contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions."}
