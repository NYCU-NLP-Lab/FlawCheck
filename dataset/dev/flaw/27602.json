{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that Rep. Gibbs \"recklessly caused downgrade, higher interest rates,\" without providing strong evidence or direct causation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only cites articles speculating on the possibility of interest rates increasing, without providing concrete evidence or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rep. Gibbs can be individually blamed for the downgrade and its potential consequences, which may be a problematic assumption as the S&P report did not assign blame or indicate individual responsibility.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the downgrade and higher interest rates, such as the political brinkmanship of both major political parties mentioned in the S&P report.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by giving equal billing to Rep. Gibbs and Speaker Boehner, even though the S&P report did not name individuals or assign specific blame.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the S&P report did not specifically attribute the downgrade and higher interest rates to Rep. Gibbs or any individual."}
