{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that the Boston Marathon bombing is the fifth case where individuals examined by the U.S. government went on to carry out terrorist murders. It implies that this is a common occurrence, which may be an exaggeration of the actual number of cases.", "Understate": "The claim may also be seen as understating the effectiveness of U.S. government officials in preventing terrorist attacks. It suggests that officials frequently fail to identify potential threats, which may be an understatement of their overall success rate in preventing attacks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that U.S. government officials examined individuals and concluded they were no threat before they carried out terrorist murders. It is based on the statement of one individual, Rep. Peter King, without further supporting evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the U.S. government's examination of individuals involved in terrorism is the sole determining factor in preventing terrorist attacks. It does not consider other factors such as limited resources, intelligence gaps, or the complexity of identifying potential threats.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why individuals who were examined by the U.S. government went on to carry out terrorist murders. It does not explore other factors such as radicalization processes, external influences, or changes in individuals' circumstances."}
