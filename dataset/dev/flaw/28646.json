{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that California Governor Jerry Brown has mandated the use of gay pornography in elementary schools. There is no evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that California has implemented mandatory \"gay pornography\" viewing for grade schoolers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the inclusion of LGBT-inclusive textbooks in schools automatically means the use of sexually explicit material, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the inclusion of LGBT-inclusive textbooks is aimed at providing a broader and more accurate understanding of history and social sciences, rather than solely focusing on sexual content."}
