{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a video that has been shared multiple times on social media with different captions and claims. The lack of clear evidence and multiple conflicting narratives weakens the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video actually shows a protest in India in 2015, not an event involving the burning of an effigy of Pakistani PM Khan. The expert's verdict provides evidence and sources that contradict the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the event by suggesting that it involves the burning of an effigy of Pakistani PM Khan, when in reality, it was a protest against Indian PM Modi. The claim misrepresents the actual content of the video.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on misleading information and incorrect captions attached to the video. This indicates a lack of thorough verification and fact-checking.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the video, such as the possibility of misinterpretation or misinformation spread through social media.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video depicts an event involving the burning of an effigy of Pakistani PM Khan without sufficient evidence or verification. This assumption is problematic as it is based on misleading information."}
