{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the growth rate of Texas public school funding compared to enrollment. The expert's verdict states that the funding increased by 70 percent from 2002 to 2012, while enrollment increased by 23 percent. However, when adjusted for inflation, the increase in spending was only 11 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the statement. The expert's verdict provides conflicting information and alternative explanations, indicating that the claim may not be entirely accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the growth rate of public school funding is directly related to enrollment. However, the expert's verdict suggests that this assumption may be flawed, as funding did not increase at the same rate as enrollment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature made modifications and cuts to school funding, which may explain the discrepancy between the claim and the actual figures. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the growth rate of funding compared to enrollment.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the actual growth rate of enrollment. While the claim mentions a three times growth rate, the expert's verdict states that enrollment increased by 20 percent from 2001-02 to 2011-12.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that funding did not grow at the same rate as enrollment. The expert's verdict states that when adjusted for inflation, the increase in spending was only 11 percent, while enrollment increased by 20 percent.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and accurate representation of the growth rate of funding compared to enrollment. The expert's verdict highlights conflicting information and alternative explanations, suggesting that the claim may not be entirely reliable."}
