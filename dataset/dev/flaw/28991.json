{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the video shows bodies of Muslims who died of COVID-19 in New York, when in fact the video shows body bags at the Islamic International Funeral Services, which includes COVID-19 victims from all religions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that the bodies shown in the video are specifically Muslims who died of COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by linking the video to a non-existent \"Dawah Group\" in the US and connecting it to the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in India, without any evidence or basis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the video, such as the fact that the bodies shown are COVID-19 victims from various religions, not just Muslims."}
