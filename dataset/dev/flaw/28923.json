{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Russ Feingold broke his promise to always get the majority of funding from Wisconsin residents. This is because Feingold's pledge was specifically for the campaign at hand, and he did keep that pledge for several campaigns before reversing his position.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to conclusively prove that Russ Feingold broke his promise. While there is evidence that Feingold reversed his position and started accepting a majority of his funding from out-of-state, it is not clear if this constitutes a broken promise.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Feingold's pledge to always get the majority of his funding from Wisconsinites should apply to all future campaigns. However, Feingold has stated that his pledge was only for the campaign at hand, which challenges this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be an alternative explanation for Feingold's change in funding sources. The claim does not consider other factors that may have influenced Feingold's decision, such as changes in campaign finance laws or the availability of funding from Wisconsinites.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Feingold did keep his promise to take the majority of his funding from Wisconsinites for several campaigns before reversing his position. This suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of Feingold's funding sources throughout his political career. It focuses primarily on the reversal of his position in the 2016 campaign without considering the consistency of his funding sources in previous campaigns.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the significance of Feingold's reversal in accepting a majority of his funding from out-of-state. While it is not clear if this constitutes a broken promise, the claim does not fully explore the potential implications or consequences of Feingold's change in funding sources."}
