{"Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of comparing response rates in 2010 and 2020 due to factors such as different timelines, additional ways to answer the questionnaire, and the ongoing pandemic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to conclusively prove that the response rate in the 2020 census is behind 2010's response rate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump's directives to exclude illegal immigrants from census data would result in a \"whiter\" census and increased Republican voting power, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the lower response rates in Black, Latino, and Native American communities, such as cultural or socio-economic factors, which are not addressed in the claim."}
