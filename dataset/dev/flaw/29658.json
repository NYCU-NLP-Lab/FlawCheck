{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Trump \"shut down all travel from China,\" when in fact he imposed travel restrictions but did not shut down all travel.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were already cases of COVID-19 in the United States before the travel restrictions were imposed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to support the assertion that the travel restrictions bought valuable time for the national response.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by inaccurately stating that there were no cases of the disease in the country before the travel restrictions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the travel restrictions effectively prevented the spread of the virus, but some disease experts argue that the Trump administration did not use the time effectively.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the travel restrictions did not completely shut down travel from China, as thousands of people still flew from China to the United States in the months following the restrictions."}
