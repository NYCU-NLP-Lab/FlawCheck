{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient data sources and evidence to support the assertion that no civilians died from terror attacks in Indian cities during Modi's tenure. The figures provided in the graphic are not verifiable, and no sources are cited.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of reported terrorist incidents in Indian cities during Modi's term means that no civilians died from terror attacks. This assumption overlooks the possibility of unreported incidents or incidents classified under different categories.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statistics provided by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, which show that 1,482 civilians were killed in \"terrorist/insurgent/extremist incidents\" between 2014 and 2018. This discrepancy undermines the claim's assertion of zero civilian deaths.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that there were no terrorist attacks anywhere in India during Modi's tenure. This broad statement overlooks incidents in specific regions, such as Jammu and Kashmir and the North Eastern Region, where civilian deaths have been reported.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of civilian deaths caused by terrorist incidents during Modi's term by presenting an unsubstantiated figure of zero deaths. The official statistics provided by the government indicate a significant number of civilian deaths in various regions of India.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, which is that incidents of terrorism may have occurred but were not classified as such, or were not reported or documented adequately. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of zero civilian deaths."}
