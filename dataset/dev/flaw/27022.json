{"Exaggerate": "The claim of a \"civil-war like situation\" erupting in Pakistan may be an exaggeration as there is no concrete evidence or widespread reports supporting this claim. The provided evidence suggests isolated incidents being blown out of proportion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the evidence provided includes misleading social media posts, old photos, and false information. There is a lack of credible sources or verifiable information to substantiate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incidents of clashes and arrests in Pakistan indicate a larger civil-war like situation, which may be a problematic assumption. The evidence provided does not establish a widespread or ongoing conflict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the incidents mentioned, such as tensions between different law enforcement agencies or localized disputes, rather than a full-scale civil war. The evidence does not conclusively support the claim of a civil-war like situation."}
