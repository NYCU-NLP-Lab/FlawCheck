{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on reports and discussions within Trump's inner circle, but there is no concrete evidence or official announcement from Donald Trump himself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump has actually started a new political party called the \"Patriot Party,\" but there is no confirmation or official statement from Trump or any reliable source.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the discussions and speculations surrounding the formation of a new political party, such as Trump exploring options or testing public opinion, rather than actually starting a new party.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on reports from different sources, some of which may have conflicting information or varying degrees of reliability.", "Contradict fact": "There is no direct contradiction of facts in the claim itself, but the lack of concrete evidence or official confirmation contradicts the assumption that Trump has already started a new political party.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the uncertainty and speculative nature of the information surrounding the formation of a new political party by presenting it as a definitive fact.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear exaggeration in the claim itself, but the use of the term \"started\" implies a level of progress or establishment that may not be accurate."}
