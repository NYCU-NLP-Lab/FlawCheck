{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the series of photographs show the skeletal remains of the biblical giant Goliath, when in fact no such remains have been discovered.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible sources provided to back up the existence of the photographs showing Goliath's skeletal remains.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the photographs are authentic and recent, when in fact they have been circulating online for over a decade and have been debunked as hoaxes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the images used in the claim are not of a Goliath skeleton nor a recent archaeological discovery, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the origin of the photographs, such as the Weekly World News tabloid and the hoax photograph contest mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
