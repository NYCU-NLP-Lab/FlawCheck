{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Romney's Medicare plan by stating that it would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year. This figure is based on an outdated study of an earlier version of the plan, and there have been updates and changes since then.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the voucher system proposed by Romney would not keep up with healthcare inflation, leading to a cost of $6,000 a year for the average senior. However, this assumption may not be supported by sufficient evidence or analysis.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of providing specific evidence or data to back up the estimation of the cost to the average senior. It relies on general references to previous attacks on Ryan's Medicare plan and premium hikes mentioned by Obama and other Democrats.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the potential cost of Romney's Medicare plan. The claim does not explore or acknowledge any alternative viewpoints or potential benefits of the proposed plan."}
