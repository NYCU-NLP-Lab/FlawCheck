{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the existence of a tweet by Trump stating that the Supreme Court should decide the presidency at every election. The only mention of the tweet is by fact-checking organizations debunking it, and a search on Trump Twitter Archive does not show any tweets resembling the screenshot.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the screenshot of the tweet is genuine and accurately represents Trump's views. However, there is no concrete evidence to verify the authenticity of the tweet.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that doctored Trump tweets are a frequent online phenomenon, and hoaxers use dedicated websites to generate fake tweets. This suggests that an alternative explanation for the screenshot could be that it is a doctored or fabricated tweet.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that genuine tweets by Trump usually attract wide media coverage, but there is no media coverage or mention of the Supreme Court tweet other than by fact-checking organizations debunking it.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim understates the impact and significance of the tweet if it were genuine. The claim does not provide any analysis or discussion of the potential implications of such a statement by the President.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information that is not directly relevant to the existence of the tweet or the biases in the claim, such as mentioning the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court and the first presidential debate between Trump and Joe Biden.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any information or make exaggerated claims."}
