{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in discretionary spending by stating that it has increased \"over 20-some percent in two years if you don\u2019t include the stimulus\" and \"over 80 percent\" if you include the stimulus. The expert's verdict confirms that the raw numbers show a 23.7 percent increase, which is consistent with Cantor's claim, but the claim lacks historical perspective.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the specific percentages mentioned. The expert's verdict mentions that the raw numbers are not in dispute, but Cantor does not provide historical perspective or additional data to support his claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in discretionary spending is solely due to the actions of President Obama, without considering other factors or external influences. The expert's verdict mentions that Cantor is referring to a period that begins with Obama's inauguration, but it does not address any alternative explanations for the increase in spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the increase in discretionary spending during the first two years of the Obama administration is higher than the average increase during the eight budgets approved during President George W. Bush's administration. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in spending, such as economic factors or policy changes."}
