{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which General Motors is sending Mexican-made models of the Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across the border. The expert's verdict states that only a small number of hatchback models were sold in the U.S., while sedans are more popular and are produced in Ohio.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that General Motors is sending Mexican-made models of the Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across the border. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that only a small number of hatchback models were sold in the U.S., while sedans are produced in Ohio.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that General Motors is sending Mexican-made models of the Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across the border. The expert's verdict provides information about the production and sales of different models but does not provide specific data on tax-free imports.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation to the claim by stating that the Mexican-made Chevy Cruze hatchback is not widely sold in the United States, and the sedans are produced in Ohio. This challenges the notion that General Motors is sending Mexican-made models tax-free across the border.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that General Motors stated that all Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the United States are built in their assembly plant in Ohio. This contradicts the claim that Mexican-made models are being sent tax-free across the border.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a complete and accurate representation of the situation. The expert's verdict provides additional context and clarifies the production and sales of different models, which challenges the claim's assertion.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the production and sales of the Mexican-made Chevy Cruze hatchback in the United States. The expert's verdict mentions that 4,500 hatchbacks were sold in the U.S. out of a total of 29,000 produced in Mexico for global markets."}
