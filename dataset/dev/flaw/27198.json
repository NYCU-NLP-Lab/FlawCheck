{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the use of human fetal tissues and embryonic stem cells in the development of REGN-COV2, as the manufacturer has stated that no human embryonic stem cells or recently harvested fetal tissues were used.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that human fetal tissues and embryonic stem cells were used in the development of REGN-COV2.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption by suggesting that the use of human fetal tissues and embryonic stem cells in the development of REGN-COV2 is in direct conflict with the administration's pro-life platform, without considering the specific circumstances and ethical considerations involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations, such as the use of other types of stem cells (mouse embryonic stem cells and human blood stem cells) in the research and development of REGN-COV2, as stated by the manufacturer."}
