{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the problem by stating that all Facebook users who donated to charities on a one-time basis were actually debited every month for one year, while the expert's verdict clarifies that it was a \"very small number\" of users who experienced this issue.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or expert's verdict faltering at times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it provides anecdotal evidence from one user's experience, but does not provide any broader data or statistics to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all Facebook users who made one-time donations were debited every month for one year, which is not supported by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the mistaken impression of recurring debits, such as a technical glitch or error in the system.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the mistaken impression of recurring debits was a result of a glitch, not intentional debiting of users' accounts."}
