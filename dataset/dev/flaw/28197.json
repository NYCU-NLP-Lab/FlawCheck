{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of gun-related deaths in the U.S. by stating that it surpassed the total number of U.S. combatant deaths on D-Day. The expert's verdict clarifies that the number of gun-related deaths was close to the number of combatant deaths, but not necessarily surpassed it.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict suggests that the figure of 2,501 U.S. combatant deaths on D-Day is an estimate and may not be definitive or final. This implies that the claim may be understating the number of combatant deaths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the statement that gun-related deaths surpassed the total number of U.S. combatant deaths on D-Day. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides analysis and data from a reliable source to support their assessment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of gun-related deaths in 2019 surpassed the number of U.S. combatant deaths on D-Day solely based on the date of 6 March. The expert's verdict clarifies that the threshold of 2,501 gun-related deaths was passed on 7 March, not 6 March.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the figure of 2,501 U.S. combatant deaths on D-Day is an estimate and there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the data. This suggests that the claim may not consider alternative explanations for the number of combatant deaths."}
