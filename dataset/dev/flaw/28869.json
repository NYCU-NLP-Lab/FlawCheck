Her voting record indicates otherwise.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that McSally's statements in her ad accurately represent her actions and positions on the issue of pre-existing conditions. However, her voting record suggests otherwise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that McSally's support for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act is based on a different approach to addressing pre-existing conditions, rather than outright opposition to coverage for such conditions.
