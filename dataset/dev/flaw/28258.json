{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Mayor Tom Barrett \"demanded concessions that went beyond those mandated\" by Gov. Scott Walker's collective bargaining law. This could be seen as an exaggeration because it implies that Barrett demanded concessions that were significantly more extensive than what the law required.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Barrett's demands for concessions were in response to the collective bargaining law, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that Barrett demanded concessions beyond what was mandated by the collective bargaining law. It lacks sufficient support to substantiate the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Barrett's demands for concessions, such as budgetary constraints or other factors that may have influenced his negotiation stance."}
