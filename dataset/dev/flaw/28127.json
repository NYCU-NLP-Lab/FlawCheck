{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to establish a direct correlation between a canine coronavirus vaccine and the existence of a human vaccine for COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the availability of a vaccine for one type of coronavirus (canine coronavirus) should automatically translate to the availability of a vaccine for another type (SARS-CoV-2).", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the fact that different coronaviruses can have distinct characteristics and may require different approaches for vaccine development.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that as of May 4, 2020, there was no vaccine available for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity and challenges involved in developing a vaccine for a novel coronavirus like SARS-CoV-2 by suggesting that it should already exist based on the existence of a canine coronavirus vaccine.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of a single photograph of a canine coronavirus vaccine in relation to the development of a human vaccine for COVID-19.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a viral photograph and its caption without considering the broader context and scientific complexities involved in vaccine development."}
