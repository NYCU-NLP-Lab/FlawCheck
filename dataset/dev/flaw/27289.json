{"Lack enough support": "The claim that over half of the people who would be taxed under a millionaire surtax are small businesspeople lacks enough support. The expert mentions that tax returns do not provide enough information to accurately determine the different types of small businesses, and it is difficult to define a small business owner.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that increasing taxes on millionaires will discourage investment and expansion by business owners who are best positioned to create new jobs. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider other factors that can influence job creation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the impact of increasing taxes on millionaires on job creation that are not addressed in the claim. The claim does not consider other potential factors that could affect job creation, such as market conditions or government policies."}
