{"Understate": "The claim may understate the decrease in state general revenue spending by only stating a decrease of 10.7 percent. It is possible that the decrease is actually greater than that.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify the accuracy of the decrease in state general revenue spending. The provided spreadsheet and figures are not thoroughly analyzed or explained.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that limiting spending increases to the sum of inflation and population growth is the only way to prevent excessive spending and that it is advocated by all conservative groups. This assumption may be problematic as there may be alternative approaches or viewpoints.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in state general revenue spending, such as changes in economic conditions or shifts in budget priorities, which are not explored in the claim."}
