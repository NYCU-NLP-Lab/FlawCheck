{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of support for Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue plan among the American people, as it states that the \"vast majority\" support it, including a majority of Republicans. However, the provided evidence suggests that while there is support for the plan, it may not be as overwhelming as implied by the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the level of support for Biden's plan among Republicans. The evidence provided includes a CBS poll that shows 70% of Republicans approving of Congress passing an economic relief package, although it does not mention the specific $1.9 trillion price tag or Biden's name. This suggests that there may be more Republican support for the plan than the claim acknowledges.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that the \"vast majority of the American people\" support Biden's plan. While some polls show majority support for the plan among Americans, it is not clear if this support extends to the \"vast majority\" as claimed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the support for Congress passing an economic relief package, as shown in the CBS poll, directly translates to support for Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue plan. However, the poll did not mention the plan's specific details or Biden's name, making it unclear if the support is specifically for his proposal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the level of support among Republicans. The evidence provided mentions that other polls, such as Quinnipiac and SurveyMonkey/New York Times, found less than majority support among Republicans for the plan. This suggests that there may be differing levels of support depending on the poll and the specific elements of the plan being considered."}
