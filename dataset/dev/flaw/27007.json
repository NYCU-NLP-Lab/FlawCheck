{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the Hollywood celebrities endorsing Hillary Clinton are \"not very hot anymore.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence of numerous high-profile celebrities who have endorsed Clinton, many of whom are still very popular and relevant in the industry.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the majority of Hollywood celebrities endorsing Clinton are \"not very hot anymore.\" The expert's verdict provides a list of over 100 enthusiastic Clinton supporters, including A-list celebrities who are still highly regarded in the entertainment industry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the popularity or \"hotness\" of celebrities is a determining factor in the legitimacy or impact of their endorsement. However, the expert's verdict does not address this assumption directly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for why Hollywood celebrities are endorsing Clinton, other than suggesting that they are no longer popular. The expert's verdict does not provide an alternative explanation either."}
