{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the satellite photos, suggesting that they could rewrite our entire history and change how we look at history forever.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the existence of an ancient civilization in Antarctica and the construction of pyramids.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of pyramid-shaped mountains in Antarctica indicates the existence of an ancient civilization, without considering alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the pyramid-shaped mountains, such as natural geological formations or other non-human factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that modern humans (homo sapiens sapiens) did not evolve until much later than the claimed ancient civilization, which supposedly existed 100 million years ago.", "Understate": "The claim understates the scientific understanding of plate tectonics and the fact that Antarctica has undergone significant geological changes over millions of years.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting irrelevant facts about the geologic history of Antarctica without directly addressing the question of how the pyramids got there."}
