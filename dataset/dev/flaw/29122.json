{"Understate": "The claim understates the content of the Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders \"unity\" policy document by falsely stating that it calls for the abolition of police departments and prisons.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the unity document includes passages that clearly indicate the existence of police and prisons in the future, but under proposed reforms.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to substantiate the assertion that Biden and Sanders want to abolish police departments and prisons.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by equating the \"unity\" policy document with the entire Biden-Sanders agenda, which is described as extreme by the expert.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the use of the term \"defund the police,\" which most officials do not interpret as a call to eliminate police departments entirely."}
