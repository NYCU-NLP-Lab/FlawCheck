{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Will Smith was \"rushed to hospital\" and \"diagnosed with a life-threatening disease\" when in reality he underwent a routine colonoscopy and was not diagnosed with any disease.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading YouTube video and misinterpreted information from an AmoMama article.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that undergoing a routine colonoscopy automatically means being diagnosed with a life-threatening disease.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Will Smith was not diagnosed with a life-threatening disease and was not rushed to the hospital.", "Understate": "The claim understates the significance of Will Smith's decision to undergo a routine colonoscopy, which potentially prevented cancer from developing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the tissue growth discovered during the colonoscopy was a pre-cancerous polyp, which required further screening in a shorter interval."}
