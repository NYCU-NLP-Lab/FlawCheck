{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim made by Rep. Paul \"Skip\" Stam may be an exaggeration. While Stam claims that there are 31 other states and 10,000 other cities with the same type of policies as North Carolina's House Bill 2, the expert points out that some of the policies in HB2 are rare and unique to North Carolina, such as not allowing discrimination claims to be filed in state court and dictating bathroom usage based on birth certificates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the policies in North Carolina's House Bill 2 are similar to those in 31 other states and 10,000 other cities. However, the expert's verdict highlights that some of the policies in HB2 are rare and not found in other states, suggesting a problematic assumption in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim made by Stam lacks enough support. While Stam asserts that there are 31 other states and 10,000 other cities with similar policies, the expert's analysis reveals that some of the policies in HB2 are unique to North Carolina and not present in other states.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations to the claim made by Stam. While Stam argues that the backlash against North Carolina is hard to understand because most states have similar laws, the expert's analysis highlights the uniqueness of some of the policies in HB2 and the attention it has received nationally.", "Contradict fact": "The claim made by Stam contradicts the fact that some of the policies in North Carolina's House Bill 2 are rare and not present in other states. Stam's assertion that the law is the same as in 31 other states is contradicted by the expert's analysis.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by Stam may falter at times due to the lack of support and the presence of alternative explanations. The expert's verdict suggests that Stam's assertion about the similarity of policies in other states may not be entirely accurate."}
