{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Muslims are being beaten in detention camps in Assam without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a viral video without verifying its authenticity or providing additional evidence to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of inmates being beaten in a Sri Lankan prison is evidence of Muslims being beaten in detention camps in Assam, which is a problematic assumption as there is no direct connection or evidence provided to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video in question is from a Sri Lankan prison and has been reported by Sri Lankan media outlets, suggesting an alternative explanation that the video is not related to Muslims being beaten in detention camps in Assam."}
