{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Mark Kelly took a \"Chinese communist banner\" to space is an exaggeration. He actually took a banner commemorating his space flight and his participation in young leaders conferences.", "Lack enough support": "The links provided by McSally's campaign do not support the claim that Kelly went on a Chinese-government funded trip to the forum or that he took a communist banner with him to space.", "Problematic assumption": "McSally assumes that Kelly's participation in the Young Leaders Forum, which alternated between the United States and China, was funded by the Chinese government and that he took a communist banner with him to space. However, there is no evidence to support these assumptions.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim that Kelly took a \"Chinese communist banner\" to space. The expert states that Kelly traveled with a banner made for him commemorating his space flight and his participation in young leaders conferences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that Kelly participated in the Young Leaders Forum, an annual program of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, which aims to encourage mutual understanding between citizens of the two countries. The forum alternated between the United States and China, and Kelly's participation does not necessarily indicate support for the Chinese communist government."}
