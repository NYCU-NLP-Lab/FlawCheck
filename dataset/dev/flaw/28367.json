{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that \"Hatchimal\" bath bombs are giving children chemical burns, without providing sufficient evidence or data to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single Facebook post and does not provide any additional evidence or research to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reported incidents of chemical burns are directly caused by the \"Hatchimal\" bath bombs, without considering alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the burns.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that reactions to cosmetic products like bath bombs, such as dyes or fragrances, could be the cause of the reported burns, rather than the reactive chemicals in the bath bombs themselves. This indicates the presence of alternative explanations for the reported incidents."}
