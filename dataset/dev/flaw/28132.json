{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Joe Biden signed an executive order allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad. The expert's verdict clarifies that Biden actually rescinded a policy that blocked non-abortion funds from going to organizations that perform or advocate for abortions with their non-U.S. derived money.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific details about the executive order signed by President Biden. The expert's verdict provides a detailed explanation of the policies and laws related to funding abortions abroad.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the executive order signed by President Biden allows the U.S. to fund abortions abroad, but the expert's verdict explains that the executive order only rescinded a policy that blocked non-abortion funds to certain organizations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by clarifying the difference between the global gag rule and the Helms Amendment, and how they relate to funding abortions abroad."}
