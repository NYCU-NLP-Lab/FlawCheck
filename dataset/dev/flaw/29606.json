{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support abortion \"up to the moment of birth\" contradicts the expert's verdict, which states that they have not said they support such a position.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual position of Biden and Harris on abortion, as they support the landmark Supreme Court case Roe vs. Wade and want to codify it into law, which allows states to regulate abortion after viability.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Biden and Harris support abortion \"up to the moment of birth,\" as the expert's verdict states that they have not made such statements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting Roe vs. Wade and opposing state laws that violate it equates to supporting abortion \"up to the moment of birth,\" which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the difference in interpretation of the complex rulings on abortion may lead to different perspectives on whether they allow abortions \"up to the moment of birth,\" indicating the existence of alternative explanations."}
