{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of South African police minister Bongani Mkongi's justification of xenophobic attacks. The video shows him expressing concerns about the influx of immigrants and the dominance of certain areas by foreign nationals, but it does not explicitly justify or condone attacks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mkongi's comments in the video are directly related to the current xenophobic violence in South Africa. However, the video was filmed in 2017, and Mkongi is no longer a serving minister.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Mkongi justifies xenophobic attacks. The video shows him expressing concerns about immigration and the dominance of certain areas, but it does not provide explicit support for attacks on foreigners.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Mkongi's comments in the video. It is possible that he was expressing frustration with the social and economic challenges associated with high levels of immigration, rather than justifying violence against foreigners.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was filmed in 2017 and does not represent Mkongi's current stance on the issue. It also contradicts the fact that publicly available data does not support the claim about a South African city being 80 percent immigrants.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times."}
