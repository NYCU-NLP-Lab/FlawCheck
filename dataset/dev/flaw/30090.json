{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of violence and danger posed by the migrants in the caravan by using terms like \"invaders\" and stating that they are shooting at police and setting fire to immigration checkpoints.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that migrants in the caravan are engaging in violent acts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incidents of violence mentioned in the headline are directly linked to the migrants in the caravan, without providing clear evidence or establishing a causal connection.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the available information, as it is stated that the fire at the immigration checkpoint was caused by migrants who had already left the caravan, not by those currently in the caravan.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim understates the actual extent of the violence or incidents occurring within the caravan, as it only focuses on one specific incident without providing a comprehensive overview."}
