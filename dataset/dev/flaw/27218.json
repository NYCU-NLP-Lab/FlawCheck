{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Trump's endorsement on Luther Strange's performance in the Alabama Senate runoff by using the term \"MANY points\" without providing specific numbers or evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is weak support for Trump's claim. The evidence provided, including a poll from Emerson College's polling unit, does not strongly support the claim that Strange gained a significant number of points after Trump's endorsement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in support for Luther Strange after Trump's endorsement was solely due to Trump's influence. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there are alternative explanations for the narrowing gap between Strange and his rival Roy Moore, such as other factors or events that may have influenced voters' decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are other factors that could have contributed to the narrowing gap between Strange and Moore, such as voters being aware of Trump's endorsement prior to the Sept. 22 rally or other polling data that showed little movement towards Strange after Trump's endorsement.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by Trump falters by not acknowledging the timing of his endorsement and rally, as voters had been aware of his endorsement for weeks prior to the rally. This suggests a lack of accuracy or oversight in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of other factors or events on the narrowing gap between Strange and Moore, as it solely focuses on Trump's endorsement and rally without considering other variables that could have influenced voters' decisions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Luther Strange lost the Alabama Senate runoff election, despite Trump's endorsement. The expert's verdict mentions that Strange's defeat was a blow for Trump, indicating that the claim contradicts the actual outcome of the election."}
