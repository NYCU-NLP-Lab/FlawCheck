{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it mentions the impeachment trial of U.S. President Donald Trump and the killing of Iranian General Qassim Soleimani, which are not directly related to the implementation of Daylight Saving Time in Norway.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that the official responsible for implementing Daylight Saving Time in Norway apologized for making 2020 one hour longer.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the official's apology was sincere and not tongue-in-cheek. The expert's verdict mentions that the comment was likely tongue-in-cheek, as Daylight Saving Time does not actually make the year longer.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the official's apology, which is that it was made in jest or as a lighthearted comment rather than a genuine apology."}
