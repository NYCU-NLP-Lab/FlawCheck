{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the health risks posed by the \"flicker\" impact created by shadows of wind turbine blades, particularly seizures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or documented case histories to support the assertion that wind turbines can trigger seizures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the \"flicker\" impact created by shadows of wind turbine blades poses a significant health risk, particularly seizures, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the reported health risks, such as pre-existing medical conditions or other environmental factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of the investigation, which did not find any real evidence that wind turbines can trigger seizures."}
