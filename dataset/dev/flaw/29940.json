{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of people that Donald Trump would potentially deport, as it states that he would deport 16 million people, but the actual number may be higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that Donald Trump would deport 16 million people.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump has explicitly stated that he would deport 16 million people, which is not accurate according to the Trump campaign.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the claim, such as the fact that Trump's stance on immigration has evolved throughout his campaign, making it difficult to determine his exact position on deportation."}
