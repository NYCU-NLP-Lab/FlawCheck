{"Understate": "The claim may understate the actual losses incurred by Costco from keeping rotisserie chickens at $4.99 each. The expert's verdict mentions that the actual losses are unknown and the company has declined to offer figures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the estimated losses of $30 to $40 million a year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for keeping the price of rotisserie chickens low is solely to keep members happy and foot traffic high. However, the expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations, such as the concept of a \"loss leader\" where the company swallows the losses on the chicken to attract customers who end up buying more.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the low price of rotisserie chickens is considered a \"loss leader\" strategy by Costco, which draws customers who end up making additional purchases. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the pricing strategy, beyond just keeping customers happy and foot traffic high.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that in 2018 alone, Costco reportedly made $91 million from sales of rotisserie chickens. This contradicts the claim that the company loses $30 to $40 million a year by selling them at $4.99 each.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the losses incurred by Costco from selling rotisserie chickens at $4.99 each. The expert's verdict mentions that the actual losses are unknown, and the company has declined to offer figures. Additionally, the expert's verdict also mentions that the company reportedly made $91 million from sales of the item in 2018.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing consistent information. The expert's verdict mentions that in 2015, Costco's CFO stated the willingness to sacrifice \"$30 million, $40 million a year on gross margin\" for the chicken's price, but by 2019, the senior vice president declined to confirm whether Costco still loses money on the chicken at that price. This inconsistency suggests that the claim may not be entirely accurate or up-to-date."}
