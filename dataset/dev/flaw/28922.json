{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp \"stole\" the state's 2018 election, implying a deliberate act of theft rather than potential voter suppression or other factors.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the election process and the potential impact of other factors on the outcome.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that Kemp \"stole\" the election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actions listed (canceled voter registrations, closed polling places, put voters \"on hold\") were solely responsible for Kemp's victory, without considering other factors that may have influenced the outcome.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Kemp's victory or address any potential counterarguments."}
