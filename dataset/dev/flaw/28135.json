{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that several male students at Baraboo High School were photographed performing the Nazi salute. It is based on a single photograph and testimonies from a few individuals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the boys in the photograph were intentionally performing the Nazi salute, without considering alternative explanations or motivations behind their actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The photographer and some students have provided an alternative explanation, suggesting that the gesture was meant to wave goodbye or was suggested by the photographer, not as a Nazi salute.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the situation by not fully addressing the allegations of racist bullying and harassment made by other students against the boys in the photograph.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting conflicting accounts and testimonies from different individuals involved, making it difficult to determine the exact nature and intent of the gesture.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim exaggerates the number of boys involved or the significance of the incident beyond the specific photograph.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim, as it is based on the photograph and testimonies provided. However, the alternative explanation provided by the photographer contradicts the assumption of a Nazi salute."}
