{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks support as there is no announcement by the Minnesota Department of Public Safety or any report by WCCO that confirms Chauvin's death in jail.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Derek Chauvin committed suicide in his prison cell, but there is no evidence or official confirmation of this.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Chauvin's transfer to different detention facilities, such as COVID-19 concerns and the anticipation of a large number of protests-related bookings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no official announcement or report confirming Chauvin's suicide in prison.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the lack of evidence and support for the claim, as it only mentions the absence of an announcement by the Minnesota Department of Public Safety and a report by WCCO.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the seriousness of the situation by stating that Chauvin committed suicide, without any factual basis.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a junk news website (W24n) that has published hoax stories in the past, including one about President Barack Obama testing positive for the coronavirus."}
