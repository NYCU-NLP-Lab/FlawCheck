The video footage and media reports may have presented the incident in a more dramatic or sensationalized manner.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the miscreants who attacked the police were members of Tablighi Jamaat, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to establish a clear connection between the miscreants and Tablighi Jamaat. The media reports and video footage may not provide enough information or context to definitively link the two.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the attack on the police, such as general unrest or dissatisfaction with the police presence or actions in the area. The claim does not explore or acknowledge these alternative explanations."}
