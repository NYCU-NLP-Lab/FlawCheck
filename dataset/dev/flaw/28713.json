{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Nigeria has 100 million generators in private hands. The information provided by the radio host is based on a friend's account and a presentation from a solar energy solutions company, without any concrete reference data or official statistics.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of generators imported by Nigerians equates to the number of privately owned generators in the country. However, the data from the National Bureau of Statistics only provides information on the amount spent on generator imports, not the actual number of units.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing accurate and reliable information. The radio host's statement is based on hearsay from a friend and a presentation from a specific company, which may not be a comprehensive or representative source of information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the electricity problems in Nigeria, such as insufficient infrastructure, inadequate investment in the power sector, or issues with distribution and maintenance, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the actual number of privately owned generators in Nigeria. The available data from the General Household Survey suggests that 31.8% of sampled households owned generators, but this figure may not accurately represent the entire population.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is a lack of specific data or research on the number of generators in Nigeria. The Energy Commission of Nigeria, the state agency responsible for energy development, has not conducted any research on this matter.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the number of privately owned generators in Nigeria by suggesting that there are 100 million of them. The lack of concrete data and conflicting information about Nigeria's population and household count make it difficult to substantiate such a high number."}
