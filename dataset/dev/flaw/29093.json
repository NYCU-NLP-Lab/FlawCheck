{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it suggests that all of Santa's reindeer are female based solely on the fact that female reindeer retain their antlers until after giving birth in the spring. It does not consider the possibility of male reindeer retaining their antlers until late December, which is not typical but still possible.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides evidence of female reindeer retaining their antlers, but does not provide any direct evidence that all of Santa's reindeer are female.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that there are alternative explanations for Santa's reindeer having antlers, such as the possibility that they could be castrated males known as steers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of Santa's reindeer are female based on the presence of antlers, without considering other factors or evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that both male and female reindeer grow antlers, but male reindeer drop their antlers at the beginning of winter.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of female reindeer retaining their antlers, suggesting that it is the sole factor determining the gender of Santa's reindeer."}
