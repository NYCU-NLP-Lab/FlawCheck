{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the benefits of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) by stating that it is \"so much better\" than NAFTA and that Mexico is paying for the wall through the money saved. The experts state that the USMCA is only slightly better than NAFTA and does not generate enough federal revenues to pay for the border wall.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making an unsupported connection between the USMCA and Mexico paying for the wall. The experts state that this connection is not possible.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the USMCA is significantly better than NAFTA and that Mexico is paying for the wall. The experts provide evidence to the contrary.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the USMCA is significantly better than NAFTA and that the money saved from the agreement is equivalent to Mexico paying for the wall. These assumptions are problematic as they are not supported by evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The experts provide an alternative explanation by stating that Mexico will not pay for the wall and that the USMCA does not generate enough revenue to fund it."}
