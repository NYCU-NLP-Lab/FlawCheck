{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of driver's licenses issued to illegal aliens by stating that \"more than half\" of all licenses were issued to them. The actual number provided by the Department of Motor Vehicles is about 397,000 licenses, which is less than half of the total 759,000 licenses issued during the specified period.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all undocumented immigrants who received a driver's license are illegal aliens. However, the term \"undocumented immigrants\" is broader and includes individuals who may have legal status but lack the necessary documentation to prove it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by the number provided by the Department of Motor Vehicles, but it does not provide additional evidence or context to support the assertion that this is a significant issue or problem.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in driver's licenses issued to undocumented immigrants, such as the implementation of the Safe and Responsible Driver Act, which aimed to provide licenses to undocumented immigrants for safety reasons and to ensure they knew how to drive.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in presenting a clear and accurate representation of the situation by using language that is emotive and biased, such as referring to undocumented immigrants as \"illegal aliens.\"", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the efforts made by the state of California to accommodate the surge in driver's license applications, such as opening temporary offices, hiring additional staff, and extending office hours.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the driver's licenses were issued to undocumented immigrants, not necessarily illegal aliens."}
