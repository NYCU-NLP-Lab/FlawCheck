{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that \"nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days\" after the shootings of Dallas policemen. It is not clear where this information comes from or how it was obtained.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in job applications to the Dallas Police Department is solely a result of the shootings of Dallas policemen. It does not consider other potential factors that may have influenced the increase in applications.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of applications by using the term \"nearly 500\" instead of providing the exact number of applications received.", "Falters at times": "The claim is based on statements made by Hillary Clinton during her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. While the claim is presented as a fact, it relies on the accuracy and reliability of Clinton's statement, which may not always be infallible.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any established facts or information.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to contain any exaggerated statements or information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in job applications, such as other external factors or events that may have influenced people's decision to apply to the Dallas Police Department."}
