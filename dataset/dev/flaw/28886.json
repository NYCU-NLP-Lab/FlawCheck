{"Exaggerate": "The claim of prosecuting over 4,000 cases may be an exaggeration, as it would require prosecuting at least three cases a day on average during her tenure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is unclear how many of the cases Hanaway personally prosecuted.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the cases filed by Hanaway were personally prosecuted by her, which may not be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have an alternative explanation, such as Hanaway overseeing a staff of more than 100 people who were responsible for prosecuting the cases.", "Understate": "The claim may actually understate the number of cases Hanaway dealt with, as the court records show that her office filed at least 5,430 cases during her tenure, not including cases inherited from her predecessors."}
