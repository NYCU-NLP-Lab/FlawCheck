{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Rep. Sandy Pasch \"did nothing to stop\" people from scamming the Wisconsin Shares child-care subsidy program. The evidence provided suggests that Pasch called for reforms and a comprehensive audit of the program after reports of abuse and fraud.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actions taken by Rep. Sandy Pasch to address the issue of fraud in the Wisconsin Shares program. The evidence shows that Pasch voted against funding for fraud investigations in the 2009-2011 budget and the 2011-\u201913 state budget, which indicates a lack of support for allocating resources to combat fraud.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that Rep. Sandy Pasch \"did nothing to stop\" people from scamming the Wisconsin Shares program. While there is evidence of Pasch voting against funding for fraud investigations, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of all the actions taken by Pasch to address the issue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Rep. Sandy Pasch's vote against funding for fraud investigations directly correlates with her lack of action to stop people from scamming the Wisconsin Shares program. There could be alternative reasons for her vote, such as disagreement with the overall budget or prioritizing other aspects of the program.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Rep. Sandy Pasch's actions and votes regarding the Wisconsin Shares program. The evidence provided does not delve into Pasch's reasoning or motivations for her decisions, leaving room for alternative explanations."}
