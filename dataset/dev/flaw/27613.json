{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of scientists who reject anthropogenic climate change by stating that \"30,000 scientists have signed a petition.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the petition only requires an undergraduate degree in any science, which means the signatories may not all be climate scientists or top researchers in their field.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that there is no convincing scientific evidence for anthropogenic climate change. The expert's verdict highlights that the petition is distributed using misleading tactics and lacks accountability regarding the authenticity of its signatures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 30,000 scientists who signed the petition represent a significant portion of the scientific community rejecting anthropogenic climate change. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the petition's signatories may not have expertise in climate science or related fields.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the petition's existence and purpose. The expert's verdict mentions that the petition was created by individuals and groups with political motivations and aimed to reject the Kyoto Protocol rather than solely addressing the scientific consensus on climate change.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the petition by presenting it as a strong argument against anthropogenic climate change. The expert's verdict highlights the questionable tactics used to gather signatures and the lack of verification for the signatories' credentials.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the overwhelming scientific consensus that anthropogenic climate change is supported by convincing evidence. The expert's verdict mentions that the petition's rejection of climate change is not supported by the majority of climate scientists and researchers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a petition as evidence against anthropogenic climate change rather than scientific studies and research. The expert's verdict suggests that the petition's credibility and scientific validity are questionable."}
