{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the view of \"every objective observer\" believing that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons. This is an overstatement and lacks sufficient evidence.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the U.S. intelligence community stated in its National Intelligence Estimate that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Iran is actively pursuing nuclear weapons.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pursuit of nuclear power automatically means the pursuit of nuclear weapons, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Iran's nuclear program, such as the country's assertion that it is solely for peaceful purposes."}
