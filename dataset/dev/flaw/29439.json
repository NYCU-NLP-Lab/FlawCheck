{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that polls show Bernie Sanders would do better than Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head battle against Donald Trump. The expert's verdict mentions polls from Real Clear Politics and various news outlets, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all available polls or their methodology.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations for the claim, such as the fact that Georgia is a solidly red state and Sanders was trounced by Clinton in their primary there. These alternative factors could influence the results of the polls mentioned.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Clinton's campaign did not respond to their request for their reads on the polls, which could suggest a lack of comprehensive analysis or input from both sides.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not understate any biases in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not exaggerate any biases in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not contradict any facts in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict does not mention any problematic assumptions in the claim."}
