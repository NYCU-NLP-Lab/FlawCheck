{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no direct evidence or confirmation provided in the expert's verdict that Myanmar's army arrested Aung San Suu Kyi. The photo in question is shown to be misleading and features a Malaysian actress, not Suu Kyi.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo shows Myanmar's army arresting Aung San Suu Kyi without providing concrete evidence or verification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photo depicts a scene from a film called \"The Lady\" featuring Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh, and not an actual arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo is not of Aung San Suu Kyi being arrested but a scene from a movie.", "Understate": "There is no understatement bias present in the claim as it does not downplay or minimize any information.", "Exaggerate": "There is no exaggeration bias present in the claim as it does not overstate or amplify any information.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not show any signs of faltering at times bias as it presents a straightforward statement without wavering."}
