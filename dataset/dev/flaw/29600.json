{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the forensics examination by suggesting that it proves widespread vote switching from Trump to Biden.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by failing to provide enough evidence or support for the assertion that votes were switched.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single machine in one county, without any evidence of similar incidents occurring elsewhere.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the forensics examination proves intentional vote switching, while election officials attribute the difference to human error.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation provided by election officials, who state that the difference in vote count resulted from human error rather than a flaw in Dominion software."}
