{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Donald Trump was actually in New York on the day his son and others met with a Russian lawyer, not in Florida as stated.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Donald Trump was doing a rally in Florida on the same day as the meeting, when in fact the rally took place two days later.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that Donald Trump was in Florida on that specific day.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the meeting with the Russian lawyer is directly related to Donald Trump's rally in Florida, without providing any evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that Donald Trump was in New York for a fundraising lunch and spent the rest of the day at Trump Tower, as supported by a schedule of his activities and a Tampa Bay Times photo."}
