{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Rick Perry completely turned down the invitation to meet President Obama in El Paso, implying a complete refusal. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that Perry declined the offer to greet the president in El Paso but did express interest in meeting later in Austin or discussing specific issues such as wildfires and border security.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Perry's interaction with President Obama. The expert's verdict mentions a 34-second conversation and handshake between Perry and Obama at Austin's airport, which contradicts the claim that Perry completely turned down the invitation to meet.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Rick Perry turned down the invitation to meet President Obama in El Paso. The expert's verdict provides statements from White House press secretary Jay Carney and Perry's spokeswoman Lucy Nashed, but there is no additional evidence or documentation provided to corroborate their statements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for Perry's refusal to meet Obama in El Paso was due to a lack of interest or willingness on Perry's part. However, the expert's verdict suggests that Perry declined the offer in El Paso because he wanted a more substantial meeting or to discuss specific issues such as wildfires and border security.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation provided by Perry's spokesman Mark Miner, who stated that Perry wanted to meet with the president to discuss wildfires and border security, rather than just shaking hands on a tarmac."}
