{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"2.5 million times a year\" is an exaggeration according to the expert's verdict, as the estimates on the number of times people use a gun in self-defense range from about 100,000 to 3 million per year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single study conducted in 1993 by Gary Kleck, and other gun researchers view his estimate as extremely high.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the estimate of 2.5 million times a year is accurate, despite other more trustworthy information that suggests a lower number of instances of defensive gun use.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations by mentioning the National Crime Victimization Survey, which suggests a much lower estimate of less than 100,000 instances of defensive gun use per year.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is a wide range of estimates on the number of times people use guns in self-defense, making it difficult to determine a precise number.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on a single study from 1993 and does not consider more recent data or alternative surveys."}
