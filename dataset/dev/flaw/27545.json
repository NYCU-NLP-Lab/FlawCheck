{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the severity of tuberculosis by stating that \"10 million fell ill from TB and 1.5 million died\" without specifying the time frame. The expert's verdict clarifies that these numbers are annual statistics, not a single year's data.", "Understate": "The claim understates the importance of wearing masks for tuberculosis by suggesting that people don't wear masks for TB, while the expert's verdict confirms that mask-wearing is recommended in countries where TB is prevalent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its assertion that mask-wearing for TB is not emphasized due to media attention. The expert's verdict explains that the suggestion to wear masks for TB has not received much media attention in the US because TB is less prominent in the country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for not wearing masks for TB is because CNN hasn't instructed people to, which is a problematic assumption without evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for not wearing masks for TB, such as cultural practices or lack of awareness, which may vary across different countries and regions."}
