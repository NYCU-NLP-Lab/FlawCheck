{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that a signature audit of absentee ballots in Georgia could overturn the 2020 presidential vote results in that state. This could be seen as an exaggeration because the expert explains that it is unlikely to occur or change the election outcome for a number of reasons.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to justify the assertion that a signature audit could overturn the election results. The expert's explanation highlights the existing processes and safeguards in place to verify signatures on absentee ballots.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a signature audit would produce evidence of widespread voter fraud. However, the expert's explanation suggests that there is no evidence to support this assumption and that the rejection rate for absentee ballots due to signature issues in 2020 was consistent with previous elections.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rejection rate of absentee ballots due to signature issues. The expert's explanation suggests that the rejection rate in 2020 was consistent with previous elections, indicating that it may not be solely attributed to rampant absentee voter fraud."}
