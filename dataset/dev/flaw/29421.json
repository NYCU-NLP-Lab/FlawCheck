{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that the attack was carried out by \"Muslim Jihadi forces\" or \"terrorists.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the attack on the ISKCON temple was motivated by religious extremism without providing any concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The journalist from Netrokona, Bangladesh, who works with a national daily in the country, disproved the social media claims and stated that the incident was a property dispute, not a terrorist attack.", "Understate": "The claim may downplay or understate the complexity of the situation by attributing the attack solely to \"Muslim Jihadi forces,\" without considering other possible motives or factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The journalist's statement about the incident being a property dispute suggests an alternative explanation for the attack, which contradicts the claim's assertion of a terrorist attack."}
