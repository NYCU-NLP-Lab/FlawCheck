{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration as it states that Gov. Scott Walker said \"no to equal pay for equal work for women,\" which implies a clear and explicit statement from Walker on the issue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the repeal of a law allowing workers to pursue discrimination claims against employers in state court automatically translates to saying \"no to equal pay for women.\" It assumes a direct link between the law and equal pay for women without providing sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Gov. Scott Walker explicitly opposed equal pay for women. It relies on the interpretation of the new law's impact on workplace discrimination claims, which is a matter of debate among employee attorneys.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Gov. Scott Walker's support for the repeal of the law, such as concerns about the effectiveness of state court suits or a preference for federal court proceedings. However, the claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
