{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Catherine Cortez Masto \"failed Nevada rape victims\" by stating that \"thousands of rape kits were never sent for DNA analysis.\" The evidence provided does not explicitly support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the accusation that Catherine Cortez Masto failed Nevada rape victims. The evidence provided only suggests that there is little evidence of her specifically addressing the backlog issue of untested rape kits during her tenure as attorney general.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the backlog of untested rape kits is solely the responsibility of Catherine Cortez Masto, without considering other potential factors or individuals involved in the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the backlog of untested rape kits in Nevada, such as systemic issues within the law enforcement or forensic departments, which are not addressed in the claim."}
