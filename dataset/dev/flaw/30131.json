{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the video shows a 'war' at a recent state election in Nigeria. The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence that any of the clips in the video show recent violence in Nigeria's Edo state.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video depicts a war at a recent state election in Nigeria, without providing any substantial evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video actually shows scenes from a different country, Ivory Coast, and not Nigeria. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the video was originally published by a France-based media outlet in the context of unrest in Ivory Coast.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by using the term 'war' to describe the events shown in the video, without any factual basis or evidence to support such a claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the video, such as the possibility that it may depict unrelated incidents or events that are not related to a state election in Nigeria. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the video was originally published in a different context, related to unrest in Ivory Coast.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting misleading information and failing to provide accurate context or evidence to support its assertion. The expert's verdict highlights the false claims and misleading context surrounding the video.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the claim."}
