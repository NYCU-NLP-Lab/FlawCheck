{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between Elena Kagan and Goldman Sachs by stating that she \"took money from Goldman Sachs just like her boss, Obama.\" While Kagan did receive a stipend for her services on an advisory council for Goldman Sachs, it is an exaggeration to suggest that she took money from the company in the same way as President Obama.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct connection between Kagan and any alleged wrongdoing at Goldman Sachs. The provided information suggests that Kagan's role on the advisory council was focused on public policy matters and not involved in making investment decisions for the company.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kagan's association with Goldman Sachs is inherently negative due to the company's investigation for fraud. However, the information provided does not indicate any wrongdoing on Kagan's part or a direct connection to the investigation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Kagan's involvement with Goldman Sachs was purely advisory and focused on providing research and high-level advisory services to policymakers, regulators, and investors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Kagan's role on the advisory council was limited to a one-day-a-year conference and did not involve making investment decisions for Goldman Sachs.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making an exaggerated and unsupported connection between Kagan and Goldman Sachs, as well as assuming a negative association without sufficient evidence."}
