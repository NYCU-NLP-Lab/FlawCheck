{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the percentage of adults in the U.S. who received a flu shot in the last 10 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that less than half of adults in the U.S. received a flu shot in the last 10 years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative factors or reasons that may have influenced the percentage of adults receiving flu shots, such as age groups or demographic differences.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the data provided by the CDC, which shows that the percentage of adults receiving flu shots has fluctuated over the years but has generally stayed above 50%.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not provide a consistent representation of the vaccination rates among different age groups, as there are variations in coverage among adults and children.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the low vaccination rates among adults by not considering the higher vaccination rates among certain age groups, such as older adults and young children.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the social distancing measures in place during the current flu season will impact the vaccination rates, without providing evidence for this assumption."}
