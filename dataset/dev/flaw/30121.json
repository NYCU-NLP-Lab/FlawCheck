{"Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of redistricting and the potential impact on fairness by stating that the U.S. Constitution \"doesn't say anything about being fair.\" The expert points out that the concept of fairness in redistricting is not explicitly mentioned in the U.S. Constitution and that the Supreme Court has recently avoided ruling on partisan gerrymandering.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the assertion that the redistricting system is \"set up to be partisan.\" The expert's analysis does not provide direct evidence or examples to support or refute this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly mention fairness in redistricting, it means the system is intentionally partisan. This assumption may oversimplify the complexities of redistricting and the potential factors that influence the process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of explicit mention of fairness in the U.S. Constitution regarding redistricting. It is possible that the framers of the Constitution left the issue open to interpretation or intended for fairness to be determined by other laws or principles."}
