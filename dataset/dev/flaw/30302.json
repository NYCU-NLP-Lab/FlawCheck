{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it presents Jesus' immigration status as an undocumented immigrant, which may not accurately reflect the historical context in which he lived.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Jesus' situation can be directly compared to modern immigration issues, which may be a problematic assumption as the historical context and circumstances are different.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or historical documentation to support the assertion that Jesus was an undocumented immigrant.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the world in which Jesus lived was part of the Roman Empire, which makes it hard to classify him as an illegal immigrant in the modern sense."}
