{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that Mitt Romney refused to say whether he'd sign the Lilly Ledbetter bill.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Romney's response of \"I'll get back to you\" when asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill means he refused to say whether he supported it, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Romney's response, such as needing more time to review the details of the bill before giving a definitive answer.", "Understate": "The claim may understate Romney's position on the Lilly Ledbetter bill by not fully exploring his stance or providing additional context.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and direct answer to whether Romney refused to say whether he'd sign the bill, instead stating \"sort of\" and providing additional information about the law and Romney's response.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that Romney did not explicitly refuse to say whether he'd sign the Lilly Ledbetter bill, but rather responded with \"I'll get back to you.\"", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Romney's response by framing it as a refusal to support the bill, when it could simply indicate a need for further consideration or review."}
