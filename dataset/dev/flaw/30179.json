{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump received the highest percentage of minority votes of any Republican candidate for president in over 100 years, without providing sufficient evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the facts by not acknowledging that previous Republican candidates, such as George W. Bush, received higher percentages of minority votes than President Trump.", "Understate": "The claim understates the support that other Republican candidates have received from minority voters by not mentioning their higher percentages of support compared to President Trump.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in the form of concrete data or statistics to back up the assertion made.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that previous Republican candidates may have received higher percentages of minority votes due to various factors, such as different political climates or campaign strategies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Trump did not receive the highest percentage of minority votes among Republican candidates, as evidenced by the data from exit polls and historical election results.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates President Trump's success in attracting support from minority voters by not acknowledging that other Republican candidates have achieved higher percentages of minority votes in the past."}
