{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the predictions made by James Hansen regarding sea-level rise. While Hansen did forecast a \"multi-meter sea level rise\" in 50 to 150 years, the claim states a specific range of 10 to 30 feet, which is not directly supported by Hansen's statements or the study he co-authored.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the specific range of sea-level rise mentioned (10 to 30 feet). The study co-authored by Hansen and other scientists predicts a rise in sea levels within a 50-to-150 year timeframe, but does not provide specific figures in the 10-to-30 foot range.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sea-level rise predicted by James Hansen will result in the loss of population centers on the coasts. While Hansen does mention the loss of most coastal cities in his forecast of \"multi-meter sea level rise,\" it is not explicitly stated that this will happen within the 50-year timeframe mentioned in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for sea-level rise, such as thermal expansion and melting ice, which have been attributed by scientists to the rising seas.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that sea levels measured in Florida have risen nine inches since the 1920s, as confirmed by historical data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This contradicts the claim's suggestion of a much higher sea-level rise within a shorter timeframe.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the specific predictions made by James Hansen regarding sea-level rise. While Hansen does forecast a significant rise in sea levels, the claim exaggerates the range and timeframe mentioned by him."}
