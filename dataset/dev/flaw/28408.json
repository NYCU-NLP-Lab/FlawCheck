{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the connection between the use of a Monsanto-manufactured pesticide and the increased number of microcephaly cases in Brazil.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causation between the pesticide and microcephaly cases without providing sufficient evidence or considering alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that multiple credible public health experts are investigating the concurrent outbreak of Zika virus and the uptick in microcephaly cases in Brazil, suggesting an alternative explanation for the increase in cases.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a strong and conclusive argument by not presenting enough evidence or addressing alternative factors that could contribute to the increase in microcephaly cases.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the larvicide pyriproxyfen, which is mentioned in relation to the pesticide, wasn't well studied or in use elsewhere prior to the cases of microcephaly in Brazil.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the role of the Monsanto-manufactured pesticide in causing the increased number of microcephaly cases by not providing sufficient evidence or considering other factors."}
