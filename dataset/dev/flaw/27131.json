{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of children paralyzed by the polio vaccine, stating that at least 490,000 children were affected, while the actual number of recorded cases of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in India between 2000 and 2017 was 17.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the polio vaccine tested by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation caused paralysis in nearly half a million Indian children.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal link between the Gates Foundation's polio vaccine campaign and the paralysis of children, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the cases of paralysis, such as other factors or diseases that could have caused the paralysis in children.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that India was officially declared polio-free in 2014, indicating that the polio vaccine campaign was successful in eradicating the disease rather than causing paralysis in children.", "Understate": "The claim understates the rarity of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), which are extremely rare and can mutate from the strain contained in the oral polio vaccine. The claim fails to acknowledge the low number of recorded cases of cVDPV in India during the specified period.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on posts and articles that have been debunked and proven false, as well as referencing conspiracy theories about Bill Gates and vaccines."}
