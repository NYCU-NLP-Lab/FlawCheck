{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Israel has discovered a vaccine against the novel coronavirus, when in reality, they have developed a vaccine against a strain of coronavirus affecting poultry and are still in the process of adapting it for human use.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the vaccine developed for poultry coronavirus can easily be adapted for human use, without providing sufficient evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that Israel has discovered a vaccine against the novel coronavirus. The provided evidence only suggests that they have developed a vaccine for a different strain of coronavirus and are working towards adapting it for human use.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19, as stated by the World Health Organization.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, which is that Israel's MIGAL Research Institute has developed a vaccine for a strain of coronavirus affecting poultry, and they are working towards adapting it for human use, but it is still in the testing and approval phase.", "Understate": "The claim understates the progress made by stating that the vaccine is still \"weeks away\" from completing safety approvals and being produced, while the MIGAL Research Institute aims to produce the vaccine in the next 8-10 weeks and achieve safety approval in 90 days."}
