{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the conclusion of the \"last non-partisan commission\" by stating that it concluded that #VoterID was necessary. The report mentioned in the expert's verdict recommends a photo ID system, but it does not explicitly state that #VoterID is necessary.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or specific details about the \"last non-partisan commission\" and its findings to support the conclusion that #VoterID is necessary. More information is needed to fully evaluate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the \"last non-partisan commission\" is the ultimate authority on the necessity of #VoterID. It does not consider alternative viewpoints or potential flaws in the commission's findings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives on the issue of #VoterID. It presents the conclusion as a definitive statement without acknowledging opposing arguments or evidence."}
