{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the number of people who will see their taxes go up due to the House health care bill. The expert's analysis shows that less than 1 percent of tax filers would be affected by the \"millionaire's tax,\" but there are other taxes in the bill that could impact a wider pool of individuals.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to back up the statement that \"ninety-eight percent of the American people will not see their taxes go up.\" The expert's analysis shows that there are taxes in the bill that could affect individuals indirectly or directly, but the exact amount of increase is hard to determine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the House health care bill will not lead to tax increases for the majority of Americans. However, the expert's analysis shows that there are taxes in the bill that could impact individuals, albeit to a lesser extent than the \"millionaire's tax.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for potential tax increases. The expert's analysis highlights the existence of other taxes in the bill that could affect individuals, such as the penalty for not buying health insurance.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are taxes in the House health care bill that could lead to an increase in taxes for some individuals. The expert's analysis provides evidence of the \"millionaire's tax\" and other taxes that could impact a wider pool of people.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which taxes will not go up for the American people. The expert's analysis shows that while the \"millionaire's tax\" would only affect less than 1 percent of tax filers, there are other taxes in the bill that could impact a wider pool of individuals."}
