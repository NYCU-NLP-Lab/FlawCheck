{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the chair-throwing incident. While there were reports of supporters lifting chairs, there is no clear evidence of chairs actually being thrown.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that chairs were thrown during the convention. The available video footage only shows a man briefly lifting a chair before placing it back on the ground.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the chair-throwing incident was solely caused by angry Bernie Sanders supporters. It does not consider the possibility of other individuals or groups being involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the chair-throwing incident, such as misunderstandings or misinterpretations of supporters' actions. The claim does not explore these alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no clear evidence of chairs being thrown during the convention. The available video footage and reports suggest a different narrative.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting conflicting accounts and evidence regarding the chair-throwing incident. Different sources provide varying information, making it difficult to determine the exact events that took place.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the adversarial nature of the convention and the tensions between Bernie Sanders supporters and Hillary Clinton supporters. It does not fully capture the extent of the conflict that occurred."}
