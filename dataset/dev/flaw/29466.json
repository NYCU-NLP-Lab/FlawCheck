{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that 58,000 ineligible non-citizens illegally registered and voted in one or more elections in Texas. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was made by the Texas attorney general, and opponents argue that there is no credible data indicating illegal voting in significant numbers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict mentions that opponents argue that there is no credible data supporting the claim of illegal voting by non-citizens in significant numbers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 58,000 non-citizens who registered and voted in Texas elections did so illegally. The expert's verdict mentions that opponents argue that the Texas efforts were an excuse to purge immigrants, who are more likely to vote Democrat, from voter rolls. This suggests that the assumption of illegal voting may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that opponents argue that the Texas efforts to identify non-citizen voters were aimed at purging immigrants from voter rolls. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim made by the Texas attorney general."}
