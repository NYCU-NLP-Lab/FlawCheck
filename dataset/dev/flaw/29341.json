{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Strom Thurmond proposed the amendment that blocked Puerto Rico's use of Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. The expert mentions that they were unable to find any relevant papers or documentation to confirm this.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Strom Thurmond intentionally deprived Puerto Rico of bankruptcy protections, but there is no concrete evidence to support this assumption. It is unclear why the amendment was written and what the intentions behind it were.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there may be more to the story and that Thurmond may not be solely responsible for the amendment. This implies that there could be alternative explanations or factors involved in the decision to exclude Puerto Rico from bankruptcy protections.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Puerto Rico had bankruptcy protections until the amendment in 1984. The expert states that the bankruptcy protections applied to Puerto Rico until that point, which contradicts the claim's assertion that the amendment blocked Puerto Rico's use of Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and comprehensive explanation of the circumstances surrounding the amendment and its impact on Puerto Rico. The expert's analysis highlights the complexity of the issue and the lack of clarity surrounding the reasons behind the amendment.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance and impact of the amendment on Puerto Rico. The expert describes the island territory being brought to the financial brink and unable to reschedule its payments due to the lack of bankruptcy protections. This suggests that the consequences of the amendment were significant and potentially detrimental to Puerto Rico's financial situation.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
