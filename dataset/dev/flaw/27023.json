{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the legalization of marijuana in Colorado would lead to a spike in consumption. However, the expert's verdict suggests that this assumption may be problematic as there hasn't been a significant increase in consumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there hasn't been a spike in consumption after the legalization of marijuana in Colorado. The expert's verdict mentions that marijuana use by adults has consistently increased for a decade, both before and after legalization.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the increase in marijuana use by adults over the years. It fails to consider the long-term trend of marijuana consumption, which suggests that the legalization may have contributed to the overall increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of a significant spike in consumption, such as changes in social attitudes towards marijuana or the availability of other substances.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that marijuana use by adults in Colorado has consistently increased for a decade, suggesting that there has been a spike in consumption, albeit not directly caused by legalization.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of legalization by suggesting that there has been no spike in consumption at all. The expert's verdict indicates that while there may not have been a significant spike, there has been an increase in marijuana use by adults over the years."}
