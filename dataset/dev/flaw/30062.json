{"Exaggerate": "The claim that George Allen \"had 40,000 earmarks\" may be an exaggeration as it seems unlikely for someone to request an average of 18 earmarks per day during his time in the Senate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 40,000 earmarks were personally requested by George Allen, but the campaign spokesperson clarifies that he \"voted for\" the earmarks by supporting larger appropriations bills.", "Lack enough support": "The source of the claim, Citizens Against Government Waste, is mentioned but it is not clear if they provide sufficient evidence or data to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations or interpretations, such as the earmarks not being specific to Virginia or not all requested by George Allen personally."}
