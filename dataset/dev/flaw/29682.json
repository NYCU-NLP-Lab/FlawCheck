{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential number of Americans who could be denied coverage under Mitt Romney's plan by stating it as 89 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as the details of Mitt Romney's health care plan are not clearly outlined and his campaign did not provide clarification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that people who have gaps in health insurance coverage would not be protected under Romney's plan, leading to potential denial of coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the \"89 million\" figure, as it is based on a study of people who lost insurance coverage for at least a month between 2003 and 2007, and does not directly correlate to the number of people who would be denied coverage under Romney's plan."}
