{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the photo shows a street covered with potholes in Rahul Gandhi's parliamentary constituency Wayanad, Kerala. The provided evidence only shows that the photo was shared on social media platforms, but there is no direct evidence linking it to Wayanad.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo accurately represents the current state of the streets in Wayanad, Kerala, without providing any additional context or information. This assumption may be problematic as the photo could be outdated or unrelated to Wayanad.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The photo is identified as being published in a 2017 report about the poor road conditions on Bhagalpur NH-80 in Bihar. This suggests an alternative explanation that the photo is not related to Wayanad, Kerala, but rather depicts the road conditions in Bihar.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual extent of the road conditions in Wayanad, Kerala, by only focusing on potholes. The evidence provided does not give a comprehensive view of the overall road conditions in the area.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting misleading information or a lack of clarity. The provided evidence includes unrelated information about Rahul Gandhi's political background and the smart city status of Wayanad, which are not directly relevant to the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
