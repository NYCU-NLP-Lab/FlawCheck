{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the link between rare night clouds and human-caused climate change. While the expert's verdict suggests that there is evidence of a link, it does not provide concrete proof or establish a strong causal relationship.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to fully establish the connection between rare night clouds and human-caused climate change. The expert's verdict mentions computer models and satellite observations, but it does not provide specific details or references to these studies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the occurrence of rare night clouds is solely due to human-caused greenhouse gases. It does not consider alternative explanations or natural processes that could contribute to the phenomenon.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in rare night clouds, such as natural processes like dust from passing meteors or matter projected into the atmosphere from volcanoes. It solely attributes the increase to human-caused pollutants.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in fully establishing the link between rare night clouds and human-caused climate change. While the expert's verdict suggests a correlation, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis or address potential confounding factors.", "Contradict fact": "No contradictions to facts are evident in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate the link between rare night clouds and human-caused climate change. It presents the connection as significant and supported by evidence."}
