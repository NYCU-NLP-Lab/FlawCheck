{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost of detaining someone by stating that it costs taxpayers over $50,000 per year. The actual cost is slightly over $50,000 based on the current rate to house an adult detainee per day.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the average length of detention, which is stated to be 40 days. This could lead to a lower overall cost of detention than what is presented in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to back up the comparison between the cost of detaining someone and the amount spent on each child in public schools. It does not provide detailed information on how the federal government spends on each child in public schools, making it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of the comparison.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that detaining someone is an unnecessary expense, without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this assumption. It is based on the opinion of Sen. Patty Murray, who argues that the agency is \"unnecessarily detaining people,\" but this is not substantiated with further evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the cost disparity between detaining someone and the amount spent on each child in public schools. It does not take into account different factors and expenses involved in immigration enforcement and education funding."}
