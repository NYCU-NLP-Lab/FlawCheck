{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Act 10 by stating that it was \"millions short\" of filling the hole left by the state aid cut. The expert's verdict mentions that there was a net shortfall of $6.7 million, which contradicts the claim's assertion of being millions short.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Act 10 was millions short of filling the hole left by the state aid cut. The expert's verdict mentions that the shortfall was $6.7 million, but it is unclear how this figure was calculated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Act 10 was intended to offset the cuts in state aid, but the expert's verdict mentions that Governor Scott Walker's office maintains that Milwaukee County ended up with an extra $10 million on its balance sheet in 2012, thanks to Act 10. This suggests a different assumption about the impact of Act 10.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Governor Scott Walker's office argues that Milwaukee County realized more savings than the state reduction they received in shared revenue, and that they now have the ability to manage legacy costs moving forward. This suggests an alternative explanation for the financial situation of Milwaukee County, which contradicts the claim's assertion of Act 10 being millions short."}
