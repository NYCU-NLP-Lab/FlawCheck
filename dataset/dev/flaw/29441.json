{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent of Alexi's involvement in making risky loans to convicted mobsters, as there is no evidence that he approved these loans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Alexi made tens of millions in risky loans to convicted mobsters.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Alexi's role as a senior loan officer at his father's bank automatically means he was responsible for the risky loans and the subsequent collapse of the bank.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that Alexi's older brother and father managed the client relationship with the convicted mobsters, suggesting that Alexi may not have had a significant role in these transactions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence to directly implicate Alexi in approving the risky loans.", "Understate": "It could be argued that the claim understates the involvement of Alexi's family members in establishing the relationship with the convicted mobsters and managing the loans."}
