{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that David Jolly wants to outlaw a woman's right to choose, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that David Jolly's stance on abortion is the same as Donald Trump's, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove the connection between David Jolly and Donald Trump's views on abortion, as the evidence linking their stances on abortion is hard to pinpoint.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for David Jolly's stance on abortion, such as his support for exceptions in cases of rape, incest, or health risks to the mother or baby.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that David Jolly has never met Donald Trump and is not supporting him for president, suggesting that they have a relationship that does not actually exist."}
