{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Obama's position on nuclear arms as a \"march toward global zero.\" While Obama has expressed a commitment to seeking a world without nuclear weapons, it does not necessarily mean that his position is a direct march towards achieving that goal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully justify the assertion that Obama's position on nuclear arms is a \"march toward global zero.\" While there are examples of Obama expressing a commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons, it does not provide enough evidence to conclude that his entire position is solely focused on achieving that goal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's position on nuclear arms is solely focused on achieving a world without nuclear weapons. However, it does not take into account other potential factors or considerations that may influence his stance on nuclear arms control.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Obama's position on nuclear arms. It assumes that his goal is solely a world without nuclear weapons, but there may be other strategic or diplomatic reasons behind his stance.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not necessarily contradict any factual information provided in the expert's verdict. However, it may be seen as an oversimplification or misrepresentation of Obama's position on nuclear arms."}
