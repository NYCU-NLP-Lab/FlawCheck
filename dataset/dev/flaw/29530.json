{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Kamala Harris \"bailed out rioters\" and that one of them \"broke somebody's head open.\" The expert's verdict found no evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that Kamala Harris bailed out rioters and that one of them committed a violent act.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Kamala Harris encouraged donations to a nonprofit that pays bail for protesters, she is responsible for any subsequent actions of those individuals. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents one interpretation of Kamala Harris' actions, but there could be alternative explanations for her support of the nonprofit and its bail fund."}
