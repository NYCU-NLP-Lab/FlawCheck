{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"98 percent of American families\" make \"under $250,000 a year\" is supported by statistics from the IRS, which indicate that 98.2 percent of tax returns reported adjusted gross income of less than $250,000 in 2009. However, it is unclear if this statistic can be generalized to all American families, as tax returns may not necessarily reflect the income of every family.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it is based on data from 2009, which may not accurately represent the current income distribution among American families.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of American families making under $250,000 a year if the data used is outdated or if there are significant changes in income distribution since 2009.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the income distribution among American families. It assumes that the majority of families make under $250,000 a year without considering other factors such as household size, location, and occupation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that adjusted gross income reported on tax returns accurately reflects the income of American families. However, not all income may be reported or captured in tax data, leading to a potential underestimation or overestimation of the percentage of families making under $250,000 a year.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts or evidence. The statistics from the IRS support the claim that a significant majority of tax returns report income of less than $250,000 a year."}
