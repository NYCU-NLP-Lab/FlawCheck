{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Donna Brazile's actions by stating that she used her position to pass information to the Clinton campaign about upcoming appearances. The evidence suggests that she may have improperly supplied advance knowledge of questions, but it does not explicitly mention passing information about appearances.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Donna Brazile was fired from CNN.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donna Brazile was fired from CNN solely based on leaked emails suggesting her improper actions. The evidence provided indicates that she resigned from her position as a political commentator at CNN.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Donna Brazile's resignation from CNN was not solely due to the leaked emails, but also because of her role as the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Donna Brazile resigned from CNN, as stated by CNN themselves, rather than being fired.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not accurately representing the information provided in the evidence. It states that Donna Brazile was fired, while the evidence suggests she resigned.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of Donna Brazile's actions by not explicitly mentioning the potential ethical concerns or impact on the integrity of the political process."}
