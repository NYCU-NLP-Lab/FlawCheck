{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the richest people in America are paying a lower tax rate than they have in the last 80 years. While the claim is not completely false, it exaggerates the significance of the decrease in tax rates.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that there have been periods in the last 80 years where the top income tax rates were lower than they are today. This undermines the claim that the current tax rates are the lowest in 80 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that the richest people in America are paying a lower tax rate than they have in the last 80 years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in tax rates, such as changes in economic conditions or tax policy decisions made by different administrations."}
