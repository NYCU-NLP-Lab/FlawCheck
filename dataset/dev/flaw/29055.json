{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which young women in metropolitan areas who are childless and single are out-earning young males in the same category all over the country. The expert's verdict mentions that the wage gap tends to disappear when comparing women and men in the exact same jobs with the same levels of experience and education.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that young women in metropolitan areas who are childless and single are out-earning childless, single young males. The expert's verdict mentions a 2012 U.S. News and World Report article, but it is not clear if this is sufficient evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pay gap between young women and young men is solely due to young women outperforming young men in metropolitan areas. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there are multiple factors at play in the pay gap, including life choices and disparities that grow as women get older in the workforce.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the pay gap, such as systemic biases or discrimination that may contribute to the wage disparity between young women and young men. The expert's verdict mentions that the wage gap tends to disappear when comparing women and men in the exact same jobs with similar backgrounds and experiences."}
