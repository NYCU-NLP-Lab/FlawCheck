{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the level of support for reducing legal immigration. While the claim states that nearly 2 out of 3 Americans want to reduce legal immigration, the evidence provided only shows that 63% of respondents in one poll wanted legal immigration of no more than 499,999 a year. It does not specify whether this translates to a desire for a reduction or increase in immigration overall.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a clear consensus among Americans regarding reducing legal immigration. While one poll showed 63% of respondents wanting legal immigration of no more than 499,999 a year, other polling has found broad support for keeping legal immigration at current levels or increasing it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that reducing legal immigration from 1 million per year down to 500,000 or less is a desired goal among Americans. However, the evidence provided does not directly address whether respondents favored a reduction or increase in immigration overall.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the desire to reduce legal immigration. It does not explore the reasons behind respondents' preferences or address potential factors that may influence public opinion on this issue."}
