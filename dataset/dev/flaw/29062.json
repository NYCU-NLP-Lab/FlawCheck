{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Barack Obama appropriated the Social Security number of a dead man born in 1890 is contradicted by the expert's explanation that the Social Security number assigned to him was not the same as that assigned to Barack Obama.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the Social Security Administration was informed of the death of the person whose Social Security number is being mentioned in the claim, indicating that it was not used by Barack Obama.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any evidence or credible sources to back up the assertion that Barack Obama used a dead man's Social Security number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of a Social Security number assigned to someone else is evidence of wrongdoing or appropriation, without considering other possible explanations or circumstances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides alternative explanations, such as the mailing address associated with the Social Security number, which do not support the claim that Barack Obama appropriated the number."}
