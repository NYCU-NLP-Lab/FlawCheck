{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the capabilities of the Triton Scuba Mask by stating that it allows people to breathe underwater without the use of air tanks, when in reality it is a conceptual design that has not been fully developed or proven to work.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific proof to support the idea that the Triton Scuba Mask can extract oxygen from water and deliver breathable air directly into the wearer's lungs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Triton Scuba Mask is a feasible and practical solution for underwater breathing, without considering the challenges and limitations of filtering enough water to provide the necessary oxygen intake for a human.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Skeptical reports have raised doubts about the feasibility and viability of the Triton Scuba Mask, suggesting that it is more of a concept than a realistic product."}
