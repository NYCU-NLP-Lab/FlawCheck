{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of \"17 Angry Democrats\" on Mueller's legal team. The expert's verdict clarifies that this is not accurate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the prosecutor in charge of prosecuting Jerome Corsi was not \"in charge of 'legal'\" at the Clinton Foundation, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Mueller's team made \"substantial & many contributions\" to Hillary Clinton's campaign.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any connection or past work with the Clinton Foundation or the Clinton campaign automatically implies bias or conflicts of interest, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for any perceived bias or conflicts of interest on Mueller's team."}
