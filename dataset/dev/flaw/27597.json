{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Obama's taxes by presenting them as potentially breaking the family budget.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites editorials from conservative newspapers, which may not represent the views of the entire press.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's tax plan will result in higher taxes for all Americans, ignoring the fact that there would be no change in tax rates for families with an adjusted gross income of less than $250,000.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations, such as the argument made by the Obama campaign that his plan would result in a tax cut for most middle-class Americans.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama's tax plan includes tax cuts for working families and proposes a windfall profits tax on oil companies, which could potentially lower prices at the pump."}
