{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential cooking capabilities of activated cell phones by suggesting that eggs and popcorn kernels can be cooked by placing them between the phones.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence or experiments to support the assertion that cell phones can cook eggs and popcorn kernels.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the microwave radiation emitted by cell phones is capable of modifying proteins in the egg and potentially in the human brain, without providing substantial evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for similar claims in the past, such as the use of editing tricks in a video and a spoof article created to poke fun at technological fears. This suggests that alternative explanations exist for the claim of cell phones cooking food."}
