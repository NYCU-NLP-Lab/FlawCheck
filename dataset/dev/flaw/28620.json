{"Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that the retired police officer was eventually allowed into the park while wearing the shirt, which is mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make the problematic assumption that the retired police officer was completely denied entry into the theme park, whereas the expert's verdict clarifies that he was temporarily stopped but eventually admitted into the park.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to prove that the retired police officer was denied entry solely because of his T-shirt, as the expert's verdict mentions that Universal Orlando Resort has a policy of not allowing clothing that could be mistaken for active emergency personnel.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider the alternative explanation that the park's policy was intended to avoid confusion and not specifically targeting the retired police officer, as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
