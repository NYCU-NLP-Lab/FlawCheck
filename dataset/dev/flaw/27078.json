{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that Governor Romney cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens on Medicaid to save $5 a day. The actual situation was more complex, as explained in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Governor Romney intentionally cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens. The expert's investigation found that the change in state reimbursement formula for nursing homes led to the closure of some kosher kitchens, but it was not a direct decision by Governor Romney.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Governor Romney's actions were motivated solely by saving $5 a day, without considering other factors such as budget constraints and the broader context of the state's financial situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation reveals that Democratic lawmakers wanted to keep nursing homes' kosher kitchens open and requested additional funding. This suggests that the decision to close kosher kitchens was not solely Governor Romney's responsibility, and there were alternative solutions being considered.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by oversimplifying a complex issue and attributing the decision solely to Governor Romney, without considering the involvement of other stakeholders and the broader context of the budget gap.", "Understate": "There is no clear example of understating bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any known facts, but it presents a simplified and exaggerated version of events that may not accurately reflect the full context and complexity of the situation."}
