{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Americans who are still waiting under Obamacare and remain uninsured by not providing the full picture of the progress made in reducing the uninsured population since the Affordable Care Act went into effect.", "Understate": "The claim understates the progress made in reducing the uninsured population since the Affordable Care Act went into effect by not mentioning that there are 20.4 million fewer uninsured people since 2010.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that 28.2 million Americans are still waiting under Obamacare and remain uninsured. It only provides a tweet without further evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Senate health care bill would provide relief to the uninsured population, but it is countered by experts who argue that the bill would result in more uninsured people.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations to the claim, such as the possibility of expanding Medicaid in more states or providing more generous financial assistance, which the administration and its congressional allies have opposed."}
