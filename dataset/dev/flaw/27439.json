{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating by stating that Kenya has \"one of the worst\" maternal mortality rates in the world. This bias is supported by the expert's verdict, which mentions that Kenya is one of 21 countries with a high ratio of maternal deaths, but does not explicitly state that it has one of the worst rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that Kenya has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the world. The expert's verdict mentions that there are data series comparing maternal mortality rates between some countries, but it is unclear if there is comprehensive data comparing all countries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kenya's maternal mortality rate is among the worst in the world without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions that Kenya is one of 21 countries with a high ratio of maternal deaths, but it does not provide a comparative analysis to determine if it is truly one of the worst.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to Kenya's maternal mortality rate. The expert's verdict mentions that maternal deaths can be caused by various factors, including direct and indirect causes, but it does not explore these factors in relation to Kenya specifically.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the severity of Kenya's maternal mortality rate by simply stating that it is one of the worst in the world. The expert's verdict mentions that Kenya is one of 21 countries with a high ratio of maternal deaths, which suggests a significant issue, but it does not provide a clear comparison to determine the extent of the problem.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear whether the claim falters at times as the provided information does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the claim."}
