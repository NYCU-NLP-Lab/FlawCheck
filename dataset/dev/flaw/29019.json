{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of oil discovered in the deep Gulf of Mexico by stating it as 80% without providing sufficient evidence to support this figure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or data to support the assertion that 80% of oil discoveries are made in the deep Gulf of Mexico.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a moratorium on drilling offshore would prevent the exploration and discovery of oil in the deep Gulf, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the percentage of oil discoveries in the deep Gulf of Mexico, such as discoveries in other regions or sources of oil.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the moratorium on drilling offshore was lifted in October, which suggests that the assertion about the negative impact of the moratorium on oil discovery may be inaccurate."}
