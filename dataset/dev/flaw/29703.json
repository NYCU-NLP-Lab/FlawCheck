{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate O'Rourke's position on border security by portraying him as \"careless\" and associating him with taxpayer-funded benefits for immigrants and sanctuary cities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting against the Grayson Amendment, which would prevent funding for the Defense Department's Excess Personal Property Program, means voting against body armor for Texas sheriffs patrolling the border. This assumption may be problematic as there could be alternative explanations for O'Rourke's vote.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that O'Rourke voted specifically against body armor for Texas sheriffs patrolling the border.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for O'Rourke's vote on the Grayson Amendment, such as concerns about the program or other aspects of the bill."}
