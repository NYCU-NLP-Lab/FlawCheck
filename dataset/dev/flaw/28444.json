{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference between the predicted increase in global temperatures and the observed temperatures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that observed temperatures have been only half as high as predicted.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the prediction of a one-degree Celsius increase in global temperatures by 2020 is accurate, without providing any evidence or context for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference between predicted and observed temperatures, such as natural climate variability or the margin of error in climate models."}
