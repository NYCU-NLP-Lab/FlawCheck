{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of sharks that could be killed for their squalene to produce a COVID-19 vaccine. The expert's verdict clarifies that the estimate of 550,000 sharks is at the high end of projected estimates and does not account for limitations and variables.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all COVID-19 vaccines will require shark squalene, which may not be the case. The expert's verdict mentions that not all vaccines will require squalene and that synthetic alternatives exist.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on non-peer-reviewed research conducted by a conservation advocacy group. The expert's verdict highlights the limitations and variables that were not accounted for in the research.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of using synthetic alternatives to squalene in vaccine production. The expert's verdict mentions that synthetic alternatives may prove more beneficial.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts. The expert's verdict provides clarification and additional information.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at times."}
