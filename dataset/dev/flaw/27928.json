{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"We didn't go out asking people\" to join the \"stand your ground\" task force lacks enough support. The expert's investigation found several cases where task force members stated that they were not aware of an application process and simply expressed their interest in serving.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the task force members were selected solely based on their own initiative and interest in the review. However, the expert's investigation found evidence that the task force members were chosen through a process that involved recommendations from specific individuals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that some task force members were recruited or recommended by others, contrary to the statement made by Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll. The expert's investigation found evidence that the task force members were chosen based on recommendations from various officials.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that some lawmakers and lawyers actively sought to join the task force, as stated by the expert's investigation. Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll's statement that they didn't go out asking people is contradicted by the evidence that individuals expressed their interest in serving on the task force.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll falters at times, as it does not accurately represent the process by which the task force members were selected. The expert's investigation found inconsistencies and discrepancies between Carroll's statement and the actual process.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the involvement of certain individuals or groups in the selection process. The expert's investigation found evidence that recommendations from specific officials played a role in choosing task force members, which is not mentioned in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
