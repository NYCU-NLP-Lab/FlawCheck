{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that every Supreme Court vote in the United States Senate, for over 200 and some years, has been an up-or-down vote. This is not accurate as there have been instances of filibusters and cloture motions in the past.", "Understate": "The claim understates the two-step voting process for Supreme Court nominees, which is rare. It fails to acknowledge the existence of cloture motions and the requirement of 60 votes to end a filibuster.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the assertion that every Supreme Court vote has been an up-or-down vote.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current rule requiring 60 votes for a Supreme Court nomination is common practice, when in fact it is not. It fails to acknowledge the historical context and changes to the cloture rule over time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the two-step voting process and the requirement of 60 votes for cloture are legitimate and necessary measures to ensure bipartisan support and prevent extreme nominees from being confirmed."}
