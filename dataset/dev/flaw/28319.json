The provided evidence suggests that the video is from a different event in 2015.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is authentic and shows Indian soldiers skydiving, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the video is misleading or falsely attributed to Indian soldiers.
