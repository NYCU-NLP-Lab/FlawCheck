{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the GOP had \"no discussions\" with Democrats in preparing the rules package for the 112th Congress. The expert's verdict provides evidence that there were discussions and a statement from Minority Whip Steny Hoyer criticizing the rules proposed by the Republican majority.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of discussions with Democrats is a negative aspect or a deviation from normal practice. However, the expert's verdict explains that it is a longstanding tradition for the majority party to put together the rules package with limited minority input.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that there were absolutely no discussions with Democrats. The expert's verdict provides evidence of a statement from a Democrat criticizing the rules package, but it does not provide comprehensive information about all the discussions that may have taken place.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that discussions may have taken place in a different format or at a different time. The expert's verdict mentions the tradition of limited minority input in the rules package process, suggesting an alternative explanation for the lack of discussions with Democrats."}
