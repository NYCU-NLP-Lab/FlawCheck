{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that Chris Abele \"once proposed a plan to end county funding to homeless shelters,\" without providing evidence or specific details about the proposal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the Facebook post making the claim was removed, and the campaign manager acknowledged that it was written hastily and inaccurately.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Abele's attempts to end supplemental funding for homeless programs equate to wanting to end all county funding for homeless shelters, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Abele's attempts to end supplemental funding, such as financial constraints or a desire to find more sustainable funding sources."}
