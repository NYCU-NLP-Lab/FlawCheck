{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in murder rates by stating that it is \"up an astonishing 57 percent.\" The expert's verdict confirms that while there was a spike in murders after 2014, the numbers have since leveled off and even dropped.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide additional data or evidence to back up the claim of a 57 percent increase in murders. The expert's verdict mentions that the White House was asked to provide information to support Sessions' statement, but no additional data is provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in murders is an ongoing trend without considering the fluctuations in the data. The expert's verdict highlights that the spike in murders occurred between 2014 and 2015 and then dropped in 2016.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the number of murders in Milwaukee has actually decreased in recent years. The expert's verdict mentions that both the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel figures and the Milwaukee Police Department figures show a decrease in the number of murders from 2015 through December 18, 2017.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of the murder rates in Milwaukee. The expert's verdict points out the fluctuations in the data and the decrease in murders in recent years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no mention of alternative explanations for the increase in murders or any alternative interpretation of the data in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
