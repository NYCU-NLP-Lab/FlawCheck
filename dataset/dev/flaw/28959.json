{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Gov. Chris Christie's budget cuts by stating that six out of 58 family planning centers had to close. It is possible that the closures were not solely due to the budget cuts, but could have been influenced by other factors as well.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the closures of the family planning centers were directly caused by Gov. Chris Christie's budget cuts. However, there could be alternative explanations or additional factors that contributed to the closures.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim provides some evidence, such as statements from state Sen. Loretta Weinberg and information from the organizations that ran the closed centers, it may not provide enough support to conclusively prove that the closures were solely due to the budget cuts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore or acknowledge the possibility of alternative explanations for the closures of the family planning centers. It assumes that the budget cuts were the sole cause.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts Gov. Chris Christie's statement that New Jersey residents have access to \"comprehensive reproductive health care services\" at other sites and that the state cannot afford duplicative funding for family planning centers."}
