{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that Philando Castile had been stopped by police \"40 or 50 times\" before the fatal incident, while the expert's verdict confirms that he had been pulled over \"at least 52 times\" and NPR found 46 stops.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the statement that Philando Castile had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times. However, the expert's verdict provides information from the Associated Press and NPR, which confirm that he had been pulled over at least 52 times.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of times Philando Castile was stopped by police is indicative of bias or racial profiling. While the claim does not explicitly state this assumption, it is implied by the context of the debate and the mention of bias in law enforcement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high number of times Philando Castile was stopped by police, such as a high number of traffic violations or being in an area with increased police presence."}
