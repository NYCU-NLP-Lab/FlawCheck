{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Nancy Pelosi said \"no\" to the Sergeant at Arms' request for the National Guard six times, implying that she deliberately obstructed their deployment.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is based on a Facebook post and has been shared multiple times, there is no concrete evidence or official statements provided to support the assertion that Pelosi specifically denied the requests.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Pelosi's alleged denial of the National Guard requests was the primary reason behind the security failings during the Capitol riot, without considering other factors or individuals involved.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that it was actually the former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, not House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving, who made the requests for National Guard assistance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the delay in National Guard deployment, such as bureaucratic hurdles, communication breakdowns, or other decision-makers involved.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation by solely attributing the security failings to Pelosi's alleged denial of the National Guard requests, without acknowledging the broader systemic issues and multiple individuals involved.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by inaccurately attributing the denial of National Guard requests to Pelosi, when it was actually House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving and his Senate counterpart Michael Stenger who denied the requests made by Capitol Police Chief Sund."}
