{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no comprehensive data from the federal government to back up Rubio's claim and his spokespersons didn't respond. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that 70 percent of the people in Florida who are here illegally came on an airplane and overstayed a visa. This assumption is problematic as there is no concrete evidence to support it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there have been other estimates of visa overstays, ranging from 27 to 57 percent. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the number of people who are here illegally in Florida.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of people who came on an airplane and overstayed a visa in Florida. The expert's verdict mentions estimates from various sources that suggest a higher percentage of visa overstays.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the federal government has struggled to accurately count visa overstays, indicating that the claim may falter at times due to the lack of reliable data.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no comprehensive data from the federal government to support Rubio's point.", "Exaggerate": "Although the claim does not explicitly exaggerate, the lack of comprehensive data and reliance on older estimates suggest that the claim may be exaggerating the percentage of people who came on an airplane and overstayed a visa in Florida."}
