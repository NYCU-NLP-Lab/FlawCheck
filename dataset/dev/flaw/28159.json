{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Trump's legislation by stating that it will clean up \"millions of tons of trash\" from oceans and lakes, which is not entirely accurate according to the expert's assessment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that President Trump signed legislation specifically for cleaning up trash from oceans and lakes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the media won't report on President Trump's actions regarding cleaning up marine trash, which may be a problematic assumption without substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation by stating that the legislation reauthorizes funding for NOAA's Marine Debris Program, which supports various efforts to address marine debris, including the International Coastal Cleanup."}
