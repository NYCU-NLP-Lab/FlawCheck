{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Texas had the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country in 2013.", "Understate": "The claim understates the improvement in Texas' high school graduation rate by only mentioning the change in ranking but not the actual increase in the rate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the measurement used in 2002 to determine the ranking is the same as the one used in 2013, which is not the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the change in Texas' high school graduation rate, such as changes in education policies or interventions."}
