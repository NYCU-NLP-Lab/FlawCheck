{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photograph by stating that it shows the Pakistani army surrendering and compares it to a historical event in 1971.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that the photograph is indeed of the Pakistani army showing a white flag to retrieve dead bodies of terrorists.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph is related to the recent skirmish on the Line of Control (LoC) between Indian and Pakistani forces, without providing any concrete evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph is actually of the Indian army handing over the body of a Pakistani boy who fell off a cliff into a river in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK).", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the photograph has no connection to the recent events on the LoC and is unrelated to the claim being made."}
