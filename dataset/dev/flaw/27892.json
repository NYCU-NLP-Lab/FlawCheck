{"Understate": "The claim may understate the decline in federal prosecutions for lying on background checks to buy guns under President Barack Obama. The expert's verdict states that there has been a 42 percent decline in prosecutions, which is higher than the 40 percent mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or data to back up the statement that federal prosecutions for lying on background checks have decreased by 40 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a decrease in federal prosecutions for lying on background checks is solely the responsibility of President Barack Obama's administration, without considering other factors that may contribute to the decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in federal prosecutions, such as changes in law enforcement priorities or resource allocation.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the data and only focusing on a limited time period (2009-2010) for Obama's administration.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that federal prosecutions for lying on background checks have declined by 42 percent, according to the expert's verdict, rather than the stated 40 percent.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the decline in federal prosecutions by rounding it to 40 percent, when the actual decline is 42 percent."}
