{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the employees' union for the IRS wants to be \"let out from under this law.\" The union was not lobbying against Obamacare itself, but rather against a specific bill that would change how Obamacare operates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the employees' union for the IRS is \"begging\" to be let out from under the law. The information provided only mentions the union's opposition to a specific bill, not their overall stance on Obamacare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the employees' union for the IRS turning against the bill sponsored by one of the law's opponents means they are against Obamacare as a whole. This assumption is problematic as it oversimplifies the union's position.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the union's opposition to the bill. It is possible that their opposition is based on specific concerns about how the bill would affect their operations or the implementation of Obamacare, rather than a rejection of the law itself."}
