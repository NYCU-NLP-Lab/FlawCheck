{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money that Scott Walker has turned down, as it states that he has turned down $1 billion of Medicaid money over the course of his tenure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the $1 billion figure, as it only cites a memo from the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau without providing additional sources or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that accepting the Medicaid funding under Obamacare would require the state to expand eligibility for Medicaid beyond those living in poverty, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why Scott Walker rejected the Medicaid money, such as concerns about the long-term sustainability of the program or disagreement with the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare."}
