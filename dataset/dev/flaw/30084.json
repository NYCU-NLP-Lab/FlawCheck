{"Understate": "The claim suggests that the state pension system benefits are average or below average compared to other systems throughout the country. However, the expert's verdict points out that the comparison is based on outdated data and does not consider health insurance benefits for retirees. This implies that the claim may be understating the actual benefits of the state pension system.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a comparison to other systems throughout the country, specifically referencing a report from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the information in the report is outdated and may not accurately reflect the current state of the pension system. This lack of up-to-date support weakens the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the state pension system benefits are not gold-plated or rich, based on the comparison to other systems. However, the expert's verdict points out that the comparison is tricky due to the quirks of different retirement systems and the lack of consideration for health insurance benefits. This problematic assumption undermines the claim's validity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents the state pension system benefits as average or below average compared to other systems throughout the country. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the comparison is based on outdated data and does not consider health insurance benefits. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the perceived average or below-average benefits, such as changes in the pension system provisions over time."}
