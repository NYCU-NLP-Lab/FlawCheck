{"Understate": "The claim understates the actions of Gov. Tony Evers and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes by stating that they \"did not call for peace\" and \"did not encourage calm.\" The expert's verdict confirms that there was no explicit call for calm or peace in their statements.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Gov. Evers and Lt. Gov. Barnes did not call for peace or encourage calm. The expert's verdict provides examples of their statements, but it does not conclusively prove their lack of support for peace and calm.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gov. Evers and Lt. Gov. Barnes should have explicitly called for peace and encouraged calm without considering the context of the situation or their statements. The expert's verdict mentions that their statements did not directly reference violence and damage in Kenosha, but it does not evaluate whether their overall response was appropriate or effective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Gov. Evers and Lt. Gov. Barnes' actions or statements. The expert's verdict provides some context and examples, but it does not explore other possible reasons for their response.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Gov. Evers did release a statement regarding the officer-involved shooting in Kenosha. The expert's verdict confirms that a statement was made, but it does not address whether it explicitly called for peace or encouraged calm.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the lack of a call for peace and encouragement of calm by Gov. Evers and Lt. Gov. Barnes. The expert's verdict provides evidence that their statements did not explicitly address violence and damage, but it does not assess the overall tone or intent of their response.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a blanket statement about Gov. Evers and Lt. Gov. Barnes' actions without considering the full context of their response. The expert's verdict points out specific instances where their response may have been lacking, but it does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of their overall actions."}
