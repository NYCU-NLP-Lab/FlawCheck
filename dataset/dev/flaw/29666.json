{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the presence and influence of Khalistani supporters at Rahul Gandhi's event by stating that they \"reached\" the meeting and raised slogans in support of the Congress party.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that Khalistani supporters participated in the event. The provided video and statements from individuals who gatecrashed the event do not establish widespread participation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of individuals chanting anti-India and pro-Khalistan slogans at the event, such as their personal beliefs or motivations unrelated to the Congress party.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of Khalistani supporters at the event reflects the views or affiliations of Rahul Gandhi or the Congress party, which may be a problematic assumption without further evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its attempt to link the presence of Khalistani supporters at the event to the Congress party's rule in India, as it does not provide a clear connection or explanation for this association.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the event was interrupted by protesters who managed to evade security, suggesting that their participation was not planned or endorsed by the organizers.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
