{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that there is a sculpture of Jakarta's ex-governor Ahok at Madame Tussauds, which may be an exaggeration if there is no evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the existence of the sculpture at Madame Tussauds.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image shared on Facebook is a sculpture of Ahok at Madame Tussauds, without verifying its authenticity.", "Contradict fact": "If there is evidence or information that contradicts the claim, such as the image being an advertisement for an action figure, it could be considered a contradiction to the claim."}
