{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the endorsement from Club for Growth Wisconsin, as the organization has stated that it does not get involved in federal elections and takes no position on federal candidates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Club for Growth Wisconsin has endorsed the candidate, as the organization has stated that it does not endorse federal candidates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the endorsement from Terry and Mary Kohler, founding members of Club for Growth Wisconsin, translates to an endorsement from the organization itself, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be an alternative explanation for Thompson's claim, as his campaign spokesperson argued that he was referring to the Kohlers as founding members of the state group, rather than the organization itself."}
