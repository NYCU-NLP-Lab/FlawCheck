{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in earnings between CEOs and ordinary workers by stating that CEOs make more in 10 minutes than workers make in a year. While it is true that some CEOs earn significantly higher salaries, the exact comparison provided in the claim may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that CEOs make more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers make in a year. The expert's research found reports that provide some comparisons, but none specifically supporting the 10-minute timeframe mentioned in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the difference in earnings between CEOs and ordinary workers is an indication that something is wrong. This assumption may be subjective and open to interpretation, as it does not provide specific criteria or context for determining what is considered \"wrong.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the difference in earnings between CEOs and ordinary workers, such as differences in job responsibilities, skills, or market demand. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and presents the difference as inherently problematic."}
