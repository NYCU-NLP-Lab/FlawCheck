{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential savings for average middle-class families by stating that they will save $3,000 each and every year on their health care bills without providing enough evidence or support.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that \"study after study has shown\" the average middle-class families will save $3,000 each year. The expert points out that the latest Medicare for All bill is silent about the taxes needed to pay for it, and Sanders' website only offers some options without a specific proposal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the savings from eliminating insurance premiums will be enough to offset the potential impact of higher taxes required to fund Medicare for All. The expert notes that this assumption is a main fear about the plan.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that credible studies raise questions about Sanders' belief that a single-payer program would save trillions of dollars in overall health care spending, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations or factors to consider.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the latest Medicare for All bill does not specify the taxes needed to pay for the plan, and Sanders' website only offers options without a specific proposal. This contradicts the claim's statement that \"study after study has shown\" the savings for middle-class families.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact of higher taxes to pay for Medicare for All, which the expert mentions as a main fear about the plan. The claim focuses on the potential savings for middle-class families without adequately addressing the potential cost implications."}
