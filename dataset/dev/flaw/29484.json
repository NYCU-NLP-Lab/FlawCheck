{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mahesh Bhatt's anger is directly related to the number of dislikes on the trailer of his film 'Sadak 2' on YouTube, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any concrete evidence or sources to support the assertion that Mahesh Bhatt is angry because of the dislikes on the trailer.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video in question was uploaded on December 4, 2019, which means it cannot be related to the release of 'Sadak 2'.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Mahesh Bhatt's behavior in the video, other than being angry about the dislikes on the trailer, but the claim does not consider or explore these possibilities."}
