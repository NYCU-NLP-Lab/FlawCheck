{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money that will be funneled annually to private insurance companies, as the expert's verdict states that the accurate figure is $95 billion, not over $100 billion.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim or expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the health care law is a pro-insurance-industry plan and that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model would have been better. This assumption is not supported by the expert's verdict, which states that the law is not a government takeover of health care.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation provided in the claim or expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the health care law is not a government takeover of health care, but rather adds regulations and subsidies to the existing private sector system.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information."}
