{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of barriers on apprehensions by stating \"massive drops\" and specific percentages (90-95%) without providing sufficient evidence or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the statement that the barriers were the sole cause of the massive drops in apprehensions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the barriers were the primary factor in reducing apprehensions, without considering other possible contributing factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in apprehensions, such as changes in border patrol strategies or economic factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the downward trend in apprehensions started before the passage of the Secure Fence Act of 2006, suggesting that other factors may have played a significant role.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by attributing the decrease in apprehensions solely to the barriers, without acknowledging other factors at play.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting the data selectively, focusing on the sectors with the highest decreases in apprehensions while ignoring other sectors that may not have experienced the same impact."}
