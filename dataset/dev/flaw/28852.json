{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the list of Nigerian politicians banned from entering the US. The claim presents the list as official and definitive, but it is not confirmed by the US government.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to validate the existence and accuracy of the list. The US embassy has not disclosed any names or confirmed the authenticity of the list.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the list of banned politicians is a result of their support for President Buhari's re-election bid. However, there is no direct evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the visa restrictions on Nigerians, such as involvement in election-related violence or undermining the democratic process, rather than solely being based on support for a particular candidate. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
