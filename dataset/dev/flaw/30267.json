{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that over 200,000 Biden votes are illegitimate in Wisconsin.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the ballots in question were backed by Biden, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the court ruling stated votes were only invalid if the individual casting them falsely claimed to be indefinitely confined, and not all of the votes in question were deemed illegitimate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the court ruling by stating it as a \"historic moment to save the country,\" without providing adequate context or evidence.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the court ruling actually rejected a lawsuit from Trump seeking to invalidate votes en masse, which goes against the claim's implication that the ruling supported Trump's position.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations or interpretations of the court ruling, such as the possibility that the ruling was specific to individual cases and not a blanket declaration of illegitimacy for all the votes in question.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on social media posts that misstate court rulings, which indicates a lack of reliable and accurate information."}
