{"Exaggerate": "The governor's claim exaggerates the number of New Jersey residents who have found work since he became governor. He claims that almost 90,000 people are back to work, but the actual number of residents who found employment is less than half of that figure.", "Lack enough support": "The governor's claim lacks enough support as it is based on job numbers rather than the number of employed residents. The job numbers do not necessarily reflect the number of people who have returned to work.", "Problematic assumption": "The governor's claim assumes that the increase in job numbers directly translates to an increase in employed residents. However, the expert points out that a job created in a state does not necessarily mean an unemployed resident returned to work.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests an alternative explanation for the increase in job numbers, stating that the growing unemployment rate in New Jersey may be due to more people actively seeking work, rather than an actual increase in employment."}
