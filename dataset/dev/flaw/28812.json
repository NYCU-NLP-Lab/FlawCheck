{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the bloodied Quran and the Christchurch mosque attack, as the image was already online in September 2018 and cannot have been taken after the attack.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that the bloodied Quran was found at the scene of the Christchurch mosque attack.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bloodied Quran is related to the attack without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the origin of the bloodied Quran, such as it being taken in Somalia after a US drone strike on Al-Shabab militants.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image was already online in September 2018, which makes it impossible for it to be from the Christchurch mosque attack."}
