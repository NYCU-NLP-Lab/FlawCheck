{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of Kevin Nicholson's involvement in advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people. The article states that Nicholson worked as a consultant for these companies but does not specify if he provided consulting on the decisions to close the plants or conduct layoffs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people. The article mentions that Nicholson reported being paid $362,417 in salary and $808,180 in fees from 27 clients between January 2016 and November 2017, but it does not specify how much he was paid for the companies involved in the layoffs and shutdowns.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kevin Nicholson's consulting work directly contributed to the decisions of companies to shut down plants and lay off employees. The article does not provide clear evidence of Nicholson's role in these decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the companies' decisions to shut down plants and lay off employees. It is possible that these decisions were driven by various factors beyond Nicholson's consulting work.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Nicholson's employer, ghSMART, stated that they have never advised clients on whether to close a plant or conduct employee layoffs. This contradicts the claim that Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies on these matters.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear connection between Nicholson's consulting work and the decisions of companies to shut down plants and lay off employees. The article mentions that Nicholson worked as a consultant for these companies but does not provide details on his specific involvement in those decisions.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
