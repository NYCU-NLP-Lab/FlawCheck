{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots by describing it as \"stunning\" and implying that it is highly unusual.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that November elections consistently have a lower ballot rejection rate due to the higher use of in-person early voting, which is assisted by clerks to avoid errors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that there was something questionable or improper about the low number of ballots rejected in the November election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the low rejection rate is evidence of a conspiracy or questionable tally without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the rejection rate in the November 2020 election was in line with the historic trend of lower rejection rates in November elections."}
