{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the Mueller report found \"no obstruction of justice\" when in fact, the report did not explicitly state that.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific references from the Mueller report to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump's tweet declaring \"No Collusion, No Obstruction\" and \"Complete and Total EXONERATION\" accurately represents the findings of the Mueller report, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the report did not explicitly state \"no obstruction\" and Mueller himself clarified that the report did not exonerate the president."}
