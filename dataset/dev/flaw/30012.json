{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of a statewide mask order by suggesting that it would require the individual to wear a mask in their own house or while walking their dog, which is not accurate according to the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that a statewide mask order would require the individual to wear a mask in their house or while walking their dog.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a statewide mask order would infringe on personal freedom and choice, without providing enough evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by clarifying that the mask order specifically exempts private residences and does not require masks in general outdoor areas where one would walk a dog."}
