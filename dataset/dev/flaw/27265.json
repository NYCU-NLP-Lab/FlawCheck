{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the prosecutor's intentions by stating that she wants to release all 90 convicted murderers serving life sentences, when in fact she plans to review the cases and seek commutation for only a select few.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the prosecutor's actions by not fully explaining that the review will focus on cases from the 1970s and 1980s, and that the release of any inmates would require approval from the governor and the state Parole Board.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the prosecutor is actively seeking the release of the 90 inmates. The article only mentions that she plans to review the cases and seek commutation for some.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the prosecutor's review of the cases will automatically lead to the release of the convicted murderers, without considering the legal process and requirements for commutation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the prosecutor's decision to review the cases, such as a desire to ensure that appropriate sentences were given or to address potential flaws in the criminal justice system. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
