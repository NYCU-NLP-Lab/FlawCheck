{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that global warming is supported by a long-standing scientific consensus.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the 58 peer-reviewed papers, presenting them as evidence that global warming is a myth.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the analysis of the findings presented in the blog post is crude, misinformed, and riddled with errors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the graphs from the 58 studies prove that current climatological changes are neither dramatic nor man-made, without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations and interpretations of the data presented in the 58 studies, as confirmed by the responses of the authors who disagreed with the analysis presented by Breitbart and No Tricks Zone."}
