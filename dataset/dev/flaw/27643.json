{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the consequences of not linking SIM cards to national ID numbers by stating that users will risk disconnection. It is possible that there may be other consequences, but the claim does not provide enough information to support this.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear timeline for the deadline extension. It mentions that the deadline was extended to January 2021 for those who already had NINs and to February 2021 for those who did not, but it does not specify the exact dates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully explain the difficulties faced by the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) in handling the influx of people crowding enrollment centers due to the coronavirus pandemic. It briefly mentions that some workers have gone on strike and that a large number of Nigerians have been infected with Covid-19, but it does not provide further details or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by stating that a Twitter account claiming to belong to the NIMC started publishing false claims about the registration process. While the claim mentions that the account is a parody account and that the NIMC has rejected it as a hoax, it does not provide concrete evidence or examples of the false claims.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for the requirement of linking SIM cards to national ID numbers. It only presents the official requirement and the potential consequences of not complying."}
