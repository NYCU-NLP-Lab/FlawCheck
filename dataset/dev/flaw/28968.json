{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or references to support the correlation between marijuana and psychosis, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a direct causal relationship between marijuana use and the development of schizophrenia, without considering other potential factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the increased risk of developing schizophrenia, other than marijuana use.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential risks or negative effects of marijuana use on mental health by only mentioning psychosis, schizophrenia, and psychotic disorders, without considering other potential mental health issues.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by state Sen. Melissa Agard, who claims that youth usage of marijuana has actually gone down in states that have fully legalized it. This suggests a contradiction in the relationship between marijuana use and the risk of developing psychotic disorders.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by not providing a comprehensive overview of the research on the topic or acknowledging any conflicting evidence or studies.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the risk of developing schizophrenia by stating that the risk increases threefold in teenagers, without providing specific data or statistics to support this claim."}
