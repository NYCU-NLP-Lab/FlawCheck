{"Contradict fact": "The claim made by Roy Blunt that under H.R. 1, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would have a partisan composition with three members from one side and two from the other is directly contradicted by the language of H.R. 1, which states that no more than two members may be affiliated with the same political party.", "Lack enough support": "The claim made by Roy Blunt lacks enough support as it is directly contradicted by the language of H.R. 1, which clearly states the composition of the FEC.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim made by Roy Blunt assumes that the fifth member of the FEC, who would be unaffiliated with either political party, may show partisan leanings. However, this assumption is not supported by any evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation for proposing an alternate design for the FEC under H.R. 1 is the history of dysfunction and gridlock caused by the current partisan composition of the FEC. The drafters of H.R. 1 aimed to address this issue by proposing a new composition for the commission."}
