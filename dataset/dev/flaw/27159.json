{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the effects of Jon Huntsman's support for changes in Medicare by stating that it would deny guaranteed benefits to 980,000 New Hampshire residents. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim uses the loaded word \"guaranteed\" and that the Ryan plan provides few details about the benefits.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Jon Huntsman supports changes in Medicare that would deny guaranteed benefits to 980,000 New Hampshire residents. The expert's verdict mentions that Huntsman considers the Ryan plan a \"good step forward\" and has not distanced himself from it, but it does not provide direct evidence of his support for denying guaranteed benefits.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Jon Huntsman supports changes in Medicare that would deny guaranteed benefits to 980,000 New Hampshire residents. The expert's verdict confirms that Huntsman considers the Ryan plan a \"good step forward,\" but it does not explicitly state his stance on denying guaranteed benefits.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for Jon Huntsman's stance on Medicare changes, so this bias does not apply.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Ryan plan would not completely end Medicare but would make fundamental changes to the program. The expert's verdict mentions that the Ryan plan turns Medicare into a defined contribution program, which would change the nature of the benefits.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in terms of presenting accurate information."}
