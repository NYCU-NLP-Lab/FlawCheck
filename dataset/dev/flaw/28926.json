The expert's verdict mentions that SAA is cash-strapped and on its last legs after years of mismanagement and debt.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an inaccurate representation of the video and its context. The expert's verdict clarifies that the video is not related to a final fly-by for SAA but was taken during a practice for the presidential inauguration flypast.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the video, such as it being from a different event or occasion. The expert's verdict provides the alternative explanation that the video is from a rehearsal for the presidential inauguration flypast."}
