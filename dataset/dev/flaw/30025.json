{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Kamala Harris and other Democratic senators by stating that they \"voted to let babies scream until they die if born alive.\" This is an extreme and exaggerated characterization of their votes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that Harris and other senators voted in favor of allowing babies to die if born alive. The expert's verdict provides information about the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protections Act and the actual implications of the senators' votes, which contradict the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the senators' votes were in support of letting babies die if born alive, without considering the complexities and nuances of the legislation and the senators' intentions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for the senators' votes, stating that their intention was to preserve the legal status quo rather than allowing babies to die. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion."}
