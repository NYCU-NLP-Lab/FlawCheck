{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that there are hundreds of bubble tea pearls inside the teenage girl's stomach. The claim is based on an X-ray image circulating on social media, but there is no additional information or verification provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of bubble tea pearls in the girl's stomach is the cause of her digestive issues. While doctors deduced that the shadows in the CT scan were undigested tapioca pearls, it is not explicitly stated that these pearls were the direct cause of her symptoms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Some viewers and doctors expressed skepticism about the image and questioned how tapioca pearls could show up on a CT scan. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the shadows seen in the scan, casting doubt on the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of consuming a large quantity of tapioca balls, as mentioned by Dr. Lina Felipez. While she acknowledges that eating a lot of tapioca balls could cause constipation, she also notes that the balls typically contain other additives that can contribute to digestive issues.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that tapioca, guar gum, and other ingredients typically used in bubble tea would not show up on a CT scan, as stated by Dr. Felipez. This challenges the assumption made in the claim that the shadows seen in the CT scan are undigested tapioca pearls."}
