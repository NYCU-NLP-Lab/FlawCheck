{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it provides only four photos without any additional evidence or context to support the assertion that they show anti-racism protesters in the US.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos are evidence of anti-racism protests in the US without providing any concrete proof or verification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the photos, such as the possibility that they were taken during protests in other countries or unrelated events.", "Contradict fact": "One of the photos is proven to be from a protest in Hong Kong in October 2019, contradicting the claim that all the photos show anti-racism protesters in the US.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance or impact of the anti-racism protests in the US by only presenting a limited number of photos without providing a broader context or analysis of the protests.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its presentation of evidence and information, as it includes misleading photos and fails to provide sufficient verification or background for the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it simply presents four photos without making any specific claims about the scale or intensity of the protests."}
