{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, equating it with winning the prize itself.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize, suggesting that only two individuals (Obama and Trump) were nominated, when in fact there are 318 candidates for the 2020 prize.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the media ignored Trump's nomination, as there were reports and discussions about it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that media attention for Obama's nomination was solely due to the nomination itself, rather than his subsequent win of the Nobel Peace Prize.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the fact that media attention for Obama's nomination may have been influenced by factors other than the nomination itself, such as his position as the President of the United States."}
