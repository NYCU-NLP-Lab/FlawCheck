{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Biden's executive order by stating that it \"destroyed\" 11,000 jobs without providing concrete evidence of the exact number of jobs that would have been filled without the order.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that 11,000 jobs were directly eliminated as a result of Biden's order. The exact number of jobs affected remains unknown.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 11,000 projected jobs would have been filled without any hindrances or challenges, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the potential job losses, including multiple hurdles for pipeline proponents."}
