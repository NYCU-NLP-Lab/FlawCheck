The expert's verdict clarifies that Northam was an ex officio member of the board and had no direct role in the grant process.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Northam's involvement in the state agency automatically makes him responsible for the grant. The expert's verdict clarifies that the agency's professional staff has discretion over grant awards, and the final approval authority lies with the governor.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the grant, such as the role of the agency's professional staff and the discretion of the governor.
