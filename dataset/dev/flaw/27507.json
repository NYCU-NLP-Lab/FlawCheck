{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Mary Burke's budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion, which may not accurately reflect the actual increase in taxes.", "Lack enough support": "The expert points out that the claim does not provide enough evidence or support to establish a direct connection between Mary Burke and the tax hike mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mary Burke was solely responsible for the tax hike in the state budget, which may not be entirely accurate or fair.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that attributing the entire budget to Mary Burke is misleading, as it was a collaborative effort by elected officials and not solely determined by her.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the state budget is set by elected officials, not appointed Cabinet secretaries, which undermines the assertion that the budget was solely Burke's responsibility."}
