{"Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of people in Missouri without degrees. The claim states that \"65 to 70 percent of the people in Missouri don\u2019t have degrees,\" but according to the data from the Missouri Department of Higher Education, only 39.9 percent of working age adults had an associate degree or higher in 2017.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that \"65 to 70 percent of the people in Missouri don\u2019t have degrees.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the need for professionals with four-year degrees, such as the specific requirements and qualifications needed for certain professions or industries. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the percentage of Missourians with degrees has been steadily increasing over the years, as mentioned in the expert's verdict. The claim implies that the percentage of people without degrees is high and remains constant, while the data shows an increase in educational attainment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the need for professionals with four-year degrees is separate from the need for other skilled professionals without degrees. It does not consider the importance of vocational or technical training in certain industries.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the need for professionals with four-year degrees by stating that \"we are always going to need architects, doctors, we\u2019re going to need professionals with four-year degrees.\" While these professions may require four-year degrees, it does not necessarily mean that the majority of jobs in Missouri require such degrees.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a clear definition of what constitutes a \"degree.\" It does not specify whether it includes associate degrees, technical certifications, or other forms of post-secondary education."}
