{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of new jobs in Texas by comparing it to the entire population of Fort Worth. The claim implies that the number of new jobs is larger than it actually is.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not considering the more recent job numbers, which show a decrease in the net job gain. This information was not included in the ad.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement. It relies on general statements about job gains in Texas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the comparison of job gains to the population of Fort Worth is a meaningful and relevant comparison, without providing any explanation or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the job gains in Texas, such as economic factors or policies that may have contributed to the increase in employment."}
