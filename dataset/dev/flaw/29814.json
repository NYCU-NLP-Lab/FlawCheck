{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the tax cuts by stating that 70 percent of businesses in Florida don't pay a business tax. The actual percentage is closer to 76.8 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to back up the assertion that 70 percent of businesses don't pay a business tax.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that cutting business taxes is the sole reason for the high percentage of businesses not paying a business tax, without considering other factors such as pre-existing exemptions for small businesses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the fact that a significant portion of the exempt businesses were already exempt from the corporate income tax before Governor Scott's tenure."}
