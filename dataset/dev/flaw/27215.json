{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the issue of contaminated water in California by stating that there are \"tens of thousands of homes\" where the water cannot be consumed. The evidence provided in the expert's verdict suggests that the number may be lower than that.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that there are tens of thousands of homes in California with undrinkable water. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no official tally or comprehensive data on the number of households or individuals facing this issue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the availability of clean water is solely linked to the use of hydraulic fracking. While fracking can have environmental implications, it may not be the only factor contributing to the problem of undrinkable water in California.", "Alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the undrinkable water issue in California. The expert's verdict mentions that violations in water systems do not necessarily mean that households don't have drinkable tap water, and different areas within California may have varying levels of contamination.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a comprehensive and accurate picture of the issue of undrinkable water in California. The expert's verdict suggests that the claim oversimplifies the problem and fails to consider the complexities involved in assessing the scale and severity of the issue."}
