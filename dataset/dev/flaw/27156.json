{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Ted Cruz denied ever calling Social Security a \"Ponzi scheme\" when there is evidence of him doing so in a 2011 interview.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides one piece of evidence from a 2011 interview, but it does not provide any further evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ted Cruz's denial in the debate is true, without considering the evidence of his previous statements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Cruz's denial, as he argues that the \"Ponzi scheme\" comment was made by another Republican and not himself."}
