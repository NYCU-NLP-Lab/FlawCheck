{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money a university medical school would pay for the donation of a testicle. The expert's verdict mentions that the rumor has morphed into the idea that men could sell one of their testicles for a hefty fee, but there is no evidence or support provided for the specific amount of $50,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to prove the existence of a university medical school paying for the donation of a testicle. The expert's verdict mentions rumors and anecdotes but does not provide any concrete evidence or examples of such transactions taking place.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a university medical school would be willing to pay for the donation of a testicle. However, the expert's verdict explains that U.S. law prohibits the sale of organs, including less-desirable options like corneas or lungs. It is a problematic assumption to believe that a university medical school would be involved in such transactions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the rumor, mentioning the shift in rumors from selling whole bodies to selling organs for transplantation. This suggests that the claim may be based on a misunderstanding or distortion of information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that U.S. law prohibits the sale of organs, including testicles. The expert's verdict mentions that most potential donors are aware of this restriction.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the provided claim."}
