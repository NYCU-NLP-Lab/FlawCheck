{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which judges receive better benefits at a lower cost than everyone else in the state. The expert's verdict states that recent retirees from the judicial pension system collected the largest average annual benefit, but it does not provide a direct comparison to benefits received by other public employees.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough supporting evidence to fully validate the statement that judges receive better benefits at a lower cost. While the expert's verdict provides some data on the average annual pension benefit collected by recent retirees from the judicial pension system, it does not provide comprehensive data on the benefits received by all public employees in the state.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that judges are part of an elite, special class of citizens who receive better benefits at a lower cost. This assumption may oversimplify the complexities of the pension system and the factors that determine the benefits received by different groups of public employees.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the differences in benefits received by judges compared to other public employees. It does not explore factors such as occupation, salary, years of service, and the specific requirements of the judicial role that may contribute to the differences in benefits."}
