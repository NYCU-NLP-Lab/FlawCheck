{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that cities and counties saw larger revenue declines than states, while the claim only focuses on state revenues.", "Understate": "The claim understates the depth of the decline in state revenues, as the expert's verdict mentions that aggregate state revenues dropped 1.6% from the same period a year earlier.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement that states are seeing increases in revenue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in revenue in some states is representative of the overall financial situation across all states, without considering the variations and disparities in revenue changes among different states.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the reported positive growth in some states, such as specific economic factors or policy changes that may have contributed to the increase in revenue.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the positive growth by including California as an example, which was an outlier with tax receipts rising 3.5%, while other states like Florida and Texas saw significant drops in revenue.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting inconsistent information, as it initially states that states are seeing increases in revenue, but later acknowledges that overall state revenues fell 0.12%."}
