{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as exaggerated because it states that individuals who are black or brown are \"nine times more likely to be stopped and frisked\" in New York City. The available data suggests that the adjusted figure is closer to 4.8 times more likely.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion. The expert had to provide additional information and sources to validate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the higher likelihood of being stopped and frisked for black or brown individuals is solely due to racial bias. It does not consider other factors that may contribute to the disparity, such as higher crime rates in certain neighborhoods.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge the possibility of alternative explanations for the higher rates of stops and frisks for black or brown individuals. It does not consider factors such as crime rates, suspicious behavior, or other demographic factors that may influence police actions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the adjusted figure for black and Latino individuals being frisked compared to whites is closer to 4.8 times, rather than the originally stated nine times.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered as understating the issue by not fully addressing the racial disparities in stop-and-frisk practices. The adjusted figure still indicates a significant disparity, even if it is lower than the original claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing accurate and complete information. The expert had to clarify that the claim specifically refers to New York City, which was not initially mentioned, and provide additional estimates and sources to support the claim."}
