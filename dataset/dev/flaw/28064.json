{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Press Information Bureau (PIB) did not provide any medical reports to support its claim that the deceased migrant workers had pre-existing conditions or were undergoing treatment. This lack of supporting evidence suggests a bias towards lacking enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict highlights that the PIB's claim contradicted the accounts given by the family members of the deceased workers. This suggests a bias towards making problematic assumptions without considering alternative explanations or gathering all the relevant information.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict points out that the PIB's fact-checking tweets contradicted the accounts given by the family members of the deceased workers. This indicates a bias towards contradicting the facts presented by reliable sources.", "Understate": "Although not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, the fact that the PIB's claim was contradicted by the family members' accounts suggests a potential bias towards understating the severity of the migrant workers' situation and the causes of their deaths.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the PIB missed facts in its fact-checking and contradicted the accounts given by the family members. This suggests a bias towards occasionally faltering in accurately assessing and verifying information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations by highlighting the accounts given by the family members of the deceased workers, which contradicted the PIB's claim. This suggests a bias towards recognizing the existence of alternative explanations that challenge the initial claim."}
