{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the woman was removed from the bathroom because she wasn't feminine enough. The video itself does not provide clear context or details about the incident.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the woman was targeted because she wasn't feminine enough, without considering other possible reasons for her removal from the bathroom.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the incident by linking it directly to the controversial HB2 bill in North Carolina, even though there is no clear evidence connecting the two.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the expert's verdict, which states that the video was unrelated to HB2 and most likely not recorded in North Carolina. This suggests that the claim is not based on accurate information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the incident depicted in the video, such as jurisdictional issues or unknown circumstances. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
