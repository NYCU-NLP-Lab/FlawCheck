{"Understate": "The claim understates the decrease in the corporation tax rate during Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister. It states that the rate fell from 52% to 34%, but it fails to mention the actual lowest rate of 28% that was reached during that period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its statement. It does not provide any specific data or sources to verify the stated corporation tax rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct correlation between the decrease in the corporation tax rate and the amount of tax collected. However, the expert's verdict highlights that this assumption is uncertain and that the government's own estimates suggest that they could have collected more without making changes to the tax rate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that other factors, such as measures to lower capital allowances or reduce tax avoidance, have offset the cuts to corporation tax rates. This alternative explanation is not acknowledged in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Labour is planning to raise corporation tax to a rate lower than it was in 2010. This contradicts the statement in the claim that the rate fell during Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the decrease in the corporation tax rate by not providing a comprehensive analysis of other factors influencing tax collection."}
