{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Donald Trump used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. While it is true that he hired 200 undocumented Polish workers for the demolition phase of the project, it is unclear if he continued to use undocumented labor throughout the construction process.", "Understate": "The claim may also be seen as understating the issue by focusing solely on the Trump Tower project. There is evidence to suggest that Trump's alleged use of undocumented workers has continued beyond that project.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to conclusively prove that Trump used undocumented labor for the entire construction of the Trump Tower. The evidence provided only pertains to the hiring of 200 undocumented Polish workers for the demolition phase.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump knowingly used undocumented labor and deliberately underpaid them. While there are reports of Trump allegedly seeking out the workers and threatening to contact immigration services during a wage dispute, it is unclear if he was aware of their immigration status from the beginning.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the use of undocumented labor, such as the contractor hiring them without Trump's direct knowledge or involvement. The claim does not explore these possibilities."}
