{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of illegal voters allowed to register in Florida by stating that Kurt Browning allowed 1,800 illegal voters to register. The actual number was much lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a campaign mailer from Heather Fiorentino without providing any concrete evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the individuals flagged as potential noncitizen voters were all illegal voters. However, further investigation revealed that many of them were U.S. citizens.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the presence of noncitizen voters on the list, such as individuals who obtained their citizenship after getting their last driver's license.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on flawed methodology and flawed data, which led to the Department of State instructing supervisors of elections to stop using the list of potential noncitizen voters.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual number of illegal voters allowed to register in Florida, as the final number of verified noncitizen voters was lower than the initial estimate of 2,600."}
