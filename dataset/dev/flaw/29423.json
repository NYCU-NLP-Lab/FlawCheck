{"Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on two studies that have been criticized for flawed methodologies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a static proportion of left and right-handed people throughout time, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Critics argue that historical records suggest that many people who were born in the early 1900s may have been pressured to become right-handed, which could affect the accuracy of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times due to the flaws in the methodologies used in the studies.", "Contradict fact": "There is a contradiction to the claim as the studies mentioned in the expert's verdict show a statistically significant but relatively small difference in lifespan between left and right-handers.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in lifespan between left and right-handed people based on the studies mentioned."}
