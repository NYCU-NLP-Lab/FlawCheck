{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the protest against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Saudi Arabia for atrocities against Indian Muslims. The image used in the claim has been doctored to include Modi's photo on a poster, which originally showed the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The original photo was from a protest against Moscow's support of the Syrian regime outside the Russian embassy in Kuwait in December 2016.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image used is manipulated and does not represent a genuine protest against Modi in Saudi Arabia.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a doctored image and misrepresents the actual event that took place in Kuwait in 2016.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the protest depicted in the image was not related to Indian Muslims or atrocities committed by Modi but was instead a demonstration against Moscow's support of the Syrian regime.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the protest shown in the manipulated image is evidence of atrocities against Indian Muslims by Modi, which is a problematic assumption given the misleading nature of the image.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times bias in this claim."}
