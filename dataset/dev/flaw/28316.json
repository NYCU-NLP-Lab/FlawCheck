{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of money Marco Rubio spent on remodeling offices and building a members-only lounge. The expert's verdict mentions that Rubio ordered almost $560,000 in renovations, but the claim states it as $400,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement that Marco Rubio spent $400,000 of taxpayer money on remodeling offices and building a members-only lounge.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that spending taxpayer money on remodeling offices and building a members-only lounge is inherently problematic or wasteful. However, the expert's verdict mentions that it is common for incoming speakers to make renovations to the chambers as they see fit.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Marco Rubio spent money on remodeling offices and building a members-only lounge. The expert's verdict mentions that Rubio wanted to provide a convenient dining option for lawmakers and that previous speakers had also made renovations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Marco Rubio spent almost $560,000 on renovations, according to records from the Speaker's Office, not just $400,000 as stated in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the amount of money spent by previous speakers on renovations. The expert's verdict mentions that John Thrasher spent almost $7 million in 1999, and Daniel Webster spent about $100,000 in 1997.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of the facts and context surrounding Marco Rubio's spending on renovations."}
