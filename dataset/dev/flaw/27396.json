{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that the utility pole has been buried in 40 feet of snow, but there is no evidence to support this depth. The actual depth of the snow burying the pole is unknown.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or information to support the assertion that the utility pole has been buried in 40 feet of snow.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the man in the photograph is standing on top of the 40 feet of snow. However, the expert states that it is highly unlikely that this is the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that there is another image from the State Historical Society of North Dakota that shows a much smaller utility pole next to the railroad. This suggests that the pole in the photograph may not be as tall as claimed."}
