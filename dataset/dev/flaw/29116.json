{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of student deaths in schools by only including incidents resulting in fatalities, without considering non-fatal injuries or psychological harm.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between student deaths in schools and soldiers in combat zones. It is unclear if the comparison includes all schools and combat zones or only specific ones.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of student deaths in schools is directly comparable to the number of soldiers killed in combat zones, without considering differences in population size, exposure to violence, or other contextual factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the difference in the number of student deaths in schools and soldiers killed in combat zones, such as differences in security measures, training, or the nature of the environments.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been more deaths in combat zones than the number stated in the claim, as the expert's verdict mentions a total of 13 service members killed in combat zones in 2018.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive and accurate comparison between student deaths in schools and soldiers killed in combat zones."}
