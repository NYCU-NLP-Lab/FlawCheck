{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the statement that Bill Clinton signed a law \"very similar to\" Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act and Barack Obama voted for a law \"something like\" it in Illinois.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Indiana law is similar to the federal law signed by Bill Clinton and the Illinois law backed by Barack Obama without providing sufficient evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the Indiana law may not be as similar to the federal law or the Illinois law as claimed, as indicated by the concerns raised by opponents of the Indiana law and the statement issued by the head coaches of the Final Four basketball championship.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal law signed by Bill Clinton did not apply to states, which led to states passing their own versions of the law. This contradicts the claim that the Indiana law is \"very similar to\" the federal law.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the similarities between the Indiana law and the federal law signed by Bill Clinton and the Illinois law backed by Barack Obama, as it does not provide specific details or evidence to support the claim of similarity."}
