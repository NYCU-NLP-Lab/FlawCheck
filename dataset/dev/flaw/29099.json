{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no specific evidence provided to back up the statement that \"every one of more than 30 federal judges\" ruled in favor of marriage as a constitutional right for all.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of federal judges who have ruled in favor of marriage as a constitutional right. The expert's analysis suggests that the count may not be as high as 30.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ruling of federal judges on gay and lesbian rights is a consensus and that there are no alternative opinions or dissenting judgments.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in accurately representing the number and scope of federal judges' rulings on gay and lesbian rights.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the rulings of federal judges on gay and lesbian rights, such as the influence of the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act in June 2013."}
