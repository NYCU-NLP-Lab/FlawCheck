{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential impact of Mitt Romney's policies on Medicare, stating that it could end as we know it and leave Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance, resulting in an extra cost of $6,350 per year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mitt Romney's position on Medicare would lead to the end of Medicare as we know it and result in a voucher system, without providing sufficient evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to back up the assertion that Medicare could end under Mitt Romney's policies and that Julia would be left with only a voucher to buy insurance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or potential alternative policies that Mitt Romney might have regarding Medicare, which could impact the accuracy and validity of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that both the Wyden-Ryan and Romney plans for Medicare offer traditional Medicare inside a new premium-support system, rather than completely ending Medicare and leaving individuals with only a voucher system."}
