{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Democratic protesters \"stormed\" the U.S. Capitol in 2018, when in reality they were protesting in the Wisconsin state capitol building.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details about the alleged Democratic protesters storming the U.S. Capitol in 2018.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the protests against Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation in 2018 were similar to the violent insurrection by Donald Trump supporters in 2021, which is a problematic assumption as the two events were fundamentally different in nature and scale.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo shared by Ted Nugent does not depict the alleged Democratic protesters storming the U.S. Capitol, but rather shows protesters in the Wisconsin state capitol building.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information and conflating different events (the 2011 protests in Wisconsin and the 2018 protests against Kavanaugh's confirmation) with the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation bias in the provided claim."}
