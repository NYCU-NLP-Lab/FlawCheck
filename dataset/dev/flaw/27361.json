{"Understate": "The expert's verdict may understate the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission from gas pump handles. While they acknowledge that gas pump handles are a potential source of surface contact transmission, they also state that there have been no substantiated reports of anyone being infected in that fashion yet. This understates the possibility that transmission could occur through gas pumps.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no substantiated reports of anyone being infected with COVID-19 through gas pump handles. The expert's verdict mentions that they are not aware of any credible reports of COVID-19 being spread via gas pump handles.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the COVID-19 coronavirus is spreading quickly from gas pumps. There is no concrete evidence or data provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that gas pumps are only one of many commonly handled objects that could transmit the COVID-19 coronavirus. This implies that there could be alternative explanations for the spread of the virus, and gas pumps may not be the primary or sole source of transmission.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been no substantiated reports of anyone being infected with COVID-19 through gas pump handles. The expert's verdict mentions that they have found no substantiated reports of such infections.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the speed at which the COVID-19 coronavirus is spreading from gas pumps. The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or data to support the claim that the virus is spreading quickly from gas pumps.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict falters at times in providing a clear and definitive answer regarding the transmission of COVID-19 through gas pump handles. While they acknowledge the potential risk and lack of substantiated reports, they also mention that surface contact is one of the means of transmission and gas pumps are a potential route for the virus. This inconsistency in the verdict's stance may indicate a bias."}
