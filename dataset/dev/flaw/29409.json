Without proper evidence, it is not possible to confirm the extent of his injury.", "Understate": "There is no indication of any bias of understating in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication of the claim faltering at times, as it does not make any direct assertions or statements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation for the X-ray image or the alleged injury, so it is hard to determine if any bias exists in this regard."}
