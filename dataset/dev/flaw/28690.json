{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the toxicity of corpses infected with COVID-19 after 72 hours, stating that it is \"100 times more potent\" and poses a grave danger to anyone who comes close to the sealed casket/coffin.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential danger of handling and moving a body infected with COVID-19, as it mentions that it can cause expulsion of material from the airways and manipulation of respiratory organs, which can be potential dangers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough scientific evidence or support to prove that the toxicity of COVID-19 infected bodies increases significantly after 72 hours.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the longer the period after death, the lower the degree of infectivity, but this assumption is not supported by sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the expert, stating that the source of infection from COVID-19 positive bodies can be contaminated body surfaces or directly from the respiratory tract and organs, and proper procedures can eliminate the danger of infection."}
