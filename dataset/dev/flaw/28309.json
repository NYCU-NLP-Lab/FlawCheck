{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the achievements of Chris Christie's leadership, particularly in regards to education funding and merit pay for teachers. The ad gives the impression that these initiatives are widespread and successful across the state, when in reality they are only available in a limited number of districts and face opposition from the New Jersey Education Association.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement about \"the best job growth in 12 years.\" No evidence or data is provided to back up this claim, making it unsupported and potentially exaggerated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the achievements mentioned, such as balanced budgets and job growth, can be solely attributed to Chris Christie's leadership. It fails to consider other factors that may have contributed to these outcomes, such as national economic trends or policies implemented by previous administrations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim about education funding. While the claim states that it is the \"most education funding ever,\" it is important to note that this is based on Christie's proposed budget for fiscal year 2014, which has not been implemented yet. It is possible that future budgets or changes in funding priorities could result in even higher levels of education funding."}
