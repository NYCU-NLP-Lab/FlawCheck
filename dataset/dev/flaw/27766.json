{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of refugees accepted by the United States by referring to a specific and small subset of the total refugee population.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual number of refugees residing in the United States in 2013, which was about 264,000, or 2.3 percent of the total.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that the United States accepted 67 percent of the world's refugees in 2013.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by equating the United States' acceptance of a specific subset of refugees referred for resettlement by the UNHCR with accepting the world's refugees as a whole.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that most countries offering asylum for refugees are geographically close to war-torn states, which is why the United States doesn't have to directly deal with a majority of refugees."}
