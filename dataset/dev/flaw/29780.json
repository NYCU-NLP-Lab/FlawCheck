{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of missed votes by Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Bob Graham. The actual percentages are lower than what is stated in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the stated percentages of missed votes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the missed votes by Obama, Kerry, and Graham are comparable to Rubio's missed votes, implying a double standard. However, the circumstances and reasons for the missed votes may differ, making the comparison problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests a double standard between the mainstream media and the conservative movement without considering other factors that may have influenced the newspaper's endorsements or editorial decisions."}
