The expert's verdict points out that the boat sinking in the photograph actually occurred in Michigan, not during the Trump parade in Texas.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the photograph, such as the possibility that it was digitally manipulated or taken at a different event. The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by explaining that the boat sank in Michigan and the Trump flag was added to the image.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the boat in the photograph did not sink during the Trump parade.
