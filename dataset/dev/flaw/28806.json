{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the security upgrades by stating that an 8-foot-tall, electrified fence is being installed, while the exact height and electrification of the fence are unconfirmed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the fence is electrified or that it is exactly 8 feet tall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Governor Whitmer's previous criticism of the U.S.-Mexico border wall makes her hypocritical for receiving security upgrades at her residence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the security upgrades, such as reported security threats against Governor Whitmer, which are not fully explored in the claim."}
