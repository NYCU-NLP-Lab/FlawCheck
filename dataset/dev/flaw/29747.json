{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a partially mummified body found in the Atacama Desert without providing substantial evidence for the human-alien hybrid theory.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the strange skeleton found in the Atacama desert is a human-alien hybrid without sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the strange skeleton, such as it being a mummified stillborn baby or a human fetus, as suggested by other experts.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the significance of DNA testing and analysis, which revealed that the skeleton was that of a young human female, not a human-alien hybrid.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that DNA testing confirmed the skeleton to be human and traced its origin to an indigenous Indian from the Chilean area, rather than a distant galaxy.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting contradictory information and not providing a clear and consistent explanation for the anomalies in the skeleton's structure.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the significance of the 9% DNA mismatch, as it is suggested by experts that it could be the result of \"bad reads\" or \"machine error\" rather than indicating a human-alien hybrid."}
