{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of Atlanta households that pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent. The expert's verdict provides evidence that there are at least 27,000 households making $20,000 or less and another 13,000 households with incomes between $20,000 and $35,000 that spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing in 2012. However, the claim does not specify the exact number of households and only mentions \"tens of thousands,\" potentially understating the problem.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of specific data or sources to back up the statement. While the expert's verdict mentions a 2015 update of Atlanta's housing strategy report and the 2012 American Community Survey, the claim itself does not provide specific references or data sources to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations for why tens of thousands of Atlanta households may be paying more than 30 percent of their income towards rent. It does not explore other factors such as high housing costs, limited affordable housing options, or income inequality that could contribute to this issue."}
