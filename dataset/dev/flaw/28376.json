{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the Obama administration manipulated deportation data to make it appear that they were deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration. This could be seen as an exaggeration if the data manipulation is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on an enduring claim made by Lou Dobbs, but it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim of data manipulation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Obama administration intentionally manipulated deportation data, which may be a problematic assumption without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the difference in deportation numbers, such as a shift in immigration focus towards undocumented immigrants who commit crimes or are caught at the border. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the difference in deportation numbers, rather than intentional data manipulation."}
