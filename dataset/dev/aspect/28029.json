This information helps verify the accuracy of the claim by providing context on how capital gains taxes work.", "The expert clarifies that the exemption on home sales": "which allows individuals to avoid being taxed on the first $250,000 of profit if single or $500,000 if married, is not proposed to be changed by either McCain or Obama. This information supports the expert's verdict that the claim about Obama's 28 percent tax on all home sales is false.", "The expert points out that the e": "mail's assertion that McCain supports capital gains taxes of \"0 percent on home sales of up to $500,000 per home for couples\" is technically inaccurate. The expert explains that it is the profit made from the sale of the home that matters, not the sales price alone. This clarification further discredits the claim made in the e-mail."}
