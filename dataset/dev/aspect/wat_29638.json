{"The comparison of two images": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim involved a campaign advertisement on President Donald Trump's official Facebook account that presented a comparison of two images titled \"Public Safety\" and \"Chaos and Violence.\" This comparison was a crucial aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Analysis of the images": "Media outlets such as the BBC analyzed the images used in the advertisement and determined that the image on the right, depicting violence against a police officer, was not taken in 2020 and did not show an incident from the United States. Instead, it was a photograph taken in 2014 during a protest in Ukraine. This analysis played a significant role in verifying the claim.", "Confirmation from the photographer": "The expert's verdict mentions that the photographer of the image, Mstyslav Chernov, confirmed that the Trump ad indeed used his photograph from Ukraine in 2014. This confirmation from the photographer provided concrete evidence to support the claim's inauthenticity.", "Importance of media literacy": "The expert's verdict emphasizes the role of education and media literacy in combating manipulations like this. The photographer, Chernov, stated that with the rise of social media and populism, photography is increasingly used to manipulate public opinion. He stressed the need for independent truth discernment and media literacy to decrease the number of such manipulations. This aspect highlights the broader context of the claim and its implications for media literacy education."}
