{"Lack of evidence or reference": "The claim does not provide any evidence or reference to support the assertion that 60,000 Christians have been killed by Fulani Herdsmen in Nigeria since 2001. This lack of substantiation raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Origin and source of the claim": "The claim was uploaded to Facebook by Jay Sekulow, a personal lawyer to US President Donald Trump. It originates from the Be Heard Project, an initiative of the American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative Christian lobby group based in Washington DC. Understanding the source helps evaluate the potential biases or motivations behind the claim.", "Inconsistent figures and lack of credible evidence": "While other organizations have published similar figures of 60,000 deaths, none of them provide relevant studies or credible evidence to support these numbers. The African Centre for Strategic Studies, for example, combines two different statistics from separate time periods, and the evidence provided lacks credibility.", "Complex nature of the conflict": "The conflict between Fulani herders and farmers in Nigeria is a long-running issue over land and resources, occurring in the north central region known as the Middle Belt. The conflict is not solely based on religious lines, as the herders are mainly Muslim while the farmers are largely Christian. Understanding the complexity of the conflict helps in assessing the accuracy of claims related to religious killings."}
