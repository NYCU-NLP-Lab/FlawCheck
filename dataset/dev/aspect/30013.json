{"Survey of physicians": "The expert mentions that Kyrillos' campaign manager, Chapin Fay, pointed to a survey of physicians that found more than half of the respondents believed that health care reform would have a negative impact on their relationship with patients. However, the expert notes that this survey does not prove that the patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated.", "Value": "Based Payment Modifier: Fay also pointed to the \"value-based payment modifier under the physician fee schedule\" as evidence to support the claim. This modifier provides financial penalties or rewards to doctors serving Medicare patients based on the quality and cost of care delivered. However, it is not explicitly stated how this modifier would lead to the elimination of the patient-doctor relationship.", "Independent Payment Advisory Board": "IPAB): The expert mentions that Fay referred to the IPAB as one of the reasons why the patient-doctor relationship could be \"eliminated.\" The IPAB is a 15-member board that will recommend ways to prevent Medicare's spending growth from exceeding targets. While it has the power to decrease government payments to healthcare providers, it cannot recommend changes that would ration care or raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries.", "U": "S. Preventive Services Task Force: Fay also mentioned the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force as a factor that could contribute to the elimination of the patient-doctor relationship. This task force makes recommendations on clinical preventive services to primary care clinicians. However, it is not specified how these recommendations would directly lead to the elimination of the patient-doctor relationship."}
