{"The red flag was raised for the first time over the Holy Dome of Jamkaran Mosque in Qom": "Iran. This was confirmed by the mosque's press office and one of the administrators in charge of cultural affairs.", "The red flag is a symbol of revenge to come from Iran after the death of General Soleimani": "This claim was supported by multiple sources, including tweets in English and French, as well as large media outlets like the Daily Mail and the Times of India.", "The red flag": "symbolizing the blood of martyrs, is frequently raised in Iran, particularly during religious processions and the Islamic month of Muharram. It is often unfurled above mosques and is not necessarily indicative of revenge.", "The flag bears the Arabic phrase": "Ya la-Tharat al-Hussein,\" which translates to \"O ye avengers of Hussein.\" Hussein is a sacred figure in Shia Islam and is seen as the embodiment of justice. The flag's use at Jamkaran Mosque is relatively recent and is specifically related to the mourning of Muharram and the call for revenge for General Soleimani's death."}
