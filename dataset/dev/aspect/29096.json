This lack of supporting evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in dates and events": "The article states that the incident occurred on a Monday night in Philadelphia, but the date provided (July 30) does not align with the Redskins' game schedule. The expert's verdict points out that the Redskins had not started their pre-season yet, further highlighting the inconsistencies in the claim.", "Source credibility": "The claim originated from a clickbait site called Universaleinfo, which was flagged by Facebook for spreading false news and misinformation. The fact that the source has a reputation for publishing fabricated stories undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Historical context": "The expert's verdict mentions the NFL protests that started in 2016 and the involvement of the Washington Redskins players in kneeling during the anthem.
