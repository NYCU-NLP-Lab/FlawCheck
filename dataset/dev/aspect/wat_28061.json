{"The claim is based on a tweet by Congress leader Rajesh Mishra": "which states that Dr. Manmohan Singh was declared the most honest political leader in a list of the 50 most honest people in the world released in America.", "The claim has been widely circulated on Twitter and Facebook": "with thousands of likes, retweets, and shares.", "The claim is supported by a graphic made by the pro": "Congress page 'Viral In India', which has been circulating since 2018. However, it is important to note that this page is known for spreading disinformation.", "The claim is based on a half": "truth, as it is true that a photograph of Manmohan Singh was prominently featured in images shared by the White House photographer during a state event. However, these images were not a collection of \"honest\" world leaders, but rather behind-the-scenes glimpses of dinners hosted by President Obama. Narendra Modi did not feature in these photographs."}
