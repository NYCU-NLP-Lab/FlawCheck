{"The expert mentions that the ad was produced by Giffords": "an organization that fights gun violence and is named after former Arizona U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head in 2011. This establishes the source of the claim and the context in which it is being made.", "The expert explains that the claim refers to a law enacted by Gov": "Rick Scott in Florida that supposedly made it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun, even a mental health professional. The expert provides information about the specific law, known as the 'docs vs. glocks' law, which was intended to protect patient rights related to firearms.", "The expert clarifies that while the 2011 law did not explicitly state that doctors couldn": "t ask patients if they owned a gun, it did restrict their ability to do so by emphasizing that they should refrain from making written inquiries or asking questions about firearm ownership unless they believed it was relevant to the patient's medical care or safety.", "The expert mentions that after nearly six years of litigation": "the 11th Circuit Federal Appeals Court ruled in February 2017 that certain provisions of the law, including the one preventing providers from asking patients about guns, were unconstitutional. This verifies the claim that the law was struck down by a court."}
