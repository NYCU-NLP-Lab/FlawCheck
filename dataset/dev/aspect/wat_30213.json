{"Social media posts falsely claim that President Donald Trump": "s campaign hats are made in China, while Joe Biden's campaign hats are made in the U.S.", "The official hats sold by both campaigns are made by American companies": "debunking the claim.", "The photos used in the social media posts compare a pro": "Trump hat and a pro-Biden hat, along with their respective labels.", "The claim that the red": "Make America Great Again\" hat was made in China does not imply that it came from the Trump campaign, as the posts suggest. The Trump campaign's website states that all of its \"official\" hats are proudly made in the USA, and reports filed with the Federal Election Commission confirm that American companies are responsible for the production and distribution of the hats."}
