{"The source of the claim was identified as the Farmington Tribune website": "which is a regional satirical page known for publishing borderline true stories.", "The claim was based on a Facebook post allegedly made by New Mexico Gov": "Michelle Lujan Grisham, stating her plans to make Ramadan a state holiday. The post was quoted in the expert's verdict.", "The expert pointed out that Ramadan is not a discrete": "holiday\" but a month-long observance in which Muslims fast every day from dawn until sunset. It was deemed unreasonable to give government employees 29-30 days off each year for Ramadan in addition to existing state holidays.", "The expert highlighted the lack of transparency and responsibility on the part of the Farmington Tribune": "as they did not clearly indicate that their content is satirical, leading to misinformation and confusion among readers."}
