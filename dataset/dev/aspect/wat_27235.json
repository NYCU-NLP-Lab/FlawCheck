{"The artist": "s own description of his visual style as \"bombastic, syrupy, and garish\" suggests that the claim about the controversial paintings aligns with his artistic approach.", "The fact that the paintings in question are modern takes on the biblical story of Judith beheading Holofernes": "featuring black women brandishing the severed heads of white women, supports the claim of racially charged content.", "The social media comments shared alongside images of the paintings": "which state or imply that their content is racist, provide additional evidence for the authenticity of the claim.", "The description of Kehinde Wiley as": "known for\" and \"having a great fondness for\" painting black people beheading white people on a right-wing blog further supports the claim and adds to the controversy surrounding the artist's work."}
