{"The claim states that states like New York": "Illinois, and California have been demanding funding to bail out their pension systems and other unrelated programs. This aspect is supported by the statement of Rep. Andy Biggs and his colleagues in a letter to President Trump, as reported in The Hill.", "Rep": "Biggs further emphasizes that these states, including New York, Illinois, and California, have been vocal in their demands for funding, highlighting the negative impacts of poor budgeting, bloated spending, and high taxes. This aspect is also mentioned in the same letter shared by Biggs on his social media accounts.", "The National Governors Association is calling for": "500 billion in federal funding for states, and New York supports this request, according to Freeman Klopott, press officer for the state Division of the Budget. This indicates that New York is indeed seeking federal assistance.", "An analysis by the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts in 2017 found that New York": "s pension system was one of only eight states with at least 90% of its pension obligations funded, with assets covering 94.5% of its pension obligations. This suggests that New York's pension system is well-funded and does not require a bailout, as stated by E.J. McMahon from the Empire Center for Public Policy and New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli."}
