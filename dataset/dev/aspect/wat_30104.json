{"Misleading claims on social media": "Dozens of misleading claims were made on Facebook and Instagram regarding an overnight jump in Democratic votes in Wisconsin. These claims were centered around a chart published by FiveThirtyEight.com, which showed a sharp uptick in Democratic votes at around 4 a.m. on Nov. 4.", "Conspiracy theories and false narratives": "The misleading claims on social media sparked unfounded conspiracy theories, with some referring to the increase in votes as \"voter fraud\" or a \"ballot dump.\" President Donald Trump also promoted this narrative in a tweet, suggesting that his lead in key states \"magically disappeared\" due to surprise ballot dumps.", "Verification of the chart and its implications": "The expert's verdict clarifies that the chart in question does not prove any voter fraud. Instead, it simply reflects when the City of Milwaukee reported its absentee ballot results. The expert emphasizes that this increase in Democratic votes was expected due to the demographics and voting mechanics of Wisconsin, particularly in Milwaukee, which is a Democratic stronghold.", "Official statements and explanations": "The expert cites statements from Julietta Henry, director of elections for Milwaukee County, who confirmed that no ballots were \"found\" or added falsely. Henry clarified that the ballots were being counted, as expected, and that the increase in votes was due to the reporting of absentee ballots from the City of Milwaukee and other communities using a central count location. The expert also mentions that the Associated Press election reporting stream showed the specific jump in votes for both Biden and Trump, with Milwaukee County accounting for nearly all of that increase."}
