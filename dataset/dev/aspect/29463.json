{"The claim made by Donald Trump speculates that Shahram Amiri": "an Iranian nuclear scientist who defected to the U.S. and became a CIA spy, was executed in Iran because of Hillary Clinton's hacked emails.", "The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the timeline of events": "It is stated that news stories about Amiri providing information on Iran's nuclear program appeared in March 2010, which is several months before Clinton's aides referenced Amiri in emails. This contradicts Trump's claim that the execution was related to Clinton's emails.", "The second aspect is the lack of evidence that Clinton": "s emails were hacked. The FBI investigation did not find direct evidence of a successful hack into Clinton's personal email domain, although it was acknowledged that hostile actors might have gained access to her server.", "The third aspect is the confirmation by the Iranian government that Amiri was killed": "Trump's claim that the Iranians killed Amiri because of Clinton's emails is not supported by any evidence or official statements."}
