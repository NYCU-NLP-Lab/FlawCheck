{"The expert mentions that Federal code 18 U": "S.C. \u00a7 1503 defines \"obstruction of justice\" as an act that \"corruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.\" This aspect highlights the legal definition of obstruction of justice and sets the criteria for evaluating whether it occurred or not.", "The expert refers to Mueller": "s jurisdiction, which includes the investigation of \"federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel's investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\" This aspect establishes the scope of Mueller's investigation and the specific crimes he was authorized to examine, including obstruction of justice.", "The expert cites U": "S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler's questioning of Mueller during his testimony on July 25, 2019. Nadler asked Mueller about Trump's claim that the report found no obstruction, to which Mueller responded, \"Correct. That is not what the report said.\" This aspect highlights Mueller's own statement contradicting Trump's claim and reinforces the fact that the report did not exonerate the president from obstruction of justice.", "The expert mentions that the phrase": "no obstruction\" does not appear in Mueller's report. This aspect emphasizes the absence of explicit language supporting Trump's claim and suggests that the report did not reach the conclusion of \"no obstruction\" as asserted by the president."}
