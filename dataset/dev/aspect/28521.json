{"The claim being examined is that President Obama promised that with the stimulus plan": "unemployment would never go above 8 percent. He even said it would be 6 percent by now.\"", "The expert": "s verdict states that the claim has been examined numerous times by PolitiFact and has been rated as Mostly False.", "The claim was recently reiterated by Rep": "Bob Latta of Bowling Green, who added the new aspect that the current unemployment rate should be 6 percent.", "To support the claim": "Latta's office pointed to a Jan. 9, 2009, report by Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, which projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would result in an unemployment rate peaking at just under 8 percent in 2009. However, the actual unemployment rate peaked at above 10 percent in early 2010 before falling to 8.1 percent. The report was a projection and not a direct promise, and it came with disclaimers."}
