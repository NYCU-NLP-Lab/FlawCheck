{"The number of children who do not show up for their hearings": "The expert's verdict mentions that \"roughly half\" of the children do not show up for their hearings, which aligns with the claim's statement that only a fraction of the children who entered the country illegally in 2013 were repatriated.", "The difficulty in obtaining accurate numbers": "The expert's verdict highlights the bureaucratic labyrinth and the multiple government agencies involved in handling this immigration issue. Despite contacting various departments and agencies, the expert was unable to obtain a definitive answer regarding the number of children returned.", "Testimony from R": "Gil Kerlikowske: During a hearing, R. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, stated that approximately 57,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended since the start of Fiscal Year 2014. This provides evidence supporting the claim's statement that a significant number of children have crossed the border illegally.", "Testimony from Thomas Winkowski": "Thomas Winkowski, the principal deputy assistant secretary for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, mentioned that the numbers discussed were around 1,300 to 1,500 children being returned. This testimony supports the claim's statement that only a small percentage (as few as 2 percent) of the children who crossed the border illegally this year have been sent home."}
