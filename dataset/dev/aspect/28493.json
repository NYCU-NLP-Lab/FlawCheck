{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that a Biden campaign staffer, Dallas Jones, was arrested for voter fraud. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Unverified allegations": "The false claim originated from unverified allegations made in an unsuccessful lawsuit brought by a group of Republicans. These unverified allegations were used to spread the false story on social media platforms.", "Absence of criminal case": "The expert's investigation reveals that there is no criminal case filed against Dallas Jones in Harris County court records. This absence of a criminal case further discredits the claim of his arrest for voter fraud.", "Misleading image": "Some posts included a photo that was claimed to show the arrest of Dallas Jones. However, the image was actually a snapshot of the actor Cuba Gooding Jr. being arrested in 2019. This misleading use of an unrelated image adds to the lack of credibility of the claim."}
