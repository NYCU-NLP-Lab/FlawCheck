{"The photograph of the car accident was found to be genuine and was originally posted on Flickr by EMS Flight Crew in October 2010": "2. The accompanying backstory of the accident, including the claim that the upper half of a woman's body was found clutching her phone in the car's trunk, is unsubstantiated and lacks credible sources.", "The photograph itself disproves the claim": "as the driver's side chair is still intact, indicating that the driver was not bisected as described in the story.", "While texting while driving is a dangerous activity": "there is no evidence to support the claim that this specific car accident was caused by distracted driving. The story about the bisected driver clutching her phone appears to be manufactured to scare drivers from using their phones while driving."}
