{"Use of a photograph": "The expert mentions that the claim uses a photograph of an obese woman to illustrate the story. This is a common tactic used by fake news websites to create a story around a real person.", "Lack of credible sources": "The expert points out that the claim was published by World News Daily Report, a well-known purveyor of fake news. The website has a long history of publishing misinformation and sensational stories, including ones related to bestiality.", "Satirical nature of the website": "The expert highlights that World News Daily Report carries a disclaimer stating that all of its content is \"satirical\" in nature. This suggests that the claim about the woman being sexually assaulted by an escaped hippo is fictional and not to be taken seriously.", "Identification of the woman in the photograph": "The expert reveals that the woman pictured in the claim is Vilma Soltesz, who passed away in 2012. Her story was unrelated to any incident involving a hippo at a Paris zoo. This information further discredits the authenticity of the claim."}
