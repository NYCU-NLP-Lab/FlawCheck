{"The biography": "Elvis and Gladys\" by Elaine Dundy provides information about Elvis Presley's maternal side and his family origins, including the marriage of his great-grandfather White Mansell to Martha Tackett, who was the daughter of Abner and Nancy J. Burdine Tackett. The book suggests that Nancy J. Burdine was Jewish, as confirmed by Elvis' third cousin Oscar Tackett.", "Authors Max Wallace and Jonathan Goldstein": "in their book \"Schmelvis: In Search of Elvis Presley's Jewish Roots,\" state that Nancy Burdine likely came from a family that immigrated from Lithuania around the time of the American Revolution. This suggests a potential Jewish connection in Elvis Presley's ancestry.", "The website for Graceland": "Elvis Presley's mansion, acknowledges the Jewish heritage of his mother, Gladys. It states that her gravestone, placed in December 1964, features the Star of David, symbolizing her Jewish heritage.", "Despite his Jewish ancestry": "Elvis Presley did not practice Judaism and attended the Assembly of God Church with his family in his early childhood. His connection to Judaism is a matter of religious interpretation, as some Jewish traditions consider heritage to be passed down along the maternal line."}
