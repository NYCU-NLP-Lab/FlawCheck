{"Verification through the Social Security Death Index": "SSDI): The expert used the SSDI, a database of death records created from the United States Social Security Administration's Death Master File Extract, to confirm that the Social Security Administration was informed of the death of Jean Paul Ludwig, the person whose Social Security number was claimed to be appropriated by Barack Obama. The expert found that Ludwig's assigned Social Security number was different from the one assigned to Barack Obama.", "Disproving the need for appropriation": "The expert pointed out that Barack Obama was born in the United States, making it unnecessary for his grandmother to appropriate someone else's Social Security number for him. The claim's premise that Obama used a deceased person's number was flawed.", "Clarification on the meaning of Social Security numbers": "The expert explained that possession of a Social Security number is not an indicator of citizenship, as non-citizens can legally obtain Social Security numbers. Therefore, the claim's focus on the Social Security number as evidence of Obama's citizenship was deemed irrelevant.", "Explanation of the area number assignment": "The expert addressed the false claim that Social Security numbers beginning with 042 are reserved for Connecticut residents. They clarified that the area number of a Social Security number does not necessarily correspond to the state of birth or residence. Instead, it reflects the mailing address requested by the applicant when the card was issued. The mailing address can be different from the applicant's residence address, and the area number is based on the ZIP code provided. The expert provided historical context and clarified the process of assigning area numbers."}
