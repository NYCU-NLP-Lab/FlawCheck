{"The claim is based on a social media post that alleges that Native Americans in North Dakota will be the first subjects to receive a novel coronavirus vaccine": "2.

The claim is debunked by Scott Davis, executive director of the North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission, who states that the idea of forcing a Covid-19 vaccine on Native American tribes is false and that the tribes will have their own processes and review boards to determine if the vaccine is suitable for their communities."}
