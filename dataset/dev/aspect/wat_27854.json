{"Equipment malfunction": "The expert's verdict mentions that the divers' equipment, including cameras and satellite phones, stopped working when they approached within 200 meters of the object. This aspect suggests that there was some form of electromagnetic interference or unknown force affecting the equipment, which could be indicative of an unusual phenomenon.", "Unusual physical characteristics": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Swedish diving team observed a 985-foot flattened out \"runway\" leading up to the object. This aspect suggests that there was a distinct physical feature associated with the object, possibly indicating that it had skidded or moved along a specific path before coming to a stop.", "Personal testimonies": "The expert's verdict includes quotes from professional diver Stefan Hogerborn and member Dennis Asberg, both expressing their conviction that the object they discovered was unique and unlike anything they had encountered before. These personal testimonies serve as another aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Repurposed article": "The expert's verdict mentions that the article published by Earth We Are One in 2014 was a repurposed version of a story published by the UK newspaper Daily Mail in 2012. The fact that the claim was based on a real discovery by the Ocean X team adds credibility to the initial claim, even though later experts determined that the object was not an alien spaceship. This aspect highlights the initial interest and attention the discovery received, contributing to the verification process."}
