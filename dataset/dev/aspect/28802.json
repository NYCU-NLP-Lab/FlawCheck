{"Confirmation from the owner": "The owner of the Texas plumbing company, Jeff Oberholtzer, confirmed that the truck seen in the photograph was indeed his company's truck. He expressed surprise and disbelief at its use by a militant group in Syria.", "Multiple photographs": "The truck in question was also found in other photographs, indicating that it had been in circulation and passed through various hands before ending up in Syria. This adds credibility to the claim.", "Auction history": "The fact that the plumbing company had put the truck up for auction in November 2013 suggests that it had been sold and could have potentially been purchased by someone who later sold it to the militant group in Syria.", "Lawsuit and harassment": "Jeff Oberholtzer's father, Mark Oberholtzer, filed a lawsuit against AutoNation Ford Gulf Freeway for neglecting to remove the company's decals before selling the truck. The lawsuit claimed that the family had received continual abuse, harassment, and even death threats since the photos of the truck surfaced on Twitter. This further supports the authenticity of the claim."}
