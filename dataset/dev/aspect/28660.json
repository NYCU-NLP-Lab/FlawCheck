{"The narrator in the ad explicitly states that": "giving money to politicians has paid off for Paul Workman\" and that he \"got millions in government construction projects.\" This statement directly supports the claim and suggests a connection between Workman's political donations and his government contracts.", "The campaign of Workman": "s opponent, Turner, provided a list of projects handled by Workman's company, Workman Commercial Construction Services, which he founded. This list serves as evidence of the government construction projects that Workman received, further supporting the claim.", "Workman": "s estimated $15,010 in political donations since 2000 to candidates for state office and political groups, as reported by the Texas Ethics Commission, provides additional evidence. The breakdown of his donations to individual candidates, including Democrats and Republicans, and the top recipients of his contributions further support the claim that Workman gave money to politicians and received government construction projects in return."}
