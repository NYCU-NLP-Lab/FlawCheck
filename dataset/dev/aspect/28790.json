{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert mentions that they have not found any credible sources that state where and when Marjorie Taylor Greene supposedly made the quoted comment. They conducted a cursory search of news articles, interviews, and Greene's social media accounts, but found no results.", "Pre": "dates Greene's political career: The expert notes that the quote predates Marjorie Taylor Greene's political career by nearly half a century. This suggests that the attribution of the quote to her is highly unlikely.", "False attribution to multiple politicians": "The expert mentions that this quote has been falsely attributed to various politicians over the years, including former Texas governor Miriam Ferguson, radio host John Henry Faulk, former Canada Prime Minister Lester Pearson, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, and former U.S. President George W. Bush. This pattern of false attribution raises doubts about the authenticity of the quote.", "Inaccurate linguistic claim": "The expert highlights that the claim itself is inaccurate, as Jesus did not speak English. They explain that Jesus's everyday spoken language would have been Aramaic, not English, and cite biblical scholars who support this."}
