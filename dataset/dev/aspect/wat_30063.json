{"The presence of misleading images": "The expert identified that some of the images in the Facebook post were not from the Million MAGA March in 2020, but rather from other events such as a Cleveland Cavaliers parade in 2016 and the Women's March in 2017. This inconsistency in the images raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Discrepancy in attendance numbers": "The expert stated that the claim falsely stated that more than 1 million people attended the rallies for Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. on November 14, 2020. News outlets estimated the attendance to be in the thousands, indicating a significant discrepancy.", "Verification through news outlets": "The expert referenced news outlets to verify the attendance numbers and provide accurate information about the events. This external validation added credibility to the expert's verdict and helped confirm the inaccuracy of the claim.", "Contextual information about the events": "The expert provided additional context about the events that took place on November 14, 2020, including the convergence of multiple events like the Million MAGA March, the March for Trump, and Stop the Steal DC. This information helped paint a clearer picture of the situation and further supported the expert's verdict."}
