{"The claim about Ruth Bader Ginsburg wanting to lower the age of consent for sex to 12 is a distortion of a report she co": "authored in the 1970s on sex bias in federal laws.", "The claim has been circulating since at least Ginsburg": "s Senate confirmation hearings in 1993, where it was brought up by Susan Hirschmann, the then-executive director of a conservative group.", "The report cited as evidence for the claim": "Sex Bias in the U.S. Code,\" does not contain any arguments for changing the age of consent.", "The report actually discusses the need for sex": "neutral provisions to protect the vulnerability of young people and addresses the failure of existing federal provisions to comply with equal rights principles."}
