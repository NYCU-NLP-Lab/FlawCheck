{"The expert examined the background and career history of the military leaders mentioned in the claim": "specifically focusing on Gen. John Keane, Gen. David Petraeus, and Gen. Stanley McChrystal.", "The expert found that Gen": "Keane never served under President Obama, contradicting the claim that he was retired early for telling President Obama things he didn't want to hear.", "The expert discovered that Gen": "Petraeus retired from the military to take on a new position as head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and was forced to resign in 2012 due to a scandal involving sharing classified materials and engaging in an extramarital affair. This information challenges the claim that Petraeus was retired early for telling President Obama unwelcome information.", "The expert also found that Gen": "McChrystal's downfall came as a result of allowing a Rolling Stone reporter to travel with him, leading to the publication of disparaging remarks made by McChrystal and his staff. While McChrystal did advocate for a strategy in Afghanistan that was not entirely aligned with the White House's views, it is not accurate to say he was retired early solely for telling President Obama unwelcome things."}
