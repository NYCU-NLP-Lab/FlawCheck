{"Comparison with other states": "The expert compared North Carolina's absentee ballot requirements with those of other states to determine if it is in the minority. They specifically mentioned Alabama and Rhode Island as the only other states that require two witnesses or a notary public.", "Confirmation from a nonpartisan organization": "The expert referred to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), a nonpartisan group that tracks state laws, to verify the accuracy of the claim. The NCSL confirmed that North Carolina is one of only three states with the mentioned witness or notary requirement.", "Statement from state senators": "The expert cited the statements of State Senators Jay Chaudhuri and Natasha Marcus, who described North Carolina's absentee rules as antiquated and stated that it is in the minority of states with the witness or notary requirement.", "Lack of evidence to the contrary": "The expert stated, \"Is it true that NC is in a 'minority' of states that requires two people to witness an absentee ballot? Yes.\" This suggests that the expert did not find any evidence contradicting the claim and supports its authenticity."}
