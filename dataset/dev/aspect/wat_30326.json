{"The claim was not supported by any credible news reports or evidence from the Democratic fundraiser where Barack Obama spoke": "Multiple news outlets, including Politico, the Daily Caller, CNN, and Fox News, reported on Obama's speech at the fundraiser but did not mention the statement in question.", "The quote was first circulated on Facebook pages and troll forums": "which are not reliable sources of information. This suggests that the claim may have originated from an unreliable or fabricated source.", "The authenticity of the claim was further questioned when it was retweeted by conservative radio host Bill Mitchell": "While Mitchell is a verified Twitter account, his endorsement does not provide substantial evidence to support the claim.", "Time magazine": "s report on Obama's speech highlighted that he did not mention President Donald Trump by name and focused on mobilizing Democrats rather than making any personal commitment to \"do something\" about the current administration. This contradicts the claim's assertion that Obama made such a statement at the fundraiser."}
