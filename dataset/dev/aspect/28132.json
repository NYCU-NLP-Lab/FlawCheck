{"The claim is false because it suggests that President Joe Biden signed an executive order allowing the U": "S. to fund abortions abroad. However, the federal government had already banned the direct funding of abortions abroad through the 1973 Helms Amendment, which remains in effect and requires an act of Congress to overturn.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that the \"domestic gag rule\" was instituted by President Trump in 2019. This policy seeks to bar organizations that provide abortion referrals from receiving federal family planning money. It is important to note that organizations receiving federal funds have already been prohibited from using that money to finance abortion services for years.", "Additionally": "the expert's verdict highlights that President Trump further expanded anti-abortion policies abroad by blocking U.S. funds to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in March 2017. The UNFPA is an agency that oversees issues related to abortion and aims to promote sexual and reproductive health globally. Trump's action limited funding to this organization, impacting its ability to fulfill its mission."}
