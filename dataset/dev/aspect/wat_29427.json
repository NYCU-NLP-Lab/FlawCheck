Ron Maag says 46 percent of Medicaid expansion money would be borrowed from\nforeign governments that don\u2019t \u201clike us very much\u201d\n\n   Free money from Washington sure sounds enticing.", "That\u2019s one reason Maag does not want Ohio to expand Medicaid, the joint\n   federal-state healthcare program for low-income Americans.", "Plenty of Ohio Republicans have doubts about expanding Medicaid, but\n   Maag\u2019s statement stood out because it sounded contrary to federal\n   assessments about the program\u2019s financing."]
