{"The presence of additional photographs showing the scene from different angles was used to verify the authenticity of the claim": "This is because if a picture has been photoshopped, it is unlikely to have multiple pictures of the object from different angles. However, in this case, an additional photograph of the \"snake\" was found, indicating that it is a physical object rather than a digitally created one.", "The shape of the snake in the photograph was analyzed to determine its authenticity": "It was noted that the snake's body wrapped tightly around the angular shape of the AK-47, which seemed unlikely for a real snake. A real snake would stretch from one protuberance to another, creating a more rounded shape if it had swallowed the gun.", "The expert mentioned that the photograph shows artwork created by Vasily Slonov": "a Russian political artist, called \"Python-AK.\" This information was used to verify the authenticity of the claim. The artwork is made of rubber and was created in 2019, indicating that the snake in the photograph is not real but a part of the artwork.", "The source of the claim": "Snopes.com, was mentioned in the expert's verdict. Snopes.com is known for fact-checking and debunking misinformation. The inclusion of Snopes.com as the source adds credibility to the expert's verdict and the information provided to verify the authenticity of the claim."}
