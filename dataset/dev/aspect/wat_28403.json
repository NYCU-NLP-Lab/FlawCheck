{"The claim originated from a Facebook post published on November 28 and has been shared multiple times": "2. The misleading post stated that there would be a $999 fine and a 3-year suspended license for using a cell phone while driving in Queensland starting from January 2020.", "Other Facebook posts with similar claims but without location references were also shared hundreds of thousands of times": "4. The expert's verdict confirms that while Queensland is indeed implementing stricter penalties for illegal phone use while driving, the specific details mentioned in the claim are inaccurate. The penalty for this offense will increase from AUD $400 to AUD $1,000, with three to four demerit points added to the driver's record. However, these increased penalties will be effective from February 1, 2020, not January 2020. Additionally, the claim of a three-year license suspension is false."}
