{"Confirmation of the claimed fact": "The expert verified the accuracy of the claim by confirming with the city attorney's office that the $127 million cited in the email was accurate.", "Comparison with industry analysis": "The expert mentioned that Portland has one of the highest combined water and sewer rates in the country, ranking 5th in a 2010 industry analysis of the nation's 50 most populous cities. This comparison supports the claim that Portland has high rates.", "Lawsuit filed by ratepayers": "The expert mentioned that a group of Portlanders filed a lawsuit alleging that the city improperly spent ratepayer money on projects unrelated to the core function of the water and sewer bureaus. This lawsuit supports the claim that there have been \"pet projects\" funded by the city council.", "Formation of Portlanders for Water Reform": "The expert mentioned that Kent Craford, the man behind the lawsuit, formed a group called Portlanders for Water Reform, aiming to get a measure on the 2014 ballot to transfer oversight of water and sewer utilities to an independently elected board. This formation of a group advocating for reform further strengthens the claim that there are concerns about the allocation of funds towards unrelated projects."}
