{"Lack of evidence from Oscar Mayer": "The expert mentions that there is no mention of a pumpkin spice bologna product on Oscar Mayer's website, nor are there any press releases or news articles reporting on the company's release of such a product. This lack of official information raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Image origin and history": "The expert notes that the image of the pumpkin spice bologna has been circulating since at least 2016 and was initially shared on a forum thread mocking pumpkin spice trends. This information suggests that the image may have been created as a joke or hoax rather than representing an actual product.", "Similarity to another product": "The expert points out that the image of the pumpkin spice bologna closely resembles an image of Oscar Mayer's Jalapeno Bologna, an actual product. The similarities between the two images raise questions about the authenticity of the pumpkin spice version and suggest that it may be a manipulated or doctored image.", "Lack of previous use of pumpkin spice flavor": "The expert states that, to their knowledge, Oscar Mayer has never used pumpkin spice as a flavor for their deli meat products. This information further supports the skepticism towards the claim, as it suggests that the introduction of a pumpkin spice bologna would be out of character for the company."}
