{"The claim is based on a factsheet from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services": "which states that Medicare and Medicaid together made up 76 percent of home health spending in 2017.", "Medicare paid a total of": "38.7 billion, followed by Medicaid, which paid for over $35 billion in home health care in 2017.", "Government programs": "including Medicaid, Medicare, Department of Veteran Affairs programs, state and local programs, and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, spent a total of $75.2 billion on home health care in 2017, accounting for 78% of total home health care spending.", "However": "it is important to note that while government programs cover skilled medical care, they do not fully cover long-term, non-medical unskilled care, which includes services like assistance with bathing, cooking, and chores. Medicaid is the only program that covers some non-medical long-term care under certain circumstances for individuals who have spent down their assets."}
