{"The claim is supported by a specific statistic": "Black children constitute 18 percent of the nation's public school population but 40 percent of the children who are suspended or expelled.\" This statistic provides a quantitative measure of the alleged disparity.", "The claim is backed up by a credible source": "The information used to support the claim was obtained from a U.S. Department of Education online warehouse of school suspensions and expulsions, as well as a 2012 Children's Defense Fund report. These sources add credibility to the claim.", "The claim is corroborated by a widely publicized report": "The U.S. Department of Education researchers conducted a study that examined 85 percent of the nation's public school students in 72,000 schools. The findings of this report align with the claim, stating that black students accounted for 35 percent of students suspended at least once and 39 percent of students expelled.", "The claim is acknowledged by a government official": "U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan acknowledged the findings of the study and emphasized the need for educators to address the disparities.
