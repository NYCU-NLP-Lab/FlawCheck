{"Lack of documentation": "The expert contacted Dan Fanelli, who posted the video, and asked for any documentation to support the claim about age limits in the health care bill. However, Fanelli was unable to provide any specific evidence or reference to a section of the bill or a position paper from an organization.", "Personal anecdote": "Fanelli used his own family experience as evidence for the claim. He mentioned that his aunt in France was initially denied a procedure because she was considered too old. However, he later stated that she was able to receive the procedure, indicating that the denial was not ultimately upheld.", "Financial concerns": "Fanelli argued that the increase in the number of people covered by the health care bill, combined with the country's significant debt, would lead to limited resources and the need to prioritize certain coverages. He suggested that age limits may be imposed due to financial constraints.", "Comparison to other countries": "Fanelli used the video to highlight what he believed could happen in the United States based on his perception of how socialized medicine operates in other countries. He implied that denying treatment based on age could be a consequence of implementing a similar system."}
