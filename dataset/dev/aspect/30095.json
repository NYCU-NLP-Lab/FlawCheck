{"The photo attached to the claim was analyzed to determine its authenticity": "It was found that the photo was not from the Golden Gate Bridge's 1937 opening, but from a 1987 celebration of the bridge's 50th anniversary.", "Historical records and photographs from the actual 1937 opening were examined to verify the claim": "These records showed significantly fewer people walking the bridge during the opening, contradicting the claim of a massive crowd that almost caused a collapse.", "Eyewitness accounts from individuals present during the 1987 celebration were considered": "While some people in the crowd expressed concerns about the bridge collapsing due to high winds and the weight of the crowd, engineers stated that a collapse was unlikely as the bridge was designed to withstand such conditions.", "Expert opinions from engineers and other professionals were sought to assess the structural integrity of the bridge during both the 1937 opening and the 1987 celebration": "These experts confirmed that the bridge was over-engineered and designed to withstand heavy loads, further debunking the claim of a near collapse."}
