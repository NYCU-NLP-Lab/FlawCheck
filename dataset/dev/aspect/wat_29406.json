{"Confirmation from a spokesperson": "The expert's verdict mentions that Dylan Rivera, a spokesperson at the Portland Bureau of Transportation, confirmed that the city \"generally barely breaks even\" in parking enforcement. This confirmation from a reliable source adds credibility to the claim.", "Confirmation from a colleague": "The expert's verdict also mentions that Diane Dulken, a colleague of Rivera at PBOT communications, confirmed the statement made in the Portland Mercury. Having multiple sources within the organization confirming the claim further verifies its authenticity.", "Examination of expenses": "The expert's verdict discusses the analysis of expenses related to parking enforcement. It mentions that both direct costs (salaries and equipment) and indirect costs (overhead expenses) were considered. The examination of these expenses helps determine whether the revenue collected from parking fines covers the cost of enforcing parking rules.", "Historical budget analysis": "The expert's verdict states that the previous budgets were pored through to understand the presentation of the parking enforcement budget to others. By analyzing the budgets from previous years (2010-11, 2011-12), it is possible to assess the trend and determine if the claim about barely breaking even is consistent with the historical data."}
