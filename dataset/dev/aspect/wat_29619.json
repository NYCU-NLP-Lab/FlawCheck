{"The claim falsely links Justin Trudeau": "s support for changing a law to promote pedophilia. This claim is based on Facebook posts and videos that have been shared multiple times since September 2020.", "The disinformation about Trudeau": "s alleged support for pedophilia can be traced back to as early as July 2016, when he spoke about changing the law ahead of joining a Pride march.", "Canadian legal experts": "including Douglas Elliott, have refuted the claim, stating that the age of consent for any sexual activity is determined by the Parliament of Canada, not the Prime Minister. Trudeau has never proposed changing the age of consent.", "The law that was changed": "Section 159 of the Criminal Code, governed anal intercourse and was found to be discriminatory by various courts in Canada. Its repeal was a result of efforts by queer and trans people who argued for its removal for over 40 years. The change aimed to eliminate the discriminatory nature of the law and promote equality."}
