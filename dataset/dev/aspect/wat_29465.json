{"The Affordable Care Act is not a government takeover of healthcare but rather adds regulations and subsidies to the existing private sector system": "2. The federal government offers subsidies to make health insurance more affordable, which are used to lower premium costs for individuals purchasing coverage through federal or state marketplaces.", "The subsidies increase demand for coverage": "benefiting insurance companies by gaining more customers.", "The majority of the subsidies": "at least 80 percent, will go directly towards paying medical claims of enrollees, indicating that a significant portion of the funds will be used for healthcare expenses rather than profit for private insurers."}
