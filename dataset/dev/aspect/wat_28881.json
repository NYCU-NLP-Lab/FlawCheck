{"Verification of the source": "The expert checked the Facebook account called \"The Planet Today\" that originally posted the photo and attempted to contact them for information about the source of the photo. They also reached out to National Geographic for confirmation.", "Search for the image on Google": "The expert conducted a reverse image search on Google to see if the photo had been shared or posted before 2018. They found several instances of the photo pre-dating 2018, suggesting it was not a recent National Geographic photo of the year.", "Lack of credible websites connecting the photo to National Geographic": "The expert searched for credible websites or sources that linked the photo to National Geographic but couldn't find any. This lack of reputable sources supporting the claim adds to the doubt about its authenticity.", "Past statements from National Geographic": "The expert referred to a blog post from National Geographic in December 2016 where they refuted the claim that the photo was their photo of the year. The magazine's editor also used the opportunity to condemn fake news and shared genuine shark photos. This previous statement from National Geographic contradicts the claim being made."}
