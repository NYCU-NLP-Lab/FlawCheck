{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that there is no evidence to support the claim that \"a lot of people are being saved\" under the Right to Try Act. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no information on the number of people who have used the law to gain access to unapproved medications.", "Limited data collection": "The FDA, responsible for collecting data on patients treated with investigational medicines under the Right to Try Act, states that it has no information on the number of people benefiting from the law. Only two individuals have been publicly identified as having used the law.", "Context of the claim": "The claim was made by President Donald Trump during a White House meeting on e-cigarettes, which may not be directly related to the effectiveness of the Right to Try Act. The expert highlights the context in which the claim was made.", "Existing alternative pathways": "The expert mentions that the FDA has a long-standing program called \"expanded access\" that allows patients to seek access to investigational drugs. This program has been in place since the 1970s, indicating that the Right to Try Act is not the only avenue for accessing unapproved medications."}
