{"The claim is based on a misattribution of a quote by Nazi party member Gregor Strasser to Adolf Hitler": "The expert explains that the quote in question actually belongs to Strasser and not Hitler.", "The expert highlights that the quote from Strasser": "s pamphlet, which is mistakenly attributed to Hitler, attempts to appeal to ultranationalist movements on both the left and the right. This suggests that the Nazis were trying to gain support from a wide range of political ideologies.", "The expert points out that Strasser": "s pamphlet also contains statements that are decidedly non-socialist, such as rejecting the belief in the equality of man and advocating for unequal valuation of individuals in society and the state. This further undermines the claim that Hitler was a socialist.", "The expert mentions that Gregor Strasser was a prominent Nazi propagandist and one of the two most prominent voices for the party alongside Adolf Hitler": "This context helps to establish the credibility and relevance of Strasser's views within the Nazi party."}
