{"Use of data": "The experts employed the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Hate, Extremism, Anti-Semitism, Terrorism map data (HEAT map) to examine the correlation between counties hosting Trump rallies and increased incidents of hate crimes.", "Research methodology": "The experts aggregated hate crime incident data and Trump rally data at the county level and used statistical tools to estimate the impact of the rallies. They also included controls for various factors such as crime rates, active hate groups, minority populations, education levels, location, and the month when the rallies took place.", "Comparison with non": "rally counties: The experts compared counties that hosted Trump rallies with similar demographics to non-rally counties to determine the difference in reported hate crimes. This approach ensured that the increase in hate crimes was not solely attributed to the presence of a Trump rally but rather compared to counties with similar characteristics.", "Clarification of phrasing": "The experts pointed out that the claim made by Bernie Sanders' campaign, stating a \"226% spike in hate crimes,\" was not entirely accurate. They clarified that the increase in hate crimes was a comparison between Trump rally counties and non-rally counties with similar demographics, rather than a direct increase within a single jurisdiction."}
