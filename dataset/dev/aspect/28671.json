{"The claim is supported by the National Federation of the Blind": "NFB), which has organized a public awareness campaign and delivered petitions to Goodwill affiliates nationwide, asking the company to change its payroll practices that allow low wages for disabled workers.", "The claim references Section 14": "c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which allows employers to obtain special wage certificates to pay workers with disabilities wages below the federal minimum. The NFB's news release highlights this provision to support their claim.", "Goodwill Industries has faced previous criticism and media coverage regarding low wages for disabled workers": "NBC's \"Rock Center with Brian Williams\" featured a segment on some Pennsylvania affiliates paying disabled workers as little as 22 cents per hour. Forbes, Salon, and the Huffington Post have also reported on low wages in different locations.", "Goodwill corporate officials argue that the low wages highlighted in media reports are special cases and not indicative of the overall pay scale": "They state that only 64 affiliate agencies pay disabled workers below minimum wage, while 101 do not. However, the NFB's spokesman argues that this should not be the case for any worker."}
