{"The claim is based on statements made by Fox News analyst Juan Williams": "who argued that prejudice is widespread among whites. This provides a source for the claim and establishes its origin.", "Polling data from a 2012 survey conducted by the Associated Press": "the GfK polling firm, Stanford University, the National Center for Opinion Research (NORC), and the University of Michigan was used to analyze racial attitudes. The survey asked both white and black respondents a set of questions about their own group and the other group, allowing for a comparison of results.", "The survey questions included measures of intelligence": "trustworthiness, and patriotism, which were used as approximations for the aspects mentioned in the claim. This provides a direct connection between the survey data and the specific aspects mentioned in the claim.", "The survey results showed that while a majority of whites did not hold negative views of blacks": "there was a group of whites who viewed blacks more harshly than whites. This group was larger than the fraction of blacks who held negative views of their own race. This supports the claim that there are white people who think poorly of blacks in terms of intelligence, trustworthiness, and patriotism."}
