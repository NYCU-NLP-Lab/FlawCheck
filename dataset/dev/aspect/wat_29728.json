{"The governor": "s claim of 90,000 people finding work during his time in office is inaccurate. The expert clarifies that this figure represents the number of private-sector jobs added since the governor took office, while the actual number of New Jersey residents who found employment is nearly half of that.", "The expert highlights that a job created in a state does not necessarily mean an unemployed resident returned to work": "The federal labor department counts jobs through a survey of employers, and it is not known how many people each job represents, as a person may hold more than one job.", "The discrepancy between job gains and the number of employed residents in June is mentioned": "Despite the state gaining 9,900 jobs overall, there were 17,000 fewer employed residents in June compared to May, indicating that job growth does not directly translate to an increase in the number of people employed."}
