{"Lack of evidence in official transcripts and news databases": "The expert mentions that they could not find any instance of the claimed exchange between President Obama and the student in official transcripts listed on the White House website or in the Nexis news database.", "Absence of independent news sources": "The expert notes that while there are variations of the claim circulating in the conservative blogosphere, they could not find any reports from independent news sources supporting the claim.", "Similar claims in the past": "The expert mentions that Snopes.com, a website that investigates urban legends, has come across similar chain emails in the past involving different individuals such as Richard Earl, Hillary Clinton, and Bono. This suggests that the claim may be a recycled joke or urban legend.", "Origins of the joke": "The expert traces the inspiration for the joke at least as far back as a 2005 video called \"Click\" by the group \"Make Poverty History.\" The video featured celebrities snapping their fingers every three seconds to highlight the issue of child poverty. This suggests that the joke may have been adapted and modified over time to fit different individuals."}
