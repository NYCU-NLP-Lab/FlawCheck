{"Retired Army Gen": "Jack Keane stated on Fox News Sunday that al-Qaida has grown \"fourfold\" in the past five years. This statement by a credible expert adds weight to the claim's authenticity.", "Keane previously mentioned the growth of al": "Qaida in testimony before the Senate Armed Services committee. This indicates that the claim is not a one-time statement but has been consistently made by the expert.", "The definition of al": "Qaida has evolved over time. While it originally referred to a few hundred people who swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden, it now includes a broader category consisting of core members, affiliates, and other Sunni Islamic extremists. This broad definition supports Keane's claim of al-Qaida's growth, although the exact numbers are difficult to verify.", "Anne Stenersen": "a research fellow in terrorism, acknowledges that the narrowly defined al-Qaida (core members) has remained relatively stable since 2010, but she agrees that the broader definition, including affiliates, suggests growth. This perspective from another expert adds credibility to Keane's claim."}
