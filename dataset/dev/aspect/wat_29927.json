{"Voting record": "The expert examined Carol Shea-Porter's voting record during her time in Congress, specifically focusing on her support for bills such as the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act and the Small Business Jobs Act. These votes indicated her support for small businesses and contradicted the claim that she wants to increase taxes on them.", "Stimulus package support": "The expert noted that Shea-Porter supported the federal stimulus package, which included a $400 tax cut for individual workers and an $800 tax cut for working couples. This support further indicated her support for small businesses.", "Letter to Nancy Pelosi": "The expert referenced a letter signed by Shea-Porter and other Congress members, urging then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi not to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for taxpayers making more than $200,000 a year. This letter demonstrated Shea-Porter's stance on tax breaks for the wealthy, but did not specifically advocate for increasing taxes on small businesses.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert mentioned that there was no evidence of Shea-Porter advocating for tax increases on small businesses during her campaigns or previous political activities. This lack of evidence further supported the conclusion that the claim was not authentic."}
