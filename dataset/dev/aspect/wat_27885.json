{"The claim is supported by a statement from Atlanta Progressive News CEO Matthew Charles Cardinale": "who wrote in the Saporta Report that \"tens of thousands of Atlanta households are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent.\"", "The claim is further backed up by data from a 2015 update of Atlanta": "s housing strategy report, which shows that about 27,000 households with incomes of $20,000 or less and another 13,000 households with incomes between $20,000 and $35,000 spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing in 2012.", "The claim is also supported by the 2012 American Community Survey": "which estimated that out of 103,219 households in Atlanta, 50,509 of them spent 30 percent or more of their income on housing.", "The claim is reinforced by the fact that the number of households spending more than 50 percent of their income on housing decreased by 574 households from 2012 to 2014": "indicating that there is still a significant number of households struggling to afford rent."}
