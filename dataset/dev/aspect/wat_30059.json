{"The claim made by President Donald Trump that the United States is": "the cleanest we've ever been\" is false.", "Data from various sources": "including the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, show that the United States does not rank as the \"cleanest\" country in terms of air and water quality.", "When assessing cleanliness in the context of climate change": "the relevant metric is greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). The United States is not the top emitter of CO2 and is not at its historical best in terms of emissions.", "The Energy Information Administration": "EIA) provides comprehensive data on CO2 emissions in the United States, which indicates that the majority of emissions stem from the energy sector. This contradicts the claim of being the cleanest in terms of CO2 emissions."}
