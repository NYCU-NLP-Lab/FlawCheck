{"The claim is supported by a recent report from the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families": "which found an increase in the number of uninsured children in the United States. The report used data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, which is a reliable source for health care data.", "The Kaiser Family Foundation": "a well-respected center for health care data, also analyzed the American Community Survey numbers and arrived at the same result, further validating the claim.", "The Georgetown study observed increases in uninsurance in every state": "except for the District of Columbia. This consistency in state results suggests that there are national forces at play, supporting the claim that the rate of uninsured children is rising.", "The report indicates that factors such as the push to repeal the Affordable Care Act and administration moves that curtailed marketing efforts and enrollment periods for health care coverage on the marketplaces may have contributed to the increase in uninsured children": "This analysis provides a potential explanation for the rising rate of uninsurance among children."}
