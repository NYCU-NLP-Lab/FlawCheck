This perspective highlights the perceived discriminatory nature of the law.", "Wisconsin Governor": "s comments: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker stated that the reactions to the Indiana law were overblown and that the law is not unusual. He also mentioned that both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had been involved with similar laws in the past. Walker's comments suggest that the Indiana law is not significantly different from previous laws signed by Clinton and supported by Obama.", "Historical context": "The expert's analysis provides a historical context by mentioning that a federal law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was signed by Bill Clinton in 1993. However, it also notes that the U.S. Supreme Court later ruled that the law didn't apply to states, leading to states passing their own versions of the law. This historical context helps to establish the existence of similar laws to the Indiana law."}
