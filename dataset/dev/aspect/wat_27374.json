{"The lack of credible sources": "The expert noted that the claim was based on a fake news article from Your News Wire, a website known for spreading false information. The lack of reputable sources to back up the claim raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Inconsistencies in the evidence": "The expert pointed out several inconsistencies in the evidence presented to support the claim. The photographs of the restaurant staff on the supposed Cannibal Club website were found to be stock images, and the cover image used by Your News Wire actually depicted a restaurant in Spain, not the alleged club in Los Angeles. These inconsistencies cast doubt on the credibility of the claim.", "Unverifiable information": "The expert highlighted that the supposed Cannibal Club website provided limited information about the restaurant's location and operation. The FAQ section on the website vaguely mentioned the need for privacy and vetting of members, but failed to provide any substantial details. This lack of verifiable information adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Longevity of the fake website": "The expert noted that the fake Cannibal Club website had been online since at least 2009. This suggests that the website has been used to spread false information for a significant period of time, further undermining the credibility of the claim."}
