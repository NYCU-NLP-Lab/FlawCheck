{"The claim states that Barack Obama surrendered his law license in 2008 to escape charges of lying on his bar application": "while Michelle Obama voluntarily surrendered her law license in 1993 after a Federal Judge gave her a choice between surrendering her license or standing trial for insurance fraud. This aspect of the claim was verified by checking the website for the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois, where Barack Obama is listed as retired and was last registered in 2008, and Michelle Obama is listed as voluntarily inactive and was last registered in 1993.", "The expert": "s verdict also explains that the rumor may have spread due to the way Michelle Obama had to change her registration status. Prior to 1999, active lawyers in Illinois were required to petition the court if they wanted to change their status. Michelle Obama filed a motion to transfer to inactive status in 1994, while Barack Obama elected to have his license placed on inactive status in 2007 and changed it to retired after becoming president in early 2009. This aspect verifies the reasons behind the changes in their registration status.", "The fact that the claim was flagged by Facebook as part of their efforts to combat false news and misinformation on their platform adds another aspect of verification": "This indicates that the claim is not supported by reliable sources and is likely to be false."}
