{"The use of before and after pictures": "The expert noted that the claim included two images, one showing a damaged road and the other showing a newly made road. This comparison was used to support the claim of road construction in remote villages by the BJP Bihar.", "Verification through reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search and found that the image on the top, depicting a damaged road, was actually a picture of a road in Bangalore.

This suggested that the image could not depict a newly constructed road in 2018 as claimed by the BJP Bihar.", "Previous instances of misleading images by BJP": "The expert highlighted that the BJP had previously used misleading images to showcase infrastructural projects completed under its governance. This pattern raised concerns about the credibility of the claim regarding road construction in remote villages."}
