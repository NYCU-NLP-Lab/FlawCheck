{"The expert reached out to multiple states that have legalized marijuana to inquire about the claim": "but none of them could corroborate it. This indicates that there is no evidence to support the claim.", "Spokespeople from regulatory agencies in California": "Washington, and Oregon stated that there is no link between purchasing marijuana and owning a gun. This contradicts the claim made in the Facebook post.", "The expert pointed out that federal law prohibits users of controlled substances": "including marijuana, from possessing firearms. This demonstrates that there is already a federal law in place that addresses this issue, and there is no need for individual states to enact their own laws.", "The expert also highlighted that the federal form for firearm applications explicitly states that the use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under federal law": "regardless of its legalization or decriminalization in the state. This further supports the fact that marijuana users may be denied the right to own a gun due to federal regulations."}
