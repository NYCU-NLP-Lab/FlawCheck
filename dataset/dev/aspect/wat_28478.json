{"The video shared by Sahibzada Jahangir shows a group of men lying on the road while a herd of cows runs over them": "This visual evidence supports the claim that Indians are forcing Muslim men and children to undergo this treatment.", "The audio in the video includes the crowd saying": "haathi godha palkhi jai kanhaiya lal ki\u201d, which refers to Lord Krishna and suggests that the ritual is part of a religious tradition. This linguistic analysis adds context to the video and indicates that it is not an act of punishment against Muslims.", "Alt News": "through a keyword search on Google, found a video of the same ritual performed by villagers in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. This discovery provides additional evidence that the video is not depicting an act of violence against Muslims but rather a voluntary ritual practiced by some individuals.", "The Daily Mail also posted a video of the same ritual in 2018": "describing it as a voluntary act aimed at securing future prosperity for the participants and their villages. This corroborates the notion that the video is not showcasing an act of persecution but rather a cultural tradition with a specific purpose."}
