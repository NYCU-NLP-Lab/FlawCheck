{"The claim made by Joe Biden and other Democratic leaders states that the Trump budget cuts": "845 billion from Medicare and $240 billion from Medicaid.", "The use of the word": "cuts\" is debatable because Trump's proposed budget actually shows a steady rise in spending for Medicare.", "The": "845 billion reduction in Medicare spending is based on the difference between the projected spending under Trump's plan and the projected spending under the previous trajectory.", "The reduction in Medicare spending is partly due to the shifting of certain Medicare expenses": "such as extra payments to hospitals and funds for teaching hospitals, out of the main Medicare trust fund and into the regular general fund budget. This reduces spending, but not as significantly as the claim suggests."}
