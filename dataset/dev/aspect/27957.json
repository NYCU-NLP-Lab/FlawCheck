{"Social media postings by the perpetrator": "The expert's verdict mentions that partisan news and opinion outlets cited social media postings by James T. Hodgkinson, the perpetrator of the shootings, to suggest that he was incited to violence by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). This aspect helps verify the claim by providing evidence of a potential link between Hodgkinson and the SPLC.", "SPLC": "s mission and activities: The expert's verdict explains that the SPLC is a nonprofit organization dedicated to monitoring hate groups and extremists in the United States. They publish investigative reports, conduct law enforcement training, and provide analysis on hate group activities. This aspect helps establish the SPLC's role and credibility in relation to the claim.", "Connection to a previous attack": "The expert's verdict mentions that the SPLC was \"linked\" to a domestic terror attack against the Family Research Council (FRC) in the past. This connection was cited in court as the impetus for the attack on the FRC. This aspect supports the claim by providing an example of the SPLC's alleged involvement in inciting violence against conservatives.", "Testimony from Liberty Counsel": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from the legal team at Liberty Counsel, criticizing the SPLC for falsely labeling Christian ministries as hate groups. They note that the SPLC was responsible for the first conviction of a man who intended to commit mass murder targeted against a policy organization in Washington, D.C. This aspect presents another perspective and supports the claim by highlighting the SPLC's impact on an individual's intentions to commit violence."}
