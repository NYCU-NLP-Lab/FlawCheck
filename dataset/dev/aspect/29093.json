{"The physiological evidence of antlers": "The expert's verdict mentions that both male and female reindeer grow antlers in the summer, but male reindeer drop their antlers in late November to mid-December, while female reindeer retain their antlers until after giving birth in the spring. This physiological difference supports the claim that Santa's reindeer are female.", "Historical renditions and depictions": "The expert's verdict states that every historical rendition depicting Santa's reindeer shows them as female. This suggests that the traditional representation of Santa's reindeer as female has been consistent over time, further supporting the claim.", "Reindeer and caribou behavior": "The expert's verdict explains that reindeer and caribou are the only deer species where both males and females grow antlers. It also mentions that pregnant cows and calves retain their antlers until spring for an advantage over food resources. This behavior aligns with the claim that Santa's reindeer, being female, would retain their antlers until after giving birth in the spring.", "Alternative explanations": "The expert's verdict mentions that while it is not typical for male reindeer to retain their antlers until December 24th, it is not impossible. It also suggests that Santa's reindeer could potentially be castrated males known as steers. These alternative explanations acknowledge the possibility of male reindeer or castrated males having antlers, but they do not discount the claim that Santa's reindeer are female."}
