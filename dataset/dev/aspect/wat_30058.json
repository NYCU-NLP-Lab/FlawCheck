{"The claim is attributed to Vice President Joe Biden": "who made the statement in a speech at Philadelphia\u2019s 30th Street Station on February 8, 2011. The expert's verdict establishes the source of the claim and provides context for its origin.", "The claim is supported by data from the Transportation Department": "according to Biden's office. The numbers provided include 5 billion passenger miles traveled in the Northeast Corridor every day by rail, as well as an additional 14.5 billion vehicle miles traveled on I-95 between Washington, D.C., and New York City. This data is used to estimate the potential increase in traffic on I-95 if Amtrak's Northeast Corridor were shut down.", "The claim takes into account population growth projections over the next 40 years": "which is expected to increase volume on I-95 by 80 percent. This aspect highlights the consideration of future demand and the impact it would have on the need for additional lanes on I-95.", "The expert": "Steven E. Polzin, director of mobility policy for the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, conducted his own analysis to verify the claim. While the specific methodology used by Polzin is not mentioned in the given text, his analysis provides an additional perspective on the potential impact of shutting down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor on traffic volume and the need for additional lanes on I-95."}
