{"The claim is based on a viral social media post that falsely states that a judge ruled over 200": "000 Biden votes as illegitimate in Wisconsin. The expert's verdict confirms that this claim is false.", "The claim echoes wording from a conservative website": "the Gateway Pundit, which regularly shares skewed and fabricated claims about the 2020 election. This connection further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "The claim misrepresents the concept of": "indefinitely confined\" status in Wisconsin, which allows voters to cast absentee ballots without providing a photo ID. The number of people claiming this status increased in the 2020 election, but it's important to note that more Wisconsin voters claimed this status in counties won by Trump than in those won by Biden.", "The claim fails to acknowledge that legal challenges were raised regarding the indefinitely confined status in Wisconsin": "specifically in heavily Democratic Milwaukee and Dane counties. The Wisconsin Election Commission and the Wisconsin Supreme Court clarified that all voters could not claim this status due to a COVID-19 stay-at-home order, and the clerks rescinded their initial stance."}
