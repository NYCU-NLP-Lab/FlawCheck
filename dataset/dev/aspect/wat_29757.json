{"Lack of evidence and sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim provides no evidence or sources to support the allegation of someone injecting poison into water bottle caps. This lack of substantiating information raises doubts about the claim's authenticity.", "Absence of media coverage": "The expert points out that if multiple deaths had occurred due to poisoned bottled water, it would have received extensive national media coverage. The fact that there is no such coverage further undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Official communication channels": "The expert emphasizes that if law enforcement officials were indeed warning the public about the tampering, they would do so through official government websites and social media channels. The claim's reliance on a screenshot of a text message shared on Facebook instead of official sources raises suspicions.", "Previous debunking and investigation": "The expert mentions that similar claims were debunked in the past, indicating a pattern of misinformation. Additionally, an investigation was launched into a related incident in Bennington, Vermont, but no evidence of widespread tampering was found. These previous debunkings and investigations cast doubt on the current claim's credibility."}
