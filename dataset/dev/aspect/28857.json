{"The Keystone XL pipeline is designed to transport crude oil from Alberta": "Canada to Nebraska and then to Gulf Coast refineries for processing into petroleum products like gasoline.", "The pipeline is expected to transport the equivalent of 830": "000 barrels of oil per day, indicating that it will have a significant impact on oil flow in the United States.", "The Gulf Coast refineries already process heavier crude oils": "like those found in Canada, and also receive similar crude oil from Latin America. This suggests that the pipeline is intended to supplement existing oil imports to the region.", "While the pipeline is primarily designed to transport oil to the Gulf Coast": "where it will be refined for domestic use, there is evidence that crude oil exports from the region have increased in recent years. This raises questions about the claim that the pipeline will not benefit the U.S. and could potentially lead to increased exports."}
