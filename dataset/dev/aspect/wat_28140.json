{"Consolidation in the agribusiness industry": "The expert's verdict highlights the claim that mergers and integration in agribusiness have led to fewer choices for farmers when buying and selling their products. This consolidation has resulted in big agribusinesses capturing more profits and farmers receiving a record-low amount of every dollar spent on food.", "Vertical integration": "The expert's verdict mentions that vertical integration in the agribusiness industry has contributed to the squeeze on family farms. With less competition throughout the supply chain, big agribusinesses are able to capture more profits, further reducing the share of dollars going to farmers.", "Declining share of dollars going to farmers": "The expert's verdict emphasizes the declining trend in the share of each food dollar going to farmers. USDA statistics show that farms have been receiving less and less of the consumer spending on food, indicating a decrease in the financial well-being of farmers.", "Impact of food service industry": "The expert's verdict points out that the rise of the food service industry, including restaurants and fast-food chains, has significantly affected the share of dollars going to farmers. While food service establishments gained an additional 7.5 cents in six years, farmers lost 2.8 cents on the dollar, making them the biggest losers among all sectors involved in the food supply chain."}
