{"The expert analyzed the 2013 Disaster Relief Appropriations Act and determined that the claim of": "two-thirds of the bill had nothing to do with Sandy\" was not accurate. The expert cited a Congressional Quarterly article that stated $17 billion was allocated for immediate aid and $33.5 billion for near- and long-term assistance and mitigation, which contradicted the claim.", "The expert examined the breakdown of the funds allocated by Cruz": "s office and found that a significant portion of the money, $12.8 billion, was granted to the states directly affected by Hurricane Sandy, including New Jersey, New York, and New York City. This evidence suggests that the funds were indeed intended for Sandy-related purposes.", "The expert highlighted that": "10.9 billion was allocated for mass transit reconstruction, which may not have been directly related to Sandy relief efforts. However, the expert emphasized that the slow disbursement of these funds does not necessarily prove that they had nothing to do with Sandy.", "The expert challenged Cruz": "s characterization of the bill as \"filled with unrelated pork\" and stated that while there may have been some padding, the extras amounted to far less than what Cruz claimed. The expert's analysis suggests that the claim of excessive non-Sandy-related spending in the bill was exaggerated."}
