{"Lack of credible source": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim was made by a website called Yournewswire.com, which is known for publishing hoaxes and does not provide any reliable evidence or sources to support the claim.", "Absence of specific details": "The article fails to provide specific details about the alleged doctor, such as their name, the medical symposium where the information was supposedly disclosed, or the date of the symposium. This lack of specific information raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradiction with established facts": "The expert's verdict mentions that Bill and Melinda Gates have invested billions of dollars in researching, developing, and delivering vaccines worldwide to reduce child mortality. This contradicts the claim that Gates refused to vaccinate his own children, as it goes against his philanthropic efforts and public statements supporting vaccinations.", "Inconsistent with the Gates": "public stance: The expert's verdict also cites statements made by Bill and Melinda Gates in their annual letter and social media posts, where they express their dedication to reducing preventable deaths in children through vaccination. This contradicts the claim that Gates refused to vaccinate his children and strengthens the argument against its authenticity."}
