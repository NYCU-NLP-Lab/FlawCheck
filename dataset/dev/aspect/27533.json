{"The claim was made by U": "S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat from El Paso, Texas, during her response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union Address on Feb. 4, 2020. This establishes the source of the claim.", "Escobar": "s spokesperson defined a bill as bipartisan if it had \"at least one Republican vote on the House floor\" or if it was passed by a voice vote and \"has at least one Republican cosponsor.\" This definition of bipartisanship was used to determine which bills were included in the claim.", "Political experts consulted for the analysis agreed that Escobar": "s definition of bipartisanship was relatively low, as it included bills with minimal or single Republican support. This perspective provides context for evaluating the authenticity of the claim."}
