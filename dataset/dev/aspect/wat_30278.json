{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that New York state hospitals are reporting thousands of fungus lung infections due to wearing a mask. This lack of evidence is a crucial aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Expert testimonies": "The expert consulted multiple infectious-disease doctors, spokespersons for healthcare associations, and a specialist at Boston University, who all stated that they have not heard of or are aware of any such cases. These expert testimonies provide further evidence against the claim.", "Recommendations from authoritative sources": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend washing cloth face coverings after each use, which is unrelated to the claim of fungus lung infections. However, the mention of this recommendation highlights the lack of evidence supporting the claim.", "False rating": "The expert concludes the verdict by giving the Facebook post a false rating. This rating indicates that the claim is not true and further supports the lack of authenticity in the claim."}
