{"The expert analyzed the claim made by Holmes County Republican Rep": "Bob Gibbs that \"If Obamacare is fully implemented, 30 million people will still be without health insurance.\"", "The expert found that Gibbs": "claim was close to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis, which stated that in their current projections for 2023, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would reduce the number of people without health insurance by 25 million, leaving 31 million uninsured.", "The expert highlighted that Gibbs": "claim ignored the fact that without the ACA, the number of people without insurance would be much higher. The CBO estimated that in the next 10 years, 25 million nonelderly people who currently don't have insurance would gain insurance under the ACA.", "The expert emphasized the importance of providing context and considering the overall impact of the ACA on reducing the number of uninsured individuals": "rather than focusing solely on the specific number mentioned by Gibbs."}
