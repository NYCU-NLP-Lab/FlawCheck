{"The expert referred to a U": "S. Department of Health and Human Services list of 41 federal programs that use poverty guidelines to determine eligibility. However, a review of this list did not support DiPietro's claim that New York offers 35 different welfare benefits.", "The expert mentioned that different think tanks have different ways of defining and counting": "welfare\" programs. The Cato Institute counted 126 separate federal anti-poverty programs in 2013, while the Heritage Foundation counted 79 federal means-tested welfare programs in 2012. This highlights the challenge in accurately determining the number of welfare benefits.", "The expert stated that regardless of how think tanks count the programs": "there is no doubt that New York is more generous compared to other states. In Cato's analysis, New York ranked seventh among states for the total value of welfare benefits and third most-generous in the value of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families.", "The expert emphasized that New York does not offer more programs relative to other states based on the U": "S. Department of Health and Human Services list. While specific programs like the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid can vary in generosity across states, New York does not have a significantly higher number of welfare benefits compared to the national average."}
