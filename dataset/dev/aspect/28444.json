{"Misrepresentation of Stephen Schneider": "s quote: The expert's verdict highlights that Rep. Lamar Smith took a quote by Stephen Schneider out of context. Smith claimed that Schneider said, \"we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have,\" implying that climate scientists manipulate data. However, the expert clarifies that this was not Schneider's message.", "Cherry": "picking evidence: The expert's verdict points out that Rep. Lamar Smith selectively chose evidence to support his claim. Smith mentioned that climate scientists predicted global temperatures would increase by more than one degree Celsius by 2020, but observed temperatures have been only half as high. However, this cherry-picked data does not provide a comprehensive picture of climate change trends.", "False assertion of following the scientific method": "The expert's verdict states that Rep. Lamar Smith falsely claimed that the House Science, Space and Technology Committee follows the scientific method, welcomes critiques, avoids exaggerated predictions, and relies on unbiased data. The expert highlights that Smith's claims about the committee's adherence to the scientific method are misleading.", "Ignoring scientific consensus": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Lamar Smith ignored the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change. By presenting misleading claims and cherry-picked data, Smith disregarded the consensus among climate scientists that global temperatures are indeed increasing and that human activities contribute significantly to this phenomenon."}
