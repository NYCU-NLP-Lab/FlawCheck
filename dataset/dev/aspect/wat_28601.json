{"Historical and cultural association": "The expert mentions that rosemary has long been associated with memory enhancement in classical literature and folklore, specifically referencing Shakespeare's Hamlet where rosemary is described as \"for remembrance.\" This historical and cultural association adds credibility to the claim.", "Pseudoscientific sources": "The expert highlights that the claim about rosemary increasing memory by 75% can be found on pseudoscientific natural health websites. This indicates that the claim is being propagated in unreliable sources, which raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Origin of the claim": "The expert explains that the claim originated from a Daily Mail coverage of an academic presentation at the 2013 British Psychology Society annual meeting. The presentation was given by a student working in the lab of Professor Mark Moss, a psychologist at Northumbria University. The fact that the claim is based on a small-scale experiment presented at a conference, rather than a peer-reviewed study, suggests that further scrutiny is needed.", "Experimental design and sample size": "The expert mentions the details of the experiment conducted at Northumbria University, where 66 participants were placed in either a rosemary-scented room or a non-scented room and asked to perform memory recall tasks. The small sample size and the specific methodology used in the experiment raise questions about the generalizability of the findings and the significance of the claimed 75% increase in memory."}
