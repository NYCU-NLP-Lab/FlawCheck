{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the examination of the actual bills introduced by House Democrats on the first day of the 116th Congress": "The expert analyzed the Congressional Record, which listed the bills in order, and found that the first three bills introduced by a House Democrat were H.R. 1, H.R. 21, and H.R. 31. None of these bills mentioned impeachment, banning the Electoral College, or providing $54 billion in foreign aid.", "The second aspect used to verify the claim was the description and purpose of each of the first three bills": "The expert explained that H.R. 1, known as the For the People Act of 2019, aimed to expand Americans' access to the ballot box, reduce the influence of money in politics, and strengthen ethics rules for public servants. H.R. 21, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, allocated funds to end the partial government shutdown, while H.R. 31, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019, focused on imposing sanctions and financial restrictions related to the conflict in Syria. None of these bills aligned with the claims made in the Facebook meme.", "The third aspect utilized to verify the claim was the lack of mention of impeachment or the Electoral College in the first three Democratic bills": "The expert explicitly stated that none of the bills introduced by House Democrats on the first day of the 116th Congress mentioned impeachment or the Electoral College.", "The fourth aspect considered to verify the claim was the fact that the Facebook meme cherry": "picked two bills on impeachment and the Electoral College that were introduced by individual House Democrats on the first day of Congress. However, these bills were not part of the first three bills introduced by House Democrats as claimed in the meme. The expert highlighted that these individual bills did not represent the official position or actions of the entire Democratic Party."}
