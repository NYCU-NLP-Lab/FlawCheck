{"Comparison of countries bombed": "The claim states that Obama bombed 7 countries while Bush bombed 4. The expert's verdict provides a comparison of the countries bombed by each president, listing them as Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya, and Syria for Obama, and Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, and Somalia for Bush.", "Verification through news reports": "The expert's verdict references various news organizations such as The New York Times, BBC News, and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to support the claim. These news sources have reported on airstrikes and drone strikes in countries like Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, and Libya, under both Obama and Bush.", "Credibility of intelligence officials": "The expert's verdict mentions the statements of \"three current and former intelligence officials\" who confirm drone strikes in the Philippines in 2006 and 2012. This adds to the evidence supporting the claim.", "Evaluation of the nature of attacks": "The expert's verdict also considers the nature of the attacks in Yemen, where a \"one-off strike\" was mentioned by Lizza, the person who made the claim. The expert acknowledges that while Yemen could be included in Bush's list, it may deserve an asterisk due to the difference in sustained bombing campaigns."}
