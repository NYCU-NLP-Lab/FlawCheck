{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that the claim made by Trump regarding the violation of federal law by 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants receiving welfare programs is false. This aspect is verified by stating that Trump's speech on illegal immigration did not provide any detailed policy address supporting this claim.", "The expert refers to a Department of Homeland Security report from fiscal year 2013": "which estimates that there are 1.9 million removable criminal aliens in the United States. However, it is not specified how many of these individuals are living in the U.S. illegally. This aspect verifies that the claim's assertion of 2 million people being convicted of a crime while living illegally in the U.S. is misleading.", "The Migration Policy Institute": "s report from July 2015 is cited to support the claim that most of the 1.9 million removable criminal aliens mentioned in the DHS report are in the U.S. legally. The report estimates that 820,000 of the 1.9 million are living in the U.S. illegally. Additionally, it states that 690,000 of the 820,000 would be considered priorities for removal due to felony or serious misdemeanor convictions. This aspect verifies that the claim's statement about the number of illegal immigrant households receiving welfare programs is not accurate.", "The expert also addresses Trump": "s claim that illegal immigration costs the country more than $113 billion a year. It is mentioned that this figure is based on a study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which aims to reduce overall immigration. The expert clarifies that the net cost of illegal immigration, including federal and local tax collections, was actually reported as $99 billion in the study. This aspect verifies that the claim's assertion of a $113 billion cost is incorrect and that the study's findings were solely related to costs, without considering monetary benefits to government coffers."}
