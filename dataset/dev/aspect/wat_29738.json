{"The official cause of death": "The expert's verdict highlights that the FBI agent, David Raynor, died as a result of a domestic-related suicide. The local police confirmed that Raynor turned his own gun on himself in front of officers after being given verbal commands to drop the weapon.", "Lack of evidence connecting the death to the claim": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to suggest that Raynor's death was in any way connected to the Fast and Furious operation or Hillary Clinton's State Department. The claim made by Neon Nettle implies a conspiracy to cover up Clinton's corruption, but the investigation found no such evidence.", "Divorce proceedings and domestic issues": "The expert's verdict mentions that Raynor and his wife, Donna Fisher, were in the midst of divorce proceedings and were experiencing serious domestic issues. This information provides context to the circumstances surrounding their deaths and suggests that the motive was related to their personal situation rather than any political conspiracy.", "Lack of credibility of the source": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from the disreputable website Neon Nettle. This information raises doubts about the reliability and credibility of the claim, as Neon Nettle is not known for its accurate reporting and has a history of publishing false or misleading information."}
