{"The expert used the S": "P report as a source to evaluate the claim. The report stated that the downgrade was based on political brinksmanship and did not assign blame or indicate which party was more responsible.", "The expert analyzed the sources cited by the DCCC to support their claim about higher interest rates": "These sources were articles speculating on the possibility of interest rates increasing, but did not provide concrete evidence.", "The expert considered the actions and statements of Rep": "Bob Gibbs, the Republican mentioned in the claim. However, they found no direct evidence linking Gibbs to the downgrade or the potential consequences.", "The expert highlighted the lack of individual accountability in the claim": "questioning the DCCC's assertion that Gibbs can be solely blamed for the downgrade and its consequences. They also noted that the DCCC gave equal billing to Gibbs and Speaker of the House John Boehner, which may be misleading."}
