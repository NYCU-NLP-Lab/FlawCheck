{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that the initial claim was made by a website known for publishing satirical content. The disclaimer on the website itself states that the information may not be reliable and that the articles should be considered satirical. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory information": "The expert's verdict highlights that the same website later published a follow-up article stating that George Soros was actually alive and had traveled to Hawaii. This contradictory information undermines the credibility of the initial claim and suggests that it may have been a fabrication.", "Absence of official confirmation": "The expert's verdict mentions that neither the Democrats nor Soros' representatives confirmed the plane crash. The lack of official confirmation from reliable sources raises questions about the veracity of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in details": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim stated the plane crash occurred in the Alps, but satellite images showed no evidence of a crash. Additionally, there was no radio contact with anyone near the alleged crash site. These inconsistencies in the details of the claim further cast doubt on its authenticity."}
