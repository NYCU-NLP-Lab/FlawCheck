{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the comparison of the alleged prediction in": "The Simpsons\" episode with the actual occurrence of the 2020 new coronavirus outbreak. The expert states that the episode focused on a viral outbreak, but it was commenting on past events rather than predicting future ones.", "Another aspect used to assess the claim": "s authenticity is the analysis of the image that circulated on social media. The expert points out that the first three panels of the image, which are claimed to be from the 1993 episode, are unaltered and can be seen in the actual episode called \"Marge in Chains.\" This verifies that the episode did depict a viral outbreak, but it does not imply a prediction of the specific coronavirus outbreak in 2020.", "The expert also highlights the fourth panel of the image": "which is doctored and comes from a different episode called \"The Fool Monty.\" This panel was manipulated by adding the words \"Corona Virus\" on top of an original image that read \"Apocalypse Meow.\" This aspect demonstrates that the claim was misleadingly altered to support the prediction narrative.", "Additionally": "the expert mentions historical examples of previous pandemics, such as the Spanish Flu, Hong Kong Flu, and Asian Flu, to emphasize that viral outbreaks have been a recurring theme throughout history. This context further discredits the notion that \"The Simpsons\" episode predicted the specific occurrence of the 2020 new coronavirus outbreak."}
