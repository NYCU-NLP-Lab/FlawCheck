{"The expert mentions that scientific studies have provided a wide range of mean estimates concerning bird mortality due to wind farms": "ranging from 20,000 to 573,000 bird deaths per year. This suggests that there is variability in the estimates, but none have estimated that wind farms currently kill 1 million birds a year as claimed by Trump.", "The expert cites the U": "S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which estimates that wind turbines may kill a half a million birds a year. This indicates that there is an official estimate from a reputable organization, but it falls short of the 1 million bird deaths claimed by Trump.", "The expert refers to a study conducted by ornithologist K": "Shawn Smallwood, published in the journal Wildlife Society Bulletin in 2013. This study estimated 573,000 bird fatalities per year, including 83,000 raptor fatalities, when the country's wind energy production capacity was at 51,630 megawatts. This study provides another estimate that is below the 1 million bird deaths claimed by Trump.", "The expert mentions a North Dakota lawsuit where seven oil companies were charged for violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act": "resulting in the deaths of 28 birds. This example highlights that while some bird deaths occur due to wind farms, fossil-fuel plants actually kill far more birds per year. This suggests that wind farms may not be the primary cause of bird mortality as claimed by Trump."}
