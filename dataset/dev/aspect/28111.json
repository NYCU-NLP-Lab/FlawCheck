{"The historical background of the General Assembly": "s authority: The expert mentions that the General Assembly's authority to impose taxes dates back to the colonial era and was reaffirmed in the state's first Constitution adopted in 1842. This historical context provides evidence for the Assembly's long-standing authority to levy taxes.", "The interpretation of the state Supreme Court": "The expert explains that the state Supreme Court consistently interpreted the Constitution to grant the General Assembly unlimited power unless specifically prohibited. This interpretation further supports the Assembly's authority to impose taxes.", "The 2004": "separation of powers\" legislation: The expert discusses the amendments made in 2004, which divided the government into three separate branches and eliminated the catch-all Section 10. While these amendments removed explicit references to the Assembly's authority to tax, legal experts argue that the implicit powers still allow for taxation.", "Legal experts": "perspective: The expert mentions the opinion of former state Supreme Court Justice Robert G. Flanders Jr., who states that although the 2004 amendments brought changes, much of the Assembly's authority still remains. This perspective highlights the argument that implicit authority can be as effective as explicit authority when it comes to taxation."}
