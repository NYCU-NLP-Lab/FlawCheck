{"The timing of the posts": "The expert's verdict mentions that the posts were shared on Facebook days before Ahok's release from prison on January 24. This indicates that the claim was made prior to Ahok's release and could potentially be false.", "Source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that one of the posts featuring the image was from a pro-Ahok Facebook group with over 120,000 members. This suggests that the claim originated from a Facebook group that supports Ahok, which may introduce bias and raise questions about the credibility of the claim.", "Description of the sculpture": "The expert's verdict describes the image in the misleading Facebook post, mentioning that the figure of Ahok is pictured in a green uniform with visibly jointed arms. This contradicts the typical appearance of wax sculptures at Madame Tussauds, which are known for their lifelike and realistic features. The description raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Reverse image search": "According to the expert's verdict, a reverse image search revealed that the image was taken from an advertisement for an action figure of Ahok, posted on Instagram by the toy's maker in August 2017. This suggests that the image used in the misleading Facebook post is not from Madame Tussauds but rather a promotional image for an action figure, further undermining the authenticity of the claim."}
