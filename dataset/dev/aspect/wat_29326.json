{"Radiocarbon dating": "The researchers used radiocarbon dating to measure carbon isotopes absorbed by the eye tissue of 28 Greenland sharks that had perished during the Greenland Institute for Natural Resources\u2019 commercial fish-monitoring program. This method allowed them to estimate the age of the sharks.", "Range of ages": "The tissue analysis provided a range for the sharks' ages, with the minimum age being at least 272 years and the maximum age being as much as 512 years. The oldest specimen examined was approximately 400 years old.", "Uncertainty": "The researchers acknowledged that there was some room for error in their estimates. They mentioned that there was uncertainty with the age range and that the lowest part of the range, at least 272 years, still made Greenland sharks the longest-living vertebrate known to science.", "Comparison with other species": "The study highlighted that determining the age of marine species is particularly difficult. While humans and other vertebrates are typically thought to live for about the same duration, marine species are likely to be very long-lived. The study emphasized that Greenland sharks are the longest-living vertebrates known, surpassing other species in terms of longevity."}
