{"The expert conducted a web search to find the origin of the claim and discovered that some sentences from the chain email were lifted directly from a June New York Daily News article": "However, the article did not address the specific claim being checked.", "The expert consulted the Florida Senate": "s final analysis, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the American Civil Liberties Union to gather information on Florida's law regarding drug testing for cash assistance applicants. These sources provided details on the requirements and consequences of drug testing in Florida.", "The expert found that Florida": "s law is part of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which is funded by federal block grants. As part of welfare reform in 1996, states were allowed to use drug testing as part of eligibility for these block grant programs. However, Florida was not the first state to implement such testing.", "The expert determined that Florida": "s law requires applicants for cash aid to pay for their own drug tests. If they pass the test, the cost of testing is added to their benefits. If they fail, they are disqualified from cash aid for a year, but can reapply in six months with drug abuse treatment.
