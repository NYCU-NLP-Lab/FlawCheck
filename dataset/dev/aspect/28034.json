{"Bill White": "s refusal to debate: The claim states that Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, is refusing to debate incumbent Gov. Rick Perry. This aspect is supported by statements from both campaigns and their representatives.", "Perry": "s demand for tax returns: Perry has stated that he will not debate White until the Democrat releases his tax returns for the years he served as Houston's mayor, deputy energy secretary, and as the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party. This aspect highlights Perry's condition for engaging in debates and his argument for White's lack of transparency.", "White": "s response and evidence: The White campaign responded to Perry's accusation on their Twitter account, denying the claim and suggesting that Perry's accusations were baseless. They also provided evidence of White's acceptance of five televised debates, as mentioned in a July 21 press release."}
