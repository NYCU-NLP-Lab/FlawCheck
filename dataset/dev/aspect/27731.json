{"The expert analyzed the statistics provided by President Obama regarding the number of people trying to cross the border illegally": "This involved examining data on apprehensions by the U.S. Border Patrol and comparing them to previous years.", "The expert considered alternative ways to measure the pressure at the border": "such as changes in estimates of the undocumented population in the country. They acknowledged that neither method is perfect but highlighted the advantage of using apprehension numbers, which are based on actual reports of people detained by federal agents.", "The expert noted that the Census Bureau": "s data cannot be used to evaluate Obama's comparison to the 1970s since the Census didn't start tracking the number of undocumented immigrants until the 1980s. They also mentioned the potential use of Homeland Security data, which combines apprehensions at the border and interior.", "The expert consulted U": "S. Border Patrol data, specifically looking at the number of apprehensions from 1983 through 2014. They observed a pattern of fluctuating numbers, with a dip before Obama's first term, a decrease over the next four years, and a slight uptick starting in 2012. However, the exact number for 2014 was not confirmed at the time of the analysis."}
