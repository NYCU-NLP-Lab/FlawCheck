{"Comparison with other polls": "The expert compared the claim made by White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer with various polls from reputable sources such as Time, Politico, Wall Street Journal, and Des Moines Register. These polls consistently showed Obama's approval rating at record lows, contradicting Pfeiffer's claim.", "Reference to specific polling data": "The expert mentioned the specific poll, the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, which showed Obama's approval rating at 41 percent. This specific data point was used to challenge Pfeiffer's claim of a 3-point gain in approval rating.", "Verification through an aggregate of polling data": "The expert referred to Real Clear Politics, a political website that aggregates polling data and calculates an average. This average was used to support Pfeiffer's claim of a 3-point gain in Obama's approval rating over the last couple of months.", "Consideration of potential outliers": "The expert noted that the recent surge in the average approval rating seemed to be skewed largely by two outlier polls. This suggests that caution should be exercised when interpreting the overall trend and the specific 3-point gain claimed by Pfeiffer."}
