{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was reviewing the Comprehensive Performance Audit of the Portland Public Schools": "published by auditing firm KPMG in 1998. This audit commended the district for maintaining a lean administrative staff that accounted for 8% of PPS' total staff.", "The second aspect involved contacting the auditing firm": "KPMG, to seek clarification on their definition of \"administrative staff\" mentioned in the audit. However, the firm was unable to provide a clear definition due to the age of the audit.", "The third aspect involved consulting with Portland Public Schools spokesman": "Matt Shelby, to gather information and insights on the staff composition and administrative roles within the district. This step aimed to gain a better understanding of the current administrative staff size and its percentage in relation to the total staff.", "The fourth aspect may involve further investigation into media reports or additional sources that discuss the administrative structure and staffing of Portland Public Schools": "This could include analyzing data on staff reductions, budget allocations, and any other relevant information that can provide evidence on the claim's authenticity."}
