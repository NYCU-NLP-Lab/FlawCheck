{"Comparison to other states": "The expert mentions that Illinois is not ranked as number one among states or in the top ten in terms of educational achievement. This indicates that the claim of having the most educated workforce is not supported by rankings or comparisons with other states.", "Lack of evidence": "When asked to provide evidence for Illinois' educational achievement, the spokesperson for J.B. Pritzker's campaign reframed the statement as an opinion rather than providing factual evidence. This suggests that there is a lack of concrete evidence to support the claim.", "Alternative metrics": "The expert mentions that the U.S. Census provides estimates for the share of each state's workforce that holds degrees, which is a metric more closely aligned with Pritzker's claim. However, the expert does not explicitly state whether Illinois ranks highly in this metric or not.", "Unverifiable aspect": "The expert points out that the claim includes the term \"dedicated,\" which is an unknowable state of mind and therefore impossible to assess. This highlights that one aspect of the claim cannot be verified or measured objectively."}
