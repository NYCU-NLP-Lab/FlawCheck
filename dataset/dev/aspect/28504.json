{"The claim is based on a screenshot of a tweet that is attributed to US President Donald Trump": "The expert verifies the authenticity of the claim by examining the image and its source, which is a Facebook post from an account displaying the logo of Nigeria\u2019s main opposition People's Democratic Party. The fact that the image has been viewed more than 16,000 times since it was shared on Facebook adds to the credibility of the claim.", "The caption of the tweet in the image is analyzed to determine its authenticity": "The expert notes that the caption is written in a style that is typical of Trump, with uppercase words and spelling errors. This similarity to Trump's style suggests that the tweet could be genuine.", "The expert finds that there are multiple versions of the same claim being shared on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter": "The fact that the claim is being shared by different sources adds to its credibility, as it indicates that the information is being widely circulated.", "The expert also examines the timing and context of the claim": "The claim is made in the aftermath of Iran launching missiles at air bases hosting American troops, which was seen as retaliation for the killing of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani. This context suggests that the claim could be plausible, as it aligns with recent international developments. Additionally, the expert searches for the tweets on Trump's official Twitter account but finds no evidence of them, further casting doubt on their authenticity."}
