{"The practice of": "denaturing\" alcohol: The expert explains that the government did purposely add poisonous substances to alcohol during Prohibition. This practice, known as \"denaturing,\" involved adding noxious chemicals to alcohol meant for industrial purposes to make it unfit for human consumption.", "Purpose of denaturing": "The expert clarifies that the purpose of denaturing alcohol was not to intentionally poison supplies of alcohol meant for human consumption or to kill those who drank the tainted products. Instead, it was a measure to discourage people from drinking alcohol during Prohibition by making it unpalatable and potentially harmful.", "Negative unintended consequences of Prohibition": "The expert highlights that one of the unintended consequences of Prohibition was the booming black market in alcohol. Despite the ban on production, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages, people continued to make, buy, and consume alcohol illegally. This led to increased risks and dangers associated with the consumption of illicit alcohol, including the use of poisonous substances.", "Historical context and origin of denaturing": "The expert mentions that the practice of denaturing alcohol was not specific to the Prohibition era but had been used in Europe before being introduced in the United States in 1906. It was primarily implemented to exempt producers of alcohol used in paints, solvents, and similar products from paying taxes on potable spirits. Denaturing involved adding methyl alcohol (\"wood alcohol\") to grain alcohol and sometimes including substances that made the product taste unpleasant."}
