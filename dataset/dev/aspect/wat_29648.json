{"The ad uses an out": "of-context video clip to claim that Joe Biden confirmed he will come for the guns of Americans if he\u2019s elected president.", "The full response from Joe Biden was edited in the ad": "where he actually argued that banning assault weapons wouldn't violate constitutional rights and that he wouldn't confiscate legally purchased firearms.", "The ad misrepresents the conversation between Anderson Cooper and Joe Biden": "where they were discussing mass shootings and gun restrictions, including expanding background checks and banning assault weapons.", "The ad fails to mention that the 1994 assault weapons ban": "which Biden supported, had exceptions such as a grandfather clause for legally owned weapons and that studies didn't prove its effectiveness in reducing crime."}
