{"The video does not provide evidence of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that Alt News did not post the video due to its graphic content, but they analyzed the video and found that it does not support the claim made in the tweet. This suggests that the video itself does not provide any evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that the tweet was shared by an obscure Twitter account and there were no credible news reports linking the incident to either the RSS or Bajrang Dal. This indicates that there is a lack of reliable sources supporting the claim.", "Previous debunking of similar claims": "Alt News had previously debunked a similar video with a different narrative, blaming the Bajrang Dal instead of the RSS. This suggests that there have been false claims made using the same video in the past, further questioning the authenticity of the current claim.", "Historical context and conflicting information": "The expert's verdict states that the incident in the video took place in August 2018 in Bihiya town of Bhojpur district, Bihar. However, there was no reference to either the RSS or Bajrang Dal in any of the news reports about the incident. Additionally, it is mentioned that RJD leader Kaushal Kishore Yadav was among the people arrested for the violence at Bihiya. These conflicting pieces of information raise doubts about the claim's accuracy and the involvement of RSS workers."}
