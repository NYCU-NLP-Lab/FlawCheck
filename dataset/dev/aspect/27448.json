{"Unrealistic audio": "The expert points out that the audio in the video is unrealistic. The bear's growl remains at the same volume regardless of its distance from the snowboarder, and the clear audio of the bear running seems unlikely to be captured by the camera while the snowboarder is making her way down the hill. The absence of wind interference, which should be audible, also raises skepticism.", "Previous videos with more realistic audio": "The expert mentions that five days before uploading the \"Snowboarder Girl Chased By Bear\" video, the uploader had posted two other videos from the same location with more realistic audio. This raises doubts about why the audio in the bear chase video is different.", "Possible use of stock audio": "The expert suggests that the clear audio of the bear could have been taken from stock audio, rather than being recorded in the actual snowboarding incident. This possibility questions the authenticity of the audio in the video.", "Computer": "generated animal: When the video is slowed down, the expert observes that the bear in the footage appears to be computer-generated. This raises doubts about whether the bear in the video is a real animal or a digitally created element."}
