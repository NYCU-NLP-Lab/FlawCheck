{"Legislation exemption": "The expert's verdict mentions that legislation was enacted to exempt Foxconn from certain environmental requirements, specifically allowing the company to fill in wetlands that are regulated by the state and change the course of streams. This exemption is a key aspect that verifies the claim.", "Lack of oversight": "The claim states that Foxconn will not face oversight from any federal, state, or local agency to ensure compliance with wetlands protection laws. The expert's verdict confirms this aspect, highlighting that the legislation passed in Wisconsin removed state authority over wetlands on the Foxconn property, indicating a lack of oversight.", "U": "S. Army Corps of Engineers' decision: The expert's verdict mentions that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stated they have no jurisdiction over the wetlands that will be filled as part of Foxconn's plans. This decision supports the claim that there is no federal agency oversight to guarantee compliance with wetlands protection laws.", "Mitigation requirements": "The expert's verdict also mentions that under existing law, developers are required to create new wetlands to compensate for any lost due to construction. However, the legislation specifically related to Foxconn requires greater mitigation, with a ratio of 2 acres created for every 1 acre lost. This aspect further supports the claim that Foxconn is exempt from typical environmental requirements and oversight."}
