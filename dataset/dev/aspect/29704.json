This suggests that the claim is not authentic.", "The quote about": "even some colored folk\" did not appear to be a paraphrase of anything Biden said, further undermining the authenticity of the claim.", "The": "negroes\" quote mentioning \"positions of power\" was found to be a paraphrase of something Biden read aloud in Congress in 1985.
