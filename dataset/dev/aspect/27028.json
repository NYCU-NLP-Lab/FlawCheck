{"Bernie Sanders": "statement: The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the direct statement made by Bernie Sanders during his speech at Liberty University. The expert's verdict mentions that Sanders specifically stated, \"There is no justice when the top 1/10th of 1 percent today in America owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.\" This statement serves as the basis for further investigation.", "Source citation": "The second aspect involves the source of the statistic mentioned by Bernie Sanders. The expert's verdict states that Sanders' policy director, Warren Gunnels, referred to a November 13, 2014, article in The Guardian as the source for the statistic. This article, commissioned by the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research, was written by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.", "Research paper": "The third aspect involves the research paper mentioned in The Guardian article. The paper, authored by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, utilized tax records to estimate wealth inequality in 2012. The paper's findings indicated that the top 0.1 percent of Americans owned a significant portion of the country's wealth, while the bottom 90 percent had considerably less wealth.", "Wealth concentration trends": "The fourth aspect revolves around the overall trend of wealth concentration among the richest Americans. The expert's verdict mentions that the research paper highlighted a U-shaped pattern of wealth concentration over the past century. It declined from 1929 to 1978 but has been rising since then, particularly benefiting the richest individuals. This trend supports the claim made by Bernie Sanders regarding the wealth distribution in America."}
