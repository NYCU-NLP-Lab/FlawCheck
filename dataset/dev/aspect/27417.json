{"The claim was compared to a recent event reported by The Philadelphia Inquirer": "which stated that President Trump held a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania on December 10. The event was described as having a rainy day, which contradicts the claim of a massive crowd in a stadium in downtown Philly.", "The image used in the Facebook post was identified as a photo from the Live Aid concert held on July 13": "1985, at Wembley Stadium in London. Getty Images has a collection of photos from the concert, which clearly show the similarity between the manipulated image and the original photo.", "The manipulated version of the Live Aid photo used in the Facebook post was analyzed": "and it was found that Trump signs were added in place of a white tent near the stage and the Live Aid logo on the stage. However, a commenter pointed out that the \"Feed the world\" banner on the concert stage was still visible in the manipulated image.", "The fact": "checkers also referenced a previous Facebook post that used a photo from the 1969 Woodstock festival and falsely claimed it was a Trump rally. This comparison highlights a pattern of using unrelated photos to falsely depict large crowds at Trump rallies."}
