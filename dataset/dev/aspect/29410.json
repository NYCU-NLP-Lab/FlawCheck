{"Budget reduction": "The expert analyzed historical data from the Office of Management and Budget to verify the claim that a half a billion dollars were cut from the EPA's budget in the last two years. The data showed a decrease in EPA spending from $8.725 billion in 2016 to an estimated $7.916 billion in 2018, exceeding the claimed amount.", "Omnibus spending bill": "The expert mentioned that the actual amount allowed by the omnibus spending bill passed after the Office of Management and Budget's estimate was slightly higher for 2018, at $8.058 billion. However, even with this higher level, the two-year decrease still exceeded the half-billion-dollar figure mentioned by the candidate.", "Employment level": "To verify the claim of cutting 3,000 jobs from the EPA, the expert used the federal Office of Management and Budget's data tool called FedScope. By examining employment data on a quarterly basis, it was found that EPA employment fell by 387 people over the two-year period, significantly short of the 3,000 jobs claimed by the candidate.", "Individual influence": "The expert pointed out that while the candidate boasted about cutting the EPA's budget, it is not within the power of individual U.S. House members to unilaterally reduce an agency's budget. This aspect highlights the need for a more accurate representation of the role played by the candidate in the budget reduction."}
