{"Statements from Chinese government officials": "The claim was traced back to statements made by Chinese vice foreign minister Zhai Jun and commerce minister Chen Deming, who both confirmed that trade between China and Africa reached $166.3 billion in 2011.", "Data from reputable sources": "The claim was verified using data from the United Nations (UN), World Bank, and other research institutes. These sources confirmed the $166 billion trade volume between Africa and China in 2011.", "Analysis by the China": "Africa Research Initiative (CARI): The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies houses CARI, which focuses on the economic dimensions of China-Africa relations. CARI compiled trade statistics using data from the UN Comtrade, a reliable source for tracking trade in commodities and services.", "Lack of recent data": "The claim did not provide more recent figures that could include the years during the Trump administration. This aspect raises questions about the current volume of trade between Africa and China and whether the $166 billion figure still stands."}
