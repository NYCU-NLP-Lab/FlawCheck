{"The claim originated from an obscure and dubious website called RightWingNow": "com, which raises doubts about its credibility.", "The article includes a quote from University of California freshman Seth Greenberg": "who claims that he will publicly remove his penis if Donald Trump begins work on the US-Mexico border wall. However, the article does not specify the method of removal, which adds to the questionable nature of the claim.", "The article mentions that Greenberg made this statement during a street interview where he was simultaneously protesting prayer in public school": "This additional context may cast doubt on the seriousness and authenticity of his claim.", "The article includes a picture of a student named": "Greenburg\" who threatened to cut off his penis, but it is later revealed that the picture is not of anyone named \"Greenburg\" and has no connection to the University of California system. This discrepancy further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
