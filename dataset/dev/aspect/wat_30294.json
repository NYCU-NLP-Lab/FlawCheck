{"Comparison of job growth rates": "The expert compared the monthly job gains under President Trump to those under President Obama and found that they were not significantly different. This suggests that job growth under Trump is not unprecedented as claimed.", "Comparison of specific job gains": "The expert analyzed job gains from February to August under Trump and compared them to the same period under Obama. The analysis showed that job gains under Trump were actually lower than most of the previous six years under Obama, except for one year. This contradicts the claim of exceptional job growth.", "Longest streak of positive job gains": "The expert highlighted that August 2017 marked the 83rd consecutive month of month-to-month job gains, which is a record. This information indicates that job growth has been consistently positive for a prolonged period, undermining the claim that the country has not seen such growth in a long time.", "Expert opinions": "The expert cited the opinions of economists, such as Gary Burtless and Tara Sinclair, who acknowledged the surprising and sustained nature of job growth. However, Sinclair also expressed disappointment, suggesting that the current job growth may not be meeting certain expectations."}
