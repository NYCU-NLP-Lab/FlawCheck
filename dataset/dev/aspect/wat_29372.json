{"The claim originated from a conservative website called Gateway Pundit with the headline": "BREAKING: Don't Let The MAGA Hat Fool You, Hispanic Shooter 'Nicolas de Jesus Cruz' Was A Registered Democrat.\" However, the website later changed the headline to \"UPDATE: Nicolas de Jesus Cruz was not Registered as Democrat as Some Sources Reported.\"", "Records from the Florida Department of State show that Nikolas Cruz": "the Florida school shooter, is not a registered voter. This information contradicts the claim that he was a registered Democrat.", "The claim also incorrectly identifies the shooter": "s name as \"Nicolas de Jesus Cruz\" instead of his actual name, \"Nikolas Jacob Cruz.\" This discrepancy further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "The photo circulating": "allegedly showing Cruz wearing a red cap with President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again,\" came from a now-deleted Instagram account under the name \"nikolascruzmakarov.\" However, there is no official verification that the account belonged to Cruz, adding doubt to the claim's accuracy."}
