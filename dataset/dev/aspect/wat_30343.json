{"Structural differences between virus": "bacteria, and human cells: The expert mentions that visual observation of bacteria and human cells is possible with a simple microscope, but not of a virus. They explain that typical animal or plant cells are larger in size compared to bacteria and viruses, and that the novel coronavirus falls within the size range of a virus.", "Culturing and genome sequencing": "The expert describes how samples from patients with viral pneumonia were cultured and their genome sequences were determined. The genome sequences were found to be similar to a previously identified virus, leading to the identification of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).", "Testing for COVID": "19: The expert mentions that the same virus (SARS-CoV-2) has been found through contact tracing and testing using the RT-PCR test in hospitals on suspected individuals. This indicates that the virus is responsible for causing COVID-19.", "Lack of detection of bacterial infection": "The expert states that if COVID-19 was caused by a bacterial infection, it would not have remained a matter of controversy for such a long time. This suggests that the available evidence supports the claim that COVID-19 is caused by a virus rather than a bacterium."}
