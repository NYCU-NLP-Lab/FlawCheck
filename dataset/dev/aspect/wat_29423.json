{"Publication in prestigious scientific journals": "The claim was supported by research studies published in well-respected scientific journals, namely Nature and the New England Journal of Medicine. These journals have rigorous peer-review processes and high standards for publication, indicating that the claim underwent scrutiny by experts in the field.", "Analysis of baseball player data": "One aspect employed to verify the claim was the analysis of data collected about professional baseball players. The researchers examined the longevity of both left-handed and right-handed players and found a statistically significant difference in their mean age at death. This analysis provided empirical evidence to support the claim.", "Sampling death records from California counties": "Another aspect involved sampling death records from two counties in southern California. By sending questionnaires to the next of kin of the deceased individuals, the researchers obtained information about handedness and analyzed the relationship between handedness and lifespan. The results showed a significant difference in mean age at death between right-handed and non-right-handed individuals.", "Criticism of methodology": "The claim was not without criticism, as some experts pointed out flaws in the methodologies used in the studies. One criticism highlighted the assumption of a static proportion of left and right-handed people throughout time. Historical records suggested that societal pressures in the early 1900s might have influenced left-handed individuals to identify as right-handed, potentially skewing the results. This criticism emphasizes the importance of considering historical context and potential biases in interpreting the claim."}
