{"The claim is based on an edited photograph circulating on Facebook that shows red": "tinted hedges in the shape of the letters \"KKK\" in the newly renovated White House Rose Garden.", "The hedges in the Rose Garden have a diamond shape design": "which predates the recent renovation and even the Trump administration. This design can be seen in unaltered images posted by Melania Trump and in a 2015 image of President Barack Obama walking in the Rose Garden.", "The horticulturalist": "Rachel Lambert \"Bunny\" Mellon, who designed the garden for President John F. Kennedy, confirmed that the hedges were indeed installed in a diamond shape, as described in her design plans.", "The fact that the hedges have been in the diamond configuration for decades": "dating back to the Kennedy administration, suggests that the claim of the hedges spelling out \"KKK\" is false and can be easily manipulated using image editing software."}
