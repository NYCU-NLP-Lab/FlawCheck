{"The claim states that the economic stimulus bill created a council": "modeled after the national board that controls Britain's health system.\" The expert's verdict confirms that the claim is incorrect, as the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research (FCC-CER) created by the stimulus bill is not modeled after the British health system.", "The expert": "s verdict also contrasts the FCC-CER with the British system, where government entities run the healthcare system, and a national board, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Evidence, determines coverage for specific treatments. This distinction emphasizes that the FCC-CER does not have the same control or authority as the British national board, providing another aspect to verify the claim's inaccuracy."}
