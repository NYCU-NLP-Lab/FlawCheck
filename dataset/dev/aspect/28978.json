{"Comparison to past travel restrictions": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on the statement that President Obama \"has sealed off Israel in the past.\" The expert investigates this claim and compares it to the two-day ban on American airlines flying into or out of Israel's Ben Gurion Airport in 2014.", "Lack of evidence for broader travel restrictions": "The expert's verdict mentions that they didn't find any other examples of President Obama sealing off an entire region of the world, as suggested by the claim. This lack of evidence weakens the argument that blocking travel from countries with Ebola should be possible based on past actions.", "Context of the Israel flight ban": "The expert provides context for the Israel flight ban, explaining that it was enacted due to safety concerns after a Hamas rocket landed near the airport. This context suggests that the ban was a response to a specific security threat, rather than a general sealing off of a country or region.", "Conservative commentary and comparison": "The expert mentions that the comparison between the Israel flight ban and a possible Ebola flight ban has been the subject of comment on some conservative blogs. This suggests that the claim may be influenced by political commentary and not necessarily supported by factual evidence."}
