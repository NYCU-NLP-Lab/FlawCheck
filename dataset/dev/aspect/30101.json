{"Lack of a 109th congressional district in Michigan": "The expert points out that Michigan does not have a 109th congressional district, but rather has a total of 14 congressional districts. This factual error in the claim indicates that it is not authentic.", "Made": "up names and organizations: The expert highlights that the claim mentions an \"Allah Just'ava'nosh Mosque\" and a county commissioner named \"Art Tubolls,\" both of which are clearly fabricated. These made-up names suggest that the claim is not based on real events.", "Source credibility": "The expert mentions that the claim originates from The Last Line of Defense (LLOD) website, which is known for publishing clickbait junk news articles aimed at inflaming conservative sensibilities. The website's disclaimer also explicitly states that everything on it is fiction. This lack of credibility suggests that the claim is not authentic.", "Satirical nature of the story": "The expert notes that the claim is part of a network of sites, including The Last Line of Defense, that publish satirical articles. The fake details and the intention to inflame fears about Islam and \"creeping sharia\" indicate that the claim is not meant to be taken seriously."}
