{"The claim made by Donald Trump that the Obama administration is": "letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote\" is factually incorrect. People who enter the country illegally are not allowed to vote, and there are severe consequences for doing so.", "Immigrants must reside in the US legally for several years before they can apply for citizenship through the naturalization process": "This process can take several months, making it unlikely for individuals to enter the country illegally and vote in a short period of time.", "Trump": "s claim was made during a meeting with the National Border Patrol Council, where Art Del Cueto, a vice president of the border patrol agents' union, mentioned that criminals apprehended at the border were being set aside to prioritize processing the immigration status of those on the waiting list. Trump then asked why this was happening, to which Del Cueto replied, \"So they can go ahead and vote before the election.\" However, this exchange does not provide evidence to support Trump's claim.", "News reports indicate that U": "S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has been working overtime to handle a spike in naturalization applications, which typically happens during an election year. Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson expressed concern about efforts to \"rush\" naturalization applications to allow more voters in the upcoming presidential election. However, this concern does not prove that the Obama administration is intentionally allowing illegal immigrants to enter the country to vote."}
