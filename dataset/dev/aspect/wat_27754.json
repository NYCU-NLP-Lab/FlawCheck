{"Biden misstated key facts and missed important context about asylum policies": "People can apply for asylum only once they are in the United States.", "During the Trump administration": "some people who entered at the southern border and sought asylum in the United States were sent to Mexico to wait for a decision on their case. Biden\u2019s administration has said it will no longer send asylum seekers to Mexico.", "Asylum law also extends to people who already live in the United States and are not in deportation proceedings": "Even when the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program was in effect, people already living in the United States were not necessarily sent out of the country to wait for a resolution of their case.", "Biden": "s statement gives the wrong impression to people who aren\u2019t very familiar with the asylum debate, as it overstates the details of a program implemented by his predecessor and fails to acknowledge the revisions made by his administration."}
