{"Timeline discrepancy": "The expert points out that there is a significant timeline discrepancy between the enactment of the voter ID law in 2011 and Wendy Davis' candidacy announcement in 2013. This suggests that the claim of the law being specifically aimed at disenfranchising women voters supporting Davis is not supported by the timeline of events.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert mentions that the evidence provided by the Democratic Governors Association, in the form of news articles and a report, does not conclusively establish a link between the voter ID law and Davis garnering votes for governor in 2014. This indicates a lack of concrete evidence to support the claim.", "Voter ID requirements": "The expert explains the voter ID requirements under the Texas law, which include presenting a photo ID issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety or the federal government. This information helps to provide context and understanding of the law itself.", "Potential delays and discrepancies": "The expert cites a news report where a state district judge experienced a delay at a polling place due to a name discrepancy between her offered ID and the voter roll. This highlights a potential issue with the implementation of the voter ID law, but it does not directly support the claim that the law was designed to disenfranchise women voters supporting Davis."}
