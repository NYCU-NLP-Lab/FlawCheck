{"The claim originated from Empire News": "a known fake news website that states all its articles are for entertainment purposes only. This suggests that the claim may not be authentic.", "The article from Empire News included a quote from director Bob Cisneros": "stating that Vanna White's actions compromised the production of Wheel of Fortune. However, there is no evidence or confirmation from official sources or Wheel of Fortune itself to support this claim.", "Wheel of Fortune provided updates on their social media accounts that showed Vanna White was still a part of the show": "This contradicts the claim that she was fired due to her roulette playing.", "The rumor was also spread through deceptive online advertisements by clickbait websites": "This indicates that the claim may have been propagated for the purpose of generating traffic and clicks, rather than being based on factual information."}
