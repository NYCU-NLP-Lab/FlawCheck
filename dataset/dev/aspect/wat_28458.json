{"The source of the claim": "The expert identified that the claim originated from NotAllowedTo.com, a website known for publishing fake news stories for entertainment purposes only. This suggests that the claim may not be authentic.", "Lack of credible evidence": "The expert pointed out that the mugshot used to represent the alleged murderer, Lisa Estevez, was taken from an unrelated public arrest notice in December 2015, not April 2016 when the incident supposedly occurred. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent reporting": "The expert noted that the articles reporting the incident were reproduced by several sites, but they all contained the same information and quotes from authorities. This lack of variation in reporting raises suspicions about the credibility of the claim.", "Previous track record of publishing fake news": "The expert highlighted that NotAllowedTo.com has a history of publishing fabricated claims and sensational headlines for entertainment purposes. This suggests that the claim of a woman shooting her boyfriend after an April Fool's Day prank may be another fabricated story for entertainment rather than a real event."}
