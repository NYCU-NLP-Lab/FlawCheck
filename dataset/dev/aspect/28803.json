{"The statement made by Van Jones that African": "Americans don't use drugs at a higher level than whites was fact-checked and rated as true by experts.", "The 2014 National Research Council report on": "Growth of Incarceration in the United States\" provides data that supports the claim. Pages 60 and 61 of the report specifically focus on drug crimes and state that the prevalence of drug use is only slightly higher among blacks than whites.", "Data from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health also supports the claim": "The survey shows racial differences in the types of drugs being abused, with blacks being less likely to have used marijuana, cocaine, and hallucinogens compared to whites.", "The National Research Council report further highlights that drug": "related arrest rates for blacks have been three to four times higher than those for whites in recent years, and in the late 1980s, the rates were six times higher for blacks than for whites. This information indicates a potential institutional bias leading to higher incarceration rates for African-Americans."}
