{"The study conducted in South Korea": "The expert's verdict mentions that the study analyzing the health and diet of 11,000 South Koreans between ages 19 and 64 found some indication that frequent consumption of ramen was linked to adverse outcomes. This study provides evidence for the claim.", "Lack of reproduction of results": "The expert's verdict states that the results of the study have not been reproduced. This suggests that the findings of the study have not been independently verified, which raises questions about the authenticity of the claim.", "TBHQ as a potential culprit": "The expert's verdict mentions that the substance found in ramen called Tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), a petroleum industry byproduct used to preserve cheap processed foods, was identified as a potential cause of health problems. This provides a specific mechanism through which ramen consumption could lead to adverse effects.", "Commentary from a nutritionist": "The expert's verdict mentions that the article on which the claim was based included commentary from a nutritionist on whether the research from Korea might also apply to noodle-eaters in the United States. This adds an expert opinion to the discussion and helps evaluate the generalizability of the findings."}
