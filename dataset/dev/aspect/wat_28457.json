{"The expert": "s statement is compared to a 2014 report sponsored by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which states that soccer, lacrosse, and basketball have the highest rates of reported concussions for female athletes at the high school and college levels. This report provides additional evidence to support the claim about women's soccer and concussions.", "A report chart is referenced": "which shows that football consistently ranks first in terms of concussion rates. This information is used to contextualize the claim about women's soccer and cheerleading, indicating that they are lower in comparison to football but still significant in their own right.", "A 2015 report by Dawn Comstock and others": "which synthesized nearly 50 studies on concussions among American youth soccer players, is mentioned. This report identifies contact with another player as the most common cause of concussions in soccer. While this aspect does not directly verify the claim about women's soccer and concussions, it provides relevant information about the nature and causes of concussions in the sport."}
