{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the fact that Singapore does not have a minimum wage law": "This information was obtained from an official website for the Ministry of Manpower within the Singapore government website.", "A reverse image search on Google was conducted": "which revealed that the first infographic in the misleading Facebook post was captured from a Singaporean blog published in 2014. The blog explicitly mentioned that the monthly minimum wages were calculated for 2013.", "The Progressive Wage Model": "which applies to workers in the cleaning, security, and landscape sectors, was mentioned in the text above the blog's infographic. This model was confirmed to be in place through a page on the Ministry of Manpower's website.", "The second infographic in the misleading Facebook post": "which claimed that Singapore's Prime Minister receives the highest salary of any world leader, was found to be outdated. The figure cited in the post was from 2015, and it was confirmed that it was taken from a report by Statista, a German online statistics portal."}
