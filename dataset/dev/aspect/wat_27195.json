{"The claim was supported by the International Federation of Health Plans": "an organization that tracks prescription drug prices worldwide. Their 2013 price report showed that compared to several other countries, the United States had significantly higher prices for common drugs.", "The claim was further backed by a study published in the journal Health Affairs in 2013": "The study examined the prices of brand name drugs in multiple countries over a period of three years and consistently found that U.S. prices were higher than those in other countries.", "The CEO of the International Federation of Health Plans": "Tom Sackville, confirmed the authenticity of the claim, stating that there is nowhere else in the world that pays the same prices as America for prescription drugs.", "However": "it was noted that the claim may not always apply to generic drugs, as a 2008 comparison found that some U.S. prices were actually lower than Canadian prices for certain generic drugs. Availability and other factors can influence pricing variations for generics."}
