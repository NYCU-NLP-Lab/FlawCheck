{"The expert analyzed data from the U": "S. Energy Information Administration's report titled \"Sales of Fossil Fuels Produced from Federal and Indian Lands, FY 2003 through FY 2011\" to verify the claim. This report provided information on oil production from federal lands, including offshore wells.", "The expert compared the oil production data from 2010 and 2011": "which showed a drop of 13.77 percent or rounded to 14 percent. This comparison supported the claim that oil production was down 14 percent on federal land.", "The expert considered the reliability of the 14 percent figure by consulting Jay Hakes": "who directed the independent U.S. Energy Information Administration during the Clinton administration. Hakes stated that taking one year out of three is not indicative of a trend, suggesting that the figure may be cherry-picked.", "To further assess the claim": "the expert examined oil production trends during different presidential administrations. They compared the years when George W. Bush and Barack Obama were in office and noted that oil production on federal lands and waters fell in four of five years from 2004-2008, resulting in a net decrease of 16.8 percent. This analysis provided additional context to understand the claim's accuracy."}
