{"The claim made by Trump that Democrats": "plan would \"obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage\" is false. This statement was fact-checked and found to be incorrect.", "Democrats have proposed a wide array of approaches to expand health care coverage": "including Medicare for All. However, Medicare for All is not supported by all Democrats and does not necessarily mean the end of Medicare.", "The Sanders bill": "which is the most aggressive plan proposed by Democrats, would transform the health insurance system into a single-payer system where everyone would be insured through the government. This would result in more comprehensive coverage for those currently enrolled in Medicare.", "Medicare is a program that primarily covers people aged 65 and older": "but it also helps millions of citizens with disabilities. It consists of four main parts, with Medicare Advantage being an optional component run by private companies. Under Sanders' plan, all these components would be replaced with a new health care plan that includes additional coverage such as vision, hearing, and dental."}
