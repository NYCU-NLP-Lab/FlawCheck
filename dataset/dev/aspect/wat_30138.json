{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert points out that the website TheLastLineOfDefense.com, which published the claim, is a known purveyor of fake news stories. The website's disclaimer also states that they present fiction as fact and their sources do not actually exist. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in the story": "The expert highlights several inconsistencies in the claim. The mosque named in the story, \"Ramashan Mosque,\" and the imam, Aswat Turads, do not actually exist. The radio station mentioned, WXTX-FM, is based in Columbus, Georgia, not Texas. These inconsistencies cast doubt on the truthfulness of the claim.", "Refutation by a credible source": "Canadian imam Ibrahim Hindy publicly refuted the claim, stating that he was in Saudi Arabia at the time of Hurricane Harvey and had never been to Texas. His refutation provides evidence against the claim's authenticity.", "Evidence of mosques helping hurricane victims": "The expert mentions that several Houston mosques have actually taken people in and conducted volunteer food and donation drives to assist the victims of Hurricane Harvey. This contradicts the claim that mosques barricaded themselves and refused to help. The existence of these efforts by mosques provides further evidence against the authenticity of the claim."}
