{"The expert": "s verdict mentions the polling organization Gallup and their data on the national appetite for the death penalty. This includes the most recent survey conducted in October 2011, which recorded 61 percent in favor, 35 percent opposed, and 4 percent without an opinion.", "The expert also mentions a poll conducted by CNN in late September 2011": "which showed that 50 percent of respondents favored life in prison as a penalty for murder, while 48 percent favored the death penalty. This provides an additional perspective on public opinion regarding the death penalty.", "The expert contacted Clatsop County District Attorney Josh Marquis": "who made the claim that opponents of the death penalty in Oregon were in a minority of about 25 percent. Marquis referred to a group considering a campaign to abolish the death penalty in Oregon in 2002, who backed off after polls showed just 20 to 25 percent opposed. This suggests that there may be specific data or polls related to Oregon that support Marquis' claim.", "The expert highlights the trend of growing discomfort with the death penalty nationally": "as indicated by Gallup's data. The mid-1960s saw opposition surpassing support, followed by a decline until the mid-'90s when opposition hit a low of 16 percent. Since then, opposition has been slowly increasing, although the majority of those polled still favor capital punishment in some cases. This context provides a broader understanding of the public opinion dynamics surrounding the death penalty."}
