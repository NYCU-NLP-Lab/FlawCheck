{"The lack of evidence supporting the claim": "The expert points out that there was no evidence to support the claim that Ted Cruz's father was photographed with Lee Harvey Oswald. Facial recognition experts advised that no match could be made, and historians found no corroborating records.", "The unreliable source": "The claim was based on a photo published in the National Enquirer, a tabloid magazine known for publishing sensational and often unsubstantiated stories. The Enquirer never disclosed how it determined that the man in the photo was Rafael Cruz.", "Cruz campaign denial": "The Cruz campaign issued a statement denying the claim. Cruz's communications director, Alice Stewart, explicitly stated that the story was false and that the man in the photo was not Rafael Cruz.", "Previous fact": "checking: The expert mentions that PolitiFact had previously fact-checked and rated as \"Pants on Fire\" Trump's claim about Cruz's father being with Oswald before Kennedy's assassination. This indicates that the claim had already been debunked by a reputable fact-checking organization."}
