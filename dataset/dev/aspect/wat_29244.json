{"The expert explains that the Coronavirus Aid": "Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump, authorizes the federal government to pay each U.S. citizen a one-time check called an \"economic impact payment.\" This verifies the claim that stimulus payments, termed \"Economic Impact Payments,\" exist.", "The expert clarifies that the economic impact payment is considered a tax credit advanced to the recipient from their future 2020 tax return": "This contradicts the belief that the payment needs to be paid back in full in 2020 or that it is considered taxable income, verifying that these conclusions are not true.", "The expert explains that recipients of the economic impact payment will be credited as if they had paid the government back": "making the payment a non-taxable fund that does not affect future tax returns. This verifies that the payment does not reduce one's 2020 tax refund.", "The expert mentions that if a person": "s income falls in 2020 compared to prior years, they may be eligible for an additional amount of economic impact money in their 2020 tax refund. This verifies that changes in income can potentially result in an extra stimulus credit amount in the 2020 refund."}
