Dairy Export Council to President Barack Obama, which states that a WHO proposal \"portrays milk and dairy products as an obstacle to a healthy start in life.\" This provides a direct source of the claim.", "The claim is supported by statements from Shawna Morris": "vice president of trade policy for the U.S. Dairy Export Council, who argues that the WHO proposal covers toddlers up to 3 years old and questions whether images of young children drinking milk would be prohibited. This highlights the industry's concern about the impact of the proposal on their products.", "The claim is backed by Charles Taylor": "a marketing professor at Villanova University\u2019s School of Business, who describes the WHO guidelines as \"draconian\" and argues that they provide incomplete information on milk. This adds an expert perspective supporting the industry's position.", "The claim acknowledges that WHO does not want to see breast": "milk substitutes promoted, but argues that the dairy industry is reading too much into the proposed marketing rules. This highlights the contrasting views between the industry and WHO."}
