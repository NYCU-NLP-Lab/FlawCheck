{"Expert testimonies": "The expert's verdict includes statements from Michael Cromartie, vice president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, who calls the claim \"unhinged\" and \"rooted in no reality.\" Kathleen Flake, a professor of religious history at Vanderbilt University, also dismisses the claim as baseless. These expert testimonies contribute to verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Examination of official teachings": "The experts checked the official teachings of the Mormon Church and found that it has a policy of political neutrality. The Church's website explicitly states that its mission is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, not to elect politicians. This examination of official teachings supports the conclusion that the claim is false.", "Lack of evidence": "The experts point out that there is no evidence to support the claim of a Mormon plan to overthrow the Constitution and establish a theocracy. Jan Shipps, a prominent non-Mormon historian who studies the religion, states that the claim is far from what Mitt Romney, a prominent Mormon figure, would ever want. The absence of evidence further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical context": "The experts mention that accusations of the Mormon Church wanting to abolish the Constitution are not new. This historical context suggests that the claim is likely part of a long-standing pattern of attacks on the Mormon faith. Considering the lack of evidence and the dismissals from experts, this historical context adds weight to the conclusion that the claim is unfounded."}
