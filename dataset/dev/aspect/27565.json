{"The claim is based on a provision in the Republican bill to replace Obamacare that would change the tax deduction limit for executive compensation in health insurance companies": "2. The provision would repeal the current $500,000 limit and generally make the cap $1 million, allowing health insurance companies to claim a greater tax deduction for executive pay.", "The change in tax deduction would provide a financial incentive for health insurance companies to give raises to their executives": "4. While the claim states that insurance executives would personally make millions off healthcare, it is clarified that the tax break is for corporations, not individuals, making it misleading to say that executives would personally benefit from the change."}
