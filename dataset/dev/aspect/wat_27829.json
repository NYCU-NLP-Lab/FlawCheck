The expert mentions UCLA's World Policy Analysis Center, which has a database showing 13 countries, including the United States, without guaranteed paid annual leave.", "Variation in leave policies": "The expert acknowledges that leave policies can vary based on factors such as job tenure or other classifications. This variation can make it challenging to determine the exact number of countries without guaranteed paid vacation.", "Other countries without guaranteed paid leave": "The expert mentions that the World Bank also provides data on vacation available to workers based on tenure. The bank's table includes five Pacific island nations that do not guarantee paid leave time for any worker.
