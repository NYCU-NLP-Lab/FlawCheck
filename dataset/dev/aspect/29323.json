{"Comparison of cash on hand": "The expert analyzed the financial statistics of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) to determine the ratio of money each organization had in the bank. The DCCC had $33,783,724 compared to $17,039,525 for the NRCC, confirming Pelosi's claim of a two-to-one advantage money-wise for House Democrats.", "Ratio of money raised": "The expert also examined the ratio of money raised by the DCCC and NRCC during the 2009-2010 campaign cycle. The DCCC had raised $93,706,323, while the NRCC raised $75,531,984, resulting in a ratio of 1.24 to 1. This aspect provided a more comprehensive view of the financial support received by each party.", "Money totals raised by House candidates": "To further verify the claim, the expert looked at the money raised by individual House candidates themselves. As of August 3, 2010, Republican candidates had raised slightly more than Democratic candidates, with $355,067,654 compared to $351,238,367. However, when considering the money held in the bank, Democrats had $245,223,757 compared to $173,422,985 for Republicans, resulting in a ratio of about 1.4 to 1.", "Comparison of the number of House candidates": "Recognizing that the number of candidates running for the House may affect the overall financial advantage, the expert also considered this aspect. Although the specific details were not provided, the expert likely examined the number of Democratic and Republican candidates to determine if the two-to-one advantage held by House Democrats was influenced by the sheer number of candidates running."}
