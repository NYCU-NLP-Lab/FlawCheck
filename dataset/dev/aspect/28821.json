{"Social Security is a self": "financed program: Representatives from Shaheen's Senate office clarified that Social Security is funded primarily through dedicated payroll taxes, making it a self-financed program. This means that the program takes in more money than it distributes in benefits, creating a surplus.", "Surplus dollars contribute to the Social Security trust funds": "The surplus dollars generated by Social Security are added to the Social Security trust funds, which currently hold about $2.7 trillion in assets. These trust funds collect interest over time, further adding to the surplus and reducing the deficit.", "Interest payments earned by Social Security reduce the overall federal deficit": "According to Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the interest payments earned by Social Security contribute to reducing the overall federal deficit. This suggests that Social Security is not contributing to the debt and deficits, but rather helping to alleviate them.", "Social Security surplus is invested in government bonds": "Social Security is required by law to put its entire surplus into interest-earning government bonds. However, these bonds are not separate or locked boxes; they are often mixed and invested with other revenue sources in the government's general fund. This implies that the interest payments earned by Social Security may be considered a re-shuffling of government dollars rather than a direct contribution to reducing the deficit."}
