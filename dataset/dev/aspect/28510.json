{"Discrepancy in the advertisement": "The expert notes that the advertisement promoting the claim used a frame from the 1997 Titanic film, altered to appear black and white, which raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Advertising arbitrage strategy": "The expert explains that the promotion of the claim follows a common technique called advertising arbitrage, where misleading or intriguing information is used in the advertisement to attract readers and generate more clicks on a slideshow-style story. This suggests that the claim may be a tactic to generate revenue rather than a genuine discovery.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that the remaining wreckage of the Titanic is located at a depth of 12,600 feet underwater, making it highly unlikely that an old camera from the early 20th century could be recovered with intact images. This lack of physical evidence undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Historical account of Bernice Palmer": "The expert acknowledges that while the specific claim of an old camera with \"horrifying Titanic photos\" is false, there is a historical record of a young girl named Bernice Palmer who captured photographs of the iceberg that caused the Titanic's sinking and images of survivors. This highlights the existence of genuine photographic evidence related to the Titanic, but it does not support the claim in question."}
