{"The expert found a New York Times article published on July 1": "2017, which stated that \"Over all, 1,600 coal plants are planned or under construction in 62 countries.\" This article was used as a source to verify the claim.", "The expert discovered that the data on the Global Coal Plant Tracker": "which is cited as the source for the 1,600 figure, is lower than the number claimed by Roberts. The tracker currently shows 458 coal-fired units under construction.", "The expert also considered the different categories used by the tracker to classify coal": "fired units, such as announced, cancelled, under construction, mothballed, operating, permitted, pre-permit stage, retired, and shelved. By looking at combinations of these categories, the expert determined that if units in the permitted or pre-permit stage are added, the number increases to 903.", "The expert attempted to contact the Global Energy Monitor": "GEM), the organization behind the Global Coal Plant Tracker, but did not receive a response. This lack of response could also be seen as a factor in verifying the authenticity of the claim."}
