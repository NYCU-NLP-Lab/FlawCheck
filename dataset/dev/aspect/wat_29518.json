{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert points out that there have been no reports from international independent or official news organizations confirming Kim Jong Un's death. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent information": "The expert mentions that on July 8, two days after the claim was made, Kim Jong Un was reported to have visited the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang. This contradicts the claim of his death and adds to the skepticism surrounding it.", "Unreliable source": "The expert highlights that the claim originated from a website called dailysidnews.com, which raises several questions about its legitimacy. The website lacks information about its credibility and its \"About Us\" page is empty. Additionally, the \"Contact Us\" page contains phony information, including an invalid email address and a nonfunctional phone number.", "Biased language and political agenda": "The expert points out that the claim includes a statement referring to Trump as an \"assassin\" and makes a comparison to the Iraq war. This biased language and political agenda suggest that the claim may be more focused on promoting a certain narrative rather than providing accurate information."}
