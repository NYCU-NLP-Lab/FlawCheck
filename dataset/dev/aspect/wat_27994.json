{"The initial budget released in January allocated": "52.7 million for disaster assistance, but it did not specify a specific amount for tree removal reimbursements.", "The revised May budget reduced the overall disaster assistance fund to": "8.5 million and allocated only $2 million for local agencies to remove dead or dying trees.", "The governor scaled back his plans for emergency spending by over": "100 million in his updated budget due to the end of the state's drought emergency.", "The claim made by Republican Assemblyman Jim Patterson that Governor Jerry Brown": "cuts funds for local tree mortality efforts from $52.7 million to just $2 million\" is not entirely accurate, as a significant portion of the initial budget was intended for other purposes related to drought and community water needs."}
