{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no evidence that Hillary Clinton wrote the email in question to Donna Brazile. They specifically mentioned searching through news articles and the WikiLeaks' Hillary Clinton email archive and found nothing to support the claim.", "Debunked by fact": "checkers: Both Factcheck.org and Snopes debunked similar statements in 2019 regarding Hillary Clinton sending a profanity-laced tirade to Donna Brazile. This adds to the lack of credibility for the claim.", "Source of the claim": "The claim was published in a pro-Donald Trump group on Facebook. The expert noted that it was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its platform. This raises doubts about the reliability of the source and the claim itself.", "Inconsistent accounts": "The expert mentioned that memes and conspiracy sites circulated after a commander-in-chief forum in September 2016, where Clinton and Trump were separately interviewed by Matt Lauer. However, news reports and Politico's report did not directly quote Clinton making the statements mentioned in the claim. This inconsistency further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
