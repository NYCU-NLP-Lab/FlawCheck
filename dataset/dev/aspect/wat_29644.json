{"Comparison of actual numbers": "The expert compared the actual numbers of non-defense discretionary spending from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2010 to verify the claim. The numbers showed a 23.7 percent increase, which aligns with the claim of a 20-some percent increase.", "Historical perspective": "The expert provided an historical perspective by comparing the non-defense discretionary spending during the first two years of the Obama administration to the average increase during the eight federal budgets approved during the Bush administration. This comparison showed that the increase under Obama was higher than the average increase under Bush.", "Source verification": "The expert mentioned that the numbers used by Cantor were also cited by Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Paul Ryan, and were sourced from the Congressional Budget Office. This indicates that the numbers have been widely referenced and can be traced back to a reliable source.", "Acknowledgment of computation issues": "The expert acknowledged that while the raw numbers were not in dispute, there were problems with Cantor's computations of those numbers. This suggests that there may be some discrepancies or inaccuracies in how Cantor arrived at his percentage increase figures."}
