{"The claim uses flawed data analysis to assert there was something questionable or improper about the low number of ballots rejected in the November election": "2. November elections consistently have a lower ballot rejection rate since more voters use in-person early voting, which counts as an absentee ballot but is assisted by clerks to avoid errors that would cause ballot rejection.", "The rejection rate has trended steadily down in November elections since 2008": "and the 2020 election was in line with that trend.", "The November election has come under attack on a variety of fronts from a variety of sources": "including former President Donald Trump and his backers, who have raised concerns about voting machines, vote reporting, vote counting, the mail-in voting process, and more."}
