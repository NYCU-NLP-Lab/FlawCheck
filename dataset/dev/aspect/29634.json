{"The study conducted by the Violence Policy Center": "VPC) ranks Georgia ninth among all states in terms of the rate of women murdered by men, with a homicide rate of 1.66 per 100,000 women in 2012.", "The VPC report specifically focuses on incidents where one woman is killed by one man": "excluding cases with multiple victims or perpetrators. This narrower analysis allows for a more detailed examination of characteristics such as age, race, and the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator.", "The report highlights that 69 percent of the women murdered in Georgia were killed with guns": "emphasizing the need for stricter gun control measures to protect domestic abuse victims.", "The fact that Georgia had 102 homicides in 2012": "as opposed to the 84 reported by the VPC, suggests that the VPC's data may have excluded certain incidents. However, the VPC defends its methodology, stating that it focuses on specific criteria to provide a more accurate representation of the issue at hand."}
