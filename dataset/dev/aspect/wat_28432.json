{"The claim is based on a Democratic ad sponsored by the Senate Majority PAC": "a super PAC that is spending millions to elect Democratic Senate candidates.", "The claim states that GOP Rep": "Joe Heck of Nevada voted \"23 times\" against banning terrorists from buying guns.", "The fact is": "there has not been a single up-or-down vote on such a ban in the House.", "None of the 23 votes cited by the ad would have banned anything": "according to the PAC's own detailed backup statement. All were procedural votes that would have denied \"an opportunity\" to vote on a measure Democrats wanted to get to the floor if given the chance."}
