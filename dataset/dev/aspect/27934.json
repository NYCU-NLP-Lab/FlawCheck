{"The Facebook post shared three images": "two of which showed three men with their limbs tied and their bodies suspended in the air, while the third image featured a man's badly bruised back. These images were used to support the claim of torture of Uganda opposition supporters.", "A reverse image search of the tied": "up men revealed that the two pictures were from Nigeria and featured in a BBC African Eye documentary titled \"The Torture Virus: Tabay 'rampant' among Nigeria\u2019s security force.\" This finding indicates that the images were not from Uganda, contradicting the claim's authenticity.", "Another reverse image search of the third picture": "showing a man's bruised back, revealed that it was captured in Zimbabwe during a protest over food and fuel shortages in January 2019. This image was used in major news reports and credited to the news agency Reuters. This finding further discredits the claim as it proves the image is unrelated to the alleged torture in Uganda.", "Facebook added a warning label to two of the images due to their graphic nature": "suggesting that the content may be disturbing or violent. This action by Facebook indicates that the images were deemed to be authentic, but it does not guarantee the authenticity of the claim itself."}
