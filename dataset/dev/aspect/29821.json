{"The claim is based on a vote Warner cast in 2009 to prevent a Senate filibuster on Obamacare": "2. Under the Senate's cloture rules, it takes 60 votes to end debate on most types of legislation and allow an up or down vote on the bill. Warner joined all of his fellow Democrats and two independents in voting to stop a threatened Republican filibuster.", "The Senate passed Obamacare with an identical 60": "39 vote the next day, but Warner's vote wasn't as important this time because only a simple majority was required to approve the legislation.", "Previous claims accusing one senator of casting the pivotal ballot to end the filibuster have been deemed misleading": "as it could be said of 59 others who voted to end the filibuster."}
