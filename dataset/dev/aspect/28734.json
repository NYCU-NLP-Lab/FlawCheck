{"The claim states that Hillary interned with Bob Treuhaft": "the head of the California Communist Party. The expert's verdict clarifies that while Treuhaft was once an active member of the American Communist Party, he left the party before Clinton started her internship with the firm. This verifies that Treuhaft was not the head of the California Communist Party as claimed.", "The expert": "s verdict mentions that Treuhaft was investigated and harassed by McCarthyites in the 1950s. This historical context supports the authenticity of Treuhaft's association with the American Communist Party and adds credibility to the claim.", "Clinton": "s autobiography refers to the law firm she interned at as a \"fairly radical left-wing law firm\" known for taking on discrimination and social injustice cases. This aligns with the claim's assertion that she interned with a prominent figure associated with the California Communist Party.", "A former colleague of Clinton at the law firm": "Mal Burnstein, confirms that she was one of the firm's better summer interns and describes her as non-political. This testimony supports the claim that Clinton's association with the firm was primarily based on her interest in civil rights cases rather than her political beliefs."}
