{"Comparison of the claim to the statement made by President Barack Obama": "The expert compared the claim that \"oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high\" in 2010 to the statement made by President Obama in his press conference on March 11, 2011. This comparison helped verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Analysis of Energy Information Administration data": "The expert analyzed the data provided by the Energy Information Administration, which is the federal government's official office for energy statistics. They specifically looked at the annual figures for Gulf production in barrels per day from 1981 to 2010. This analysis provided evidence to support the claim.", "Consideration of the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill": "The expert mentioned that critics argue that the claim doesn't tell the whole story because the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in April 2010 led to a moratorium on new drilling in the Gulf. The expert acknowledged this criticism and considered the potential impact of the moratorium on oil production. This aspect helped provide a comprehensive evaluation of the claim.", "Evaluation of the distinction between federal waters and state waters": "The expert clarified that the analysis focused only on oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, as specified in the claim. This distinction ensured that the evaluation was accurate and aligned with the claim's scope."}
