{"Trump": "s claim of appointing judges who are \"young\" and \"smart\" is subjective and cannot be objectively verified. The expert's verdict states that the quality of these judges is a matter of opinion, and there is no specific criteria or evidence provided to determine their intelligence or youthfulness.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions the ratings of Trump's judicial nominees by the American Bar Association (ABA). It is stated that nine of Trump's judicial nominees received a majority rating of \"Not Qualified\" by the ABA, while no judge nominated or confirmed during the Obama administration received such a rating. This aspect suggests that the quality of Trump's nominees may not align with his claim of appointing \"better\" judges."}
