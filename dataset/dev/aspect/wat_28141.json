{"The existence of the letter": "The expert's verdict mentions that Trump cited a letter he sent to Erdogan on October 9, 2019, urging him not to be a fool in regards to military action. The letter was obtained by Trish Regan, a host of the Fox Business show, who posted it on Twitter.", "Confirmation by the White House": "Although the White House did not respond to the request for confirmation of the letter's authenticity, they did confirm the veracity of the letter to several other media outlets. This confirmation adds credibility to the claim.", "Confirmation by Turkish sources": "Turkish sources also confirmed that the letter had been sent and received by Erdogan. They further stated that Erdogan found the letter insulting, which prompted him to launch the invasion. The quote from a Turkish official provided by the London-based news outlet Middle East Eye supports the claim.", "Public response and skepticism": "After the letter was made public, there was widespread skepticism about its authenticity due to its informal tone. However, the fact that it generated public discussion and debate indicates that it was considered a genuine document. The expert's verdict mentions CNN reporter Jake Tapper's initial skepticism but does not provide any evidence to suggest that the letter was proven to be a hoax."}
