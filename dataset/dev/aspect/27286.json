This statistic was used as evidence to support the claim of mass voter fraud.", "The claim was similar to an assertion made by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach": "who is a member of the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity. However, this assertion was rated as false by fact-checkers, indicating that the claim lacked credibility.", "New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner": "a member of the same commission as Kobach, disputed the facts presented by Kobach and stated that they did not provide proof of voter fraud.
