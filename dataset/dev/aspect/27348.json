{"The claim originated from a Facebook post featuring an image of Congressman Ted Yoho along with a quote about African": "Americans getting only 3/5ths of a vote.", "The rumor about Yoho": "s statement had been circulating since May 2014, when it was included in an article on the fake news website Newslo.", "The quote attributed to Yoho was a combination of a real statement he made about having": "radical ideas about voting\" and a fabricated quote about African-American votes being worth 3/5ths of a white man's vote.", "The expert clarified that the compromise measure in the original U": "S. Constitution counted slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of determining a state's population, but slaves were not allowed to vote at all. Therefore, the claim about African-American votes being worth 3/5ths was inaccurate."}
