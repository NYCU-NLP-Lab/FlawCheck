{"The supposed": "Ukrainian arms dealer\" mentioned in the claim is actually the owner of a California company that primarily develops airships, not a dealer of weapons. This information was verified through research on the company's profile and activities.", "The photo used in the claim": "showing Nancy Pelosi shaking hands with Randy Credico, was not taken at a political fundraiser as claimed. It was actually taken at the 2018 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, which was confirmed through multiple sources and other photos from the event.", "The photo does not feature any": "Ukrainian arms dealer,\" as falsely stated in the claim. The individual in the photo is Randy Credico, a comedian and former radio show host, who has no connection to arms dealing.", "The original blog post that the claim is based on is not actually about Randy Credico": "but about a man named Igor Pasternak, who is a U.S. citizen and owns an aircraft business in California. Pasternak's company has manufactured small arms for Ukrainian troops, but he is not an arms dealer as suggested in the claim. This information was verified through the blog post and additional research on Igor Pasternak's background and business activities."}
