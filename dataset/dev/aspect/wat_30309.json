{"Comparison of U": "S. census tables: The Allen campaign used U.S. census tables to support their claim, which showed an increase in full-time equivalent employment in Virginia's state government from March 2006 to March 2010. However, these tables only provide a snapshot of employment levels as of March of each year and do not align closely with Kaine's tenure.", "Examination of the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management": "DHRM) data: To obtain more accurate figures, the expert turned to the DHRM, the agency responsible for tracking the size of the state workforce. The DHRM provided tallies of full-time equivalent workers in the executive branch, which accounts for about 96% of the state's workforce and is under the governor's control.", "Comparison of workforce size at specific dates": "The expert compared the size of the executive branch workforce on two specific dates - December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2009. This comparison revealed a decrease in the number of full-time-equivalent employees, indicating that Allen's claim of workforce growth during Kaine's tenure is incorrect.", "Consideration of factors affecting workforce size": "The expert acknowledged that the census numbers included jobs in the judicial branch, which the governor has limited control over. By focusing on the executive branch and its workforce, the expert ensured a more accurate assessment of the claim."}
