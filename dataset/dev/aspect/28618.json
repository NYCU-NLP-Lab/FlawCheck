{"The presence of three photos": "The claim included three photos, one showing a handcuffed man being escorted by police, another showing a mugshot of the same man, and the third showing grenades and bullets laid out on the ground alongside a bag of apples. These photos were used to support the claim.", "Hindi language caption translation": "The Hindi language caption accompanying the photos translated to English as: \"Congress leader Amjat Ali was caught with explosives and weapons hidden in an apple basket inside a mosque in Assam. He was plotting to kill Hindus, police arrested him.\" This caption provided specific details about the alleged incident.", "Verification from Congress spokesperson": "AFP contacted Abdul Khaleque, a state lawmaker and media spokesperson for Congress in Assam, to inquire about the existence of a leader named Amjat Ali in the party. Khaleque stated that there was no minister or politician by that name in Assam Congress, contradicting the claim.", "Reverse image searches": "Through reverse image searches on Google, AFP verified that the photo of the purported weapons actually showed arms and ammunition seized by Jammu and Kashmir police after a firefight with militants. They also established that the second photo in the claim, showing a man in police custody, was identified in Bengali language reports as Mobarak Hossain, who was arrested for the alleged rape of a student in Trishal, Bangladesh. These reverse image searches helped debunk the authenticity of the claim."}
