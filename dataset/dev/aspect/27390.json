{"The claim is made by a coalition called Citizens to Protect Transportation Funding": "which is comprised of groups including the state\u2019s road construction industry, business, and transportation advocates.", "The coalition has collected": "3.75 million and spent more than $2.05 million on TV ads, a website, and airtime to promote the \"Safe Roads\" constitutional amendment, which supports the claim.", "The claim is based on the premise that if the amendment is approved": "politicians will be required to spend transportation fees on transportation only, allowing the state's infrastructure to be repaired without raising taxes.", "The state": "s history of borrowing from the road fund during budget gaps and the need for $43 billion over the next 10 years to address transportation needs are factors that support the claim."}
