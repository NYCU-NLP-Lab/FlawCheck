{"The expert": "Shawn Smallwood, is a leading ornithologist in California who has studied the impact of wind turbines on raptors, including eagles. He has extensive knowledge and experience in this field.", "Smallwood": "s research and data indicate that around 100 eagles die each year in California due to collisions with wind turbine blades. This number is much lower than the \"hundreds and hundreds\" claimed by Donald Trump.", "Smallwood points out that Trump": "s claim of \"hundreds and hundreds\" of eagle deaths may refer to the cumulative number of eagle fatalities since the installation of industrial-scale wind turbines in the early 1980s. However, the annual number of eagle deaths has significantly decreased in recent years due to improved turbine designs and better siting practices.", "While golden eagle fatalities have been a concern at wind farms in California": "bald eagle deaths are rare. The population of bald eagles is growing, and there is less concern about their conservation status compared to golden eagles, whose population is smaller."}
