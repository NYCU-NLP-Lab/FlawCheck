{"The claim originated from a fake news website called React365": "which allows users to create their own fake news stories.", "The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Services debunked the claim through a sternly worded Facebook post": "stating that a nine-foot-long bull shark was not found in Kentucky Lake.", "The image shared with the React365 post": "depicting a shark fin, was not of a freshwater bull shark but of a great white shark.
