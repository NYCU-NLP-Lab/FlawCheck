{"Hillary Clinton": "s statement: The expert's verdict mentions that Hillary Clinton referred to a past statement by Donald Trump where he suggested that the U.S. should \"encourage\" Japan to get nuclear weapons. This statement by Clinton serves as the basis for the claim being evaluated.", "Trump": "s response in the Fox News Sunday interview: The expert's verdict also mentions Trump's response during an interview on Fox News Sunday, where he was pressed on his past comments about a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula. Trump's response, although not explicitly encouraging a nuclear arms race, suggests that he is not opposed to the idea, which indirectly supports the claim that he may have encouraged Japan to get nuclear weapons."}
