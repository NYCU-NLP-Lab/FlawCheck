{"The claim is based on an estimate by the conservation group Shark Allies": "which suggests that as many as 550,000 sharks may be harvested to create enough COVID-19 vaccines.", "The estimate provided by Shark Allies includes caveats and may only come to fruition if researchers actually use shark squalene": "The number of sharks harvested could either increase or decrease depending on the use of shark squalene and the development of alternative synthetic alternatives.", "The claim does not imply that 550": "000 sharks will certainly be killed. It is an estimate based on known human population sizes and the potential need for a vaccine. Not every person within a population will require a vaccine, and alternative production methods may be more beneficial.", "The claim originated from non": "peer-reviewed research conducted on behalf of Shark Allies, a marine conservation advocacy group. The research estimated the amount of squalene required for a global vaccine demand but did not account for various limitations and variables."}
