{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no evidence of Thomas Jefferson ever saying the quoted statement. They searched through Jefferson's writings and found no mention of it.", "Expert opinion": "The Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia, a reputable source, includes the supposed quote in a list of \"spurious quotations.\" The expert noted that the quote appeared on Twitter in 2015 but couldn't trace its existence before that.", "Historical context": "The expert mentioned that fictitious quotes misattributed to Jefferson are not uncommon. In fact, a blog post was published in 2011 to help people identify such fake quotes.", "Political motivation": "The expert pointed out that the meme using the bogus Jefferson quote was shared in support of President Donald Trump's reelection. This suggests a potential political motivation behind spreading the false claim."}
