{"Verification of the source": "The expert examined the source of the claim, which was an article published on the website IntoTheLight.news. The article was no longer available, but an archived version was found. The expert also discovered that the information was attributed to another source, GoldenAgeofGaia, which had also been removed. The verification of the source helped determine the authenticity of the claim.", "Contacting the alleged author": "The expert contacted Robert Oswald, the Cornell University professor mentioned in the claim, to verify if he made the statement. Oswald denied writing the post and stated that it was a fabrication by an unknown person. This direct communication with the alleged author provided crucial evidence in assessing the authenticity of the claim.", "Statements from the universities involved": "Both Cornell University and Stanford University, mentioned in the claim, denied any involvement in a lawsuit against the CDC. Statements from university officials, such as E.J. Miranda from Stanford University and Abby Butler from Cornell University, were obtained to counter the claims made in the article. These statements further supported the debunking of the claim.", "Expert opinion and scientific evidence": "The expert consulted Heba Mostafa, an assistant professor of pathology at Johns Hopkins Medicine, to verify the existence of SARS-CoV-2 and its isolation. Mostafa confirmed that the virus exists, was isolated in China, and its full genome was deposited in databases. This expert opinion and scientific evidence contradicted the claim that Covid-19 does not exist, adding credibility to the debunking process."}
