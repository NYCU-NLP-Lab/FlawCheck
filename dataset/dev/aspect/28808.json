{"Testimony from Hillary Clinton": "s aide: According to the expert's verdict, one aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim was the testimony from one of Hillary Clinton's aides. The aide told the FBI that he disposed of her unwanted mobile devices by breaking or hammering them on two occasions.", "Lack of personal involvement": "The expert's verdict also stated that Hillary Clinton did not personally destroy her phone with a hammer. This aspect was likely employed to verify the claim by clarifying that it was her aide who carried out the destruction, rather than Clinton herself.", "FBI documents and investigation": "The expert's verdict mentioned that the Federal Bureau of Investigation made public documents relating to its investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. These documents, posted on The Vault, provided evidence and information regarding the disposal of Clinton's old mobile devices, including the mention of an aide using a hammer.", "Lack of physical evidence": "The expert's verdict highlighted that Clinton's attorneys informed the FBI that they were unable to locate any of the devices associated with her two phone numbers and personal email domain. This aspect, along with the statement from Clinton's aide and the FBI's inability to examine the devices, suggests a lack of physical evidence to directly verify the claim."}
