{"The claim states that the 2013 Legislature": "eliminated the overtesting of students in grades 3-8 by decreasing the number of tests from 17 to 8.\" This aspect of the claim is supported by state Rep. Jason Isaac's commentary describing the actions of the 2013 Texas Legislature.", "The claim also mentions that high school end": "of-course exams were reduced from 15 to 5. This aspect is confirmed by Isaac's statement in the same commentary.", "The claim further states that House Bill 866 eliminated some of the STAAR testing requirements for students who meet certain performance thresholds and would give charter schools more testing discretion": "This aspect is mentioned by Isaac in his commentary.", "However": "the claim also acknowledges that a federal waiver is required for these changes to take place. The Texas Education Agency spokesperson, Debbie Ratcliffe, confirms that a waiver is needed due to federal requirements set by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which mandates testing in reading and math every year for grades 3-8. Ratcliffe mentions that the waiver is still pending and that the U.S. Department of Education had denied the waiver request."}
