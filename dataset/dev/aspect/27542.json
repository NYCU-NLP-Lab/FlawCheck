{"Lack of record": "The expert's verdict states that there is no record of Shaquille O\u2019Neal making the comments attributed to him about Donald Trump being the \"best president of all times ever\" and deserving the Medal of Freedom. This lack of evidence suggests that the claim is not authentic.", "False and grammatically incorrect headline": "The expert's verdict highlights that the headline itself is false and grammatically incorrect. The incorrect grammar and sensationalized nature of the headline raise doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Attribution to unreliable sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim has been published on unreliable websites and YouTube channels. The fact that these sources have a history of spreading misinformation casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Misattribution of quotes": "The expert's verdict points out that several quotes attributed to Shaquille O\u2019Neal praising Trump are actually misattributed. The claim falsely attributes statements to O\u2019Neal that were actually made by other individuals, such as Republican Senator Orrin Hatch and singer Ted Nugent. This misattribution further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
