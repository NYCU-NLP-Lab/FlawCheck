{"The presence of a false beard on one of the individuals in the video suggests that it may be a staged event or a mock drill": "2. The reaction of some of the uniformed personnel, who can be seen smiling, also indicates that the video may not be an actual operation but rather a simulated exercise.", "The fact that the video was shared on social media and quickly gained traction": "with over 4,400 shares and 315,000 views, raises questions about its authenticity.", "The discovery of articles on reputable websites": "such as www.naidunia.com and Khabar State, reporting on a mock drill conducted by Vidisha police at the same location and around the same time as the video, provides evidence that supports the claim that the video is not depicting a real incident."}
