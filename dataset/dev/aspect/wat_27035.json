{"Lack of verifiable evidence": "The expert's verdict highlighted that faith-based websites and publications did not provide any verifiable evidence to support the claim that Nike didn't sign Steph Curry because he wanted to put a Bible verse on his sneakers. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Curry": "s rising fame and influence: The expert mentioned that Curry was not as well-known in 2013 as he would become by 2016. The fame and perceived influence of a sports celebrity play a significant role in endorsement decisions. This aspect implies that Nike's decision may have been influenced by factors other than the Bible verse issue.", "Nike": "s doubts about Curry's ability to sell signature shoes: The expert cited an ESPN article that discussed Nike's hesitation to offer a lucrative endorsement deal to Curry. Nike reportedly believed that Curry would not be able to sell signature shoes effectively. This suggests that Nike's decision not to sign Curry may have been based on business considerations rather than the Bible verse issue."}
