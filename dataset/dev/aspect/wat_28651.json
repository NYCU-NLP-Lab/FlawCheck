{"Lack of credible evidence": "The expert points out that the claim of a missile or direct-energy weapon causing the explosion in Nashville is largely based on a single grainy piece of footage. This lack of substantial evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate location connection": "The expert highlights that one theory behind the missile strike claim suggests that the goal was to destroy Room 641A, a telecom intercept facility. However, the expert clarifies that Room 641A is actually located in San Francisco, California, not in Nashville. This discrepancy discredits the claim's connection to the explosion.", "Nonexistent Dominion voting machine audit": "The expert refutes another theory that connects the Nashville explosion to conspiracy theories surrounding fraud in the 2020 election. The claim suggests that the U.S. government ordered the missile strike to halt an audit on Dominion voting machines. However, the expert explains that AT&T was not conducting any audit on Dominion Voting Systems, rendering this theory baseless.", "Misinterpretation of video evidence": "The expert analyzes the footage of the explosion and identifies streaks of smoke ascending from the explosion, rather than descending as claimed by proponents of the missile strike theory. The expert suggests that these streaks are likely debris shooting away from the explosion, not evidence of a missile. This misinterpretation of the video evidence weakens the credibility of the claim."}
