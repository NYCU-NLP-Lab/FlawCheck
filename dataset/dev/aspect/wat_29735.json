However, the Department of Energy's order actually approved extra power use and acknowledged the potential environmental impact.", "The Electric Reliability Council of Texas": "ERCOT), the state's power grid operator, confirmed that there was a lot of misinformation floating around and clarified that the Department of Energy's order allowed for necessary additional power generation.", "The severe winter storm resulted in numerous deaths": "power outages, and frozen water lines, leading to complaints about shockingly high power bills. While some blame could be attributed to tiered pricing from energy suppliers, Houston's mayor stated that the crisis was ultimately preventable. Four ERCOT board members also resigned in the aftermath of the storm."}
