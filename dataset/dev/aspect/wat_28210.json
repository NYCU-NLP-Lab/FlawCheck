{"Verification through a reverse image search": "The expert performed a reverse image search of the viral image and found a similar graphic plate in a fact-check report from a credible source. However, the Marathi text in the viral image was different from the one in the fact-checked image.", "Comparison with a TV9 video report": "The expert conducted a keyword search on YouTube and found a TV9 video report where Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was speaking about the Janata curfew imposed in March last year. The video did not mention anything about the lockdown effective from March 1 to 15, indicating that the claim may not be correct even in the context of the previous year.", "Analysis of text and font": "The expert observed that the text in the viral image had been edited and the font used was different from the font seen in both the viral screenshots and the fact-checked image. This raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison of graphics elements": "The expert noticed that the graphics of the channel, the chief minister's shirt, and his chair were identical in all three screenshots. This suggested that the viral screenshots may have been edited using other TV9 broadcasts, further questioning the credibility of the claim."}
