This provided a more favorable picture for Obama's tenure, with wealth increases for most income percentiles.", "Consideration of alternative measures": "The expert also considered alternative measures of wealth, such as Social Security and Medicare payments, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the financial situation for lower-income Americans.
