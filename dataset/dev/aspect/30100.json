{"The claim stated that": "six of the most prominent activists\" during the Ferguson riots were found burned to death in their cars, implying foul play and a larger conspiracy theory.", "The expert": "s verdict found that some individuals connected to the Ferguson protests have indeed died since 2014, but not all of them were found burned to death in their cars as claimed. The other cases were ruled as suicides, accidental drowning, and a fentanyl overdose.", "The death of DeAndre Joshua": "who was found dead inside a burned car after being shot in the head, led to speculation about a connection to the events surrounding Michael Brown's shooting. However, Joshua's family dispelled rumors that he was a key witness in Brown's case.", "Another individual": "Shawn Gray, who went missing around the same time as Joshua, was later found drowned in the River Des Peres. The medical examiner ruled his death as an accidental drowning with alcohol poisoning as a major contributing factor. Rumors of Gray being killed after testifying in front of a grand jury in the Brown case were dismissed by his family, as he had no connection to the case."}
