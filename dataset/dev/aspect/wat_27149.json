{"The expert analyzed the House health care bill and identified the presence of a": "millionaire's tax\" that would impose a 5.4 percent tax on individuals making more than $500,000 a year and couples earning at least $1 million. This tax is expected to affect fewer than 1 million people, which is less than 1 percent of tax filers.", "The expert also highlighted the penalty imposed on individuals who choose not to buy health insurance": "which would require them to pay a 2.5 percent tax on their income or the dollar amount of a basic coverage plan. The exact number of people affected by this tax is not specified, but it is stated that the pool of individuals impacted would be much wider than the \"millionaire's tax.\"", "The expert mentioned that the number of individuals paying the": "millionaire's tax\" is likely to increase over time due to the tax thresholds not being adjusted for inflation. This implies that more people will be subject to the tax each year.", "The expert acknowledged the difficulty in determining the exact amount of tax increase caused by the House health care bill": "However, based on the published numbers, the claim made by MSNBC host Ed Schultz that \"98 percent of the American people will not see their taxes go up\" is deemed accurate, with Schultz even providing himself a margin of error by stating it would be 2 percent when it would actually be 1 percent of Americans."}
