{"Lack of credible news reports": "The expert found that there were no relevant news reports confirming the claim about the RBI permanently closing down nine banks. This lack of credible sources raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Clarification from RBI": "The RBI itself clarified via a tweet that the reports about closing down certain commercial banks were false. This official statement from the regulatory authority contradicted the claim being circulated on social media.", "Previous circulation of the same message": "The expert discovered that the same message claiming the closure of these banks had been circulated in 2017 as well. This indicated that it was a recurring rumor and not based on any recent developments or official announcements.", "Lack of Supreme Court order": "The claim emphasized that the closure of these banks was ordered by the Supreme Court. However, there was no evidence or official statement from the Supreme Court supporting this claim. This absence of a legal directive cast further doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
