{"The chain email": "The expert mentions that the claim originated from a chain email that circulated among readers. This is the first aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Source of information": "The expert notes that most of the claim appears to be lifted from an article written by Dr. Paul L. Williams for The New Media Journal, a conservative website. This indicates that the claim is not an original piece of information but rather a reiteration of existing content.", "Presidential Determination": "The expert mentions that some of the emails include a link to \"Presidential Determination No. 2009-15 of January 27, 2009,\" a memo from Obama to the Secretary of State. The expert confirms that the memo is legitimate and provides information on the purpose of the funds, which is related to humanitarian needs of Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza.", "State Department news release": "The expert refers to a news release from the State Department on Jan. 30, which provides a breakdown of the funds' distribution. The release clarifies that the money does not go towards resettling \"Hamas\" Palestinians in the United States. This news release serves as evidence to counter the claim's assertion."}
