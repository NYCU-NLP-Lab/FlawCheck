{"Gingrich": "s claim: The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the statement made by Newt Gingrich himself. The expert's verdict mentions that Gingrich accused Mitt Romney of cutting off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens on Medicaid to save $5 a day. This claim is the initial basis for investigation.", "Robocall statement": "The second aspect is the robocall made by Gingrich's campaign, which further supports the claim. The robocall stated that Romney vetoed a bill paying for kosher food for seniors in nursing homes, including Holocaust survivors. This additional evidence adds weight to the initial claim.", "New York Post article": "The third aspect employed to verify the claim is a New York Post article from January 27, which was provided by Gingrich's campaign as support. The article, titled \"Romney rapped for kosher cut,\" likely provides more details and context surrounding the issue.", "Budget gap and legislative response": "The fourth aspect involves investigating the circumstances surrounding Romney's governorship in 2003. According to the expert's verdict, Romney faced a $3 billion budget gap, and a change in the state reimbursement formula for nursing homes removed extra funding for eight kosher homes. Democratic lawmakers proposed supplemental funding of $600,000 to keep nursing homes' kosher kitchens open. This information helps to understand the context and potential motivations behind Romney's actions."}
