{"The claim is based on forged medical records": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim is largely based on forged medical records that were anonymously \"leaked\" online. These documents claim that Hillary Clinton was diagnosed with complex partial seizures and subcortical vascular dementia by her personal physician, but the physician herself issued a statement denying their authenticity.", "Expert medical assessment contradicts the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that Clinton's actual medical assessment, conducted by her physician in 2015, stated that she had no ongoing health conditions apart from hypothyroidism and seasonal allergies. This contradicts the claim of her suffering from subcortical vascular dementia.", "Lack of credible evidence": "The expert's verdict points out that the evidence provided in the claim, such as viral images and videos, is misused and taken out of context to support the false diagnosis. The images and videos are claimed to show Clinton exhibiting symptoms of dementia, but they have been previously used to support other unfounded health rumors about Clinton.", "Discrepancies in timing and events": "The expert's verdict mentions the timing of the claim, which gained popularity after a \"medical episode\" involving Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. However, it is emphasized that the claim is not supported by credible evidence and relies on conspiracy theories rather than verifiable facts."}
