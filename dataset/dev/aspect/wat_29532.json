{"The claim is based on the accusation made by Gov": "Bob McDonnell that the Obama administration is reversing federal welfare laws. This accusation is supported by the statement made by McDonnell in an op-ed and the fact that he has joined other Republicans in criticizing the administration's announcement.", "The Obama administration announced a waiver program on July 12": "allowing states to seek exemptions from welfare-to-work requirements. This program was designed to test alternative and innovative strategies to improve employment outcomes for needy families. The announcement and the program itself provide evidence that the administration is making changes to the work requirements.", "The U": "S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a directive stating that they will only consider approving waivers that make changes intended to lead to more effective means of meeting the work goals of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. This directive indicates that the administration is actively seeking changes to the work participation requirements.", "George Sheldon": "an assistant secretary at HHS, explained that the administration's move to allow waivers stemmed from a presidential memorandum calling for the removal of regulatory barriers that undermine federal programs. This suggests that the administration's decision to allow waivers for welfare-to-work requirements is part of a broader effort to improve federal programs and remove barriers to their effectiveness."}
