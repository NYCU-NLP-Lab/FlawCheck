{"The Department of Labor": "s press release: The expert mentions that the Department of Labor issued a press release stating that the proposed rule would not ban children from operating certain tools such as a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose. This press release serves as evidence to verify the claim.", "U": "S. Secretary of Agriculture's statement: The expert refers to a statement made by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, which emphasizes the importance of preventing unnecessary child injuries or deaths while still allowing children to help with family farms. This statement supports the claim that the proposed rules aim to balance safety concerns with maintaining children's involvement in agricultural activities.", "Opposition from lawmakers and farmers": "The expert mentions that the proposed changes to the child labor rule were withdrawn in response to opposition from lawmakers and farmers. This opposition suggests that there were concerns about the potential impact of the rule on small family-owned farms, further validating the claim.", "Lack of evidence from Alexander and Rooney": "The expert states that Alexander and Rooney, who opposed the rule, failed to provide evidence that children working on farms would be banned from operating certain tools. This lack of evidence reinforces the claim that the proposed rule did not intend to prohibit children from using tools like a power screwdriver, a milking machine, or a wheelbarrow on family farms."}
