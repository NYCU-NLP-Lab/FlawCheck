{"The claim is based on a study conducted by the American Enterprise Institute": "AEI), a conservative policy group, which compared the wages and benefits of public and private sector workers.", "The study found that public workers earn about 2": "5 percent less in wages compared to comparable private employees, but when the value of benefits, including pensions and \"job security,\" are factored in, public workers make 43 percent more.", "The authors of the study": "Andrew Biggs and Jason Richwine, considered wages to be \"comparable\" between the two sectors, but highlighted the significant difference in non-wage benefits, particularly in pensions and health insurance.", "The study also emphasized the calculation of pension funding for public and private sector workers": "giving a premium to the \"guaranteed\" element of public pensions, which contributed to the higher overall compensation for public employees."}
