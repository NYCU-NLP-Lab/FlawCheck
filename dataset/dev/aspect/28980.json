{"The claim was made by a blogger named Dr": "William Mount, who published an article stating that the FBI raided the CDC headquarters in search of data linking vaccines to autism. This information was obtained from the expert's analysis of the claim.", "The CDC": "when contacted, refused to comment on the alleged raid, stating that they are not allowed to discuss the matter. This response from the CDC was considered as a factor in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "The blogger mentioned that there were 36 posts on their video discussing the raid": "which were made 10 minutes before the video was posted. This timing discrepancy raises questions about the credibility of the claim.", "The expert also mentions that the blog post was traced back to an unreliable source": "a report from a foreign intelligence service (SVR) circulating in the Kremlin. The questionable nature of this source further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
