This raises doubts about the authenticity of the information.", "Conflicting accounts": "The families of the deceased workers gave different accounts than the one reported by the outlet. This discrepancy in information further questions the accuracy of the claim made by the outlet.", "Contradictory information from official sources": "The expert mentions that the spokesperson for Railways claimed that a child who died at Muzaffarpur railway station was already ill and returning home after treatment. However, the outlet declared this news as false and misleading. The contradictory statements from official sources create confusion and make it difficult to verify the claim.", "Testimony from the father of the deceased child": "The expert includes the testimony of Mohammad Pintu, the father of the deceased child, who denies that his child had any pre-existing illness or recent treatment. Pintu provides details of their journey and the lack of food, water, and assistance during their travel, suggesting that the cause of death might be related to these factors rather than pre-existing conditions or treatment."}
