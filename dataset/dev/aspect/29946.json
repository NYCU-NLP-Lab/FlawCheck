She acknowledged the harm caused to faithful couples, leading to divorces after DNA tests, and the emotional impact on mothers who breastfed children that were not biologically theirs.", "Investigation by local officials": "The claim states that local officials took the report seriously enough to conduct an investigation. The General Nursing Council of Zambia reportedly investigated the claim but found no nurse match, suggesting that no evidence was found to support the nurse's confession."}
