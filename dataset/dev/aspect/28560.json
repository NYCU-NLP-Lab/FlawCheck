{"The claim is based on a blog post from": "No Tricks Zone\" that presents a list of 80 graphs taken from 58 studies. The expert's verdict states that the analysis of the findings presented by No Tricks Zone is crude, misinformed, and riddled with errors.", "The expert reached out to many of the authors of the studies included on the No Tricks Zone list and found that not a single researcher agreed with the analysis presented by Breitbart and No Tricks Zone": "In fact, most researchers were shocked to learn that their work was being used as evidence for the claim.", "One of the authors": "Paul Mayewski, responded to the expert's inquiry and stated that the claim is \"absolutely incorrect.\" Mayewski emphasized that his study actually deals with the impacts of greenhouse gas warming and Antarctic ozone depletion, both of which are human-caused.", "The expert highlights that the 58 studies included on the list cover a diverse range of highly technical topics and have little in common with each other": "Therefore, they cannot be collectively used to support the claim that global warming is a myth."}
