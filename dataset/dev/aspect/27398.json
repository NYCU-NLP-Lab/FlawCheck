{"Lack of official documentation": "The expert notes that there is no mention or documentation on Nancy Pelosi's House website or social media accounts regarding her visit to Wuhan or any other part of China during the stated timeframe. This absence of official records raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of travel reports": "The Foreign Travel Reports lodged with the House Clerk do not record Nancy Pelosi traveling to China in the fourth quarter of 2019. This further supports the argument that she did not visit Wuhan during that time.", "No contemporaneous news accounts": "The expert highlights that there were no news reports, either from the United States or China, indicating Nancy Pelosi's presence in China, specifically Wuhan, in November 2019. The lack of any media coverage during that period adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Inaccurate accompanying photograph": "The photograph used in the meme to support the claim is misleading. It is from November 2015 and shows Nancy Pelosi meeting with retired Chinese politician Zhang Dejiang in Beijing, not Wuhan. The expert's analysis of the image discredits its relevance to the claim and further undermines its authenticity."}
