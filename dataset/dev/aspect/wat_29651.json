{"Verification through comparison": "The expert compared the photograph in question with a similar picture posted by a Tucson news station, noting that both images showed the same sign with identical markings. This comparison helped verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Confirmation from an official source": "The expert reached out to Doug Nick, the Assistant Communications Director for Public Information for the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT). Nick confirmed that the photographed sign was not an official ADOT-produced sign. This confirmation added to the verification process.", "Lack of evidence and personal experience": "The expert mentioned their personal experience of living in Arizona and never witnessing parachuting cows or any other livestock. This lack of evidence supported the conclusion that the claim was unlikely to be true.", "Logical reasoning and practical challenges": "The expert pointed out the logistical challenges and practical impossibilities of herding cattle into aircraft, strapping parachutes on them, and releasing them safely. The expert's logical reasoning further supported the conclusion that the claim was not authentic."}
