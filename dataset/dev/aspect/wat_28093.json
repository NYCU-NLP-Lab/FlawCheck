{"Blue crabs are predominantly born in Virginia": "The expert's verdict confirms that if a crab is a blue crab, it is likely born in Virginia. This is supported by the fact that blue crabs mate in the middle of the bay, and the female migrates to the saltier waters of the lower Chesapeake Bay, which is primarily in Virginia.", "High salinity areas are in Virginia": "The expert's verdict mentions that the areas of high salinity, which are preferred by crabs for mating and birthing, are located in Virginia near the mouth of the bay. This further supports the claim that crabs are born in Virginia.", "Moment of conception and birth occur in Virginia": "The expert's statement from Romuald Lipcius, a professor at Virginia Institute of Marine Science, confirms that the moment of conception and birth (or hatching) are almost always occurring in Virginia. This is because the females settle in the saltiest waters of Virginia and the eggs become fertilized and emerge as larvae there.", "Possibility of birth in Maryland during drought": "While the majority of crab births occur in Virginia, the expert also mentions the possibility of females giving birth in Maryland during drought conditions when the salinity can get very high. This suggests that although rare, there can be instances of crab births in Maryland."}
