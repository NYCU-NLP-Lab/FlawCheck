{"Testimony from Oxford classmates": "In October 1992, a British news report included interviews with a number of Bill Clinton's Oxford classmates. None of them mentioned Clinton being expelled or leaving abruptly, suggesting that the claim of expulsion for sexual misconduct is not supported by their testimonies.", "Public knowledge of non": "completion: Clinton's non-completion of the Rhodes Scholar program at Oxford was already public knowledge more than 20 years before the rumors of expulsion emerged. This suggests that there were no official records or evidence supporting the claim.", "Timing of movements between the U": "S. and England: Clinton's movements between the United States and England during his time at Oxford were likely influenced by his efforts to avoid the military draft, rather than any penalties for misbehavior. This indicates that the claim of expulsion is inconsistent with the known reasons for his movements.", "Lack of credible sources": "The claim of Bill Clinton's expulsion from Oxford for raping Eileen Wellstone lacks credible sources. The Washington Times article that mentioned the allegation did not provide any author, citation, or supporting information, suggesting that the claim lacks verifiable evidence."}
