{"Lack of verifiable source": "The expert's verdict highlights that the viral claim did not provide any specific information about the MSNBC reporter who allegedly made the statement. The absence of a named source makes it difficult to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Inability to find supporting evidence": "The expert's investigation involved searching for the alleged quote in news reports and TV coverage databases but found no record of it. This lack of supporting evidence raises doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Admission of paraphrasing": "The commentators on the Facebook post admitted that the quote was not an actual statement from an MSNBC reporter but a paraphrased version of a discussion involving Nicole Wallace and Eddie S. Glaude Jr. The admission of paraphrasing suggests that the claim was manipulated to create a false narrative.", "Discreet editing and misrepresentation": "The clip shared on conservative websites was found to be discreetly edited to create the impression that the reporters were making light of the situation and hoping for the pandemic to harm Trump politically. The inclusion of unrelated footage and misrepresentation of the original context further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
