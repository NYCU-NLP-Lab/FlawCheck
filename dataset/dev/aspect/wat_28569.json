{"Lack of definition": "The expert points out that the claim does not define what is meant by \"too acidic,\" making the statement meaningless. This lack of clarity raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Scientific complexity": "The expert explains that the link between pH and cancer is a complex subject with a long scientific history. By highlighting the complexity, the expert suggests that a broad and simplistic claim like the one made in the meme is unlikely to be accurate.", "Variation in pH levels": "The expert highlights that pH levels vary significantly in different parts of the body. For example, the stomach has highly acidic pH levels, while blood has a tightly regulated pH of around 7.4. This variation challenges the claim's generalization that all cancer patients have pH levels that are \"too acidic.\"", "Limited impact of diet": "The expert explains that the pH of certain parts of the body, such as blood, is tightly regulated by the liver and other homeostatic systems. Therefore, the expert argues that diet alone cannot significantly influence a person's pH levels. This challenges the claim's assertion that an acidic body is a breeding ground for cancer and raises doubts about its authenticity."}
