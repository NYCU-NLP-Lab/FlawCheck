{"Lack of public agency records": "The expert mentions that neither the Indiana Historical Society nor the Federal Communications Commission found any records related to the reasoning behind the assignation of the 317 area code to Indianapolis. This suggests that there is no official documentation supporting the claim.", "No response from relevant organizations": "The expert contacted the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) and AT&T, responsible for assigning area codes in 1947, but received no responses. This lack of response indicates a lack of evidence or information regarding the claim.", "Area code determination based on phone dialing formula": "The expert explains that the initial set of area codes, including 317, were determined based on a rotary phone dialing formula. This suggests that the area code assignment was not influenced by the sinking of the USS Indianapolis or the number of survivors, but rather by practical considerations of call volume.", "Controversy surrounding survivor count": "The expert mentions that while the U.S. Navy listed 316 survivors after the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, witnesses and survivors insisted that the count was short by one. This controversy further adds to the uncertainty and lack of concrete evidence supporting the claim."}
