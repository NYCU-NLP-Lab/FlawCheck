{"The woman circled in the meme is identified as Mary Brunner": "Manson's first recruit and mother of his child. This identification was made by Joan Renner, a historian and expert on Los Angeles crimes, and confirmed by Tom O'Neill, who wrote a book about the Manson Family, and Bo Emerson, who collects documents and photos from the Manson case.", "The photo in question was taken by Michael Haering": "a Los Angeles photojournalist, and was published in the August 1970 issue of LIFE Magazine. Other photos of Mary Brunner in the same outfit credited to Haering can be found online, further supporting her identification in the photo.", "Nancy Pelosi": "s spokesperson, Drew Hamill, pointed out that in 1969, when the photo was taken, Pelosi was living in San Francisco with her five children. This contradicts the claim that she was photographed with the Manson Family at the Spahn Ranch, which is approximately 370 miles away from San Francisco.", "It is noted that Manson and his cult despised politicians": "and there is no evidence or reason to believe that they would have affiliated themselves with a member of a prominent political family like Nancy Pelosi. Joan Renner specifically stated that Pelosi would have been on their \"political piggies\" list, a term Manson used to justify his killings, further debunking the claim."}
