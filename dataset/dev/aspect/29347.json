{"The expert found a 2007 report from the independent Institute for Policy Studies and the independent nonprofit United for a Fair Economy": "titled \"Executive Excess 2007,\" which stated that CEOs of large U.S. companies made as much money from just one day on the job as average workers make over the entire year. While not exactly 10 minutes, it supports the claim that some CEOs make significantly more than ordinary workers.", "Another source cited is a 2007 report in Forbes magazine": "which stated that the average salary for the 20 highest-paid chief executives is $145 million. Comparing this to the median annual income for a full-time worker, it is calculated that it would take 30 minutes for the highest-paid CEOs to exceed the annual salary of an average worker.", "The Forbes report also mentioned that Apple CEO Steve Jobs was listed as the highest": "paid boss of America's 500 biggest companies, earning $646.6 million a year. Doing the math, it was found that Jobs makes $53,883 in 10 minutes, which is significantly more than the average worker's annual salary.", "The expert concludes that while it may be fair to say that some CEOs make more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers make in an entire year": "it would be safer for Obama to qualify his statement. The expert rules Obama's statement as \"Mostly True\" based on the evidence gathered."}
