{"Hillary Clinton": "s statement: Hillary Clinton, in a national interview with CNN, criticized Donald Trump's comments on illegal Mexican immigrants and Jeb Bush's stance on a pathway to citizenship. She claimed that Bush \"doesn't believe in a path to citizenship\" and that if he did believe in it at one time, he no longer does. This statement serves as the initial claim that needs to be verified.", "Jeb Bush": "s book: In his 2013 book \"Immigration Wars,\" Jeb Bush and co-author Clint Bolick wrote that permanent residency should not lead to citizenship. They argued that actions should have consequences, and those who violated the laws should not obtain the benefits of citizenship. This aspect shows that Bush initially opposed a pathway to citizenship.", "Bush": "s statement in March: When contacted by the fact-checkers, the Bush campaign referred to his statement in March in New Hampshire. The statement suggested that Bush would support a pathway to citizenship if it were politically viable. However, since it is not, he is in favor of a pathway to legal status instead. This aspect demonstrates Bush's current position on the issue."}
