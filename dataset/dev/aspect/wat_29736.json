{"Comparison of black America": "s buying power: The expert's verdict mentions that Larry Elder referred to an annual report by Target Market News called \"The Buying Power of Black America\" to support his claim. This report estimated the total earned income of African-Americans at $836 billion in 2011, which Elder compared to the GDP of different countries.", "Comparison to World Bank": "s GDP list: Larry Elder compared the estimated earned income of black America to the World Bank's list of each country's GDP. He claimed that if black America were a country, it would be the 15th wealthiest nation in the world based on this comparison.", "Lack of recent data": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Target Market News report, which provided the estimate of African-Americans' earned income, is behind a paywall, and they were unable to obtain a copy. Additionally, the report hasn't published another estimate since 2011. This lack of recent data raises questions about the accuracy and relevance of the claim.", "Difference between earned income and GDP": "The expert's verdict highlights the difference between earned income and GDP. NYU economics professor Gian Luca Clementi states that comparing these two measures isn't fair because GDP is a concept that applies to a jurisdiction, not a specific group of people. Factors like government expenditure and private investment influence GDP, whereas earned income is specific to a group's income. This distinction suggests that comparing black America's buying power to GDP may not provide an accurate representation of their wealth."}
