{"Misrepresentation of state": "posted numbers: The expert's verdict highlights that then-Gov. Rick Perry misrepresented state-posted numbers, inaccurately claiming that thousands of Texas murders had been committed by unauthorized immigrants. This aspect questions the accuracy and reliability of the claim.", "Use of figures from a Texas presentation": "The claim is based on a video clip from a Texas presentation that Hannity saw alongside Perry during a visit to McAllen on the Texas-Mexico border. The presentation states that more than 200,000 criminal immigrants were responsible for about 642,000 criminal offenses. This aspect examines the source and credibility of the figures used in the claim.", "Hannity": "s personal experiences and observations: Hannity mentions his personal experiences of visiting the border, being on horseback, using all-terrain vehicles, helicopters, and boats, as well as attending a security briefing with Rick Perry. He uses these experiences to support the claim and assert its validity. This aspect evaluates the relevance and objectivity of Hannity's personal observations.", "Lack of response to specific questions": "Hannity challenges news broadcaster Jorge Ramos, asking if he supports removing criminal aliens from the country and questioning his sympathy for the victims of crime. However, Ramos does not directly answer these questions. This aspect focuses on the lack of direct response and the potential implications for the claim's authenticity."}
