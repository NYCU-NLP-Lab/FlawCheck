This aspect contributes to verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Morphometric": "isotopic, and genetic analyses: The expert mentions that these analyses were conducted on Zh\u00f9r to provide details about her appearance and evolutionary relationship to wolves. These scientific investigations contribute to verifying the claim's authenticity by providing evidence and supporting information.", "Determination of Zh\u00f9r": "s age: The expert explains that radiographs of Zh\u00f9r's skeleton were used to determine her age. By comparing the fusion of her bones to the growth rate of a domestic dog, researchers estimated that Zh\u00f9r died at around seven weeks old. This aspect adds credibility to the claim by providing scientific evidence for the wolf mummy's age.", "Radiocarbon dating": "The expert mentions that radiocarbon dating was employed to determine the approximate time of Zh\u00f9r's death. This method analyzes the levels of three carbon isotopes in the remains. By using radiocarbon dating, researchers can establish that Zh\u00f9r died approximately 57,000 years ago, aligning with the claim's statement about her age. This aspect further supports the authenticity of the claim."}
