{"Historical evidence": "The expert's verdict includes a reference to Jawaharlal Nehru's autobiography, which recounts his meeting with Bhagat Singh in prison. This provides historical evidence that contradicts the claim made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.", "Eyewitness account": "Nehru's description of his meeting with Bhagat Singh provides an eyewitness account that adds credibility to the authenticity of the claim. He describes the physical condition and demeanor of Bhagat Singh and Jatindranath Das during his visit.", "Contextual information": "The expert's verdict mentions that Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt were arrested for exploding bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi in April 1929. This contextual information supports the fact that they were indeed imprisoned during the British rule.", "Comparison with corrupt leaders": "The expert's verdict also mentions Prime Minister Modi's statement that Congress leaders choose to visit those who have been jailed for corruption. This comparison highlights the contrast between the actions of Congress leaders and their alleged lack of visitation to Bhagat Singh and other freedom fighters in prison."}
