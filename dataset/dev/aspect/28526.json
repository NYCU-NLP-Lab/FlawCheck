{"Rep": "Ilhan Omar's remarks during the news conference: The expert's verdict highlights the statement made by Rep. Ilhan Omar during the news conference, where she condemned President Trump's attacks and quoted his own controversial words, including the phrase \"grab women by the pussy\" and his derogatory remarks about black athletes and people from black and brown countries.", "Fox News headline": "The expert's verdict mentions the graphic circulating on social media, which claimed that Fox News had reported on the news conference with a headline stating that Rep. Omar had delivered a \"profanity-laced attack on President Trump.\" The expert confirms that the original headline on Fox News' online reporting did contain this statement.", "Alteration of the headline": "The expert's verdict notes that the headline on Fox News' online reporting was later altered to reflect that Rep. Omar had used the \"president's words to deliver heated, profanity-laced attack on Trump.\" This alteration suggests that Fox News acknowledged that Omar was quoting Trump rather than launching an attack in her own words.", "Fox News pundit": "s complaint: The expert's verdict mentions that a Fox News pundit complained about Rep. Omar's use of profanity when quoting Donald Trump. This observation highlights the perspective that quoting Trump's own statements was somehow deemed more unseemly than Trump's original remarks because they were not made on live television at a specific time."}
