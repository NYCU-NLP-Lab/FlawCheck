{"The claim falsely states that Hermann Goering defunded and eliminated the police departments to ensure the National Socialist agenda": "However, in reality, the Nazis centralized and fully funded the police to combat criminal gangs and promote state security.", "The claim incorrectly associates Goering with the Brown Shirts": "Sturmabteilung or SA), the paramilitary organization led by Ernst Roehm. Goering was the interior minister of Prussia and not the head of the SA.", "The claim suggests that the Brown Shirts used violence to sway elections": "but this violence occurred before the Nazis took over the government. The SA's ambitions threatened the Nazi regime itself, leading to a conspiracy against Roehm and the execution of SA leaders on the Night of the Long Knives.", "The claim draws an inappropriate equivalency between the Nazi agenda and American protesters": "implying that the protesters are following a similar path. This comparison is further reinforced by comments attached to the posts, creating a misleading narrative."}
