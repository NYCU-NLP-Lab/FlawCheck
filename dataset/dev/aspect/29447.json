{"The claim stated that": "50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system\" at a Colorado hospital. This claim was made by former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb in an ad opposing recreational marijuana.", "The claim was supported by a September 2016 report from the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area": "which stated that \"nearly half\" of newborns tested in March 2016 at St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center in Pueblo, Colorado, tested positive for marijuana.", "The head of the neonatal unit at St": "Mary-Corwin, Dr. Steve Simerville, reported a \"dramatic increase\" in newborns with marijuana in their system, as noted in a July 2016 CBS Denver story.", "However": "a more comprehensive analysis of the data revealed that the claim was misleading. From January 2016 through September 2016, only 27 out of 101 newborns tested positive for marijuana at St. Mary-Corwin, which is a rate slightly under 27 percent. Similarly, in 2015, out of 93 newborns tested, only 31 came up positive for marijuana, which is a rate of approximately 33 percent. These figures contradict the claim of 50 percent."}
