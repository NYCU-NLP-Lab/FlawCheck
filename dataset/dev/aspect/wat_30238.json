{"Multiple Facebook posts": "The claim is supported by multiple Facebook posts from different pages, such as Yogi Adityanath \u2013 True Indian, I Support Namo, and ModiNama. These posts include images of Arvind Kejriwal cutting a cake and comment on his alleged insensitivity.", "Twitter post": "A Twitter handle, followed by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s office, shared the same image of Kejriwal cutting a cake along with a tweet from ABP News stating that the CM cancelled his birthday celebrations. This post further adds to the claim's authenticity.", "Article on a website": "A website called \"Actual News\" published an article highlighting Kejriwal's alleged hypocrisy and insensitivity by celebrating his birthday despite Atal Bihari Vajpayee's demise. The article provides additional evidence to support the claim.", "Counter": "claim by Ankit Lal: Ankit Lal, the social media strategist of AAP, tweeted that the image of Kejriwal cutting the cake was taken in the morning and being circulated as if it was taken in the evening. This counter-claim adds another aspect to the verification process, as it questions the authenticity of the image and suggests a possible manipulation."}
