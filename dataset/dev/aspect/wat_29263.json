{"The explanation of the claim": "s origins from Mark Twain's autobiography, which describes a bakeshop sign with the word \"BAKERY\" reversed, creating the name \"Yreka.\"", "The official designation of the town as": "Yreka\" by the legislature, which was taken from the Shasta Indian word w\u00e1ik'a', meaning \"white mountain\" or \"north mountain.\"", "The accidental substitution of the name": "Wyreka\" for \"Ieka\" during the establishment of the county seat, leading to the modified spelling of \"Yreka.\"", "The existence of a bakery sign in Yreka that reads": "Yreka Bakery\" forward and backward, highlighting the palindromic potential of the name."}
