{"U": "S. Rep. Paul Ryan's statement: The expert's verdict mentions that U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan made a statement linking pride in Texas and Wisconsin during a Republican Party convention. This statement serves as the initial claim that is being investigated.", "Worthpoint entry": "The expert's verdict mentions that a representative from Worthpoint pointed to an entry on their website. This entry states that national focus groups run by Coca-Cola found that Wisconsin and Texas natives strongly identify with their states. It also mentions that Wisconsin and Texas were the only states allowed to develop logos and advertising lines tying each state to the Coca-Cola brand. However, it is important to note that Worthpoint clarified that they cannot vouch for the truthfulness of the information in the entry.", "eBay post": "The expert's verdict states that the Worthpoint entry is a copy of a December 2006 eBay post related to the completed auction of a Coca-Cola jacket. While the post provides information about the Coca-Cola study, the credibility of the post and the person who posted it cannot be verified.", "Coca": "Cola Company's response: The expert's verdict includes the response from a Coca-Cola spokesperson. The spokesperson mentioned that the company's internal search for the study came up empty, but it is \"likely possible\" that the study took place. The spokesperson also mentioned the launch of a grassroots marketing effort called \"Coca-Cola Texas\" in the early 1990s, which suggests that there may have been a marketing study conducted during that time to validate the campaign's points."}
