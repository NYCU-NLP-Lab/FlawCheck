{"The claim is directly stated on the RailTaxFacts": "com website, which features a commercial arguing against pro-transit talking points, including the statement that \"light rail does not reduce congestion.\"", "The Greenlight Pinellas mass transit initiative": "which includes a proposed 24-mile light rail route from St. Petersburg to Clearwater, is being questioned by critics who are attacking the effectiveness of the plan's light rail line.", "The group No Tax For Tracks": "which opposes the Greenlight Pinellas plan, provides supporting evidence for their claim by referencing a Washington Post Wonkblog post and an analysis by David McKalip, a St. Petersburg neurosurgeon and supporter of No Tax For Tracks. McKalip's analysis argues that light rail actually increases congestion, citing examples from Portland, Oregon, and British cities.", "The expert mentions that there is no concrete evidence of a relationship between congestion reduction and light rail": "as stated in a post by McKalip on July 1. This suggests that the claim is being questioned and that the authenticity of the claim is being verified through the examination of evidence and arguments provided by both sides."}
