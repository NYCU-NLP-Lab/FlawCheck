{"Photo and video evidence": "The expert mentions that there is photo and video proof that Senator Ron Johnson was present at the Senate impeachment hearings on both February 11 and February 12, contradicting the claim that he didn't \"show up\" for a day of the hearings.", "Senator Johnson": "s spokesperson's statement: The expert mentions that Senator Johnson's spokesperson, Ben Voelkel, stated to a reporter that Johnson had been in attendance throughout the trial, refuting the claim made by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan that Johnson was a no-show on the second-last day of the proceedings.", "Alternative ways of watching the proceedings": "The expert explains that senators were allowed to leave the Senate Chamber and watch the proceedings from the upstairs gallery or an adjacent room by television. This information suggests that even if a senator was temporarily absent from the floor, it doesn't necessarily mean they weren't watching the proceedings.", "Tweet misinterpretation and timing": "The expert mentions that the claim originated from a tweet by author Don Winslow, which showed pictures of Senator Johnson and other senators, stating that they chose not to attend the impeachment trial. However, the tweet was sent before the Senate proceedings began on February 12, leading to misinterpretation and confusion about the date being referenced in the tweet."}
