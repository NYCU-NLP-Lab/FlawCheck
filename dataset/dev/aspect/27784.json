{"The claim originated in October as a list of senators who had not yet co": "sponsored an impeachment-related resolution, but six of them did sign on to that measure.", "The specific list of the nine senators does not appear to be based on new developments": "but instead lifted from reports in October about an impeachment-related resolution in the Senate.", "The claim falsely implies that the nine senators have": "joined Democrats on impeachment,\" even though there has been little action taken by the senators thus far.", "The argument that the senators": "support Democrat witch hunt\" based on their failure to co-sponsor one non-binding resolution is undermined by the fact that most of the senators named actually did co-sponsor the resolution."}
