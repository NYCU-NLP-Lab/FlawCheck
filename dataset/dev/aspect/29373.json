{"Aker was not arrested solely for failing to pay his student loans": "but rather for disobeying a court order.", "The U": "S. Marshals Service contacted Aker multiple times, requesting his appearance in court, but he refused.", "A judge issued a warrant for Aker": "s arrest after he failed to appear in court and pay the full balance of his unpaid federal student loan debt.", "Aker": "s claim of being arrested by \"seven armed U.S. Marshals\" is technically true but misleading, as he went inside his home to retrieve a gun when the Marshals attempted to arrest him."}
