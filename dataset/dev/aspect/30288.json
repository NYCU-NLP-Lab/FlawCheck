{"The breakdown of expenses": "The expert examined the pie chart provided in the blog post, which showed the allocation of funds raised by the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. This breakdown included categories such as fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations.", "Comparison to industry standards": "The expert referenced the standards set by the ECFA (Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability), which deems a non-profit as a reliable charity if at least 80% of donations make it to their intended projects. The expert highlighted that the blog post claimed only 27% of the donations were being used for the purpose of ALS research, which is significantly below the industry standard.", "Verification of source credibility": "The expert noted that the blog post making the claim did not provide any contact information, making it difficult to verify the credibility of the source. This raised questions about the reliability and accuracy of the information presented.", "Comparison of donation amounts": "The expert mentioned that the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge had raised at least $94 million in donations for the ALS Association. This significant amount of money raised suggested that there was substantial support for the cause, which contradicted the claim that most of the money was being spent on administration and overhead."}
