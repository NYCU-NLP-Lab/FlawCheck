{"Stephen Silberkraus appeared as an extra in the 2006 film": "The Pet\" under the stage name Stephen Neill, where he played a trader on the \"Global Slave Market\" for about 30 seconds of screen time.", "The film": "The Pet\" is described as a poorly received exploitation film that explores the concepts of \"human pets\" and sexual slavery.", "Silberkraus stated that he was on set for only one day to film his scene and believed the film would be a more serious look at human trafficking": "but it turned out to be a \"cheesy B-movie.\"", "The use of the term": "fetish film\" to describe \"The Pet\" is seen as politically charged and an attempt to establish a connection between Silberkraus and degrading women, according to UNLV gender and sexuality studies professor Lynn Comella."}
