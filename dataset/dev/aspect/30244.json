{"Lack of independent verification": "The BBC, in its report, stated that it could not independently verify the claim of a gorilla swallowing N6.8m at Kano zoo. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Multiple sources reproducing the story": "Many Nigerian newspapers and blogs reproduced the story, citing the BBC, Freedom Radio, or no source at all. The fact that the story was widely shared and reproduced without clear attribution adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Confirmation from zoo officials": "The general manager of the zoo, Umar Yusuf, confirmed that the money was stolen during a robbery, rather than being swallowed by a gorilla. He provided details of the robbery incident, including the break-in and theft of money from the safe.", "Lack of gorillas in the zoo": "The head of the primate section at the zoo, Nura Lawn Doguwa, stated that the Kano zoo does not keep gorillas. This contradicts the claim that a gorilla swallowed the money, further undermining its authenticity."}
