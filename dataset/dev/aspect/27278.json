Sean Duffy made this statement during an MSNBC interview on October 8, 2013, one week after the health insurance exchanges opened under the Affordable Care Act.", "The expert": "s verdict addresses the question of whether members of Congress are required to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, while Obama and his staff can keep their own gold-plated health care plan. It states that this claim was rated false by PolitiFact National and provides information on the insurance plans previously available to members of Congress through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.", "Duffy directly questions why President Obama": "Michelle Obama, and Jay Carney were not seen signing up for Obamacare on October 1st, suggesting that they have their own gold-plated health care plan. This aspect highlights the specific individuals mentioned in the claim and their alleged exemption from Obamacare."}
