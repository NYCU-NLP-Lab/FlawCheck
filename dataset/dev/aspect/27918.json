{"The source of the claim": "The expert investigated the source of the claim and found that it was attributed to a 2009 report by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) called \"Rich States, Poor States.\" However, the expert could not find the specific RIPEC report referenced in the ALEC report, raising doubts about the accuracy and validity of the claim.", "Verification from RIPEC": "The expert contacted the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC), the organization mentioned in the ALEC report as the source of the data. However, RIPEC stated that they could not find any reports going back to the mid-1990s that contained the mentioned statistics. This inability to locate the data casts further doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison difficulties": "The expert also consulted the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to obtain independent data for comparison. However, the BLS spokesperson explained that comparing public and private sector jobs is challenging due to differences in job types and educational requirements. The mix of occupations and the presence of high-paying jobs like police, fire, and teachers in the public sector make direct comparisons with the private sector problematic.", "Lack of consistent data reporting": "The BLS spokesperson further highlighted that the bureau does not routinely report such specific pay statistics for the reasons mentioned above. This lack of consistent data reporting adds to the difficulty of verifying the claim and raises questions about the reliability of the information presented."}
