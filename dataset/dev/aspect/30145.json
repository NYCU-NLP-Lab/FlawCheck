{"Discrepancy in view counts": "The expert noted that the TikTok video claiming to show the contestant's unfortunate letter choice had over 3.3 million views, while the various versions of the same video on YouTube had significantly lower view counts. This suggested that the TikTok video gained popularity due to its viral nature rather than its authenticity.", "Lack of news coverage": "The expert found no news stories reporting on the contestant's letter choice, which would have been expected if it had actually occurred on the show. This absence of media coverage further cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Unavailability of interviews or admissions": "Despite claims made by a YouTube commenter about an interview with the person who edited the video, the expert was unable to find any such interview or locate the person responsible for the video's editing. This lack of corroborating evidence weakened the credibility of the claim.", "Analysis by a former winner": "A former \"Wheel of Fortune\" winner named Robert Santoli provided insights that supported the conclusion that the video was fake. Santoli identified the original episode from which the video's background and puzzle elements were taken, explaining how footage from different rounds was combined. His analysis provided concrete evidence that the \"Clam Digger\" video was fabricated."}
