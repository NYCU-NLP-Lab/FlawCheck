This lack of evidence suggests that the claim may not be authentic.", "State policies on driver": "s licenses: The expert's verdict highlights that twelve states, including some solidly Democratic-leaning ones, offer driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. However, these licenses cannot be used for federal identification purposes. This information contradicts Trump's claim that Democrats want to give driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.", "Expert opinion": "The expert's verdict includes a quote from Alex Nowrasteh, a policy analyst, who states that he has never heard of any plan to give illegal immigrants cars at taxpayer expense. This expert opinion adds weight to the argument that the claim is not authentic."}
