{"Current federal law already prohibits most new immigrants from accessing federal public assistance programs for five years": "so it is misleading to suggest that all immigrants can immediately collect welfare under the RAISE Act.", "There are exceptions to the current law": "such as for children and pregnant women, which means that many new immigrants would still be eligible for public assistance under the proposed bill.", "The RAISE Act seeks to tighten the eligibility requirements for some new immigrants": "but it does not completely prevent them from collecting welfare.", "The claim made by President Trump that the RAISE Act prevents new immigrants from collecting welfare is incorrect": "as the proposed legislation would have minimal impact on the ability of new immigrants to access public assistance."}
