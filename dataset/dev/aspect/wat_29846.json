{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that Joe Biden and Barack Obama directly participated in a plot to have SEAL Team 6 murdered. Multiple investigations have concluded that the deaths of the SEAL Team members were the result of a Taliban attack, not a conspiracy orchestrated by the Obama administration.", "Conspiracy theory origins": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim has roots in a QAnon-supported conspiracy theory about the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya. This context is important to understand the baseless nature of the claim and its association with unfounded conspiracy theories.", "Source credibility": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim was shared by a now-suspended Twitter account and originated from a conservative political website called DJHJ Media. The credibility of these sources may be questionable, as the website is owned by a Trump supporter and the Twitter account was created relatively recently.", "Unsubstantiated whistleblower claims": "The expert's verdict mentions that the article shared in the post that Trump retweeted was based on an interview with Allan Harrow Parrot, who is described as a \"CIA whistleblower.\" However, there is no evidence or corroboration provided to support Parrot's claims, making them unsubstantiated and lacking credibility."}
