{"Joint statement from federal": "state, and local officials: A group of officials overseeing the nation's voting system issued a joint statement stating that there was no evidence of any voting system deleting or losing votes, changing votes, or being compromised. This statement was distributed by the federal government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, emphasizing the security and integrity of the recent election.", "Lack of evidence from a research firm": "A research firm mentioned in similar allegations to Trump's claim stated that they had no evidence of irregularities with votes and had not conducted any research on the subject. This suggests that there is no credible evidence supporting the claim of Dominion Voting Systems deleting millions of Trump votes.", "Expert opinion from voting machine experts": "Voting machine experts stated that the actions suggested by Trump, such as the deletion of votes, could not have been detected in the time that has elapsed since the election. This expert opinion reinforces the lack of credibility in the claim made by Trump.", "Source of the claim": "The claim made by Trump can be traced back to an anonymous post on a pro-Trump message board. This raises doubts about the legitimacy and reliability of the claim, as it lacks transparency and verifiable evidence."}
