{"The claim was based on a statement made by newspaper columnist and TV pundit George Will": "who argued that the complexity of the tax code and its 4 million words is the reason why America has more people employed as tax preparers (1.2 million) than as police and firefighters.", "The National Taxpayer Advocate": "s annual report to Congress also acknowledged the complexity of the tax code and stated that it favors taxpayers who can afford expensive tax advice, while discriminating against those who cannot.", "The expert fact": "checkers reached out to George Will for comment but did not receive a response. They traced the source of the claim to a U.S. News & World Report article from 2012, which cited an Internal Revenue Service report from 2007 that mentioned between 900,000 and 1.2 million people were \"preparing tax returns for a fee.\"", "The fact": "checkers obtained more recent estimates from the IRS and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In 2017, the IRS reported about 713,448 people with preparer tax identification numbers (PTINs), the closest estimate to the number of people employed as tax preparers that year. On the other hand, the BLS counted 657,690 police and sheriff's patrol officers and 315,910 firefighters. When these numbers were compared, it was found that the combined number of police officers and firefighters exceeded the number of tax preparers by 260,152 people."}
