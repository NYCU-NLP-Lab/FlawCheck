{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the original claim did not cite any manufacturer, disaster expert, or government agency that had vetted the advice. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory expert opinion": "The owner of an appliance repair shop, Ralph Feldkamp, stated that dishwashers do not keep water out and are not a good place to store valuables during a flood. This contradictory expert opinion undermines the claim's credibility.", "Risk of flooding": "The expert's verdict mentions that if a home is flooded, the dishwasher will also be flooded. This indicates that storing valuables in a dishwasher during a flood is not a reliable solution, as the valuables would be at risk of water damage.", "Potential damage from extreme wind": "The expert's verdict highlights that extreme wind can cause damage to the interior of a residence, including appliances like dishwashers. If the dishwasher is damaged during a storm, the valuables stored inside would be at risk of being lost or damaged."}
