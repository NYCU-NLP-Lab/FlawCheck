{"The U": "S. exported 401,000 barrels of crude oil per day in July 2014, primarily to Canada. However, this is a small portion compared to the almost 8.8 million barrels of crude oil produced daily in the U.S. during that month.", "The ban covers the majority of crude oil produced in the U": "S., but there are exemptions. For example, crude exports to Canada are allowed as long as the oil is used within Canada. Additionally, some heavy crude produced in California is not subject to the ban.", "Expert opinions from Barry DuVal": "president and CEO of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Kenneth B. Medlock, senior director at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University, and Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow at the Energy Security and Climate Initiative at the Brookings Institution, all support the claim that the U.S. is the only major oil-producing nation with a self-imposed ban on exporting raw crude oil."}
