{"The presence of masks": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim suggests that no one in the video, including the police officers, George Floyd, or the bystanders, is wearing a mask. However, the expert counters this by providing evidence from various sources, such as security footage and cell phone videos, which clearly show individuals wearing masks at different points in the recording.", "Minneapolis police mask mandate": "The expert mentions that the claim questions why the police department doesn't have a mask mandate, implying that this is evidence of the video being filmed before COVID-19. However, the expert clarifies that Minneapolis police have been expected to wear masks since April, although there may be some exceptions due to discomfort or personal preferences.", "Inconsistent mask use": "The expert acknowledges that mask use has been inconsistent across the United States, including among police officers. This aspect is important to consider as it challenges the assumption that all individuals should be wearing masks in the video, as claimed.", "Corroborating video evidence": "The expert refers to additional video footage from various sources, such as security cameras and emergency services recordings, which provide a timeline of events leading up to George Floyd's death. This corroborating evidence supports the fact that the video was filmed during the COVID-19 pandemic, contradicting the claim's assertion that it was filmed before the outbreak."}
