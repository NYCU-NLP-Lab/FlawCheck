{"The claim was debunked by a fake news site called True Trumpers": "which published a sensational headline stating that Marla Maples died in a plane crash. This source was identified as unreliable and known for spreading false information.", "The authenticity of the claim was questioned due to the lack of any legitimate news sources reporting on the alleged plane crash": "If such an event had occurred, it would have made worldwide news, but no credible sources could be found to support the claim.", "The photograph used to accompany the claim was proven to be misleading": "It was actually a picture from a plane crash that occurred in July 1997 at Newark International Airport, involving a Federal Express plane. The image was used out of context to create a false narrative.", "Prior to the claim about Marla Maples": "True Trumpers had also falsely reported the deaths of Vice-President Mike Pence and 23 staffers in a similar plane crash in March 2017. This pattern of spreading false information further undermined the credibility of the claim."}
