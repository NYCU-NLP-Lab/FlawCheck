{"Alex Jones": "admission: The expert's verdict mentions that Texas-based radio show host Alex Jones admitted during a child custody hearing that he has smoked cannabis, which is a violation of state law. This admission serves as evidence to support the claim that police officers also smoke marijuana once a year as part of their jobs.", "Comparison to law enforcement": "Jones argued that he only smoked marijuana once a year, just like law enforcement officers do. This comparison implies that police officers engage in similar behavior, further reinforcing the claim.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that efforts were made to contact Jones to understand the basis of his claim, but no response was received. Additionally, law enforcement agencies suggested that Jones was making unsubstantiated claims. This lack of evidence weakens the authenticity of the claim.", "Scientific research on marijuana potency": "The expert's verdict cites a study conducted by researchers at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi, which found that THC concentrations in marijuana had increased by about 171 percent over a 16-year period. While this research supports the notion of increasing potency, there is no indication that police officers smoke marijuana to determine its strength. This highlights the absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim."}
