{"The claim is based on a statement made by Florida Governor Rick Scott": "who has a history of opposing the nation's health care law and has voiced concerns about increased premiums due to the creation of health exchanges.", "The claim references a 2009 report from the Congressional Budget Office": "CBO), a nonpartisan research agency, which examined the impact of the law on health care premiums for individuals purchasing insurance through employer-based group markets and for individuals.", "The CBO report does state that average premiums per policy in the individual market would increase by 10 percent to 13 percent in 2016 compared to before the law took effect": "Specifically, for families, the increase would be around $2,100, which aligns with Governor Scott's claim.", "However": "the claim fails to acknowledge that more than half of the individuals seeking coverage in 2016 would be eligible for subsidies that would significantly reduce their premiums by 50 to 60 percent. This aspect highlights the potential impact of subsidies in mitigating the projected premium increases mentioned in the CBO report."}
