{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the original claim was published on various blogs without providing substantial evidence to support the assertion that Coca-Cola and Nestle were negotiating with the Brazilian government to privatize the Guarani Aquifer.", "Citing an anonymous source": "The claim references a Brazilian blog, Correido do Brasil, which reported that a \"senior official\" at the Brazilian National Water Agency warned about ongoing negotiations between the government and the two companies. However, the article did not provide any further information or corroboration for this anonymous source's allegation.", "Denial by Coca": "Cola and Nestle: Both Coca-Cola and Nestle were contacted for comment, and they denied the allegations. Coca-Cola's Brazilian division stated that they were not negotiating with any government for the exploitation of the Guarani Aquifer, emphasizing their commitment to water as a precious resource. Nestle also denied any plans to extract water from the aquifer and stated their commitment to water stewardship.", "Questioning the credibility of sources": "Brazilian journalists and fact-checking site Boatos have questioned the credibility of the claim and the sources supporting it. Boatos rated the claim as false in both 2016 and 2018. The claim also appeared on an online petition platform, Avaaz.org, but it was confirmed that the petition was not generated by the organization and may have been created by an individual."}
