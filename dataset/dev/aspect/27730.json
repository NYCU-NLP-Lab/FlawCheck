{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that the claim made by President Donald Trump falsely states that the Democratic proposal, referred to as \"Medicare for All,\" would cost an astonishing $32.6 trillion during its first 10 years.", "The expert points out that the claim fails to consider the offsetting savings in health care costs for others": "Under the proposed plan, as the expense of health care shifts entirely to the federal government, people, employers, and state governments would pay less for health care. Therefore, while the cost to the federal government might be $32 trillion, the overall health expenditures would not increase by that amount. Supporters argue that it would result in overall net savings.", "The expert mentions that the": "32.6 trillion cost estimate is based on an analysis by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University of the Medicare for All Act, as introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders. This analysis specifically focuses on the cost to the federal government over the first 10 years of full implementation.", "The expert emphasizes that the true": "cost\" of the plan should be evaluated based on the increase or decrease in overall health care expenditures. Proponents of Medicare for All argue that the elimination of private health insurance and the absorption of all health care costs by the government would eliminate the need for individuals to pay for private health insurance premiums, copays, deductibles, and other costs associated with employer plans."}
