{"Lack of specific details": "The expert mentions that it is hard to find a lot of information about the referenced arson. The story does not provide specific details such as the date of the fire or the extent of the damage caused.", "Reliance on secondary sources": "The story from Conservative Daily Post relies on a Breitbart report, which in turn relies on a Televisa News story. This indicates that the information presented in the claim is not directly verified or sourced.", "Inconsistencies in the narrative": "The Televisa News story mentioned in the expert's verdict states that the fire at the immigration checkpoint was caused by migrants who had already left the caravan and were detained by Mexican officials. This contradicts the claim that the migrants in the caravan were responsible for the violence.", "Use of stock image": "The photograph accompanying the Conservative Daily Post story is a stock image found on Shutterstock and other stock image sites. This raises questions about the authenticity and accuracy of the claim, as it does not provide an actual image of the incident described."}
