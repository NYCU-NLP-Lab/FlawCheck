{"Comparison of the photos": "The expert compared the photos being circulated on social media with other known photos related to the incident. They found that the pictures being shared were from an entirely different case, indicating that they were not authentic evidence of the claim.", "Reverse image search": "The expert performed a reverse image search on the photos to trace their origin. This search led them to a tweet dated August 11, 2020, which claimed that the photos were from a different location in Bihar. This finding further discredited the authenticity of the claim.", "Keyword search": "The expert conducted a keyword search to find relevant news articles or reports related to the incident. They came across a News18 report dated July 21, 2020, which mentioned a similar case of a woman's body found in a well in Vaishali, Bihar. This indicated that the photos being shared were not recent and not related to the claim.", "Verification of social media sources": "The expert analyzed the sources of the claim, which were Twitter users @jokerrr577 and @shivamvijay_. They found that these users had shared the photos with captions linking them to the incident.
