{"The claim is backed up by a specific reference to Senate Roll Call Vote 264": "Oct. 20, 2005, which was a vote on a Highway Reauthorization Bill that included funding for the Bridge to Nowhere.", "The bill in question passed with overwhelming bipartisan support": "with a vote of 93-1, indicating that Nelson was not the sole supporter of the earmark.", "The Bridge to Nowhere project was a small fraction": "less than a tenth of 1 percent) of the total spending in the bill, suggesting that it may not have been a primary focus or priority for Nelson.", "There is no evidence prior to the vote that Nelson had a specific opinion about the Alaska bridge": "indicating that his support for the bill may have been based on other factors or considerations."}
