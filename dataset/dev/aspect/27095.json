{"Lack of source data or evidence": "The claim did not provide any source data or other resources to support the claim that 179 children had disappeared in the first 45 days of 2017 in Indiana. This made it difficult for readers to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Discrepancy with official records": "The claim contradicted a recent report by a local news outlet, which stated that only six missing children had been recorded by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) in Indiana for all of 2017. This inconsistency raised doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Limited timeframe": "The claim focused on a specific 45-day period in 2017, which seemed unusual considering that missing children cases are typically reported throughout the year. This raised questions about the statistical reality of such a significant increase in abductions within a short timeframe.", "Lack of confirmation from authorities": "The expert contacted the Indiana State Police, who were unaware of nearly 200 children going missing in Indiana alone in the specified timeframe. The absence of confirmation from official authorities further cast doubt on the credibility of the claim."}
