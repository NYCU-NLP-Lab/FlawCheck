{"The false assertion that a block of salt with a light bulb inserted inside will naturally emit negative ions": "2. The interplay between the salt attracting water molecules from the air and the heat from the light evaporating that water, as described in a non-peer-reviewed paper.", "The claim that the interplay between water and salt in the process of evaporation creates negatively charged ions": "4. The skepticism of a Caltech professor of chemistry, who conducted a scientific experiment using a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer to analyze the ions produced by a salt lamp."}
