{"The claim is based on a statement made by Carlos Curbelo in April 2014 about a GOP budget plan by U": "S. Rep. Paul Ryan, which included proposals to overhaul Medicare.", "Curbelo stated that he would vote for any budget that helps create jobs": "protects Medicare for seniors, and stops piling debt on future generations. However, he also mentioned that he had not fully reviewed the budget plan at that time.", "The claim does not provide any explanation of what it would mean to": "end the Medicare guarantee\" or why Garcia believes that is Curbelo's view.", "Experts argue that while Ryan": "s proposal would bring fundamental changes to Medicare, stating that it completely ends the guarantee is a misleading overstatement, as everyone would still receive some form of insurance."}
