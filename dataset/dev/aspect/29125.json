Braynard compared voter registration lists with U.S. Postal Service change-of-address data to identify potential out-of-state voters.", "Braynard": "s analysis has been strongly criticized by statisticians and election experts for failing to meet scientific standards of evidence. Harvard professor and voting statistics expert Stephen Ansolabehere noted that the report offered no conclusions based on scientifically accepted standards of evidence and contained errors and biases.", "In December": "a Georgia state politician contacted some individuals on Braynard's list and confirmed that they still lived in Georgia, contradicting the claim.
