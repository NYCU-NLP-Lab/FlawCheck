{"McCain": "s plan does include a proposed increase in the tax exemption for dependents, from $3,500 to $7,000, which would benefit families with children or other dependents. Therefore, the claim that McCain offers \"almost nothing for families like yours\" is not entirely accurate.", "The analysis by the Center for American Progress": "cited by the Obama campaign, is based on publicly available corporate profits reported in SEC filings. However, it is acknowledged that these profits may differ from taxable income due to accounting rules, and the accuracy of the analysis cannot be determined without access to corporations' tax returns.", "In contrast to McCain": "s focus on corporate tax reductions, Obama's proposed tax cuts target middle and lower-income individuals and families, including a $500 tax credit for workers to offset payroll taxes and mortgage interest deductions for non-itemizers. This highlights a difference in approach between the two candidates."}
