{"The image in the Facebook post was compared to other images of Sandiaga Uno to verify its authenticity": "A Yandex reverse image search and a Google Images search were conducted to find the original source of the image.", "The date of the Facebook post was verified to ensure it was published before the claimed event took place": "The post was published on March 22, 2019, which matched the timeline of the claim.", "The credibility of the Facebook post was assessed by examining its content": "The post contained a caption that falsely stated Sandiaga Uno was a presidential candidate, when in fact he was a vice-presidential candidate. This discrepancy raised doubts about the accuracy of the post.", "The expert also compared the Facebook post to reliable news sources": "such as AFP and Jakarta Post, to gather additional information about the claim. These sources confirmed that Muhammad Romahurmuziy, the politician allegedly visited by Sandiaga Uno, was indeed detained by Indonesia's anti-corruption agency. However, they did not mention any visit by Uno to Romahurmuziy, indicating that the claim was likely false."}
