{"Historical studies": "The expert mentions that the claim of a link between abortion and breast cancer has its roots in studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. These early studies were ambiguous and could be interpreted to support either side of the abortion issue.", "Authoritative study": "The expert highlights a 1997 study that utilized government-collected data on Danish women born between 1935 and 1978. This study concluded that there was no increased risk of breast cancer from abortions. The findings of this study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), adding credibility to its conclusions.", "Rejection by reputable organizations": "The expert mentions that organizations such as the World Health Organization, U.S. National Cancer Institute, and American Cancer Society now reject the existence of any link between abortion and breast cancer. These organizations have reviewed the scientific evidence and concluded that there is no increased risk.", "Political influence": "The expert discusses the political aspect of the claim, noting that under the socially conservative administration of George W. Bush, the language on a National Cancer Institute fact sheet regarding breast cancer and abortions was changed against the wishes of the organization's scientists. This highlights how political factors can influence the presentation of scientific information."}
