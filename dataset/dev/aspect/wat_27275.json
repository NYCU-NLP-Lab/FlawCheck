{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support President Trump's claims linking Joe Scarborough to the death of his staffer in 2001. The medical examiner's report concluded that the death was accidental, and no evidence has emerged to suggest otherwise.", "Alibi": "The expert's verdict states that Joe Scarborough was in Washington, D.C., approximately 800 miles away, when the death occurred in his district office in Florida. This supports the claim that he could not have been involved in the incident.", "Motive": "The expert's verdict mentions that President Trump had a previously warm relationship with Joe Scarborough and his wife, Mika Brzezinski. However, their criticism of the president has led to him frequently insulting them. This suggests a potential motive for Trump to make baseless accusations against Scarborough.", "Lack of support and response": "The expert's verdict mentions that when asked about the issue, the White House provided no evidence or support for Trump's claims. This lack of response further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
