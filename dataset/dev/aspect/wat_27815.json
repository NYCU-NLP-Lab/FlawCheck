{"The claim that COVID": "19 vaccines have \"experimental technology never before used on humans\" was verified by stating that the first two vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna use new technology called messenger RNA (mRNA) to combat the disease. However, it was clarified that this does not mean safety protocols were bypassed or that sufficient testing was not done. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, for example, has been studied in clinical trials involving about 44,000 people.", "The claim that some COVID": "19 vaccines contain nanochips which can electronically track recipients was debunked by stating that the vaccines do not include microchips for tracking patients. It was further explained that a medical technology company produces prefilled syringes for coronavirus vaccines, which can have an optional chip on the label (not inside the injected dose) to indicate if a dose is expired or counterfeit. These chips do not gather information on patients or track their locations.", "The image shared on Facebook": "making the claim about experimental technology and nanochips in COVID-19 vaccines, was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. This indicates that the claim was subjected to fact-checking and found to be false.", "The expert": "s verdict explicitly states that the claim is false, providing a clear conclusion based on the evidence presented.
