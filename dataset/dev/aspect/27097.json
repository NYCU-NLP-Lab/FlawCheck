{"Collection of pyramid": "shaped mountains in the Ellsworth Range: The presence of pyramid-shaped mountains in Antarctica has been used as evidence to support the claim of an ancient civilization. These mountains have been observed and documented since at least 2016.", "Google Earth satellite imagery": "Recent satellite photos from Google Earth have revealed the existence of three snow-covered pyramids in Antarctica. This visual evidence has surprised scientists and researchers, as it suggests the presence of man-made structures in an area where no civilization has been previously documented.", "Lack of previous research on civilization in Antarctica": "The claim highlights that no previous research or historical records have mentioned the existence of a civilization in Antarctica, let alone one with the capability to construct pyramids. This absence of information adds to the intrigue and potential significance of the discovery.", "Geological history and plate tectonics": "The article mentions the geologic history of Antarctica, including its movement from a position closer to the equator to its current frozen location. While these facts are interesting, they are deemed irrelevant to the claim of an ancient civilization. The article suggests that the mention of geological history is used to distract from the lack of concrete evidence supporting the claim."}
