{"The claim accurately cites several provisions in the coronavirus relief bill": "such as funding for the Kennedy Center, refugee resettlement, PBS, and congressional salaries.", "However": "the claim is misleading in suggesting that the financial needs of a laid-off waitress are not addressed in the bill. In reality, unemployed waitresses would receive a $1,200 check and a $600-a-week increase in unemployment benefits.", "The claim": "s broader depiction of the bill, in which laid-off workers receive nothing at the expense of special interests, is significantly skewed and inaccurate.", "The funding allocated to the Kennedy Center in the bill is justified as it aims to cover expenses like deep cleaning": "maintenance, telework upgrades, employee compensation, rent, and utilities. The Kennedy Center relies on ticket revenue and congressional appropriations, making it a normal recipient of funding through a congressional bill."}
