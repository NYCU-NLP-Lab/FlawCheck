{"The article": "s headline and claim: The expert notes that the article's headline claimed that Costco had made a \"shocking\" change to their return policy. However, upon further investigation, it was found that the claim was not accurate and did not provide proof of customers being \"so mad\" about the alleged change.", "Instagram post discrepancy": "The article embedded an Instagram post showing a Costco Wholesale sign at a checkout register, stating that returns would not be accepted on certain items. However, it was discovered that the Instagram post was from March 18, 2020, indicating that the policy change was not recent as claimed in the article.", "Lack of evidence for customer dissatisfaction": "The expert mentions that the SheFinds story did not provide any concrete evidence or testimonials from customers expressing their dissatisfaction with the alleged policy change. In fact, comments on the cited Instagram post seemed supportive of the announcement, further undermining the claim made in the article.", "Authentic policy change in March 2020": "The expert highlights that while the SheFinds article misrepresented the timing and nature of the policy change, it is true that Costco implemented a policy change in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The actual policy change involved limiting purchases and placing restrictions on high-demand items like toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and other essential products. This discrepancy between the actual policy change and the claim made in the article further undermines its authenticity."}
