{"The expert": "s verdict states that the quote about the business advantage of being an atheist does not appear in Trump's 1987 book, The Art of the Deal. Various digital copies of the book were searched, and no mention of the quote or the word \"atheist\" was found.", "The expert mentions that the New York Times quote in the meme is real and appears on the cover of some editions of The Art of the Deal": "However, the meme excludes the following sentence, which states, \"It's like a fairy tale.\" This omission could potentially misrepresent the context of the quote.", "The expert points out that during the 2016 presidential election": "a similar rumor circulated claiming that Trump identified himself as an atheist. The rumor alleged that Trump had bragged on The Phil Donahue Show in 1989 about his high IQ making it impossible for him not to be an atheist. The expert confirms that this quote is also fake.", "The expert provides additional sources": "such as the New York Times review of The Art of the Deal by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, published on December 7, 1987. The review praises Trump and his book, but the meme selectively quotes only the positive aspects while excluding the sentence that mentions it being like a fairy tale."}
