{"The claim made by U": "S. Rep. Alma Adams about the Trump administration proposing to cut 3 million people from the SNAP program, including children, seniors, and veterans, was verified by examining the proposed changes to \"categorical eligibility\" rules. These changes would affect 3.1 million people currently receiving benefits, according to the USDA's estimates.", "The USDA": "s Food and Nutrition Service department provided insight on the potential impact of the proposed change. They stated that an estimated 673,000 households with seniors and 597,000 households with children are projected to lose benefits.", "The expert reached out to various sources": "including the USDA and other groups that track SNAP beneficiaries, to determine the specific number of veterans that might be affected. However, it was difficult to find a precise number as veteran status does not impact eligibility and is not captured in the caseload data used to analyze the rule.", "The Trump administration views the proposed change as closing a loophole that allows some individuals to abuse the program": "which they believe is intended to be a \"temporary safety net.\" This perspective aligns with the claim made by Rep. Adams about the administration's intention to cut people from SNAP."}
