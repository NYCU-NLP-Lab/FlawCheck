{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that no evidence was found to corroborate the claim that Marie Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million. The claim did not originate from a credible financial news outlet and the websites publishing this information provided no evidence to support the claim.", "Varying estimates": "The claim was accompanied by a wide range of figures regarding Yovanovitch's net worth, including $17 million, $12 million, $6 million, and $3 million. This inconsistency in estimates suggests a lack of credibility and undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Unjustified estimates": "The articles published on websites like Walikali and Gossipgist, which were used to support the claim, did not provide any insight into Yovanovitch's business dealings or investments that could explain her alleged fortune. These articles simply included the estimated net worth without any justification or evidence.", "Rumor without substantiation": "The expert's verdict concludes that the claim of Yovanovitch having a net worth of $17 million (or any other amount) is unsubstantiated and appears to be made up out of thin air. The purpose of this rumor seems to be an attempt to discredit Yovanovitch's testimony before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee."}
