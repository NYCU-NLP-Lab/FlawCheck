{"The number of background checks conducted": "The expert verifies that the claim of 11 million background checks conducted in the last year is a high estimate but is not far off. They provide information from the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics, stating that around 10.4 million background checks were conducted in 2010.", "Number of prosecutions": "The expert confirms that the claim of 42 people being prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record is accurate. They refer to a report by the Regional Justice Information Service, which shows that 44 charges were filed in response to background checks, slightly more than the number mentioned in the claim.", "Local charges and additional prosecutions": "The expert mentions that the number of prosecutions mentioned in the claim does not include local charges in states that conduct their own background checks. They suggest that this is likely to increase the total number of prosecutions.", "Effectiveness of background checks": "The expert discusses the effectiveness of background checks and states that if only 42 people out of 11 million were deterred from legally buying a gun due to a background check, then the claim of background checks being futile may have some accuracy. However, they also mention that the numbers provided do not fully capture the purpose and impact of background checks."}
