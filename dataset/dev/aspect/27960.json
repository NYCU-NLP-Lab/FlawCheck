{"Lack of contextual clues": "The letter lacked any contextual clues that would make it verifiable, such as school letterhead or mention of the school's name or location. This raised doubts about its authenticity.", "Inability to identify the teacher": "Despite efforts to find a math teacher named Adam Hilliker in the U.S., no such individual could be found. This lack of identification added to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Small details indicating potential fabrication": "Some readers pointed out small details that seemed to suggest the letter was phony, such as the similarity between the names \"Adam Hilliker\" and \"Adolf Hitler\" (though this may be a stretch) and the date of April 20, which is Hitler's birthday. These details raised suspicions about the letter's authenticity.", "Visual inconsistencies": "Observers noted that certain portions of the letter appeared to be wrinkled, yet there was no visual distortion in those areas. This inconsistency in the appearance of the letter further cast doubt on its legitimacy."}
