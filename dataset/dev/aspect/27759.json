{"Social media alarms": "The expert noted that in mid-December 2018, social media posts started circulating about a supposed \"door-to-door gun confiscation campaign\" in New Jersey. These posts raised concerns about the state violating the Second Amendment and declaring war on its residents.", "Shared articles": "Users shared web articles with headlines accusing New Jersey officials of conducting house-to-house confiscations. Some of the articles mentioned in the expert's verdict were \"Gun Confiscation Begins in New Jersey\" from American Thinker and \"New Jersey Declares War on Its Residents: Plans Door-To-Door Gun Confiscation Campaign\" from Zero Hedge. However, none of these articles provided evidence of actual door-to-door gun confiscations.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert highlighted that despite the alarming headlines, none of the cited articles presented evidence that the state was currently conducting or planning such confiscations. For example, American Thinker only suggested that a new state law could potentially open the door to such a program.", "Non": "committal response from authorities: The expert mentioned that when Breitbart News reached out to Governor Phil Murphy's press secretary, the New Jersey State Police refused to rule out house-to-house checks but stated that they do not discuss enforcement strategies. This non-committal response added to the uncertainty surrounding the claim."}
