{"The video shows the Littlepage Terrace housing project": "a low-income, housing tax-credit property, which houses zero Syrian refugees and many \"regular\" Americans.", "The video includes identifiable markers of the Littlepage housing complex": "such as a smokestack and buildings that match the structures at Littlepage.", "Mark Taylor": "the CEO of Charleston-Kanawha Housing Authority, confirmed that the video was taken at the Littlepage Terrace project during renovations in May 2017 and that the community houses no Syrian refugees.", "West Virginia has resettled only a small number of Syrian refugees": "and the state took in far less than 321 Syrian refugees in total.
