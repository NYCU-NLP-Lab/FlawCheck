{"Lack of authoritative source": "The fact-checker found that none of the news stories cited an authoritative source for the claim that Phoenix is one of the kidnapping capitals of the world. Despite extensive checking, they couldn't find any evidence to back it up.", "Absence of official statistics": "The FBI and the U.S. National Central Bureau of Interpol, which are responsible for compiling crime statistics, do not have city-based kidnapping data. This lack of official statistics makes it difficult to verify the claim.", "Inconsistent reporting": "Different news organizations reported varying numbers of kidnapping incidents in Phoenix, with some stating over 370 cases in a year. However, these reports did not provide a consistent or reliable source for the data, further raising doubts about the claim's authenticity.", "Time lapse": "The fact-checker notes that the claim was debunked in 2010 but decided to revisit it in 2013. While the passage of three years may have allowed for changes in the crime rates, the expert's verdict still concluded that the claim was incorrect. This aspect highlights the importance of revisiting and reevaluating claims over time to ensure accuracy."}
