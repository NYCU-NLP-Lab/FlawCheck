{"The use of government statistics": "The expert mentioned that Bill O'Reilly cited available government statistics to support his claim. These statistics were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's fatal injury reports database and the FBI's database.", "Incomplete data": "The expert pointed out that the data obtained from these databases may be incomplete. Coroners and physicians are not obligated to detail police involvement in the deaths they encounter, which means that not every death certificate indicates that the death was caused by a law enforcement officer in every jurisdiction. This raises concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the statistics used to verify the claim.", "Data collection methods": "The expert explained that the government statistics used by O'Reilly were primarily obtained from death certificates, demographic information provided by funeral directors, and a violent death reporting system. However, these methods may not capture all instances of police involvement in deaths, as they rely on voluntary reporting and may not include comprehensive information.", "Lack of a complete picture": "The expert emphasized that while O'Reilly's statistics may support his claim to some extent, they do not provide a complete picture of the issue. The expert mentioned that comparing black and white deaths from police killings based solely on these statistics is a \"half-truth\" and may not accurately represent the full extent of the problem."}
