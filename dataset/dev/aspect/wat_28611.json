{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no evidence that the right-wing rant was written by Tim Allen. This was supported by the fact that the post was not found on Allen's official social media accounts and no articles attributed it to him in a search of databases.", "Statement from publicist": "Allen's publicist, Marleah Leslie, explicitly stated that the statement in question was not written by her client. This provided further confirmation that the claim attributing the rant to Tim Allen was false.", "Confusion with another user": "The expert noted that several Facebook posts crediting the rant to Tim Allen appeared after a different user named Tim Allen posted the statement. This suggests that the shared name may have sparked the confusion and led to the false attribution.", "Previous instances of misattribution": "The expert highlighted that similar incidents of viral rants being misattributed to celebrities have occurred in the past. This context helps to reinforce the idea that the claim about Tim Allen writing the right-wing rant is likely false."}
