{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that the claim made by Sen. James Lankford about premiums and costs doubling in a majority of states under Obamacare is problematic in its wording.", "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office": "s analysis of the House-passed Republican health care bill is cited as evidence that 23 million more Americans would be left without insurance by 2026.", "The expert refers to a report released by the office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services": "which compares premiums in 2013 to premiums in 2017. This four-year span is not indicative of premiums doubling in one year, as suggested by the claim.", "The expert points out that the 2017 premium figures used in the report do not take into account the subsidies provided under the Affordable Care Act": "which significantly reduce the out-of-pocket cost for policyholders. Additionally, the comparison between 2013 and 2017 premiums does not consider that plans in 2017 offered more coverage than in 2013."}
