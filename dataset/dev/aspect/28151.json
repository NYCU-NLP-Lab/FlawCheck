{"Comparison of official unemployment rates": "The expert compared the official unemployment rates for different racial groups in the specified age range to verify the claim. They found that while African-American youth unemployment was higher than white and Hispanic youth unemployment, it was not as high as the claim suggested.", "Consideration of different data sources": "The expert examined data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which covers the age range from 16 to 19, to approximate the unemployment rates for the specified age range. They acknowledged that this data was not identical to the claim but still provided a general understanding of the unemployment rates among different racial groups.", "Analysis of alternative research": "The expert referenced research conducted by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a left-of-center think tank, which used a different measurement called U-6. This measurement included not only unemployed workers but also those working part-time or marginally attached to the labor force. The expert considered this alternative data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of labor underutilization among African-American youth.", "Comparison of claim with available evidence": "The expert compared the claim made by Bernie Sanders with the data from both the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the research by EPI. They found that while the claim had some basis in truth regarding the higher unemployment rates for African-American youth, it exaggerated the extent of the disparity compared to white and Hispanic youth unemployment rates."}
