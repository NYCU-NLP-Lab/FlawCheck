{"The number of Americans who depend on Social Security": "The expert verifies that the claim made by Mike Huckabee that \"Sixty million Americans depend on Social Security\" is slightly lower than the actual number, which is 64 million.", "Proportion of seniors depending on Social Security": "The expert confirms that Huckabee's claim that \"one-third of all the seniors in America depend on Social Security for 90 percent of their income\" is accurate. In 2012, Social Security constituted 90 percent or more of income for 36 percent of seniors over the age of 65.", "Definition of income used by the Social Security Administration": "The expert points out that the Social Security Administration's definition of income may not include sporadic sources like money withdrawn from an IRA or 401k. This could lead to discrepancies in the total income considered by the SSA.", "Impact of savings plans on Social Security dependence": "The expert mentions a study from Boston College's Center for Retirement Research, which suggests that excluding savings plans like IRAs and 401ks from the definition of income used by the SSA could result in discrepancies ranging from $18 billion to $220 billion. This implies that the actual dependence on Social Security might be affected by the inclusion or exclusion of these savings plans."}
