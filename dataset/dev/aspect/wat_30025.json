{"The claim is based on a viral image that lists the names of 44 Democratic senators": "with Kamala Harris' name circled in red, and a caption stating that they \"voted to let babies scream until they die if born alive.\"", "The image references SB 311": "the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protections Act, which proposes a uniform obligation on healthcare practitioners to provide medical care to babies born after failed abortion attempts, with potential prison time for violators.", "The effect of the senators": "vote was not to allow doctors and parents to leave babies to die, but to maintain the existing legal status quo, which already recognizes infants as humans protected under the law.", "Senate Republicans framed the bill as": "anti-infanticide legislation\" and argued that it was a choice between leaving infants to die or protecting them under the law, while some Democrats saw it as government overreach and a removal of decision-making power from parents and medical professionals."}
