{"Reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search on the collage of pictures and found that it had been circulating online since December 2016. This helped to determine the origin and timeline of the images.", "Individual image analysis": "The expert examined each image individually and found that two of the images had been used by CNN in their web content. They identified the specific articles and videos where these images were used, providing evidence of their legitimate usage.", "Comparison with other news organizations": "The expert found that the same photos were used by other news organizations, including NBC and Foreign Policy, to cover the same event. This suggests that the images were not manipulated or staged by CNN but were part of a larger coverage of the refugee crisis.", "Lack of evidence for misleading usage": "The expert's search did not find any evidence that CNN used the photos in a misleading way to illustrate any other refugee crisis. There was also no indication that the photos were used in CNN's video content on their cable channel. This lack of evidence supports the authenticity of CNN's usage of the images."}
