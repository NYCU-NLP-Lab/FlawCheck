{"Lack of corroboration": "The expert found no evidence or corroboration to support the claim that Senator John McCain's final words consisted of a foul-mouthed attack on President Donald Trump. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Source credibility": "The claim originated from a Facebook page called \"America Loves Donald Trump,\" which the expert describes as a notorious producer of junk news. The page is run by a political troll who creates fabricated inflammatory memes presented as satire. This raises doubts about the credibility and reliability of the source.", "Contradictory statements": "On August 27, Rick Davis, who ran McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and acted as a family spokesperson, read out a statement prepared by McCain before his death. While the statement made some apparent allusions to President Trump and expressed criticism, it did not contain any foul-mouthed attack as claimed. This contradiction further discredits the authenticity of the claim.", "Sincere comments": "The expert mentions that the fake meme attributing the foul-mouthed attack to McCain was taken seriously by some readers, as evidenced by the sincere comments posted under shared versions of the meme. However, the presence of sincere comments does not validate the claim's authenticity and can be attributed to the readers' beliefs or biases rather than factual evidence."}
