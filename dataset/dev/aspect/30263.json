{"Lack of credible evidence": "The expert's verdict states that they could not find any credible evidence that Stacey Abrams ever made the statement in question. This suggests that there is no reliable source or record of her saying those words.", "Social media sharing": "The expert mentions that the claim was being shared on social media accounts back in October, before Abrams lost her bid for governor. This indicates that the claim may have originated from social media posts rather than a reputable source.", "Abrams": "previous statements: The expert highlights that while Abrams did make comments about wanting to diversify the economy and create renewable energy jobs, she never clarified or made a statement about not needing agriculture because people can buy food from the store. This suggests that the claim misrepresents Abrams' views.", "Lack of response from Abrams": "spokesperson: The expert notes that a spokesperson for Abrams did not immediately respond to an email about the quote. While this doesn't directly prove or disprove the claim, it adds to the lack of evidence supporting it and suggests that Abrams' team may not have been aware of such a statement being made."}
