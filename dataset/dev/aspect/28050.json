{"The claim is supported by a statement made by Jeff Greene": "a candidate in the Florida governor's Democratic primary, who emphasized the correlation between third-grade reading level and future outcomes such as college attendance or incarceration rates.", "A 2010 study conducted by the University of Chicago is cited": "which tracked thousands of students in the Chicago Public School system from third grade through high school graduation. The study found that students who scored below grade level in third grade had lower high school graduation rates compared to those who read at or above grade level.", "The study controlled for demographic factors": "ensuring that the correlation between test scores and graduation rates was not influenced by variables like race or poverty. This aspect highlights the validity of the study's findings and strengthens the connection between third-grade reading level and future academic success.", "Although there are no direct studies linking third": "grade reading level to incarceration, the claim connects it indirectly through a two-step process. It references studies that show high school dropouts are more likely to end up in prison, and it combines this information with the finding that students who score below grade level in third grade have lower high school graduation rates. This indirect connection supports the claim's assertion of a correlation between third-grade reading level and the likelihood of going to prison."}
