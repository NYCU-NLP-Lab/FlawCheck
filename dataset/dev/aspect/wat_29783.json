{"Lack of documented case histories": "The expert found that there were no documented case histories of people having seizures specifically caused by wind turbines. This lack of evidence undermines the claim that the \"health risk of 'flicker' impact created by shadows of blades of turbines poses real and significant health risks, particularly seizures.\"", "Unreliable sources": "The expert discovered that the sources provided by the claim's proponents, including anti-turbine websites, did not offer any solid evidence or documented cases of wind turbines causing seizures. These sources only suggested that turbines \"may\" cause seizures, indicating a lack of concrete evidence.", "Misinterpretation of information": "The expert noted that the claim's proponents, Ehrhardt and Cooney, misrepresented the information found on the WindVigilance.com website. While the website mentioned the potential for flicker to induce photosensitive epilepsy seizures, it did not confirm a \"real\" seizure risk as stated by Ehrhardt and Cooney. This misinterpretation undermines the claim's credibility.", "Inconsistent evidence": "The expert's investigation revealed that while there are reports in medical literature documenting seizures caused by various stimuli, such as cartoons and voices, there is no real evidence linking wind turbines to seizures. This inconsistency in the evidence further weakens the claim's authenticity."}
