{"The claim is based on a report from the federal Centers for Disease Control": "which estimates that law-abiding gun owners stop crimes \"2.5 million times a year.\" This is the initial source of the claim.", "The claim is also supported by a survey conducted by Florida State University criminal justice professor Gary Kleck and his colleague Marc Gertz in 1993": "The survey asked a random sample of adults if they had used a gun in self-protection or in protection of property in the past year, and estimated that Americans use guns for self-protection up to 2.5 million times per year.", "Another aspect that verifies the claim is a 2018 article written by Kleck": "which summarizes the findings of 20 other surveys on defensive gun use. The article suggests that the \"implied number\" of defensive gun use incidents ranges from 600,000 to 6.1 million per year.", "However": "other gun researchers, such as Duke University professor of public policy studies Philip Cook, view Kleck's estimate of 2.5 million as extremely high. Cook argues that the best survey of crime, the National Crime Victimization Survey conducted by the U.S. Justice Department and the Census Bureau, estimates that guns are used in self-defense less than 100,000 times per year. This contrasting viewpoint provides a counterargument to the claim's authenticity."}
