The expert notes that while the statement is subjective, Ryan's reference to \"families facing huge premium increases\" suggests that the increases are impacting individuals and families negatively.", "Attribution to Obamacare": "The fourth aspect examines whether the premium increases can be attributed to Obamacare specifically, as claimed by Ryan.
