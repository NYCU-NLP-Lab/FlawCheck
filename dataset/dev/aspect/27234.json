{"The claim is based on a comparison of average in": "state tuition increases during Jeb Bush's tenure as governor of Florida. The expert verifies this by examining the chart provided by the Florida College Access Network, which shows the percent change in tuition fees from the 1999-2000 fiscal year to 2006-07.", "The expert acknowledges that the governor does not directly set tuition rates in Florida": "but they do sign off on the final budget and can veto an increase. However, the Florida Democratic Party's claim focuses on Bush \"overseeing\" the increases, implying his involvement in the overall education overhaul.", "The expert notes that the Board of Regents": "which governed the State University System, was dissolved during Bush's tenure. This suggests that the changes in tuition fees may have been influenced by the restructuring of the education system, rather than solely by Bush's actions.", "The expert also mentions that if the comparison of tuition numbers is expanded to include the fiscal year before Bush took office": "the percent change in tuition fees would be even higher. This highlights the need to consider a broader timeframe when evaluating the claim's accuracy."}
