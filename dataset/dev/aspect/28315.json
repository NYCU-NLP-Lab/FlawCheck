{"Rep": "Joaquin Castro's tweet: The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from a tweet by Rep. Joaquin Castro, where he questioned the decision to grant funds to the anti-abortion group and made the \"sewer\" claim about the group's director. This tweet serves as the initial source of the claim.", "Lack of scientific evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that HIV is primarily spread through sexual contact, sharing needles, or other direct means of transmission. The federal website focused on AIDS states that the virus does not survive long outside the human body and cannot reproduce outside a human host. There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that HIV can be spread through the sewer system.", "News stories and scrutiny": "The expert's verdict mentions that news stories from summer 2016, including one from the Austin American-Statesman, reported on Carol Everett, the chief executive of the anti-abortion group. Everett came under scrutiny for suggesting during a fetal tissue disposal hearing that sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, could be transmitted through the sewer system. This scrutiny adds to the context surrounding the claim.", "Carol Everett": "s clarification: The expert's verdict includes Carol Everett's response to the claim. Everett acknowledges that her remarks about HIV were a \"stupid mistake\" and that she regretted not making her point clearly. She clarifies that she was referring to the disposal of fetal remains into the sewer system, rather than the transmission of STDs. This clarification provides insight into the intent behind her statement and further emphasizes the lack of authenticity in the claim."}
