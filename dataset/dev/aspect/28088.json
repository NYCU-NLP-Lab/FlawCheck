{"The expert examined the statement made by Hillary Clinton during a town hall campaign event in Keene": "N.H., on Oct 16, 2015, where she was asked about her support for a national gun buyback program similar to Australia's.", "The expert verified the accuracy of the claim by reviewing a tape of the event": "where Clinton acknowledged the Australian buyback program and stated that it would be worth considering implementing a similar program on a national level in the United States.", "The expert also investigated the context of the Australian buyback program": "which was implemented after a mass shooting in Tasmania in 1996. The program involved a one-year grace period for gun owners to sell their firearms to the government at fair-market prices, with strict penalties for those who did not comply.", "Additionally": "the expert considered the response from the NRA and other pro-gun groups, who interpreted Clinton's statement as supporting a confiscation program rather than a voluntary buyback program, leading to a debate over the implications of her remarks."}
