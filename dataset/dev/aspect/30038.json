{"Hegar": "s statement: The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was made by Republican Glenn Hegar, who stated that \"the average taxpayer will see the equivalent of a 2 percent pay raise as a result of low fuel prices.\" This is the initial aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Economist magazine article": "Hegar's spokesperson Chris Bryan cited a December 2014 news story in the Economist magazine to support the claim. The article mentioned that a $40 price cut in oil would shift $1.3 trillion from producers to consumers, and the typical American motorist might be $800 a year better off, which is equivalent to a 2% pay raise. However, the magazine did not provide further details on how these figures were calculated.", "James Hamilton": "s analysis: The expert also consulted economist James Hamilton, who stated in a blog post that lower gas prices would put an extra $108 billion into U.S. consumers' pockets, resulting in a nearly 0.8% increase in disposable personal income. Hamilton further explained that if gasoline prices remained the same and the same number of gallons were bought as the previous year, there would be an additional $160 billion to spend on other items, equivalent to almost $1,400 per household.", "Comparison with Census Bureau estimates": "The expert compared Hamilton's bottom-line figure of $1,400 per household to the median income estimates provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. While the verdict does not explicitly mention the outcome of this comparison, it suggests that this aspect was used to verify the claim's authenticity."}
