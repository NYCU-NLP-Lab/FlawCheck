{"Verification of the claim": "The expert would have analyzed the claim made in the ad, which states that \"every day, 13,000 more people have been put on food stamps since President Obama took full control of Washington.\" This claim would have been fact-checked and verified using available data and statistics.", "Examination of the term": "food stamps\": The expert would have clarified that the term \"food stamps\" refers to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which has been officially known as SNAP since October 2008. This clarification ensures that the claim is accurately understood and evaluated.", "Analysis of the average rate of people joining food stamps": "Instead of focusing on the literal number of 13,000 people joining food stamps every day, the expert would have examined the average rate of Americans joining food stamps over a three-year period. This analysis helps determine whether the claim's number is close to the actual average rate.", "Assessment of the numbers and attribution of credit or blame": "The expert would have examined the data from January 2009 and February 2009 to compare the number of Americans receiving food stamp benefits before and after President Obama took office. This assessment would help determine the accuracy of the claim and whether it is fair to attribute credit or blame to President Obama for the increase in food stamp recipients."}
