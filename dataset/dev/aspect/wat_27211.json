{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the Trump campaign did not provide any evidence or response when asked about the claim regarding the 9/11 terrorists' friends and family leaving before the attacks. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradiction with 9": "11 Commission report: The 9/11 Commission report, which is considered a comprehensive investigation into the terrorist attacks, states that none of the hijackers had a wife, girlfriend, or family member in the United States before the attacks. This contradicts Trump's claim and further questions its authenticity.", "Limited number of married hijackers": "The expert's verdict mentions that only two out of the 19 hijackers were married, and only one had a girlfriend. This limited number of hijackers with personal relationships raises doubts about the claim that the terrorists' friends, family, and girlfriends were sent back to Saudi Arabia.", "Uncertain whereabouts of wives": "Philip D. Zelikow, the executive director of the 9/11 Commission, mentioned that the commission did not have specific information about the whereabouts of the hijackers' wives, whether in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, or elsewhere in the Middle East. This uncertainty adds another layer of doubt to the claim's authenticity."}
