{"The claim is supported by a statement from Houston businessman Farouk Shami": "who states that when they go to vote, they are asked for a driver's license to verify their voter and citizen status in the state of Texas.", "The claim is further supported by Vince Leibowitz": "Shami's campaign director and senior strategist, who confirms that Harris County, Texas, implemented a computerized system in 2008 where poll workers swiped driver's licenses instead of checking voter registration cards during the early voting period.", "However": "Hector DeLeon, director of communications at the Harris County Clerk's office, clarifies that voters are not required to show their licenses, and the clerk's office does not push one type of document over the other. The use of driver's licenses is just an option for voters who prefer to use an ID or license instead of their voter registration card.", "According to state law": "voters are not required to show a photo ID during early voting or on election day. If a voter doesn't have their voter card but their registration is still current, they can sign an affidavit at the polls and provide one of seven documents, including a driver's license, utility bill, bank statement, or paycheck, that shows their name and address."}
