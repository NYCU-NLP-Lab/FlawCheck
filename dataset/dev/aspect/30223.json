{"The expert": "Matthew Dowd, declared that Donald Trump has led nationally in every single poll for more than two months and has also led every single state, including favorite-son states like Florida, where he leads Jeb Bush. This aspect verifies the claim that any Republican who has led for two months and led every state has won the GOP nomination.", "The fact": "checkers wanted to verify Dowd's statement by examining historical polling data. However, Dowd did not provide any hard data to support his claim. This aspect highlights the lack of concrete evidence to substantiate the authenticity of the claim.", "Despite the difficulty in finding comprehensive state polls for early elections": "the fact-checkers managed to find some data from sources like the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, Polling Report, Selzer and Company, the Granite State Poll, the Odum Institute, 538.com, and political scientist Martin Cohen at James Madison University. This aspect showcases the effort made to gather available data and analyze it.", "After examining the available data": "the fact-checkers found that in three elections (Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, and George W. Bush), the pattern identified by Dowd roughly held up. These candidates won the pre-September polling trifecta and went on to secure the GOP nomination. This aspect confirms that there is some historical basis for Dowd's claim, although it may not be applicable to every election."}
