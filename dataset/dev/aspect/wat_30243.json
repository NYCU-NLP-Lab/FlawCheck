It specifically mentions that no other city of its size gets by without a local tax of some kind.", "State restrictions on local tax options": "The expert's analysis highlights the state's limitations on local governments in Wisconsin to levy income and sales taxes. It mentions that Wisconsin generally provides aid to local governments through shared revenue but does not allow them to levy these taxes themselves, except for certain exceptions like a half-cent \"piggyback\" sales tax and stadium districts.", "Proposal for a county sales tax increase": "The expert's verdict mentions that Milwaukee-area leaders are pushing for a 1% county sales tax increase, which could generate up to $160 million per year.
