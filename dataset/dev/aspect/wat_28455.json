{"The image was published on Weibo on February 3": "2021, with a Chinese-language caption identifying the person in the photo as Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of the Burmese army.", "The claim states that the photo shows Min Aung Hlaing standing on a stool for the photo": "implying his short stature. However, the image was found to be doctored through a reverse image search and a comparison with a similar photo published by The Irrawaddy, a Myanmar news website, which clearly shows Min Aung Hlaing without a stool.", "The Myanmar military detained Aung San Suu Kyi and other NLD party leaders in a coup on February 1": "2021, giving General Min Aung Hlaing extensive powers and effectively returning the country to military rule. This context supports the claim that Min Aung Hlaing is the person in the photo.", "International and local observers": "as well as Myanmar's own election monitor, reported no major issues of voter fraud during the November election, contradicting Min Aung Hlaing's justification for the coup. This information adds credibility to the claim that the photo is being used to mislead and manipulate public opinion."}
