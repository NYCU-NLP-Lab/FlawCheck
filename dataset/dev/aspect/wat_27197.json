{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that President Trump provided no evidence to support his claim that the Obama administration tried multiple times to meet with Kim Jong Un. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Testimony from Obama administration officials": "Former deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes and former director of national intelligence James Clapper both denied the claim, stating that Obama never sought a meeting with Kim. Their testimonies provide counter-evidence against the claim.", "Expert opinion": "General Michael Hayden, who served as director of the CIA during the Obama administration, dismissed Trump's claim as \"horseshit\" on Twitter. This expert opinion adds weight to the argument against the claim's authenticity.", "Obama": "s previous statements: The expert's verdict mentions that while Obama did express willingness to meet with leaders of enemy nations without preconditions during a debate in 2008, this does not support Trump's claim that Obama actively sought meetings with Kim Jong Un. This contradiction in Obama's previous statements weakens the credibility of Trump's claim."}
