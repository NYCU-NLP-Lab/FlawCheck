{"Comparison of unemployment rates": "The expert compared the unemployment rates of 1982 and 2010 to verify the claim. They found that the numbers were remarkably similar, with the unemployment rate standing at 9.8 percent in 1982 and 9.6 percent in 2010.", "Timing of peak unemployment": "The expert pointed out that in 1982, the unemployment rate only peaked at \"well over 10 percent\" in October, after the midterm elections. This suggests that voters may not have been aware of the full extent of unemployment when casting their votes.", "Duration of unemployment": "The expert highlighted a difference in the average duration of unemployment between 1982 and 2010. They noted that in 2010, the median length of unemployment was longer than in 1982, indicating a potentially more challenging job market.", "Impact on election outcomes": "While not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, the comparison between Reagan and Obama's approval ratings and election outcomes could be considered as an aspect employed to verify the claim. The expert mentioned that Reagan's approval ratings took a hit during the recession but he went on to win a landslide re-election victory. This suggests that the claim of Obama's predicament being similar to Reagan's could be plausible, at least in terms of the potential for a turnaround in approval ratings and election outcomes."}
