{"The expert": "s verdict mentions that studies have shown that immigrants, regardless of nationality or legal status, are less likely to commit violent crimes or be incarcerated compared to the native population. This indicates that there is statistical evidence supporting the claim that Mexican immigrants are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens.", "The expert refers to a report by the American Immigration Council": "a pro-immigrant nonprofit organization, which analyzed data from the Census' 2010 American Community Survey. The report found that the incarceration rate for immigrant males between 18 and 39 years old was 1.6 percent, compared to 3.3 percent for the native-born population. This data further supports the claim.", "The report also highlights that the incarceration rates of young": "less educated Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan men, who make up a significant portion of the unauthorized immigrant population, are significantly lower than those of native-born young men without a high-school diploma. Specifically, the incarceration rate for Mexican men ages 18 to 39 in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group. This specific demographic data strengthens the claim's authenticity.", "The expert mentions that immigrants": "especially unauthorized immigrants, are motivated to avoid trouble with the police due to the risk of deportation. This motivation, combined with the statistical evidence of lower crime rates among immigrants, further supports the claim that Mexican immigrants are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens."}
