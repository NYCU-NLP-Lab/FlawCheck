{"The claim is based on the fact that President Obama": "s lawsuit argues that it is unconstitutional for Ohio to allow servicemen and women extended early voting privileges during the state's early voting period.", "The expert": "s verdict also highlights the Republican-controlled Ohio state government's law passed last year that would have reduced the time frame for early voting, eliminated most weekend voting hours, and banned early voting on the weekend before elections. Democrats argued that this was an attempt to cut turnout among African-Americans who vote after church, a demographic likely to vote for Obama.", "The Obama campaign": "s lawsuit against Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted is mentioned, which demands that in-person voting be allowed during the three-day weekend before elections. The lawsuit argues that all Ohio voters should be permitted to cast ballots that weekend, similar to members of the U.S. military. The complaint alleges that Ohio's legislature failed to justify the disparate treatment between military and nonmilitary voters, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution."}
