{"Comparison to historical train schedules": "The expert compared the proposed travel time of the 3C Corridor train to the travel time of a New York Central train in 1935. By examining the historical train timetable, they were able to verify the claim's statement that the 3C Corridor train would have taken longer.", "Reference to Amtrak feasibility report": "The expert referred to a year-old feasibility report on the proposed Cleveland-to-Columbus-to-Cincinnati Amtrak service. This report likely contained information and schedules that were used as a basis for the claim, providing evidence to support or verify the claim's statement.", "Confirmation of the proposed schedule": "The expert confirmed that the proposed schedule for the 3C Corridor train, as outlined in the Amtrak feasibility report and included in Ohio's application for the federal grant, indicated a travel time of 6-1/2 hours for the Cleveland to Cincinnati trip. This confirmation adds credibility to the claim's statement about the longer travel time.", "Ohio Department of Transportation": "s revised estimate: The expert mentioned that the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) provided a revised estimate for the 3C Corridor train's average speed, shortening the travel time to 5 hours 12 minutes. However, the expert implies that this revised estimate may not be entirely accurate or reliable, suggesting that the claim's statement about the longer travel time still holds true."}
