{"Lack of evidence": "Health experts have stated that there is no evidence to support the claim that wearing standard masks, such as surgical masks or fabric masks, can cause fungal lung infections.", "Debunked claims": "Previous fact checks have debunked similar claims that wearing masks can lead to health problems, such as decreased oxygen intake, increased toxin inhalation, and shut down of the immune system. These claims have been rated as false.", "Expert opinions": "Regional, statewide, and national experts have been consulted, and they have found no supporting evidence for the claim. Spokespersons from UC Davis Health and ACEP have stated that they have not seen cases of fungal lung infections related to mask usage.", "Limited risk from CO2": "Experts have mentioned that the prolonged use of N95 respirator masks can potentially increase blood CO2 levels for individuals with breathing problems. However, ordinary cloth or surgical masks pose little to no risk of increased CO2 levels."}
