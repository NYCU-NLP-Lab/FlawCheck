{"Attribution": "The expert's verdict highlights the importance of verifying the authorship of the claim. In this case, it was found that syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer was not the author, despite being widely attributed to him.", "Timeline of circulation": "The expert's investigation traced the circulation of the claim over time, noting its initial appearance in October 2015 and subsequent variations with different attributions. This timeline helps establish the claim's origin and potential credibility.", "Lack of credible iterations": "The expert's research revealed that credible versions of the claim, specifically credited to Charles Krauthammer, could not be found. This indicates a lack of reliable sources supporting the authenticity of the claim.", "Similarity to previous content": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim bears resemblance to a previous blog post from April 2015 titled \"The Clinton Foundation as a money-laundering scheme.\" This similarity suggests that the claim may have been a reiteration or adaptation of existing content, rather than an original piece of information."}
