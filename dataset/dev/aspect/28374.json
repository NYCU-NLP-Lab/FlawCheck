{"Lack of jobs for young": "childless adults: The expert's verdict mentions that a lack of job opportunities for young adults in their early 20s has contributed to an increase in \"disconnected youths\" who are neither working nor in school.", "Congressional hearings and reports": "The expert's verdict highlights that concerns about disconnected youths have been raised since 2007, when Congress held hearings on the issue. Additionally, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service conducted a report on disconnected youths in 2009, emphasizing the difficulties they face in gaining the skills and knowledge needed for self-sufficiency.", "Declines in employment and college enrollment rates": "The expert's verdict mentions that people aged 16 to 24 experienced the steepest declines in employment from 2000 to 2010. Furthermore, the liberal Economic Policy Institute's report states that college enrollment rates have dropped substantially since 2012, suggesting that young adults may not be able to rely on education as a means of sheltering from unemployment.", "Absence of specific national statistics": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that there are no national statistics specifically for the group of young, childless adults aged 21 to 25 that U.S. House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan cited in his claim. This absence of specific data makes it challenging to determine the exact percentage of young adults who are not working or seeking employment."}
