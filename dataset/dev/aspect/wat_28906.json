{"Multiple tweets and social media posts claiming that the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel airport in Ahmedabad has been renamed to Adani Airports": "2. Confirmation from the Airport Authority of India (AAI) that they handed over the operations of the airport to Adani on November 6, 2020.", "Lack of news reports or official announcements stating that the name of the airport has been changed": "4. Visual evidence in the form of a video report showing signboards and hoardings at the airport displaying the words 'Adani | Airports', but the name of the airport still reading 'Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport'."}
