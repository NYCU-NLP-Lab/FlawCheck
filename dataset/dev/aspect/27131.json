{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that Bill Gates' foundation tested a polio vaccine in India that left at least 490,000 children paralyzed. India was officially declared polio-free in 2014, and there is no data or documentation to support such a massive number of children being paralyzed due to vaccine-derived polioviruses.", "Source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim appears to trace back to a lengthy Instagram post by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is known for advocating against mandatory vaccination. Kennedy's post was copied and reposted across Facebook, leading to the spread of the claim.", "Inconsistent information": "The expert's verdict points out that Kennedy's Instagram post and subsequent articles made slightly different claims. While the Instagram post mentions a polio epidemic, an article by Kennedy refers to a non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) epidemic. This inconsistency raises doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the claim.", "Limited number of recorded cases": "The World Health Organization (WHO) data cited in the expert's verdict states that there were only 17 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) recorded in India between 2000 and 2017. This number is significantly lower than the claimed 490,000 paralyzed children, further undermining the authenticity of the claim."}
