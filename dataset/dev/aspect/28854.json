{"Methodology": "The expert would have examined the methodology used by TriMet, the transit agency, to calculate the number of jobs created by the Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail Transit Project. This would involve understanding the criteria and data sources used to determine the direct jobs created.", "Independence of evidence": "The expert would have looked for independent evidence to support TriMet's claim of creating 1,525 direct jobs. This would involve assessing whether there are other reliable sources or studies that confirm the job creation numbers provided by TriMet.", "Duration of jobs": "The expert would have sought information on the duration of the jobs created by the light rail project. This would involve understanding whether the jobs were temporary, seasonal, or long-term, as it would impact the overall impact of the project on employment.", "Interpretation of": "created\" jobs: The expert would have investigated how the term \"created\" was being interpreted by TriMet and the average person. This would involve understanding whether the jobs would not have existed without the light rail project or if they were simply associated with the project but could have existed through other means."}
