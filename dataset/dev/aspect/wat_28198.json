{"The claim was found in an advertisement that promised a shocking revelation from a doctor": "However, upon investigation, it was discovered that the word \"stop\" and any mention of a doctor did not appear in the actual content of the story.", "The story was originally posted on a travel website called Wanderoam": "and the URL for the story had different endings (-ta and -ob), indicating that it was served through advertising platforms Taboola and Outbrain. This suggests that the story was designed to attract readers through clickbait tactics.", "The headline of the story mentioned a doctor telling the twins to": "stop,\" but it is unclear why this was added as it did not reflect any medical danger or actual events related to the twins' marriages.", "While the clickbait advertisement was confirmed to be real and associated with Wanderoam": "it was verified that a pair of identical twins did indeed marry another set of identical twins. This was reported by the Associated Press in February 2018, and the couples announced their pregnancies in August 2020, confirming their relationships."}
