{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that the image of the credit card was found on Hunter Biden's laptop. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim is questionable.", "Previous appearance of the photo": "The expert's verdict mentions that the photo in question first appeared online in December 2019, almost a year before the New York Post's story about the laptop was published. This indicates that the photo is not new and may have been circulating prior to the claim being made.", "Unsubstantiated connection": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no proof linking Malia Obama to the white powder shown in the image. This suggests that any claims of her involvement are baseless and lack credibility.", "Pattern of misinformation": "The expert's verdict mentions that this claim follows a pattern of unconfirmed hoaxes related to the Obama children. This indicates that there have been previous instances of false information being spread about the Obama family, further undermining the credibility of the current claim."}
