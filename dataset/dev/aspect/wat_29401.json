{"The different middle names": "The expert's verdict highlights that the suspected gunman in the Dayton, Ohio, mass shooting was named Connor Stephen Betts, while the individual who died in Connecticut in 2014 was named Connor D. Betts. The distinction in middle names indicates that they are two separate individuals.", "Birth year and voter registration": "The expert's analysis reveals that the suspected shooter, Connor S. Betts, was listed on electoral rolls with a birth year of 1994 and had been registered to vote in Greene County, Ohio, since 2012. This information contradicts the claim that he died in Connecticut in 2014.", "Megan Betts": "Both Connor D. Betts and Connor S. Betts had a sister named Megan. However, the expert's verdict confirms that they are separate individuals. Megan Betts, who was tragically killed during the Dayton shooting, was listed on the voter rolls as being born in 1997 and residing at the same address as Connor S. Betts.", "Lack of evidence for an elaborate plot": "The expert's verdict mentions that proponents of the conspiracy theory suggested an elaborate plot involving a faked death in 2014 or the suspected shooter assuming an existing identity. However, the verdict emphasizes that there is no substantial evidence to support such claims and that the similarities can be explained by mere coincidence rather than a conspiracy."}
