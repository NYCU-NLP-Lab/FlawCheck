{"The claim that jellyfish and lobsters are biologically immortal is based on the existence of one specific species of jellyfish called Turritopsis nutricula": "which can revert to its juvenile state even after reaching sexual maturity.", "While jellyfish like Turritopsis nutricula exhibit biological immortality": "not all jellyfish species possess this trait.", "Lobsters": "on the other hand, do not exhibit biological immortality and can die from old age.", "Biological immortality": "as defined by scientists, does not mean that organisms will never die. Instead, it refers to organisms that do not die from senescence or natural aging but can still be killed by external factors such as predators, diseases, or environmental changes."}
