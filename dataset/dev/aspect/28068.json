{"The Wisconsin Shares program was plagued with abuse and fraud": "as parents and child care providers scammed the system.", "Calls for improvements to the program were made after the publication of the": "Cashing in on Kids\" series by the Journal Sentinel in 2009.", "Rep": "Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, called for reforms and a comprehensive audit of the Wisconsin Shares program after the initial stories ran.", "Pasch voted against an amendment to the 2009": "2011 budget that would have provided funding for welfare fraud investigations, and she also voted against the 2011-\u201913 state budget that included funding for such investigations. However, the latter claim is considered a bit of a reach as the funding for fraud investigations was only a small part of the overall budget, which Democrats opposed for larger reasons."}
