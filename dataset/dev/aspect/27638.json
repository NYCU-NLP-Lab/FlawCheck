{"Lack of government analysis": "The expert found that there is no government analysis of the cost of the Green New Deal per household. This is because the Green New Deal is a resolution that expresses goals rather than specific policies.", "Misleading": "600,000 figure: The $600,000 figure is based on estimates in a report from a right-of-center group, the American Action Forum. However, the GOP talking point exaggerates and oversimplifies the analysis, making the $600,000 figure inaccurate.", "Difficulty in assessing cost": "The American Action Forum, the source of the $600,000 figure, acknowledged that assessing the cost of the Green New Deal is challenging due to the breadth of its proposals and the redundancy of some policies.", "Lack of cost estimate from Congressional Budget Office": "The Green New Deal has not received a cost estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, further highlighting the lack of specific cost figures associated with the resolution."}
