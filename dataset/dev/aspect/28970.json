{"The claim falsely asserts that Pritzker and Madigan want to change the constitution to allow a permanent jobs tax on middle": "class families. However, Pritzker's plan for a graduated income tax does not include a \"jobs tax\" as described in the ad.", "The term": "jobs tax\" used in the claim is colloquially used to refer to head taxes, which are charges on larger employers based on the number of workers they employ. This does not align with Pritzker's proposal for a graduated income tax.", "Experts have confirmed that it is incorrect to use the term": "jobs tax\" to describe a graduated income tax proposal. The income tax is imposed on income, not on individuals or jobs.", "The ad": "s claim that amending the constitution to allow for graduated rates would make the rates permanent is also inaccurate. Tax rates can be changed through legislative action, and there is no such thing as a permanent tax increase."}
