{"Breitbart head Steve Bannon took a Chuck Todd audio clip out of context to discredit allegations of sexual assault against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore": "2. The claim misrepresents Chuck Todd's statement by implying that he said the Roy Moore story \"felt completely orchestrated\" in reference to the allegations against Moore, when in fact Todd was discussing the implications for the Republican Party.", "The": "orchestrated\" comment made by Todd was in reference to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's condemnation of Moore shortly after the report went live, not the allegations themselves.", "Other Republican senators": "including Richard Shelby, Tim Scott, Rob Portman, and John McCain, also expressed their disapproval of Moore on the same day as McConnell, further emphasizing the coordinated response within the party."}
