{"The claim originated from a meme labeled as": "Humor\" on the website Patriot Post, indicating that it was not intended to be taken as a statement of fact.", "The meme circulated online without the context of it being labeled as humor": "leading to potential misinterpretation by some individuals.", "Expert sources": "such as Rolling Stone, Politico, and The New York Times, have reported on the conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's death, including those involving the Clintons. These sources provide additional context and analysis to evaluate the claim's authenticity.", "The official autopsy results": "as reported by The New York Times, indicate that Epstein died by hanging himself in suicide.
