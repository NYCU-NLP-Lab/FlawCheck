{"The use of federal statistics": "The expert's verdict mentions that the National Women's Law Center (NWLC) based their analysis on recently released federal statistics. This indicates that the claim's authenticity was verified by relying on reliable and official data sources.", "State": "by-state ranking: The NWLC created a state-by-state ranking of women's median earnings compared to men's earnings. This approach allowed for a comprehensive examination of the gender wage gap across all 50 states and Washington, D.C., providing a broader perspective on the issue.", "Comparison of median earnings": "The analysis focused on comparing the median earnings of women and men. By calculating the ratio of female to male median earnings for full-time, year-round workers, the NWLC determined the wage gaps in each state. This method provides a standardized and measurable way to evaluate the disparity in earnings.", "Citing the national gender wage gap": "In addition to the state-by-state analysis, the NWLC also referenced the national gender wage gap, stating that women are paid 77 cents for every dollar paid to men. By including this broader context, the claim's authenticity is supported by acknowledging the overall trend of gender wage inequality in the United States."}
