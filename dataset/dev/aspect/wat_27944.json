{"The expert mentions that the claim is part of a bigger": "unfounded conspiracy pushed by QAnon, which alleges that former President Barack Obama and other powerful people are part of a global child sex-trafficking ring. This highlights the lack of credibility and baselessness of the claim.", "The expert points out that one of the photos used to support the claim shows a child who appears to be bound and gagged with tape": "but Obama is not in this picture. This indicates that the claim is misleading and falsely associates Obama with inappropriate behavior.", "Another photo used in the claim shows Obama and actor George Clooney on a boat with a child": "with the words \"exposing herself\" and an arrow scribbled on top of one of the images. The expert clarifies that this photo was taken on a boat ride with many other people, including Michelle Obama and other guests, and no nefarious activities were reported. This debunks the claim's attempt to create a false narrative.", "The expert provides evidence that the third image": "showing Obama with his arms wrapped around a young child, was taken in 2015 by Pete Souza, the White House photographer during the Obama administration. This verifies the authenticity of the photo and discredits any claims of inappropriate behavior by Obama."}
