{"The timing of the decline of coal": "The expert's verdict states that the decline of coal started when natural gas took off, which began during President George W. Bush's administration. This aspect was verified by examining a 2012 report from the Energy Information Administration that showed the downward use of coal and the upward use of natural gas began in the mid-1990s, before Bush's presidency.", "Factors contributing to the decline of coal": "The expert's claim suggests that the rise of natural gas played a significant role in the decline of coal. This aspect was supported by the 2012 report from the Analysis Group, which stated that lower natural gas prices and rising coal prices had contributed to coal company decisions to retire older plants.", "Impact of natural gas production and prices": "The expert's claim implies that the surge in natural gas production and drop in prices had a significant impact on coal use. This aspect was verified by figures provided by the Energy Information Administration, which showed that natural gas production started seeing strong growth in the mid-2000s and natural gas prices began to drop in 2008, coinciding with a general downward trend in coal consumption and production.", "Attribution of blame to Bush": "s policies: The expert's verdict mentions that Del. Scott Surovell blames Republicans, including President Bush, for the decline of coal due to their steps to bolster natural gas. While the evidence provided supports the timing and impact of natural gas on coal, it does not explicitly verify the attribution of blame to Bush's policies."}
