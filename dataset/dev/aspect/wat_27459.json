{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that they found no evidence to support the claim that Rudy Giuliani filed for Nancy Pelosi's impeachment. This suggests that there is no factual basis for the claim.", "Constitutional process": "The expert explains that the Constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to impeach an official, and it makes the Senate the sole court for impeachment cases. This information contradicts the claim that Giuliani filed for Pelosi's impeachment, highlighting the incorrectness of the claim.", "Impeachment history": "The expert provides information about the history of impeachment in the United States, stating that less than a third of impeachment proceedings have led to full impeachments and only eight people have been convicted and removed from office by the Senate. This historical context undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Source analysis": "The expert identifies the origin of the Facebook post as a story on Bustatroll.org, which features the same photo and headline. By tracing the source, the expert reveals that the claim may have originated from a satirical or unreliable website, further discrediting its authenticity."}
