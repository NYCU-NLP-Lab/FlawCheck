They verified that Klifman's photograph showed a real sunken boat, but it was taken near Traverse City, Michigan, not during the Trump boat parade in Texas.", "The expert provided additional evidence to support their findings by sharing a comparison of the real photograph taken by Klifman and the doctored image with the inserted Trump flag": "This visual comparison further confirmed the authenticity of the original photograph and the manipulation of the doctored image.", "The expert referenced a report from MLive": "which provided details about the incident involving the sunken boat. They highlighted that the boat sank in Grand Traverse Bay on June 19, 2020, and all 10 people aboard were successfully rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard and a local good Samaritan. This information further supported the fact that the original photograph was unrelated to the Trump boat parade in Texas."}
