{"Verification of video source": "The expert checked the source of the video and found that it was originally posted on YouTube in 2015 by a channel named Amazing video. This helped establish that the video was not recent and not related to the current coronavirus pandemic.", "Comparison with other videos": "The expert found another YouTube channel, SibteinTV Official, that had dubbed the video as \"funny\" and uploaded it in 2015. This suggested that the video was a prank and not a genuine incident.", "Lack of evidence for claim": "The expert noted that there was no evidence or context provided in the video or accompanying social media posts to support the claim that it was shot at Salim Hair Saloon. This lack of evidence undermined the credibility of the claim.", "Baseless nature of claim": "Based on the above findings, the expert concluded that the claim was baseless and lacked any factual basis. The video was not related to the current pandemic or any specific barber shop, and it was being shared with the intention of spreading fear and promoting discrimination against the Muslim community."}
