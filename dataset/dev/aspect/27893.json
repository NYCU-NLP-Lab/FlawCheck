{"Verification of authorship": "The expert confirmed that the books \"Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey\" and \"1900: or, The Last President\" were indeed written by Ingersoll Lockwood. This was verified through archival evidence, such as the books being archived by the Library of Congress and available for reading on Archive.org.", "Historical publication dates": "The expert noted that \"Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey\" was published in 1893 and \"1900: or, The Last President\" came out a few years later. This information was obtained through research and cross-referencing with reliable sources.", "Connections to the Trump family": "The expert pointed out several connections between the books and the Trump family, such as the main character's name being the same as President Donald Trump's son (albeit spelled differently), the Russian setting, and a character named \"Don\" who provides guidance to the protagonist. These connections were identified through a comparison of the book's content with the Trump family's background and current events.", "Premonitory elements": "The expert highlighted certain elements in the books that seemed prescient or eerily linked to the present day. For example, the mention of a \"Fifth Avenue Hotel\" in New York City, where Trump Tower now stands, and a scene from a panicked New York City after the election of an unexpected president in \"1900: or, The Last President.\" These connections were identified through analysis and comparison of the book's content with current events."}
