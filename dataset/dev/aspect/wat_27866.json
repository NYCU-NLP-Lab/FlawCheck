{"Increase in the occurrence of rare night clouds": "The expert's verdict highlights that there has been an increase in the occurrence of a rare form of night cloud known as noctilucent clouds. This increase in occurrence suggests a potential link to the rising presence of human-caused greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.", "Specific characteristics of noctilucent clouds": "The expert explains that noctilucent clouds are typically rare and located at a height of around 50 miles above Earth in the Mesosphere. They are only visible on clear, summer nights at mid-to-high latitudes and form under specific conditions. These conditions involve water vapor freezing around specks of dust at low mesospheric temperatures, with the newly formed ice crystals being illuminated by the low-angled sun during dusk and dawn.", "Impact of increasing human": "caused pollutants: The expert states that the increase in human-caused pollutants, such as methane and particulate matter, leads to higher levels of water vapor and dust in the atmosphere. This increase in pollutants contributes to a rise in the occurrence of noctilucent clouds.", "Research findings and simulations": "The expert mentions that researchers conducted computer models and satellite observations to simulate the impact of greenhouse gases on the occurrence of noctilucent clouds over the past 150 years. These simulations indicate that methane emissions from burning fossil fuels have increased water vapor concentration by about 40 percent, resulting in more than double the amount of mesospheric ice. This research supports the claim that rare night clouds are linked to human-caused climate change."}
