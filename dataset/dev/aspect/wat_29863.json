{"Reports from parents": "The expert's verdict mentions that a small group of parents reported severe diaper rash problems after their babies wore Pampers Dry Max diapers. These reports were shared through various social media outlets, such as Facebook, indicating a widespread concern.", "Regulatory agency investigations": "The Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) in the U.S. and Health Canada investigated the claims regarding Pampers Dry Max diapers. The CPSC followed up and investigated 4,700 reported cases of diaper rash and chemical burns. The regulatory agencies critically reviewed data submitted by Procter & Gamble (P&G), conducted their own evaluations, and reviewed clinical and toxicological data from published medical literature.", "Lack of specific cause linking Dry Max diapers to diaper rash": "Despite the investigations, the CPSC announced that they could not identify any specific cause linking Dry Max diapers to diaper rash. This suggests that the evidence did not support the claim that the diapers were the direct cause of the reported issues.", "Safety declaration by Health Canada": "Health Canada also reviewed the information provided by CPSC and declared that their safety review did not find evidence linking Pampers Dry Max diapers to diaper rash. This indicates that another regulatory agency independently came to a similar conclusion as the CPSC."}
