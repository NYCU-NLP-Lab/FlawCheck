{"The study published by researchers investigated the effect of the iPhone 12": "s magnetic field on an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD), not a pacemaker as initially reported by some outlets.", "The study observed that when the iPhone 12 was brought close to the ICD": "immediate suspension of ICD therapies was noted, indicating that the iPhone 12 can potentially inhibit lifesaving therapy in patients carrying the phone in upper pockets.", "Apple acknowledges that iPhones": "including the iPhone 12, may interfere with medical devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators, but argues that the iPhone 12 is not uniquely problematic in this regard compared to previous iPhone models.", "The study highlights that other smart devices also emit magnetic fields that could potentially interact with ICDs or pacemakers through the reed switch mechanism": "which controls the rhythm of electric pulses sent to the heart. Therefore, magnetic interference is possible for both types of devices, not just the ICD focused on in the study."}
