{"California Gov": "Jerry Brown's ability to manage the state's fiscal health has received wide praise.", "Brown inherited a": "27 billion budget deficit when he started his most recent two terms as governor in 2011, but he successfully reduced spending, implemented voter-approved tax increases, and benefited from a resurgent economy.", "A recent report by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst": "s Office forecasts that the state's 'Rainy Day' reserve fund will reach $14.5 billion by the end of the next fiscal year, and the Brown Administration estimates it will hit $13.8 billion at the end of the current fiscal year.", "The report also anticipates a": "discretionary surplus\" of $14.8 billion, which can be allocated by the Legislature for spending increases or tax reductions. Altogether, these amounts would reach $29.3 billion, supporting the governor's claim of a surplus closer to $30 billion."}
