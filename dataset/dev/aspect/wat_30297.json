{"The claim was debunked by fact": "checking organizations such as FactCheck.org, which is working with Facebook to debunk misinformation on the platform.", "The Facebook page that originally shared the meme": "America's Last Line of Defense, explicitly states that nothing on their page is real and that it consists of satirical content created by liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives.", "The image used in the meme": "showing pallets of gold bars, is from the Bank of England and has no connection to the U.S. or Afghanistan.", "There is no evidence of a": "Trump audit of Obama\" or any reports of the U.S. transferring gold to Afghanistan. The claim is unfounded and lacks credibility."}
