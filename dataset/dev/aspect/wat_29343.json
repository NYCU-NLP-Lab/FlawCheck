{"The claim made by Rubio is that Obamacare contained a bailout fund that allowed taxpayer money to be used to bail out insurance companies when they lost money": "2. The expert's verdict states that what Rubio refers to as a bailout is actually a part of the Affordable Care Act known as \"risk corridors.\" These risk corridors were put in place to address the problem of insurance companies not knowing how much to charge in premiums to cover expenses for policies sold to individuals with pre-existing conditions.", "The expert also clarifies that risk corridors are not considered a bailout by several experts": "They are a mechanism designed to deal with a potential problem and were modeled after a successful plan in George W. Bush's Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage.", "Rubio claims that he and congressional Republicans led the effort to wipe out the bailout fund": "However, the expert's verdict suggests that while they did postpone a provision of the law related to risk corridors, it did not eliminate the mechanism entirely. The long-term impact on Obamacare is still up for debate, as some legal scholars argue that the rider Rubio refers to only highlighted an existing problem in the law and prevented a workaround."}
