{"The expert examined the claim made by Wayne LaPierre": "the NRA's spokesperson, in the conservative Daily Caller, regarding President Barack Obama's alleged flagrant defiance of the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border.", "The expert researched and verified the existence of the Secure Fence Act of 2006": "which was passed by a Republican-led Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. This law authorized the construction of additional fencing along specific segments of the border, rather than the entire border.", "The expert found that the claim made by LaPierre": "stating that the law required a fence to be built \"along the entire Mexican border,\" was false. The law directed the double-fencing of specific segments, totaling around 650-700 miles, while the entire U.S.-Mexican border is approximately 2,000 miles long.", "The expert also noted that President Obama": "who was an Illinois senator at the time, had actually voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act of 2006, contradicting the claim of flagrant defiance made against him."}
