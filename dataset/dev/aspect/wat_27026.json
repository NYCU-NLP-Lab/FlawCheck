{"The expert fact": "checked the quote attributed to Bernie Sanders and found that it was a misquote. This demonstrates the expert's commitment to verifying the accuracy of the claim.", "The expert consulted the official poverty report from the U": "S. Census Bureau for 2017 and found that 17 million non-Hispanic whites were living in poverty, accounting for 42% of all people in poverty. This data supports the claim that a significant percentage of Americans in poverty are white.", "The expert also considered the Supplemental Poverty Measure for 2017": "which includes a broader definition of poverty and found that 19 million non-Hispanic whites were living in poverty, accounting for 43% of people in poverty under this measure. This additional measure reinforces the claim's validity.", "The expert investigated a 2012 Census Bureau presentation slide that examined data from 1960": "2011 and found that 31.7 million white individuals were in poverty during that time period. While this aspect may not directly confirm the 70% figure mentioned in the claim, it provides historical context and suggests that a significant number of white individuals have experienced poverty."}
