{"Definition of small business owner": "The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was to define what constitutes a small business owner. It was determined that a small business owner refers to individuals who have some amount of business income that they report on their personal tax returns. This definition helped in understanding the context of the claim and who it applies to.", "Lack of information on tax returns": "Another aspect considered was the limitation of information provided on tax returns. It was noted that tax returns do not provide enough details to differentiate between different types of small businesses. This aspect highlighted the challenge in accurately identifying and categorizing small business owners based solely on tax return information.", "Impact on job creation": "The claim asserted that increasing taxes on millionaires, who are predominantly small business owners, would hinder job creation. To verify this aspect, the potential impact of higher taxes on the ability of small business owners to reinvest in the economy and create jobs was examined. This aspect aimed to determine whether there is evidence to support or refute the claim's assertion about job creation.", "Public opinion on taxing millionaires": "The final aspect considered was the public opinion regarding taxing millionaires. The claim mentioned that a majority of Americans support an increase in taxes on millionaires. This aspect involved examining public opinion polls or surveys to determine the level of public support for such tax policies. Understanding public sentiment helped in assessing the claim's alignment with the views of the American people."}
