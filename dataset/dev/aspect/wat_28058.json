{"Comparison of drug prices": "The expert's verdict includes comparisons of drug prices in the United States with those in other developed nations. The U.S. House's Ways and Means Committee compared drug prices in the U.S. with 11 countries using 79 drugs sold between 2017 and 2018. The study found that individual drug prices in the U.S. ranged from 708% to 4,833% higher than the combined mean price of the other 11 countries measured.", "Research studies": "The expert's verdict mentions several research studies conducted by reputable organizations such as the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund and the London-based International Federation of Health Plans. These studies compared drug prices between the U.S. and other countries, providing evidence for the claim that prescription drug prices in the U.S. are significantly higher.", "Specific examples": "The expert's verdict provides specific examples of top-selling drugs, such as Advair, Humira, and Crestor, and compares their prices in the U.S. with those in other countries. The average prices of these drugs were found to be significantly higher in the U.S., supporting the claim that Americans are charged prices that are on average 4 times higher than in other countries.", "Expert opinion": "The expert's verdict includes the opinion of Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, who states that the broad qualitative conclusion that drug prices are much higher in the United States than in other countries is correct. While measuring drug prices can be challenging, Fiedler's expertise adds credibility to the claim's authenticity."}
