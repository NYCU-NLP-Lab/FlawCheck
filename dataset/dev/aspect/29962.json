{"The claim is based on an ad released by Sharron Angle": "the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate from Nevada, accusing Harry Reid of voting to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters and sex offenders.", "The ad also attacks Reid on immigration": "claiming he voted \"to give illegal aliens special tax breaks and Social Security benefits.\" However, these claims were previously fact-checked and rated as False and Barely True.", "The claim is related to the health care law passed by Congress": "specifically the provision that states must create exchanges where individuals can buy insurance. The law allows subsidies for premiums and costs for people with incomes between 133 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.", "A report by the Congressional Research Service": "CRS), requested by Sen. Tom Coburn, concluded that the health care law does not appear to prohibit coverage for drugs prescribed to treat erectile dysfunction for non-incarcerated beneficiaries previously convicted of rape, child molestation, or other sex offenses. The memo also states that individuals with such convictions would not be excluded from enrolling in a qualified health plan offered through an American Health Benefit Exchange solely because of their conviction."}
