{"The claim is contradicted by evidence of Jared Kushner": "s presence at the White House during the time period in question, as he was seen on the South Lawn participating in a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.", "Attempts to contact the Trump Organization and Mar": "a-Lago resort to inquire about any possible structural damage were unsuccessful, indicating a lack of verifiable information supporting the claim.", "The source of the claim": "a website called \"Freedumjunkshun,\" is known to be a self-avowed fake news website that publishes satirical fiction. Their disclaimer clearly states that their content should not be taken as truth.", "Other elements of the claim": "such as Eric Trump designing Mar-a-Lago to withstand bunker-busting bombs but not water damage, are plainly absurd and further undermine its credibility."}
