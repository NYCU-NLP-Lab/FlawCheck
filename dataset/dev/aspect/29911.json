{"The photographs in the claim were found to be unrelated to the Black Lives Matter movement or any attacks connected with it": "They were actually pictures of victims of violence in South Africa.", "The identities of some of the individuals in the photographs were verified": "For example, the woman at the top left of the collage was identified as Anne Ells, who was beaten and robbed in South Africa in 2014.", "The provenance of the other two photographs in the collage could not be determined": "but they were found to be similar in nature to the South African violence depicted in the rest of the pictures.", "The photograph of Anne Ells had previously been misrepresented in a different context": "further undermining the claim's authenticity."}
