{"The claim is based on a study titled": "Who Benefited from Job Growth In Texas? A Look at Employment Gains for Immigrants and the Native-Born, 2007 to 2011\" published by the Center for Immigration Studies, a research group that supports reducing illegal immigration.", "The study analyzed U": "S. Census Bureau data and found that immigrants, both legal and illegal, have been the primary beneficiaries of job growth in Texas since 2007. It specifically stated that 81 percent of the jobs created in Texas since 2007 were taken by newly arrived immigrant workers, both legal and illegal.", "The report estimated that about half of the newly arrived immigrants who took jobs in Texas beginning in 2007 were illegal": "Therefore, it concluded that approximately 40 percent of job growth in Texas since 2007 went to newly arrived illegal immigrants.", "The study does not suggest that Texas employers were intentionally creating jobs specifically for illegal immigrants": "It only indicates that illegal immigrants ended up filling a significant portion of the job openings created in Texas during the specified period."}
