{"Previous fact": "checks: The expert mentions that PolitiFact and its affiliates have fact-checked similar statements on visa overstays in the past. This indicates that there is a history of verifying claims related to this topic.", "Reliance on a Pew Research Center report": "The expert refers to a 2006 Pew Research Center report that estimated nearly half of all unauthorized migrants in the United States entered legally through a port of entry and overstayed their visas. This report provides a basis for the claim and suggests that there is research supporting it.", "Lack of updated statistics": "The expert highlights that neither the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) nor its successor, the Department of Homeland Security, have provided updated statistics on the percentage of undocumented immigrants who overstay their visas. This lack of updated data makes it difficult to accurately determine the current extent of visa overstays.", "Limited data on land crossings": "The expert mentions that recent reports from the Department of Homeland Security only include data on foreign visitors who arrived by air and sea crossings, not by land. This limitation in data collection implies that the full scope of visa overstays may not be fully captured, potentially affecting the accuracy of the claim."}
