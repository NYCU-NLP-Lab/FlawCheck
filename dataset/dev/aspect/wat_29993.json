{"Analysis of Poll Results": "The expert analyzed the results of two different polls conducted in Massachusetts to assess the popularity of the state's health care plan. The first poll, conducted by Suffolk University, found that 38 percent of respondents believed health care in Massachusetts was working, while 49 percent disagreed. The expert noted that while this provided some support for the claim, it did not necessarily indicate that the plan was \"wildly unpopular.\" The second poll, conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health, asked respondents who were aware of the law whether they supported or opposed it, providing a more direct measure of the plan's popularity.", "Comparison to Claim": "The expert compared the results of the polls to the specific claim made by Laura Ingraham that the Massachusetts health care plan was \"wildly unpopular.\" The expert noted that while the polls showed varying levels of support and opposition, they did not necessarily support the claim of extreme unpopularity.", "Consideration of Question Wording": "The expert also considered the phrasing of the poll questions and how it may have influenced the results. They pointed out that the Suffolk University poll question referred to \"health care in Massachusetts\" in a broad sense, which could include factors beyond the state health plan. This raised the possibility that respondents' opinions may have been influenced by their personal experiences with specific doctors, hospitals, and pharmacists, rather than solely reflecting their views on the health care plan itself.", "Assessment of Degree of Unpopularity": "In evaluating the claim, the expert assessed the degree of unpopularity indicated by the poll results. They noted that while the Suffolk University poll showed a split of 38 percent in favor and 49 percent against the plan, this did not necessarily meet the threshold of being \"wildly unpopular.\" The expert highlighted the importance of considering the specific wording used in the claim and the actual percentages of support and opposition revealed by the polls."}
