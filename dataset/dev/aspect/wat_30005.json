{"The claim was made by Erick Erickson": "an influential blogger and editor of RedState.com, and PeachPundit.com, which focuses on state issues. He posted the claim on both websites after 8 p.m.", "The claim stated that Nathan Deal": "a Republican candidate for governor, voted for Henry Waxman sponsored legislation to give $500 million to Planned Parenthood to pay for actual abortions. The claim was made in blog posts on RedState.com and PeachPundit.com.", "The expert investigated the claim and found that Deal did vote for the Family Planning Amendments Act of 1993": "which would have provided funding for family planning clinics, some of which perform abortions. However, the bill did not pass the Senate and never became law.", "The expert also reached out to Erick Erickson": "who clarified that the issue was not about Deal's stance on abortion but rather about the conduct of Georgia Right to Life (GRTL), who endorsed Deal despite his vote on the legislation. Erickson accused GRTL of hypocrisy in their support for Deal."}
