["Illinois\u2019 20th House district is considered one of the most important in-state races to watch\u00a0come\u00a0Election Day in the battle for seats between Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan and GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner.", "The district, which includes parts of Chicago\u2019s Northwest side and nearby suburbs,features Republican state Rep. MichaelMcAuliffe defending his seat from\u00a0first-time\u00a0candidate Democrat Merry Marwig. McAuliffe\u2019s defense includes a new television ad that calls Marwig corrupt and ties her to Madigan because she has successfully appealed her property tax bills.", "The ad, titled \"Inside Game,\" is a 30-second spot running in the Chicago area and was produced by Citizens for Michael McAuliffe and the Illinois House Republican Organization.", "Here\u2019s the transcript:", "\"Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals. Representing the powerful and politically connected. Saving his friends millions. Forcing you to pay more. It\u2019s an inside game played by people like Merry Marwig, Madigan\u2019s hand-picked candidate. When Marwig thought her property taxes were too high she got them lowered at your expense. Saved so much she did it again. Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system.\"", "It got us wondering: Did Marwig\u00a0get\u00a0her property taxes lowered? Did Madigan have anything to do with it? Is it corrupt to get your property taxes lowered? We took a look to find out.", "Madigan\u2019s law firm and tax appeals", "The opening line of the advertisement says: \"Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals. Representing the powerful and politically connected. Saving his friends millions.\"", "Madigan\u2019s personal law firm, Madigan & Getzendanner, has made quite a bit of money from property tax appeals. According to\u00a0the\u00a0Chicago Tribune, Madigan & Getzendanner represented 45 of the 150 most valuable Chicago downtown buildings in 2008. The Tribune also found \"Madigan's firm won enough appeals to cut more than $183 million from the taxable value of the top high-rises it represented\" in 2006.", "A 2013 Chicago Magazine article also backs this claim, citing a\u00a0Sun-Timesarticle\u00a0that says over the course of a decade Madigan & Getzendanner made nearly $14 million for suburban Cook County landowners.", "Madigan and Marwig", "Where the ad gets murky is when it starts linking Marwig to Madigan. The advertisement says Madigan \"saved his friends millions, forcing you to pay more.\" It also says Marwig is Madigan\u2019s \"hand-picked candidate.\" The ad lays out these ideas in an order that implies Madigan\u2019s firm represented Marwig during her property value reassessment. However, Marwig and her husband were not represented by an attorney and filled out the forms themselves.", "Marwig\u2019s property taxes", "Next, the ad claims Marwig had her property taxes \"lowered at your expense. Saved so much she did it again.\"", "Marwig once unsuccessfully appealed to the Cook County Assessor to have her property value lowered in 2015. However, she successfully appealed to the Cook County Board of Review twice. It resulted in getting her property taxes lowered by about $400 in her 2013 appeal and then about $700 in her 2015 appeal.", "Marwig believes there is a double standard for McAuliffe to criticize her practices. In an emailed statement to Reboot Illinois she said:", "\"For Mike McAuliffe -- a 20-year politician who has personally benefited from a property tax appeal -- to attack my family for going through the legal process of correcting a government error in an unfair tax bill is another sad example of what\u2019s wrong with the politics and hypocrisy that local residents are so fed up with.\"", "Note: McAuliffe did benefit from getting his property taxes lowered when his condominium association appealed its property value in 2012. However, McAuliffe did not file the claim himself.", "And when the advertisement says Marwig\u00a0got her property taxes \"lowered at your expense,\" it\u2019s technically correct. But Chicago-based property appeals lawyer Gary H. Smith believes the ad implies Marwig is stealing, which is not actually the case.", "\"It\u2019s got elements of the truth,\" Smith said. \"When someone gets their property assessment lowered, it has to be made up by everyone else.\"", "But is it corrupt? The ad ends by saying, \"Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system.\"", "Not at all, Smith says. Anyone, regardless of whether they are\u00a0regular\u00a0citizen or a political candidate, can appeal a property tax bill if they believe it is inaccurate.", "According to the most recent available data from the Cook County Board of Review website, citizens filed appeals for nearly 403,000 parcels in 2013. The Board of Review approved a reduction for 63 percent of them.", "Smith said the ad\u2019s message is misleading and paints the practice of property value reassessment as ugly.", "\"It\u2019s horrible we live in a society that a system that\u2019s meant to improve our lives might be perceived as a detriment based on a person\u2019s political status,\" Smith said.", "Our ruling", "In their advertisement, Citizens for Michael McAuliffe and the House Republican Organization say, \"Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals. Representing the powerful and politically connected.\u2026 When (Merry) Marwig thought her property taxes were too high she got them lowered at your expense... Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system.\"", "Merry Marwig did, in fact, get her property taxes lowered twice and it did raise other people\u2019s taxes. But the ad\u2019s tone and inferences are misleading to viewers.", "It makes it seem like Madigan\u2019s firm was connected to Marwig\u2019s property value reassessment. Madigan\u2019s firm never represented Marwig. In fact, Marwig never\u00a0used an attorney during her property tax appeals.", "The ad also calls the practice of appealing one\u2019s property taxes corrupt. While there is evidence Madigan has been a highly successful property tax appeal lawyer whose clients win breaks more than many others,\u00a0any citizen within the geographic boundary can file an appeal to the Cook County Assessor's Office or Cook County Board of Review. The process becomes public record.\u00a0While some people may think Madigan succeeds more than average citizens, there\u2019s no evidence the system as a whole is corrupt.", "We rate this claim as Mostly False.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa7dab3e-6788-47a1-a2d6-b1a64c11ecc8", "Chicago Magazine,\u00a0\"Michael Madigan is the King of Illinois,\"\u00a0Nov. 20, 2013", "Chicago Tribune,\u00a0\"Madigan\u2019s Kind of Town\", Jan. 24. 2010", "Cook County Assessor\u2019s Office,\u00a0Michael McAuliffe\u2019s former condominium appeal history, Sept. 27, 2016", "Cook County Assessor\u2019s Office,\u00a0Merry Marwig property value appeal, Sept. 21, 2016", "Cook County Board of Review,\u00a0Merry Marwig\u2019s appeal history, Sept. 21", "Cook County Board of Review\u00a0Statistics, Sept. 27, 2016", "Email statement from Merry Marwig, Sept. 21, 2016", "Gary H.
