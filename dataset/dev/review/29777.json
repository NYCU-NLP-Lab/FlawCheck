["About this rating", "In the 1970s, then-Sen. Joe Biden was a vocal opponent of busing as a means for desegregating public schools. And that record haunts him in his bid to secure the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.", "In early March 2020, readers asked Snopes to verify a quote in 1977 in which Biden, then a U.S. senator representing Delaware, allegedly expressed fear that desegregation, if not done in an \"orderly\" way, could result in his children growing up in \"a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point.\"", "The quote was initially uncovered by Daria Roithmayr, a law professor at the University of Southern California (USC), in July 2019.

As The New York Times reported in a detailed delineation of Biden's history with busing, Biden at the time had emerged as the Democratic party's crusader against busing, taking the same side as segregationists. Biden \"joined up with Jesse Helms, the segregationist senator from North Carolina, to offer his own anti-busing amendment to that year\u2019s education spending bill.\" Biden's \"advocacy made it safe for other Democrats to oppose busing,\" The Times reported.", "The Times further reported that Biden sided with Helms in 1975 when the latter proposed to strip the federal government's power to withhold funding from school districts that refused to comply with racial-equality measures:", "Under the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare had a powerful tool to fight school segregation: It could withhold funding from districts that refused to integrate \u2014 and integration effectively meant busing. Mr. Helms wanted to strip the agency of that power.", "As Mr. Biden rose on the Senate floor in September 1975 to embrace that approach, Mr. Helms wryly welcomed him \u201cto the ranks of the enlightened.\u201d Mr. Biden objected to the education department mandating desegregation absent a court order, and warned of white flight to the suburbs and even racial unrest. ... Mr. Helms\u2019s amendment, which would have also barred the education department from collecting data about the race of students or teachers, failed. But a slightly narrower measure written by Mr. Biden, which prevented schools from using federal dollars to assign teachers or students by race, passed, 50-43.", "Roithmayr told us via email that busing, along with affirmative action, were viewed by those trying to achieve desegregation of schools after Brown v.
