Many represent a continuation of policies enacted by Trump himself in the First Step Act.", "In a break from tradition, President Donald Trump used the White House\u2019s Rose Garden as the venue for a lengthy rhetorical shot at his 2020 campaign rival, Joe Biden. Trump particularly targeted a policy document recently agreed to by representatives of the Biden campaign as well as allies of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who gave Biden a strong challenge from the ideological left in the 2020 Democratic primaries.", "\"The Biden-Sanders agenda is the most extreme platform of any major party nominee, by far, in American history,\" he said.", "Trump went on to call out many parts of the platform, including its policies on criminal justice.", "\"We could go on for days,\" Trump said. \"Incentivize prison closure. So they want to close our prisons. They now want to abolish our police departments. They want to abolish our prisons, I guess.\"", "This is wildly untrue.", "The Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to our inquiries.", "As we\u2019ve reported, some protesters using the term \"defund the police\" want to eliminate police departments entirely. But most officials do not want to eliminate the police; they want to revisit the functions of police departments and reroute some of their funding toward social services.", "But Biden explicitly rejected the \"defund the police\" label.", "\"While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people\u2019s rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police,\" Biden wrote in an op-ed in USA Today. \"The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms.", "So what does Biden support?", "The unity document backs a wide array of criminal-justice provisions, including decriminalization of marijuana by jurisdictions that want to do so and repealing federal mandatory minimum sentences.", "Not only does the unity document not say anything about abolishing the police, it includes several passages that are based on the assumption that there will be police going forward.

This measure tried to move the law in directions that are similar to aspects of the Biden platform, including efforts to reduce the severity of sentences, a greater emphasis on policies to reduce convict recidivism, and making retroactive the end to the disparity between crack and powder cocaine.", "Trump said that a Biden-Sanders \"unity\" policy document shows that \"they want to abolish our police departments.
