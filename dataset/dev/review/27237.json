Follow our post-election coverage here.", "On Nov. 20, 2020, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany held a news conference in the White House briefing room. Addressing U.S. President Donald Trump's refusal to concede his electoral loss to President-elect Joe Biden and his administration's stonewalling of Biden's transition team, McEnany said this about Trump's own transition into power after the 2016 election:", "\"Also, something that I would note is, just we talked a lot about transfer of power and the election, and it's worth remembering that this president was never given an orderly transition of power.
