Pasha, accompanied with the others, had parked his lorry at a toll plaza in Shamshabad when they spotted the victim park her scooty. She came back to the toll plaza around 9 pm to collect her vehicle. \u201cBy this time the accused had already consumed alcohol and planned how to trap this lady,\u201d said the police.

Shiva joined in later. \u201cAll these people while they were doing this offence had closed the mouth and the nose of the victim because of which she died on the spot.
