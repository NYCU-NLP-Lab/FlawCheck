["About this rating", "NPC International, the largest franchisee of Wendy's restaurants, announced they were filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2020.", "Neither Wendy's nor NPC International made any announcement about closing Wendy's outlets due NPC's bankruptcy filing, or any other announcement that Wendy's fans would find \"heartbreaking.\"", "Clickbait never sleeps, as indicated by an August 2020 article from the website SheFinds.com that continues to draw attention for its headline of \"Wendy\u2019s Just Made The Most Heartbreaking Announcement Ever -- We Can\u2019t Believe It!\" ... even though the article references no announcement made by the Wendy's restaurant chain, nor any information that fans of that eatery would find \"heartbreaking.\"", "What the article referenced was the July 2020 announcement by NPC International, a franchisee that operates numerous outlets of the Pizza Hut and Wendy's restaurant chains in the U.S., that the company was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
