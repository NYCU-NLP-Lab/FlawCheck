I mean even people have families, the police, the ICE people, the Border Patrol, they have families, they understand these moments and I think in moments of crisis like this \u2014 there's people, there were priests, there were chaplains there, we would be able to be of service to them. I would say, come, we'll help you.\"", "Prosecutors have charged Patrick Crusius, 21, in the shooting spree.
