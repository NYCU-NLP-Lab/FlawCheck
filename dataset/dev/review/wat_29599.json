["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on March 12, 2020", "As the COVID-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus has spread around the world, a number of politicians, news organizations and public figures have made the false claim that the Trump administration cut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s anti-pandemic work in over 40 countries to just 10. The CDC told us that\u2019s not true.", "The claim appears to have been based solely on outdated news reports from early 2018 that said the CDC was preparing to dramatically reduce its work helping to prevent infectious-disease epidemics. Those reports said much of that work on the Global Health Security Agenda, a pact between over 60 nations that began in 2014, had been funded by a five-year, nearly $600 million supplemental package that was dwindling. That one-time funding, which Congress originally appropriated in response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014, ran out at the end of September 2019.", "The director of the CDC\u2019s Center for Global Health did say at the time that, without additional funding, its Division of Global Health Protection \u201cwill have to scale its global health security portfolio to focus efforts based on existing resources,\u201d as the Wall Street Journal first reported in January 2018. If that happened, the official said the CDC would shift its focus to just 10 \u201cpriority countries\u201d and \u201cplan for the completion of its country-based programs\u201d in 39 other nations, the Journal\u2019s story said.", "Those hypothetical cuts were avoided, however, because Congress later provided more funding for the CDC\u2019s global health programs, the CDC told us in a statement.", "But in remarks from the Senate floor on Feb. 24, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed the Trump administration made \u201cdrastic cuts to the global health division at CDC,\u201d before saying, \u201cIn 2018, CDC was forced to reduce the number of countries it operated in from 49 to 10.\u201d", "Three days later, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut made a similar claim on Twitter \u2014 though he used slightly different figures.", "\u201cPresident Obama set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries, as a way to protect against something just like Coronavirus breaking out across the world,\u201d Murphy wrote. \u201cExperts begged Trump to keep them open. He closed 37 of them.\u201d", "Murphy\u2019s tweet appeared to catch the attention of Joy Behar, co-host of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d who made the same claim on the daytime talk show March 9.", "Murphy\u2019s office did not respond when we asked for a source for his statement, and Schumer\u2019s office told us Schumer relied on a New York Times article that was published the day of his floor remarks. That Times piece was not the only one from a news outlet to state that the cutbacks the CDC warned about in 2018 had actually gone into effect.", "As we said, the CDC told us that\u2019s false.", "\u201cCDC did not have to cut back its work from 49 to 10 countries,\u201d said Maureen Bartee, CDC\u2019s associate director for Global Health Security, in a statement to FactCheck.org. \u201cIn the FY18-FY20 annual appropriations, CDC received base appropriations for global health security from Congress. This was used to continue the essential public health capacity development in the four core areas that was started in 2014 with the one-time supplemental funds.\u201d", "Those four core areas, Bartee said, are surveillance, laboratory systems, workforce development and emergency management and response. \u201cFocusing on potential weak links in these core areas ensures that partner countries are better prepared to respond to disease threats, wherever they might begin,\u201d she explained.", "CDC operating budget plans show that its funding for global public health protection \u2014 which includes global disease detection and emergency response and global public health capacity \u2014 increased from $58 million in fiscal year 2017 to around $108 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. (And that does not include any remaining supplemental funds available for use.) The increases included nearly $50 million more each year for CDC\u2019s global health security initiatives.", "Those amounts went up again in fiscal year 2020, when the CDC was awarded $183 million for global public health protection, overall, and $125 million specifically for its global health security efforts. For fiscal year 2021, President Donald Trump has requested that CDC funding for global disease detection and other programs be increased further \u2014 to $225 million total, with $175 million going directly to global health security.", "With its current funding, Bartee said, the CDC is actually working in \u201cmore than 60 countries\u201d \u2014 not 10 \u2014 to address the threat of global infectious diseases and outbreaks.", "Bartee, email to FactCheck.org, March 10: In fiscal year 2020, the U.S. government, including CDC, is working with 19 priority partner countries to build preparedness and capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats at their source. These countries are Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote D\u2019Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, and Vietnam. In addition to these 19, CDC is supporting global disease detection, emergency and humanitarian response, and other global health protection activities in Cambodia, China, Egypt, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Niger, Panama, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.", "Also, CDC is establishing platforms with regional offices to advance global health security and maintain a sustainable global presence. With this regional approach, CDC intends to implement a sustainable, long-term overseas operational structure, expand the reach of its technical assistance and programs, and strengthen disease outbreak response. CDC is currently establishing regional platforms in South America (Brazil), Eastern Europe/Central Asia (Georgia), Middle East/North Africa (Oman), and Southeast Asia (Vietnam).", "Beyond those countries listed here, CDC, along with other U.S. government agencies, continues to support a broad range of global health programs (e.g., HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, global immunization) that address global infectious diseases threats, as well as response to major outbreaks that require international assistance. All told, CDC is currently working in more than 60 countries.", "For comparison, in 2017, the CDC said it worked with 17 \u201cPhase 1\u201d countries and another 14 \u201cPhase 2\u201d countries and CARICOM, an organization of 15 Caribbean island nations, on implementation of the Global Health Security Agenda. That\u2019s the same number of countries the CDC said the U.S. originally committed to working with back in 2014.", "The \u201cPhase I\u201d countries receive financial support and technical assistance from CDC staff, while the \u201cPhase II\u201d countries receive technical assistance only.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
