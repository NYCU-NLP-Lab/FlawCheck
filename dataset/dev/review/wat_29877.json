The page took out the word \u2018fictional\u2019 from the story and added a picture of the \u2018teacher\u2019. This picture was also used in news reports.", "This definitely deserved a share. Read, understand, implement. Trolling \u2260 bullying. You can be funny without hurting someone Principal suddenly called the 55 year old teacher and told him to learn how to take class online. He doesn\u2019t have much to say as he knows that if he denies he will be laid off, at this age in this situation he can\u2019t do any other job, to pay for his family he has no choice. Unwillingly he takes his smart phone to his daughter. His daughter helped him to understand the basic of Zoom, his hands often shake to go around the tabs, he often freezes trying to understand how this thing works but he has no choice. The next day he goes to a market to buy a new white board. The price of these small board soared up, but without these how can he take the class? He took the board in a rickshaw and came home. Placed the board in a chair and started practicing the lesson. It was harder than he thought, staring at a camera and teaching but he has no choice. The next day he wore a new shirt, will be seeing his students after one and half month, his daughter helped him to setup the smart phone, and the students were added and the class went on. He was shaky, his voice cracked every now and then he was nervous but he has no choice. Suddenly an unknown ID started using slang at him, the F word, the A word, open threats. He couldn\u2019t understand how should he react, he shouted out of anger and embarrassment, a teacher is being humulated infront of his students. His life work of earning respect from his students seemed to vanish in seconds. His daughter taught him to mute students but the student could unmute himself, the student kept on using slangs and he did it for entertainment. The only thing the teacher could do was to end the class, as he has no choice. He called for his daughter, she came running and saw her father in tears, she held him tightly tried to calm him down but he kept crying as he never faced such humiliation in his life. That he had troubled sleeping that night, as he knew the next day he has to wake up and face the same ordeal as he has no choice. Note:Abusing a teacher doesn\u2019t make you cool, It makes you sick.

A subsequent keyword search on Facebook led us to a post by Bangladesh user Hafiz R Rahman who had shared the video on June 29.

They are disrupting the class by mocking the teacher.", "Rahman wrote that the teacher\u2019s name is Mohiuddin and the incident occurred while he was taking a class for students of Milestone College, Dhaka. Rahman referred to himself as an ex-student of the college and claimed that he knows the teacher.", "In another video, he said that he has informed the college authorities of the incident in hopes that the unruly students would face consequences. He claimed to have shared the details of one of the boys with the college administration.
