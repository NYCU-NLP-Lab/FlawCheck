["About this rating", "As television host John Oliver wisely illustrated with \u201cdefinitelyrealquotes.com\u201d, it is extremely easy to convincingly attribute any saying to any historical figure by presenting the words in the form of a meme and without any citation or documentation. That approach seems to be the employed for a well-shared but attribution-free quotation about Muslims and minority rights alleged to have come from pen of British political figure Winston Churchill:", "Although such a statement might not have been out of character for Churchill, whose controversial musings on Islam revealed both a fascination and fear of the faith, no evidence documents his having said or written any such thing.", "Richard Langworth, a senior fellow with the Hillsdale College Winston Churchill Project, included this putative Churchillian quote in a 16 November 2018 addition to his running list of \u201cAll the \u2018Quotes\u2019 Winston Churchill Never Said.\"", "As best we can tell, this \u201cquote\u201d is an utterance commonly found in the comment sections of Islamophobic websites and was later attributed to Churchill with the use of Photoshop. For example, on 11 May 2015, a man commented on a blog named \u201cThe Muslim Issue\u201d with the words allegedly uttered by Churchill:", "And see, this is what the muslims do: when they are in the minority, it is all about \u201cminority rights.\u201d When they are in the majority, there are NO minority rights.", "Similarly, a 5 December 2015 Islamophobic message board post from someone named \u201cGrampa Dave\u201d used the same statement (without attribution to Churchill) as a sign-off. And a scantily worded and lightly proofread 27 January 2017 letter to the editor written by a man named Don Searles and printed by the Illinois newspaper Journal Gazette/Times-Courier used the same statement and followed up with a call for people to prove him wrong:", "In every country where Muslims are in the minority, they are obsessed with the rule of law and minority rights. In every country where Muslims are the majority, there is no rule of law or minority rights.", "I ask that anyone who is able to show where this is not true to please post you [sic] evidence in the comments section of the online version of this newspaper.", "Not only were these words not first attributed to Winston Churchill until well into the 21st century, but they don't seem to have appeared in print anywhere at all prior to about 2015 -- making it extremely unlikely they originated with a man who passed away in 1965.", "The Churchill Project. \u00a0 \"Churchill on Islam.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 4 March 2016.", "Sawer, Patrick. \u00a0 \"Sir Winston Churchill's Family Feared He Might Convert to Islam.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Telegraph. \u00a0 28 December 2014.", "Langworth, Richard. \u00a0 \"All the 'Quotes' Winston Churchill Never Said.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 richardlangworth.com. \u00a0 16 November 2018.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
