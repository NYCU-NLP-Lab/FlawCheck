["By Robert Farley", "Posted on June 17, 2020", "Former Vice President Joe Biden wrongly says \u201cmost of the conservative think tanks,\u201d including the Heritage Foundation, agree that the tax cuts championed by President Donald Trump \u201cgenerated virtually no growth at all.\u201d", "There are many economists who might agree with Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, that the tax cuts have not generated much, if any, economic growth, but most conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation, are not among them.", "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed by Congress and signed by Trump in December 2017, was billed by Republicans as a catalyst to accelerate economic growth and in turn, to create more jobs and higher wages. The law lowered many individual tax rates, nearly doubled the standard deduction, eliminated personal exemptions and increased child tax credits, among other changes. It also cut the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. It is expected to add $1 trillion to $2 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years.", "In an open letter to Congress in November 2017, more than 100 economists in support of the tax cuts predicted the tax cuts would \u201cignite our economy with levels of growth not seen in generations.\u201d", "A Congressional Research Service review of the first-year impact of the law, however, did not find evidence of \u201clarge effects particularly in the short run.\u201d", "CRS, May 22, 2019: In 2018, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 2.9%, about the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s (CBO\u2019s) projected rate published in 2017 before the tax cut. On the whole, the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy. Although growth rates cannot indicate the tax cut\u2019s effects on GDP, they tend to rule out very large effects particularly in the short run. Although investment grew significantly, the growth patterns for different types of assets do not appear to be consistent with the direction and size of the supply-side incentive effects one would expect from the tax changes. This potential outcome may raise questions about how much longer-run growth will result from the tax revision.", "Last week, Biden seized on the GDP growth figures highlighted in the CRS report to argue that the TCJA has \u201cgenerated virtually no growth at all.\u201d And, Biden added, that is according to conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation.", "\u201cImagine if we had that $2 trillion tax cut and we hadn\u2019t wasted it on the wealthy, that generated virtually no growth at all,\u201d Biden said on \u201cThe Daily Show with Trevor Noah\u201d on June 10. \u201cNo growth at all, according to most of the conservative think tanks.\u201d", "\u201cAnd imagine if we had that $2 trillion tax cut that he promoted and got passed for the wealthy, even places like the Heritage Foundation said that didn\u2019t grow the economy. $2 trillion,\u201d Biden said on June 11 during a roundtable meeting in Philadelphia on opening the economy. \u201cImagine if we had it right now, to focus on the things that can build a new economy, invest in everything from teleconference, into providing for the kind of health.\u201d", "We reached out to the Biden campaign for backup, and it passed along the nonpartisan CRS report, which as we said, concluded that \u201cthe growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy.\u201d", "Biden\u2019s campaign also pointed to a May 29, 2019, article from Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, who wrote that the CRS report findings were consistent with the Tax Policy Center prediction in December 2017 that the \u201cshort-term macroeconomic effects\u201d would be \u201cextremely modest.\u201d", "\u201cIn fairness, the tax cuts didn\u2019t occur in a vacuum,\u201d Gleckman wrote in that same article. \u201cSome of their benefits may have been offset by President Trump\u2019s own highly restrictive trade policy, or magnified by new deficit spending approved by Congress in 2018.\u201d", "In his latest update about the economic impact of the TCJA, published on Feb. 5, Gleckman concluded after looking at two years of data: \u201cDespite the Trump Administration\u2019s rosy promises that the post-TCJA economy would boom, it has instead grown on many dimensions at roughly the same steady, unspectacular pace as it did prior to passage of the tax law.\u201d", "\u201cOur forecast at the time the TCJA became law was for a modest short-term bump in economic output (mostly from people spending their tax cuts) followed by a gradual return to pre-TCJA trend,\u201d Gleckman told us via email. \u201cThat is pretty much what happened. \u2026 Business investment fell after passage. Employment pretty much tracked pre-TCJA trends. GDP growth had its bump, then returned to trend.\u201d", "\u201cRemember too that the growth story the White House told was this: The TCJA would encourage more capital investment that would lead to more productivity and, eventually, to higher wages,\u201d Gleckman said. \u201cThe reality was: We never even got the first step, except for a brief period just before and after passage of the law.\u201d", "Gleckman acknowledged, however, that it is \u201cimpossible to pull apart tax policy from other issues, including Trump\u2019s trade policy in 2018 and 2019.\u201d It is possible, he said, that the \u201cTCJA contributed to more growth but that benefit was offset by the tariffs (which are a tax increase on US consumers and businesses). Or not.\u201d", "\u201cThe disruptions of 2020 mean we never will know the long-term effects of the TCJA,\u201d Gleckman said. \u201cBut based on what we saw in 2018 and 2019, there is no evidence that the TCJA contributed very much to economic growth.\u201d", "Those analyses \u2014 from CRS and the Tax Policy Center, which is not a conservative group \u2014 provide some ammunition for Biden\u2019s claim that the TCJA \u201cgenerated virtually no growth at all.\u201d That\u2019s his assessment, and some economists agree.", "But Biden is wrong to claim that \u201cmost of the conservative think tanks\u201d agree.", "Biden\u2019s campaign cited three articles that it says came from conservative institutions: two from the American Enterprise Institute and one from the Tax Foundation. None of them support Biden\u2019s claim, though.", "The article from Nicole Kaeding, then at the Tax Foundation, was titled \u201cThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act After A Year\u201d and was published on Dec. 17, 2018.", "Kaeding wrote that one year after the law\u2019s passage there was \u201cvery little\u201d evidence \u201cwe point to on how the Act has impacted the U.S economy.\u201d But Kaeding also wrote that \u201cthe law\u2019s design is such that the economic impacts are long-run. It takes several years for the lower cost of capital to impact investment. Firms need time to plan, purchase, and permit new investments before they put the items into service. As we noted in our original score, much of the acceleration of growth happens several years after the law\u2019s original passage, before fading as provisions in the law expire.\u201d", "Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said Biden is distorting the Tax Foundation\u2019s position.", "\u201cOur position is not that the TCJA \u2018has generated no growth at all,\u2019 but rather that identifying the specific impact the TCJA had on growth is challenging given the many other factors at play that drive business investment and economic growth,\u201d Watson told us via email. \u201cThis includes the economic headwinds produced by the escalating trade war in 2019 and the coronavirus pandemic today. This is in addition to the fact that it may take several years to isolate the impact of a tax change, as Nicole pointed out in her piece. We provided feedback on a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report on TCJA last year, for example, arguing that \u2018its conclusion that the TCJA has produced little to no increase in output (GDP) and its argument that investment has not increased as was expected\u2026are too strong given the evidence.\u2019\u201d", "The first article from the American Enterprise Institute cited by the Biden campaign was one written by Alan Viard, a resident scholar at AEI. Although Viard wrote that \u201ca sharp uptick in investment has not occurred,\u201d he did not conclude that the TCJA has generated no growth.", "Rather, Viard posed three possibilities, only one of which considers the possibility that \u201cthe corporate tax cut is not boosting investment.\u201d It is also possible, he wrote, that \u201cthe boost is taking longer than expected\u201d or that \u201cthe tax cut boosted investment relative to what it would otherwise have been, even as other factors (perhaps other TCJA provisions or the trade war) have offset the boost.\u201d", "\u201cIt would be very surprising it if didn\u2019t generate any growth at all,\u201d Viard told us in a phone interview, adding that as a general economic principle, the corporate tax cuts should increase investment in the U.S.", "Viard said that while \u201cthe growth impact may be smaller than many of us [conservative economists] thought,\u201d it is \u201cimpossible to know\u201d whether the law\u2019s effects are simply taking longer than expected, or if the growth it generated has been offset by other factors, such as the trade war.", "The third article cited by the Biden campaign is a blog post written for AEI by Jason Furman. But Furman is not affiliated with AEI. Furman, an economics professor at Harvard and a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, served eight years as a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. According to Viard, Furman was simply invited to participate in a blog symposium about the effects of the TCJA. The symposium sought to include input from economists across the ideological spectrum.", "As for Biden\u2019s specific claim that \u201ceven places like the Heritage Foundation said that [TCJA] didn\u2019t grow the economy,\u201d the Biden campaign did not get back to us with backup for that.", "But the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, says that\u2019s false.", "On Twitter, Adam Michel, a senior policy analyst who focuses on tax policy for the Heritage Foundation, pointed to his Dec. 12 commentary \u201cHow 2 Years of Tax Cuts Have Supported Our Strong Economy.\u201d", "When Biden said something similar last August, Michel tweeted, \u201cI think I\u2019ve written something basically every week for the last year+ that says the tax cuts are working.\u201d", "In a series of tweets, Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of Heritage, also took issue with Biden\u2019s comments, saying, \u201cThe country saw increased wage growth, business investment, and employment thanks to the law.\u201d", "In a Nov. 4 post, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation looked at what economists from various viewpoints were saying about the TCJA nearly two years after its implementation. One of its conclusions: \u201cEconomists do not agree on the economic effects of the TCJA.\u201d Additionally, it concludes, \u201ceconomists generally agree that while certain definitive trends are emerging, it is impossible to undertake a full accounting of the TCJA\u2019s effects until more time has passed.\u201d", "\u201cA full analysis of the effects of the TCJA will not be possible to complete for years to come, if ever,\u201d the Peterson report states.", "Biden is, of course, entitled to his opinion about the effect of the TCJA. And he has numerous economists he could cite who agree the tax cuts have, to date, resulted in very little economic growth. But he is wrong when he says that \u201cmost of the conservative think tanks\u201d in general, and the Heritage Foundation in particular, agree that the tax cuts resulted in \u201cvirtually no growth.\u201d In fact, they do not agree.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
