["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett landed in a Feb. 16 opinion column by Gail Collins of The New York Times that questioned draft plans by the GOP-led Texas Legislature not to hike state education aid.\n\n\"In Austin,\" Collins quoted the Austin Democrat saying, \"I\u2019ve got half-a-dozen or more schools on a list to be closed \u2014 one of which I presented a federal blue-ribbon award to for excellence. And several hundred school personnel on the list for possible terminations.\"\n\nWe wondered if Doggett accurately summarized the situation.\n\nDoggett\u2019s spokeswoman, Sarah Dohl, told us by e-mail that Doggett based his comment on Austin American-Statesman news reports on a district task force\u2019s recommendations about closing schools and the district\u2019s recent announcement that it\u2019s considering employee layoffs as part of an array of budget cuts.\n\nDoggett\u2019s \"blue-ribbon\" reference, Dohl said, was to South Austin\u2019s Zilker Elementary. We found \u00a0a May 1999 Statesman story stating that Zilker was among three district schools that year to win the honor from the U.S. Department of Education. The story says Doggett was expected to attend the award ceremony. It quotes then-Education Secretary Richard Riley saying: \"These schools are examples of the good things happening in education nationwide.\"\n\nNext, we turned to the Statesman\u2019s coverage of school closure recommendations by the Austin district\u2019s volunteer facilities task force. According to a Feb. 10 story, the task force in January specified nine schools, including Zilker, that could be closed \"for efficiency\u2019s sake.\" However, the story says, the task force\u2019s recommendations to the school board would not name particular schools, instead referring to areas of the city where schools could be closed in 2012-13 and 2013-14.\n\nA link on the Statesman site led us to a Feb. 9 draft version of the task force\u2019s district facility master plan, which urges consideration of school closures \"only after all other alternatives and options, both programmatic and facilities use, have been thoroughly examined and discussed with the affected communities.\"\n\nNo individual schools are named, but there are regional suggestions for consolidating/closing a middle school in Northeast Austin; four elementary schools in \"Central East Austin\"; three elementary schools in Central Austin; and one elementary school in South Austin.\n\nWe called the district, whose spokesman, Andy Welch, cautioned that the district has no school-closing schedule and said its facility task force won\u2019t present its final report until March. \"So there is no list\" of schools to be closed, Welch said.\n\nStill, didn\u2019t the names of nine schools get floated for possibly closing? \"Can\u2019t deny that,\" Welch said.\n\nAfter he noted that some of the school district is outside Doggett\u2019s House district, we ran the addresses of the schools named for possible closure through the Texas Legislative Council\u2019s \"Who Represents Me?\" web feature. Eight are in Doggett\u2019s district; Pease Elementary is in San Antonio Rep. Lamar Smith\u2019s district.\n\nDohl of Doggett\u2019s office said by e-mail that the congressman was aware of the updated task force report--and that it doesn\u2019t specify individual schools to possibly close. But, Dohl said, \"the school closure list seems to still be a very real issue\" and Doggett believes school closures should be avoided.\n\nAll told, Doggett\u2019s comment accurately refers to Zilker Elementary and possible district layoffs. At the time he spoke, though, the task force that aired school closing suggestions had backed off the specifics. And it's not certain any schools are to be closed.", "We rate Doggett\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "Austin American-Statesman, news articles, \"Area\u2019s elementaries get honors as nation\u2019s best,\" May 21, 1999; \"Task force to present efficiency proposal to school board Monday,\" Feb. 10, 2011; \"AISD trustees discuss slashing more than 1,000 jobs,\" Feb. 14, 2011\u00a0 (accessed Feb. 18, 2011)\n\nAustin Independent School District, draft report, \"District-wide Facility Master Plan,\" Feb. 9, 2011 (accessed Feb. 18, 2011)\n\nGail Collins, oped column, \"Mrs. Bush, Abstinence and Texas,\" The New York Times, Feb. 16, 2011 (accessed Feb. 18, 2011)", "E-mails (excerpted), responses to PolitiFact Texas, Sarah Dohl, communications director, U.S. Rep.
