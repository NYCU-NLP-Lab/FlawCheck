["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on October 23, 2020", "Social media posts erroneously suggest that President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign hats are made in China, while those for former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign are made in the U.S. The official hats sold by both campaigns are made by American companies.", "Social media posts are wrongly suggesting that President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has its iconic red hats made in China, while former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign uses a U.S. manufacturer for its hats.", "The criticism levied by the posts hits at the core of Trump\u2019s message of \u201cAmerica First,\u201d but it\u2019s wrong.", "The posts in question use photos comparing a pro-Trump and a pro-Biden hat, and their respective labels.", "But while the red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat pictured in the posts does show a label indicating it was made in China, that doesn\u2019t mean it was a hat that came from the campaign, as the various posts either explicitly or implicitly claim.", "A Facebook page called \u201cTrump Sucks\u201d posted the photos on Oct. 19 with the caption: \u201cTypical Trump.\u201d It was shared nearly 3,000 times from there and later deleted. But we found that the same claim has\u00a0been repeatedly shared in recent weeks and months on Facebook and Twitter. One tweet posted in August reads: \u201cIt\u2019s classic: Trump campaign hats made in China. Biden campaign hats made in USA.\u201d", "The Trump campaign\u2019s website, however, touts all of its \u201cofficial\u201d hats as being \u201cProudly Made in USA.\u201d And reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show the campaign regularly pays two companies in the U.S. for the production and distribution of its hats.", "A 2018 Business Insider video spotlighted the Cali-Fame factory in California where the campaign\u2019s official \u201cMAGA\u201d hats are made. It noted that the hats are then shipped to Ace Specialties in Louisiana. Ace is the official merchandise distributor for the Trump Make America Great Again Committee \u2014 a joint fundraising committee run by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. The committee operates the campaign\u2019s online store and all purchases through the shop are considered a donation to the committee.", "Between 2019 and 2020 alone, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee reported payments totaling $17 million to Ace Specialties.", "The Trump campaign in that period also reported disbursements totaling $840,900 to Cali-Fame for hats and delivery services. It paid another $1.7 million to Ace for purchases of hats as well as other goods \u2014 such as signs, shirts and buttons \u2014 according to disbursement descriptions.", "Other fact-checkers have addressed the false claim that Trump has his MAGA hats made in China before \u2014 as far back as 2015. Meanwhile, there have been reports over the years of unofficial hats being made overseas.", "In 2018, readers asked us whether Trump 2020 banners were being made in China. As we wrote then, there were reports of such banners being made in China, but the Trump campaign said they were not their orders. It was unclear who had ordered those banners.", "\u201cWe have made it clear all along that all of our merchandise is 100% made in the USA. Any vendor who claims to have a relationship with us otherwise is lying or violating our protected trademark rights,\u201d the campaign\u2019s chief operating officer said in a statement at the time. \u201cThis applies to all of the recent fake news about Made in China products for the 2020 campaign.\u201d", "As far as the Biden campaign\u2019s \u201cJOE\u201d hat shown in the social media posts, the label indicates it was made by Unionwear in New Jersey. Unionwear CEO Mitch Cahn told us in an email that his company manufactures the hats sold for the Biden campaign though BumperActive, which manages the campaign\u2019s online store.", "But Cahn\u2019s company has made hats supportive of Trump, too.", "In the 2020 election cycle, he said, the company has manufactured hats \u201cfor merchandise companies selling to more decentralized campaign offices, such as California for Trump or Women for Trump.\u201d", "\u201cWe do not do any work for the Trump national campaign or its merchandise company, Ace Specialties \u2014 however at any given time we have 20-30 pro-Trump orders in house,\u201d Cahn said.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
