["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on July 21, 2017", "President Donald Trump said that by allowing insurers to sell plans across state lines, \u201cyour premiums will be down 60 and 70 percent.\u201d We couldn\u2019t find any study supporting such a decrease, and experts we consulted disputed the idea that overall average premiums would decline significantly.", "The president made the claim in his remarks before a luncheon on July 19 with Republican senators to talk about legislative efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.", "Trump, July 19: [C]ross state lines, where you have \u2014 where it\u2019s almost impossible for insurance companies to compete in different states. \u2026 We\u2019re putting it in a popular bill, and that will come. And that will come, and your premiums will be down 60 and 70 percent. People don\u2019t know that. Nobody hears it. Nobody talks about it. \u2026 We\u2019re going to have to cross state lines\u00a0\u2026 and you\u2019ll have insurance companies bidding, you\u2019ll have forms of insurance that you don\u2019t even know about right now, because that\u2019s the way it works. There\u2019s going to be tremendous competition.", "We asked the White House for support for the president\u2019s claim, but we did not receive a response. We reached out to health care experts, and\u00a0they knew of no study or analysis backing up Trump\u2019s 60 percent or 70 percent figures \u2014 nor could they point to any other studies giving estimates for the impact on premiums.", "In a\u00a0\u201cmyth vs. reality\u201d fact sheet, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners \u2014 a support organization established by the country\u2019s state insurance regulators \u2014 said the idea that cross-state sales\u00a0would bring about lower premiums was a \u201cmyth.\u201d The reality: \u201cInterstate sales will start a race to the bottom by allowing companies to choose their regulator,\u201d allowing insurers to target the healthiest consumers. \u201cWhile those individuals in pristine health may be able to find cheaper policies, everyone else would face steep premium hikes if they can find coverage at all,\u201d the NAIC wrote.", "Allowing insurers to sell policies across state lines \u2014 on the individual market, where those without employer plans or government plans like Medicaid buy their own coverage \u2014 has been a popular proposal among Republicans for some time. As the president mentioned, the idea is that it would promote more competition to bring down the prices of policies.\u00a0It would cut down on state insurance regulations, as insurance companies would choose to sell policies out of states with fewer regulatory requirements.", "In 2008, Sen. John McCain included the policy in his health care plan as he campaigned for president, saying it would \u201cprovide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.\u201d", "That, of course, was before the Affordable Care Act, when states varied widely in what they required of insurers on the individual market. But the ACA enacted countrywide minimum benefit standards, limits on out-of-pocket spending, limits on how much premiums could vary based on a consumer\u2019s age, and requirements that insurers not use health status to price premiums or reject anyone, among other regulations.", "Trump talked of making the cross-state policy separate legislation from a repeal of the ACA. The recent GOP health care bills in the House and Senate both included provisions giving states the ability to change or drop some of the ACA regulations, but the Senate is now set to consider repealing the ACA with a two-year delay.", "The ACA did include a provision allowing insurers to sell policies across state lines, but states would have to enter into \u201ccompacts.\u201d And the Obama administration never issued regulations establishing how those compacts would work. The Department of Health and Human Services would have to approve the cross-state sales, a February 2017 brief from the National Academy for State Health Policy explains. Five states have passed laws allowing interstate sales \u2014 with three of them doing so after passage of the ACA \u2014 but no insurers have entered new markets under those laws.", "So, if insurance companies could sell individual market plans across state lines, and state regulators didn\u2019t have to follow ACA requirements, would\u00a0\u201cyour premiums\u201d go down \u201c60 and 70 percent\u201d?", "Experts cited several reasons that the across-state-lines idea wouldn\u2019t be a\u00a0cure for high premiums\u00a0as the president implied.", "Joseph Antos, the Wilson H. Taylor Scholar in Health Care and Retirement Policy at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in a Feb. 26, 2016, post on the think tank\u2019s website that even with giving states regulatory authority, \u201cone should not expect interstate sales to significantly reduce the cost of health insurance.\u201d", "Why? Primarily because the costs of health services are local. Medical services are more expensive in places like New York City or San Francisco \u2014 like virtually every other commodity \u2014 than they are in, say, small towns in Ohio, or even other areas of New York and California.", "Antos, who was on President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and held other positions in the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Health and Human Services, told us in a phone interview that more regulatory flexibility \u201ccould reduce premiums to some extent,\u201d but insurers are still locked into the costs of health services in a given geographic area. The \u201cprice of insurance is driven not by the cost of health care in the state where the insurer is legally domiciled,\u201d Antos said, but rather in the state where the customer lives.", "So a cheap plan in an inexpensive locale would still have to be priced higher if sold in a high-cost area.", "Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Center, told us that some people could see a drop in what they pay for premiums on the magnitude Trump claimed, if insurers significantly curtailed benefits. But other people \u2014 those who want or need to buy comprehensive policies \u2014 could see dramatic premium increases.", "This is the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d that the NAIC cited in its \u201cmyth vs. reality\u201d paper.", "In states with unregulated markets, \u201cyou could create a situation where you are selling very low-priced policies to healthy people without much [insurance] protection whatsoever,\u201d Blumberg, who was a health policy adviser to President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, said in a phone interview. \u201cBut that ignores the fact that \u2026 what you\u2019re doing is driving up the premiums to impossible levels\u201d in states that want to have insurance regulations.", "It\u2019s a \u201crisk-segmentation strategy,\u201d she said, where eventually the healthy people are pulled into one set of plans and those with health problems are left in another. Premiums would go up so much in states with regulated plans that it would become impossible for them to sustain those regulations.", "That\u2019s one reason state regulators don\u2019t like this idea, says Blumberg, because \u201cno state regulator wants \u2026 to be undermined by rules in another state.\u201d", "Antos\u00a0wonders how much insurers could possibly strip down their policies. They could reduce some benefits, but it \u201cwould also have to be something people want to buy,\u201d he said. And excluding certain benefits, like mental health benefits, wouldn\u2019t reduce premiums by much.", "It\u2019s difficult to know what would happen, Antos\u00a0said. If an insurer were to drop all inpatient services, for example, the premium would be a lot cheaper. \u201cBut who would buy it?\u201d he said.", "Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, said\u00a0that the lion\u2019s share of a premium is the money a plan has to pay for medical claims, as well as utilization. Selling insurance across state lines wouldn\u2019t change the price of medical services \u2014 as Antos said \u2014 but if insurance companies could deny coverage or charge more for health conditions, a carrier could \u201cpush down on utilization by screening out sick people\u201d and then, \u201cthey can charge a lower premium.\u201d", "\u201cYou could start to see dramatically different premiums\u201d between regulated and unregulated states, Corlette said, echoing Blumberg\u2019s comments.", "A September 2016 study by RAND Corp. researchers looked at the impact of Trump\u2019s health care campaign proposals, including selling policies across state lines. It didn\u2019t provide estimates for the impact on premiums alone, but said that out-of-pocket costs would increase on average for individual market enrollees if the ACA were repealed, and increase even more if only the across-state-lines policy were added. But that doesn\u2019t account for any tax credits, which presumably would be part of a larger ACA-replacement package.", "Evan Saltzman, one of the authors of that report, told us that he didn\u2019t think it was a stretch to say premiums would go down by allowing insurance to be sold across state lines. But a 60-to-70 percent drop seems \u201ca little unreasonable.\u201d", "\u201cMaybe a 21-year-old would see that kind of decrease, but a 64-year-old might not,\u201d he said.", "Then there\u2019s the question of how much insurers want to sell plans across state lines. Insurance companies build networks of doctors and hospitals in a given area to provide discounted pricing. The ACA has highlighted the fact that\u00a0insurers are able to reduce premiums by offering plans with narrow networks.", "Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini\u00a0told CNBC in late January\u00a0that an across-state-lines proposal\u00a0was past its prime:\u00a0\u201cQuite frankly, the idea of selling insurance across state lines is a dated concept. Insurance products are now tightly aligned with networks, and so buying an insurance product from another state that\u2019s tied to a network in another state really doesn\u2019t work for people seeking care.\u201d", "In fact, Corlette found that a \u201csignificant barrier,\u201d more so than regulatory environments, to insurers entering a new market was \u201d\u00a0the enormous difficulty that out-of-state insurers face in building a network of local providers.\u201d In a 2012 report for Georgetown\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, Corlette and her co-authors interviewed government officials and insurers in the handful of states that have enacted laws regarding cross-state insurance sales. As we mentioned, no insurer had entered a new market due to those laws.", "The American Academy of Actuaries outlined all of the concerns we\u2019ve covered here\u00a0in a February brief. On provider networks, the professional association said: \u201cAny cost savings resulting from differences in benefit coverage requirements among states can be small compared to cost savings that can be accomplished through negotiating strong provider contracts. Unless they are able to achieve a large enrollment, out-of-state insurers may have difficulty in negotiating with providers.\u201d", "The NAIC\u00a0cautioned in a Jan. 24 letter to GOP leaders in the House of Representatives: \u201cWe continue to see proposals that would preempt state licensing requirements and, thus, consumer protections by allowing sales across state lines by federal edict, without proper discretion for the states to form compacts between themselves.\u201d", "Saltzman, co-author of the RAND study, said there\u2019s also \u201cselective entry\u201d within states, where, for instance, Los Angeles has a lot of insurance competition but rural areas of the state don\u2019t.", "He said, and other experts agreed, that it\u2019s very difficult to model an across-state-lines policy. The appendix to his September 2016 report noted that this was \u201cparticularly challenging given the lack of available data on insurer entry decisions and strategic behavior.\u201d", "It remains to be seen if a federal across-state-lines policy is politically, and practically, feasible. And since it hasn\u2019t been tried, we don\u2019t know exactly what impact it would have. But we found no evidence for President Trump\u2019s contention that\u00a0under such a policy, \u201cyour premiums will be down 60 and 70 percent.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s Note: More articles about the 2017 health care debate can be found here.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
