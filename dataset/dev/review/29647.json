["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on August 13, 2019", "A headline circulating on partisan websites distorts former President Barack Obama\u2019s tweet advocating stricter gun laws in the wake of the most recent mass shootings.", "Former President Barack Obama posted a statement on Twitter advocating \u201ctougher gun laws,\u201d reducing the influence of online hate groups, and heightening tolerance following the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.", "He also tweeted a link to piece published by Vox titled: \u201cDemocrats have been discussing the same ideas on guns for 25 years. It\u2019s time to change that.\u201d", "The article criticizes candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination for offering weak platforms on gun control. It argues that much more radical steps need to be taken to curb gun violence in the country, making the case, primarily, that there should be a nationwide gun licensing program and that the number of guns available needs to be slashed.", "It does suggest that confiscation, or a \u201cmandatory buyback program,\u201d is one option for cutting down the number of guns. But it never suggests an \u201call-out\u201d confiscation. In fact, it gives so little attention to the idea that it doesn\u2019t even address what a confiscation program would entail.", "A headline published on several partisan websites, however, has twisted Obama\u2019s endorsement of that article to make this claim: \u201cBarack Obama Calls For All-Out Gun Confiscation.\u201d", "Most of the websites that made the claim cited this passage from the Vox story: \u201cTo change the status quo, Democrats should go big. They need to focus on the abundance of guns in the US and develop a suite of policies that directly tackle that issue, from licensing to confiscation to more aggressive bans of certain kinds of firearms (including, perhaps, all semiautomatic weapons or at least some types of handguns).\u201d", "But we don\u2019t know which part of the story Obama was highlighting, and an Obama spokesman didn\u2019t respond to our request for clarification on the former president\u2019s tweet. In his statement on Twitter, Obama said this about gun laws:", "Obama, Aug. 12: Every time this happens, we\u2019re told that tougher gun laws won\u2019t stop all murders; that they won\u2019t stop every deranged individual from getting a weapon and shooting innocent people in public places. But the evidence shows that they can stop some killings. They can save some families from heartbreak. We are not helpless here. And until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening.", "When he was president, Obama never proposed gun confiscations of any kind. Rather, he called for closing background check loopholes and banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.", "He wasn\u2019t able to pass any of that legislation, though, and instead signed a series of executive actions.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
