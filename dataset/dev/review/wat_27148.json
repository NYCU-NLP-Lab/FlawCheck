PolitiFact also ran the numbers itself, using Bureau of Labor Relations data, and asked the taxpayer-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, which does nonpartisan analysis of the state's financial and economic statistics, to do the same.\n\nEvery way PolitiFact sliced the jobs numbers, Massachusetts was 47th.\n\nBut in that item and many others, economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy.\n\nMichael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, warned us not to put too much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly.\n\nCastro\u2019s political consultant, Christian Archer, sent us a June 5, 2012, New York Times news story supporting the statistic, and also said that as a co-chair of Obama for America, the mayor has received material from the president citing the same ranking.\n\nArcher said Castro was offering the ranking as evidence Romney would not be as strong on job creation as Obama.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe job-creation ranking for Massachusetts is right; the implication that Romney is solely to blame for the state\u2019s low standing does not hold up.
