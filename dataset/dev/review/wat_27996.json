["About this rating", "If screenshots circulating on Twitter and Instagram are to be believed, actor Armie Hammer is into some unconventional sexual stuff. His name started trending in early January 2021, when screenshots claiming to be his messages spread across the internet, detailing his sexual kinks that include BDSM and even cannibalism.", "They reportedly originated from a now-private Instagram account, House of Effie, that claimed that Hammer sent her some explicit direct messages. In one message, he allegedly said, \u201cI am 100% a cannibal. I want to eat you... I've cut the heart out of a living animal before and eaten it still warm.\"", "Some of the screenshots are visible below (Note: They contain graphic descriptions of violent sexual acts):", "Hammer\u2019s Twitter account has reportedly liked bondage-related tweets in the past. Rumors about his kinks, and his infidelity (he announced his divorce last year) have circulated for years. Some gossip outlets have claimed that his sexual proclivities went too far and some women felt uncomfortable. None of these stories have been verified or proven.", "We went to Hammer\u2019s verified Instagram account, and he does follow the hashtag #Shibari, which refers to the Japanese art of tying knots. The practice originated from Hojo-jutsu, a method of restraining captives and a form of torture, before morphing into the erotic bondage Kinbaku (Kinbaku-bi translates to \u201cthe beauty of tight binding\u201d) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.", "While it has been used for sexual pleasure historically, it can also be a form of meditation, relaxation, and trust-building practice between partners. The hashtag #Shibari has been restricted on Instagram because of \"content that may not meet Instagram's community guidelines.\"", "Hammer's role on an upcoming movie with Jennifer Lopez will be recast in light of the DMs scandal.

That\u2019s about as weird as we got,\" she said. But she also described a \"consuming\" and emotionally abusive relationship with Hammer.", "On March 18, 2021, a woman accused Hammer of rape and assault. In a press conference with attorney Gloria Allred, the woman said Hammer violently raped her, repeatedly banged her head against a wall, and committed other violent acts. Hammer has denied the rape allegation.", "However, There is no evidence that these messages were actually sent by Hammer. He had not commented on these claims as of writing this story on Jan. 13, but recently called them \"bullshit.\" Since the screenshots could very easily be manipulated images, and no one has independently investigated the source of these claims, we rate them as \u201cUnproven.\u201d", "Jan. 14, 2021: Updated with Hammer's comment on the claims.", "Jan. 14, 2021: Updated with Hammer's reported ex-girlfriend's interview.", "March 18, 2021: Updated with rape accusations, and Hammer's denial.", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
