["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "On July 3, 2014, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper announced that his state has seen a 40 percent drop in teen birth rates since 2009, when Colorado began a program to provide discounted and free contraceptive devices to women. Pundits immediately compared Colorado\u2019s contraceptive program to Texas\u2019\u00a0abstinence-only efforts, including Michael Eric Dyson, filling in for Ed Schultz on the July 9 Ed Show.", "\"We should all be taking a page from Colorado when it comes to contraception,\" Dyson said. \"The state saved $42.5 million in health care expenditures associated with teen births in 2010 alone. It\u2019s a stark contrast to the results out of Texas, where Gov. Rick Perry has pushed an abstinence-only education program.\"", "Texas, said Dyson, \"has the fifth-highest birth rate among teenagers\" and \"the highest rate of repeat births among teenagers aged 15 to 19. Teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion in health care, foster care, and lost tax revenue in 2010 alone.\"", "The discussion around contraceptives often revolves around the rights of the unborn child and the mother, so we were surprised to see such a precise cost attributed to teenage birth. In this fact-check, we\u2019re looking at Dyson\u2019s claim that teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion in 2010.", "The source of the claim", "While we didn\u2019t hear back from Dyson, the statistic he\u2019s referring to comes from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a nonprofit that researches and advocates for their eponymous cause.", "According to the National Campaign, teen childbearing cost U.S. taxpayers $9.4 billion, and $1.1 billion of that -- more than any other state -- comes from teen childbearing in Texas.", "David Wiley, professor of health education at Texas State University, vouched for the National Campaign\u2019s reliability. \"They are pretty much the gold standard on research. Their methods are good and they don\u2019t do hyperbole.\" And even though there\u2019s no perfect way to measure the public cost of teen birth, Denver University professor of sociology Jennifer Reich told us that the National Campaign\u2019s stat is \"substantiated by a sizeable amount of data.\" A press officer from the Texas Department of State Health Services also deemed the National Campaign\u2019s figures credible.", "So on a basic level, Dyson is right to imply that Texas\u2019\u00a0relatively high teen childbearing numbers have a substantial fiscal impact. But the National Campaign\u2019s communications director, Jessica Sheets Pika, cautioned that \"Texas\u2019\u00a0high cost compared to most states may not be the most meaningful way to measure differences in teen childbearing.\"", "\"Part of this difference is due to Texas\u2019\u00a0relatively high teen birth rate. For example, the teen birth rate in Texas was 52.2 births per 1,000 teen girls in 2010, while it was 33.4 in Colorado. However, much of this difference is simply due to the fact that Texas has a much larger population than most states.\"", "It\u2019s also worth noting that Texas\u2019\u00a0teenage birth rate has been steadily decreasing, albeit at a slower rate than Colorado\u2019s. Texas\u2019\u00a0teenage birth rate for teenagers between 15 and 19 declined by 5 percent from 2011 to 2012, compared to 12 percent in Colorado and 6 percent nationally. Texas\u2019\u00a0teenage birth rate remains, though, the fifth-highest in the nation, and three of the experts we contacted suggested that the difficulty of accessing contraceptives in Texas is part of the problem.", "Drilling down on the $1.1 billion figure", "Dyson gets the gist of the National Campaign\u2019s research right, but his particular wording misrepresents exactly what goes into their $1.1 billion figure, and where that comes from.", "The National Campaign gets their public cost estimates by comparing teenage mothers to 20-to-21-year-old mothers on several factors, including the mothers\u2019 and their children\u2019s odds of participating in state and federal welfare programs, the children\u2019s increased chances of incarceration, and the taxable incomes of these women, their children, and their children\u2019s fathers.", "\"Based on this increased risk for participation among teen mothers and the total number of teen births, we then estimate the additional number of participants in various government programs,\" Pika said. \"Then, based on the cost per participant in each of those programs, we then estimate the total cost of teen childbearing.\"", "The three factors Dyson names -- health care, foster care, and lost tax revenue -- certainly constitute part of the National Campaign\u2019s measurement, but increased risk of incarceration and social welfare programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families are also part of the National Campaign\u2019s full $1.1 billion figure for Texas.", "Importantly, that cost also isn\u2019t only on the shoulder of Texas taxpayers; the loss in tax revenue and Medicaid costs, for example, are national. The National Campaign\u2019s research more accurately means that Texas teenage births cost taxpayers $1.1 billion (instead of \"teenage births\" costing \"Texas taxpayers,\" as Dyson phrased it).", "The National Campaign also is careful to emphasize that their estimate is just that. \"It\u2019s useful to keep in mind that this is an estimate,\" said Pika, \"based on the best available research on the consequences of teen childbearing, rather than a dollar-for-dollar accounting of exactly what was spent on teen mothers.\"", "To that end, the National Campaign pegs the Texas figure as \"at least\" $1.1 billion, leaving open the possibility that it could be more.", "Our ruling", "In the course of comparing the results of Colorado\u2019s public contraceptives program to Texas\u2019 high teen birth rate and abstinence-only program, Michael Eric Dyson said, \"Teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion in health care, foster care\u00a0and lost tax revenue in 2010 alone.\"", "Dyson\u2019s stat comes from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, who experts say is a reliable source. But Dyson misrepresents their data in three minor ways: He gives an incomplete list of the components of that cost; he implies that teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion when, in fact, births in Texas cost all taxpayers $1.1 billion; and he doesn\u2019t mention that the National Campaign\u2019s stat is a conservative estimate on an issue that\u2019s difficult to quantify.", "Dyson gets the gist of the statistic right, though he was inartful in his phrasing.
