And according to NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell, the notion that Snipes is trying to engineer a victory for Democrats is even more off-base because, as Mitchell claimed, Snipes is a Republican.", "\"We should also point out that Brenda Snipes in Broward County is a Republican appointed by former governor, then-Gov. Jeb Bush,\" Mitchell said Nov. 12. \"So she was put in by a Republican governor after the mess that we all remember from 2000. And she\u2019s hardly a Democratic official, or someone doing the bidding of the Democratic candidates there.\"", "Mitchell is wrong about Snipes\u2019 party affiliation: She\u2019s a Democrat. But, again, it\u2019s important to note we\u2019ve seen no evidence Snipes has done anything untoward on her party\u2019s behalf during the Florida recount.", "Mitchell is apparently not the only person confused about Snipes\u2019 political affiliation.", "In an interview with CNN, Snipes said she recently corrected someone who mistakenly believed she was a Republican:", "\"I was talking with a woman today, as she came into our office, and she made some statement \u2014 a partisan statement \u2014 and she said, \u2018I know that you\u2019re a Republican.\u2019 I said, \u2018I have been a Democrat all my life.\u2019 In this position, I have been very focused on party, because I want to treat all of the voters in Broward County the same. And I think if you\u2019d ask the voters, I have that reputation.\"", "At look at Snipes\u2019 biography on the Broward County supervisor of elections website also lists her as a Democrat.", "Countless media reports also refer to Snipes\u2019 Democratic affiliation.
