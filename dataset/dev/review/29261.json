They were of high to moderate quality\u201d.Sagoe said his analysis did not specifically investigate prevalence of skin bleaching in South Africa. \u201cThat work was done by Dlova and her colleagues and their results support the assertion that \u2018600 women completed the questionnaire, of whom 32.7% reported using skin lightening products\u2019.\u201d Dlova\u2019s study did not make a finding on how many women buy skin bleaching creams. But she has also researched the best-selling skin-lightening creams in Durban. In 2012, she found that \u201cof the 10 top\u2010selling creams nine (90%) were found to contain banned or illegal compounds\u201d.", "What goes into skin lighteners?Known as skin-bleaching, skin-lightening, depigmenting, skin-evening and skin-brightening agents, chemicals that lighten the skin are commonly used in skin preparations globally. This is according to a 2016 paper on skin lightening use in sub-Saharan Africa, co-authored by Prof Lester Davids while at the University of Cape Town. He was also interviewed by UK documentary maker Unreported World in a much viewed episode on South Africa. Skin bleaching creams are used cosmetically to lighten skin colour or to treat dermatological conditions. They work by reducing the concentration or production of melanin. This is the pigment that gives skin its colour and helps protect it from the sun.While many substances go into them, Davids\u2019s paper identifies the \u201cBig Four\u201d: mercury-containing compounds, hydroquinone and its derivatives, potent corticosteroids and retinoids. Skin lightening products containing mercury and hydroquinones are banned in South Africa. (Note: According to the UK\u2019s National Health Service, many alternative skin-lightening products containing natural ingredients are available online and in shops without prescription. These are legal and unlikely to be harmful, but there's no guarantee they work.)Davids previously told Africa Check it was difficult to keep track of how much of the ingredients of interest were in skin lightening products in South Africa, whether legal or illegal. This is because the country\u2019s Cosmetics, Toiletries and Fragrances Association considers \u201cskin brighteners\u201d to be a cosmetic, not a drug.\u201cAs soon as you label something as a cosmetic it falls under the CTFA,\u201d Davids said. Products not always accessible for testingProducts banned for their hydroquinone or mercury content were not \u201calways accessible for testing\u201d, he said. These ingredients could be imported separately \u2013 such as mercury for use in photography or paints - and then diverted to skin lighteners, he said.In South Africa using the word \u201clightening\u201d on products is banned, but the terms \u201cbrighteners\u201d or \u201ceven toners\u201d can be used. Products that contain bleaching agents in any quantity are also illegal.This is according to Adelia Pimentel, executive director of the CTFA. The cosmetics industry currently self-regulates but new rules expected in 2019 would try to keep track of illicit products smuggled into the country, she told Africa Check.", "Many skin lightening products were unregulated and might contain harmful substances, so there wasn\u2019t a public health danger \u201cper se\u201d in overestimating their use, Dr Maia Lesosky previously told Africa Check. Lesosky is an associate professor at the school of public health\u2019s epidemiology and biostatistics division at the University of Cape Town.\u201cOverestimation may lead to increased scrutiny by policy makers or such because there is a harm associated with [unregulated] product use.\u201d", "Calling it a \u201cscandal\u201d, an international documentary said a third of South African women buy illegal skin lightening creams. But the study they used was not nationally representative - it only surveyed 579 women attending two hospitals in Durban. A wider study found sub-Saharan Africa had a skin bleaching prevalence of 27.1%, but did not work out how widespread it was in South Africa. There aren\u2019t enough studies that represent all of South Africa, so it\u2019s difficult to gauge the country\u2019s use of skin bleachers.", "Please complete this form to receive the HTML sharing code.", "In this guide, we\u2019ve taken it back to basics to explain how to identify images and videos where not everything is as it appears to be.", "This step-by-step guide explains how to do a reverse image search to check whether the photo you saw on social media is the real thing.", "Zombie claims don\u2019t bite, but they\u2019re annoying.
