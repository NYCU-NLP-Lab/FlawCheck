["By Robert Farley", "Posted on January 8, 2020", "Questioned by a Fox News reporter, former Vice President Joe Biden denied that he told then-President Barack Obama \u201cnot to go after [Osama] bin Laden\u201d in what turned out to be a successful mission to kill the 9/11 mastermind. The Republican National Committee immediately called it \u201can instance of Biden flat out lying.\u201d", "We wouldn\u2019t go that far, but Biden wasn\u2019t giving the whole story.", "In his initial recounting of the events leading up to bin Laden\u2019s death on May 2, 2011, Biden portrayed Obama as a decisive leader who decided to move forward with the daring raid over the vice president\u2019s advice. In the mid-2011 and early 2012, Biden recounted how he advised Obama during a national security strategy meeting in April 2011 to wait for further confirmation that bin Laden was actually in the compound in Pakistan before acting. That\u2019s the version being seized upon by the GOP as a contradiction of Biden\u2019s recent denial that he advised Obama not to go after bin Laden.", "But Biden also \u2014 months later and ever since \u2014 claimed that in a one-on-one meeting with Obama immediately after the security council meeting, he told the president to \u201cfollow your instincts,\u201d knowing that the president was inclined at that time to move forward with the raid.", "We can\u2019t confirm what Biden may have told Obama privately. But if Biden\u2019s account about his one-one-one advice to Obama is correct, he wasn\u2019t fully forthcoming about his position when it served Obama\u2019s reelection bid, and his various versions over time haven\u2019t always comported with one another.", "There is renewed interest in Biden\u2019s contemporaneous position on the bin Laden raid in the wake of Trump\u2019s decision to target Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike at Baghdad\u2019s airport on Jan. 2.", "Here\u2019s Biden\u2019s exchange with Fox News reporter Peter Doocy on Jan. 3:", "Doocy, Jan. 3: As commander in chief, if you were ever handed a piece of intelligence that said you could stop an imminent attack on Americans \u2014 but you have to use an airstrike to take out a terror leader \u2014 would you pull the trigger?", "Biden: Well we did \u2014 the guy\u2019s name was Osama bin Laden.", "Doocy: Didn\u2019t you tell President Obama not to go after bin Laden that day?", "Biden: No, I didn\u2019t.", "The GOP put out a press release with a video of the exchange, and paired it with a video of Biden in 2012 recounting the April 2011 national security team meeting and saying, \u201cMr. President, my suggestion is, don\u2019t go.\u201d The release cites it as evidence that Biden \u201chas a long history of changing his tune on the bin Laden raid.\u201d", "We should note that Biden\u2019s comment \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t\u201d came in the middle of Doocy\u2019s question \u2014 after Doocy had said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell President Obama not to go after bin Laden\u201d but before Doocy said \u201cthat day.\u201d Biden has never said he advised Obama not to go after bin Laden, only that he thought the raid should not be undertaken until they had taken further steps to confirm bin Laden was actually at the compound in Pakistan.", "The following is a timeline of accounts Biden has given about his advice to Obama about the raid.", "Several weeks after the raid, at a time when Obama was gearing up for a reelection campaign, the New York Times on May 26, 2011 reported that Biden said at a Democratic fundraiser in late May 2011 \u201cthat he and others had counseled Mr. Obama to be more careful and cautious about the raid. But he said it was the president who made the decision to launch the daring action.\u201d", "\u201cI said \u2018wait another seven days for information,'\u201d Biden reportedly said, portraying Obama as a decisive leader \u201cwith the backbone of a ramrod.\u201d", "Biden gave a similar account at the House Democrats\u2019 annual retreat in Cambridge, Maryland. Biden told the Democrats that he advised the president in the April 2011 meeting not to immediately approve the raid on the Abbottabad compound.", "Biden, Jan. 27, 2012: The president, he went around the table with all the senior people, including the chiefs of staff, and he said, \u201cI have to make a decision. What is your opinion?\u201d", "\u2026 Every single person in that room hedged their bet except [then director of the Central Intelligence Agency] Leon Panetta. Leon said go. Everyone else said, 49, 51. It got to me, He said, \u201cJoe, what do you think?\u201d And I said, \u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t know we had so many economists around the table.\u201d I said, \u201cWe owe the man a direct answer. Mr. President, my suggestion is, don\u2019t go. We have to do two more things to see if he\u2019s there.\u201d He walked out and said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you my decision.\u201d The next morning he came down the diplomatic entrance \u2026 he turned to [national security adviser] Tom Donilon and said, \u201cGo.\u201d", "This was still during the time when Obama was seeking a second presidential term, and Biden told the New York Times he cited the anecdote to show that \u201cthis guy\u2019s got a backbone like a ramrod.\u201d", "Biden\u2019s account of his position in that meeting, which was confirmed by the White House at the time, is not in dispute among those that were there.", "In his 2014 memoir, Worthy Fights, Leon Panetta, Obama\u2019s director of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time of the National Security Council meeting in question, wrote (on page 318) that at the meeting, \u201cBiden argued that we still did not have enough confidence that bin Laden was in the compound, and he came out firmly in favor of waiting for more information.\u201d", "In his 2014 memoir, Duty, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote\u00a0that he and Biden were \u201cthe two primary skeptics\u201d of the raid during national security team meetings that were held in March and April 2011 to debate whether to strike the compound. Gates wrote that \u201cBiden\u2019s primary concern was the political consequences of failure.\u201d", "During the fateful meeting in question on April 28, 2011, Gates said \u201cBiden was against the operation.\u201d", "And in her 2014 memoir, Hard Choices, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote only that \u201cVice President Biden remained skeptical\u201d and had \u201cconcerns about the risks of a raid.\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t until a year after his initial account of the national security team meeting, during an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d that Biden added the detail about his private advice to Obama.", "Biden, May 6, 2012: President had a roll call. Everybody had some maybe yes, maybe no, I think on balance, \u201cGo.\u201d The only guy who had a full-throated, full-throated \u201cGo, Mr. President,\u201d was Leon Panetta. I walked out of that meeting as I usually do, I get to be the last guy to be with the president. We walked up toward the residence, toward his office and I knew he was going to go. And what I always tell him, when he said \u2014 looked at me again, I said, \u201cFollow your instincts, Mr. President. Your instincts have been close to unerring. Follow your instincts.\u201d I wanted him to take one more day to do one more test to see if he was there.", "During the third presidential debate between Obama and Republican Mitt Romney on Oct. 22, 2012, Obama noted Biden\u2019s position against immediately moving forward with the raid, and he did not mention anything about Biden telling him something else privately. Obama touted his decision to green-light the raid and mocked Romney for saying the U.S. \u201cshouldn\u2019t move heaven and earth to get one man\u201d (a claim that didn\u2019t capture the full context of Romney\u2019s words) and that they should\u2019ve asked Pakistan for permission.", "Obama added that \u201ceven some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did.\u201d", "In a look-back at Obama\u2019s first term for a New York Times Magazine article on Jan. 16, 2013, Biden said, \u201cI remember walking up to his office and saying, \u201cLook, follow your instincts, follow your instincts,\u201d and him coming down the next morning to say, \u201cGo.\u201d", "Another account emerged in 2015, at a time when Biden was still mulling a 2016 presidential run.", "In this account, given during remarks at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., where he talked about the legacy of former Vice President Walter Mondale, Biden said he did not offer a firm opinion during the National Security Council meeting about whether or not to go forward with the raid, and that he later told Obama privately \u201cthat I thought he should go, but follow his own instincts.\u201d", "Biden, Oct. 20, 2015: Well, I said, \u201cI think we should make one more pass with another UAV [Unmanned Aerial Vehicle] to see if it is him [Osama bin Laden].\u201d And, the reason I did that is I didn\u2019t want to take a position to go if that was not where [the president] was gonna go. So, as we walked out of the room, and walked upstairs, I told him my opinion \u2014 that I thought he should go, but follow his own instincts. But it would have been a mistake, imagine, if I had said in front of everyone, \u201cdon\u2019t go\u201d or \u201cgo,\u201d and his decision was a different decision. It undercuts that relationship. So, I never, on a difficult issue, never say what I think finally until I go up into the Oval with him alone.", "That account is at odds with his former claim in 2012, when he said that during the meeting he said, \u201cWe owe the man a direct answer. Mr. President, my suggestion is, don\u2019t go. We have to do two more things to see if he\u2019s there.\u201d", "In other words, contrary to Biden\u2019s claim that he did not offer a \u201cdon\u2019t go\u201d or \u201cgo\u201d opinion at the meeting out of fear that contradicting the president\u2019s final opinion would \u201cundercut\u201d his relationship with Obama, Biden in his 2012 retelling said he provided a \u201cdirect answer\u201d and that his answer was \u201cdon\u2019t go,\u201d at least not yet.", "Several days later, in an interview with CBS journalist Norah O\u2019Donnell that aired on Oct. 26, 2015, Biden was asked about the apparent discrepancy between his earlier accounts and the one he gave just a few days before. Biden said all of his versions were \u201ccompletely accurate\u201d but he said that until that recent speech he had never told \u201cthe whole story.\u201d", "Biden, Oct. 26, 2015: Everything I said was completely accurate. I just never until last Tuesday night told the whole story. We got down to the final decision and the president asked everyone\u2019s opinion. And everyone in the room said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a close call, Mr. President, probably.\u201d And it went back and forth. Two people for certain said absolutely do something. One, the CIA director said, \u201cGo.\u201d Two, the secretary of defense said, \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d", "I was the last guy in the room. In order to give the president the leeway he needed, I said, \u201cMr. President, there\u2019s one more thing we can do\u201d \u2014 where he had discussed about another pass to see whether it was bin Laden. I said, \u201cYou should do that and there\u2019d be still time to have the raid. But that\u2019s what I would do.\u201d Immediately, we got up, as we always do, and I walked out with the president. We walked up to the Oval. I said, \u201cMr. President, follow your instincts. Mine are you should do it, but follow your instincts.\u201d", "\u2026 The reporting was accurate when I said I didn\u2019t say, \u201cGo.\u201d And I didn\u2019t. What I said was, \u201cMr. President, try one more thing.\u201d And the reason for that was, imagine if I had said, \u201cMr. President, go,\u201d and he didn\u2019t go. And then bin Laden did something else bad, they would\u2019ve said, \u201cWell, everybody said, even his vice president said, to go, and he said no.\u201d Barack Obama made that decision knowing if it was wrong, his career was over. I wanted the public to know, this is a man with a backbone of steel. That\u2019s why I said it. And had I said, \u201cBut by the way, when I went up privately I told him to go,\u201d it would\u2019ve made it look like I was self-aggrandizing. It\u2019s long since passed. It was in the context of what the role of a vice president is. And that\u2019s exactly what happened.", "The Biden campaign says there are no contradictions between Biden\u2019s accounts, that there were two distinct occurrences: the larger security meeting and a later private meeting between Biden and Obama.", "\u201cAt the outset, the Vice President advised that we first obtain additional confirmation that bin Laden was indeed at the compound \u2014 but he did not say that the operation shouldn\u2019t ultimately go forward,\u201d a Biden campaign official told us. \u201cLater, in a one-on-one setting, the vice president urged President Obama to \u2018follow [his] instincts.'\u201d", "And when he told Obama to follow his instincts, the Biden campaign official said, it was with the understanding that it was Obama\u2019s inclination at that time to go ahead with the raid.", "As we said when we wrote about this back in 2015, \u201cThere are only two people who can say for sure what advice Biden gave to Obama in a private conversation as they left the meeting together and walked up the stairs. We have Biden\u2019s revised version, but for now Obama isn\u2019t revising his past statements.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
