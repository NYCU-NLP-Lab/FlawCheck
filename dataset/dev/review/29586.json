["Sen. John McCain has a long reputation as an opponent of pork-barrel spending, those billions of dollars for local projects earmarked quietly every year into massive federal spending bills.", "In the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2008,\u00a0McCain said Sen. Barack Obama, in his relatively brief senatorial career, has asked for $932-million in pork for his home state of Illinois. Just to be sure everyone heard it, McCain cited the number\u00a0three times.", "\"He has asked for $932-million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly\u00a0$1-million dollars for every day that he\u2019s been in the United States Senate,\" McCain said.", "In response, Obama noted, correctly, that he has eschewed any pork spending for fiscal 2009.", "Said Obama: \"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.\"", "McCain shot back that Obama did not suspend his requests for pork-barrel projects until after he was running for president, and then reminded viewers of that number again.", "\"He didn\u2019t happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932-million in requests,\" McCain said.", "And in case you missed it the first two times, McCain cited the number yet again a few minutes later.", "\"And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932-million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.\"", "We should note that PolitiFact has\n\nfound\n\nthat while McCain has a well-deserved reputation in Washington as a pork-buster, his record is not entirely pristine. For example, McCain in 2006 co-sponsored legislation that asked for $10-million for an academic center at the University of Arizona to honor the late\u00a0United\u00a0States\u00a0chief justice William Rehnquist.", "But as for his claim in the debate: Is it accurate?", "Obama, on his Web site, has listed every earmark he\u2019s requested \u2013 but not necessarily received \u2013 as a U.S. senator. It totals $931.3-million.", "McCain is also correct that it comes to nearly a million dollars for every day that Obama\u2019s been in the United States Senate, provided you include just working days.", "The math goes like this: Obama was elected in 2004 and took office January 3, 2005. Since then, there have been about 930 working days, as they are defined by most people, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, which would mean McCain would be completely right if he had specified working days.", "Technically, Obama's been \"in Congress\" for more than 1,350 days, if you count weekends. So how many points do you take off for McCain not saying \"every\n\nworking\n\nday\"? Not many. We say this claim is Mostly True.", "New York Times,\n\n\u201cFoe of Earmarks Has a Pet Cause of His Own,\u201d\n\nby Carl Hulse, Feb. 18, 2006", "Washington Post,\n\nAn Old Earmark of McCain\u2019s Surfaces,\n\nDec. 31, 2007", "Library of Congress,\n\nS. 2136,\n\n109th Congress", "Obama presidential Web site,\n\nObama fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 earmark requests", "Obama Senate Web site,\n\nObama Announces FY08 Federal Funding Requests", "CNN,\n\n\"Obama: No earmarks for 2009,\"\n\nby Drew Griffin and Scott Bronstein, April 15, 2008", "PolitiFact,\n\nMcCain's record on pork: Good, not perfect", "PolitiFact,\n\nMcCain's got Obama over a pork barrel", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
