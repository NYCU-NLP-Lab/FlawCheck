The picture shows a condition known as Trench foot which is caused by long immersion of feet in cold water or mud.  This picture has been shared by several users on Facebook with the same claim.  This photograph has been circulating on social media since 2018. One Vishnu Prakash\u2019s post on Facebook, with the same claim, has been shared more than 12,000 times.

Alt News compared the viral image with several other images available on the official website of the United States Marine Corps for further corroboration and found that the uniform is identical to that of the US Marines. Thus we were able to conclude that the person in the image is wearing the uniform of a US Marine and is not an Indian army soldier.   Similar misinformation has been circulated in the past. BJP MP Kirron Kher had posted an image of Russian army soldiers as Indian army men. Earlier this year, a still from a winter surfing video from Michigan, USA was viral as an Indian army soldier on duty in extremely cold weather.", "Donate Now", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
