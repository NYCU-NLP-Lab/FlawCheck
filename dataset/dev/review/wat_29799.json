The exchange, which took place in a noisy site crowded with workers, turned contentious as the worker repeatedly challenged Biden\u2019s responses, with Biden shouting at times and other workers and aides trying to cut off the exchange.", "At one point, according to media reports, the worker said to Biden, \"You\u2019re working for me, man.\" Biden\u2019s reply was not uniformly reported by the media, and video footage of the incident does not clearly capture all of the dialogue.", "WATCH: \"You\u2019re full of sh*t,\" @JoeBiden tells a man who accused him of \"actively trying to end our Second Amendment right.\"\"I support the Second Amendment,\" Biden adds while vising under-construction auto plant in Detroit. @CBSNews pic.twitter.com/sueOSBaY9P", "Some outlets, including CBS News and The Detroit News, reported that Biden responded, \"I\u2019m not working for you.

Don\u2019t be such a horse\u2019s a--.\"", "CNN\u2019s report was presented more like a transcript of the exchange, while other media accounts appeared to paraphrase it or edit it down. For example, Biden clearly says \"give me a break\" at the 1-minute mark in the video before saying \"don\u2019t be such a horse\u2019s a--.\" Neither the CBS nor Detroit News article included that phrase.", "The Facebook post includes a photo of Biden pointing his finger at the worker.
