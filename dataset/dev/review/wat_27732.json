["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Since the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans and their allies have claimed the Affordable Care Act slashes funding for Medicare, the federal healthcare program for seniors. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made almost identical claims in the 2012 presidential election as well.", "It appears the GOP playbook for the 2014 midterms will be similar.", "An early indication is in Florida\u2019s special election to replace the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., where the National Republican Congressional Committee is airing an ad hammering Democrat Alex Sink\u2019s support of Obamacare.", "The ad says the law includes a \"$700 billion cut from Medicare for seniors.\"", "We\u2019ve tackled this claim repeatedly throughout the years. There\u2019s some truth to it, but quite a bit of context is missing.", "Obamacare does not literally cut funding from the Medicare budget, but tries to bring down future health care costs in the program. Much of this is accomplished by reducing Medicare Advantage, a small subset of Medicare plans that are run by private insurers.", "President George W. Bush started Medicare Advantage in hopes the increased competition would reduce costs. But those plans are actually costlier than traditional Medicare. So the health care law reduces payments to private insurers.", "Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.", "The goal is get health care providers to increase their efficiency and quality of care instead of cutting benefits for seniors.", "The overall trend in Medicare spending is still expected to increase, even after the adjustments in the Affordable Care Act.", "How much are the spending reductions? That has changed throughout the years as estimates get updated.", "In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan scorekeeper of fiscal legislation, estimated that the reductions in Medicare spending in the Affordable Care Act we about $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. A more recent estimate from 2013 anticipated about $716 billion in Medicare savings from 2013-2022.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that the preferred plan of Republicans in 2012, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s budget, assumed the same cuts to Medicare.", "When asked to back up their claim, the NRCC pointed us to our own story from Nov. 2, 2012, about Young\u2019s last Congressional race. In it, we fact-checked an ad in which Young claimed he \"opposed $716 billion cut to Medicare.\"", "We gave it a Half True.", "Our ruling", "In its ad against Sink, the NRCC said the Affordable Care Act includes a \"$700 billion cut from Medicare for seniors.\" There is reduction in spending to Medicare outlays, but it\u2019s fueled by finding savings in the program, a move that Republicans actually supported in the Ryan budget. Medicare spending still increases in the coming years.", "We rate the statement Half True.", "National Republican Congressional Committee, \"Loyalty,\" viewed Feb. 12, 2014", "Email interview with Katie Prill, spokeswoman for National Republican Congressional Committee, Feb. 13, 2014", "PolitiFact, \"Romney says Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare,\" Oct. 3, 2012", "PolitiFact, \"Romney says Obama 'cuts' $716B from Medicare to pay for Obamacare,\" Aug. 20, 2012\n\n10 News,\u00a0interview with Mitt Romney, Aug. 15, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCongressional Budget Office,\u00a0Letter to the Honorable John Boehner providing an estimate for H.R. 6079, the Repeal of Obamacare Act, July 24, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCongressional Budget Office,\u00a0CBO's Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010, March 30, 2011\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCongressional Budget Office,\u00a0H.R. 2, Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act, February 18, 2011\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCongressional Budget Office,\u00a0The Long-Term Budgetary Impact of Paths for Federal Revenues and Spending Specified by Chairman Ryan, March 20, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPolitiFact, \"Medicare 'cuts' in the health care law will hurt seniors, says 60 Plus Association,\" Sept. 20, 2010\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation,\u00a0Health Reform and Medicare: Overview of Key Provisions, July 2010\n\nPolitiFact, \"$500 billion from Medicare for Obamacare, Mitt Romney says,\" June 16, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
