Bob McDonnell stands accused of sanctioning the biggest tax hike in Virginia history.\n\nThe charge has been lodged by Jamie Radtke, a Virginia Tea Party organizer, in protest of the General Assembly\u2019s approval last month of a transportation plan that could raise annual taxes by $1.25 billion a year. McDonnell backed the legislation and hailed its passage as \"an historic day in Virginia.\"\n\nThe bill is sitting on McDonnell\u2019s desk and Radtke is trying to pressure the governor not to sign it. She has started a Facebook page and a petition called \"Stop Largest Tax Increase in Virginia History.\" She also narrated a TV ad claiming that McDonnell, who many believe has national ambition, \"pushed the largest tax increase in Virginia history.\" The commercial was sponsored by the conservative Patriot Super PAC and aired in Iowa, site of the first presidential caucuses every four years.\n\nAll of this leads to an obvious question: Does the transportation bill call for the largest tax increase in Virginia history? We checked.\n\nThe package would generate $880 million a year in\u00a0new state revenues in 2018 when it is fully phased in, according to a report by the House Appropriations Committee. About $680 million of that sum would come from tax increases.\n\nThe legislation would replace the current 17.5-cent per-gallon gas tax with a 3.5 percent tax on gasoline and 6 percent diesel tax at the wholesale level. It would raise the 5 percent sales tax to 5.3 percent and increase the 3 percent motor vehicle tax sales tax to 4.3 percent. It also counts on Congress passing legislation that would give states authority to compel online retailers to collect sales tax.\n\nIn addition, Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads would be empowered to impose a 0.7 percent local sales tax and other regional levies that could raise a total of $568 million a year for transportation by 2018.\n\nWhen you combine the new tax revenues for the state with the potential new levies flowing into\u00a0Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, the tax package comes to about $1.25 billion a year\n\nWe asked Radtke to back up her claim that it all adds up to Virginia\u2019s largest tax increase. \"I\u2019m slammed and don\u2019t have time to pull all that for you right now,\" she replied in a March 5 email. Radtke added that former Gov. Mark Warner \"had the biggest tax increase in 2004, which was $1.4 billion over two years. This one is $1 billion every year. I will see if I can get you more data later.\"\n\nRadtke never got back to us.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Warner\u2019s 2004 tax increase, often described as record-breaking when it passed, originally generated about $700 million a year. So in terms of raw dollars, Radtke has a point: This year\u2019s take hike, with a potential of producing $1.25 billion annually for state and local coffers, would set a high-water mark.\n\nBut Radtke may not have chosen the most meaningful way to compare financial data from different points in time. \u00a0Several analysts urged us to account for inflation.\n\nWe followed their advice and found that Warner\u2019s tax hike, in today\u2019s dollars, comes to about $860 million a year. That still falls below the $1.25 billion potential of the bill that awaits McDonnell\u2019s signature. \u00a0\n\nWarner, however, \u00a0is not the only governor in Virginia history who pushed through a tax increase that can be compared to the current plan.\n\nIn 1986, Gerald Baliles signed a package of tax hikes that raised $422 million for transportation. Adjusted for inflation, it comes out to $893 million in 2013 dollars. That doesn\u2019t beat this year\u2019s bill, either.\n\nBut we got a different result when we went back to 1966 and examined landmark legislation signed by Gov. Mills Godwin that created the state\u2019s sales tax.\n\nThe legislation phased in a 3 percent state sales tax over about three years to aid public education, help create Virginia\u2019s community college system and pay for some transportation and administrative expenses. In addition, the law allowed counties and cities to enact a 1 percent sales tax, and all localities did that, according to a 1970 publication by the University of Virginia.\n\nThe new levies brought in $282 million during the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1970, according to a report that year by the Department of Taxation. Adjusted for inflation, that comes to $1.68 billion today and easily outpaces the tax increase that McDonnell has endorsed.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRadtke said that the transportation package approved by the General Assembly this year amounts to the largest tax increase in Virginia history. Using raw dollars, she\u2019s correct. But that\u2019s not the whole story.\n\nThe value of a dollar changes over time. When inflation is factored, the value of legislation approved in 1966 that created the state\u2019s sales tax would be $1.67 billion annually today. That exceeds the $1.25 billion-a-year potential of this year\u2019s bill.\n\nRadtke\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information.
