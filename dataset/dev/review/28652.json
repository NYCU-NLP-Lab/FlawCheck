According to state data, the number of registered voters exceeded the votes cast by nearly 388,000, as of Nov. 1.", "The state of Wisconsin favored Democratic presidential candidates for more than three decades, until Republican Donald Trump broke the trend in 2016, when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by a margin of less than 30,000 votes.", "The state continued to be a battleground in 2020, as former Vice President Joe Biden was projected the winner on Nov. 4 by an unofficial margin of roughly just 20,000 votes.", "The Trump campaign announced it would seek a recount.

Wisconsin has Election Day registration, which means that the voter registration numbers are likely even higher than the total reported on the state website on Nov. 1.", "As for votes cast for president in 2020, the New York Times was reporting on Nov. 4 a total of 3,297,137 votes in Wisconsin.", "So, there were nearly 388,000 more voters registered in Wisconsin than there were votes cast \u2014 contrary to the claims in the social media posts.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
