["A Facebook meme lists fabricated statistics about nefarious activity among members of Congress.", "Whose pants are the most on fire: the NBA, the NFL, Congress or Facebook memes?", "Several readers sent us Facebook messages this week asking about a meme popping up on their newsfeed. It\u2019s a list of statistics about crime, corruption and generally bad behavior, and it asks the viewer to guess if the list describes players in the NBA or the NFL. Surprise! It says it\u2019s actually\u00a0describing Congress.", "The meme struck us as suspect right off the bat.", "It says, of Congress\u2019 535 members:", "Wowza. One version on Facebook was posted Sept. 18 and already has more than 328,000 shares, The meme has appeared on Reddit a few times this week, too.", "Our friends at Snopes and FactCheck.org debunked the claims in this image years ago. But with the NFL\u2019s current scandal concerning spousal and child abuse, it makes sense that this meme is circulating again.", "So we\u2019re going to debunk it again.", "We don\u2019t dispute that some lawmakers are involved in nefarious activities. Take, for example, former Rep. Trey Radel, R-Fla., who resigned earlier this year after he was caught buying cocaine from a federal agent.", "There\u2019s no comprehensive database about all congressional crime and generally unsavory behavior, so we can\u2019t come up with the real numbers on our own. But we know enough about where the meme originated to say that these statistics can\u2019t be trusted.", "We searched the news, Congressional Quarterly membership profiles and other sources and couldn\u2019t find anywhere near 84 arrests for drunk driving, 14 arrests for drug-related charges, 36 accusations of spousal abuse or any of these other accusations. We\u2019re not even sure how you\u2019d measure things like indirectly bankrupting a business or a person\u2019s bad credit.", "The meme gives no author or source information. However, Snopes examined a near-identical 2012 version that references a 1999 series of articles by Capitol Hill Blue, an online politics publication. (Capitol Hill Blue has had several issues\u00a0with credibility in the past.)", "Keep in mind that if these statistics were true -- and we\u2019re reasonably certain they\u2019re not -- they\u2019re 15 years old. Only 100 members of the current Congress were in office in 1999, when Capitol Hill Blue published the stories.", "The Capitol Hill Blue articles say the authors\u2019 research revealed each one of the statistics listed above, though sometimes with slightly different wording. (With one exception: the article says 29 members have been accused of spousal abuse, rather than 36.)", "The authors mention \"public records, past newspaper articles, civil court cases and criminal records,\" but do not quote specific documents. They also say plainly of some of their sources, \"We have talked with former associates and business partners who have been left out in the cold by people they thought were friends.\" So these sources possibly had an agenda in talking to Capitol Hill Blue.", "We can\u2019t even check which members of Congress Capitol Hill Blue is talking about. The article says, \"We will not run lists of every member who has written a bad check, punched somebody out or been charged with slapping a spouse.\"", "All of this makes it difficult to take these allegations seriously.", "Even further, the series has been removed from Capitol Hill Blue\u2019s website. It\u2019s only accessible through the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, which periodically saves web pages. As far as we can tell, it was removed mid\u00a02013. (In the last version that was saved, editors had removed the statistics from the article completely.)", "We reached out to Capitol Hill Blue for comment but haven\u2019t heard back.", "Our ruling", "A Facebook meme says Congress includes 36 people accused of spousal abuse, 84 arrested for drunk driving in the past year, 71 with terrible credit\u00a0and more.", "These accusations appear to be fabricated. The statistics come from an article written 15 years ago, and the original source, Capitol Hill Blue, has removed the original article\u00a0from its website. Congress\u2019 record isn\u2019t blemish-free, by any means, but these statistics have no basis in fact. We rate this meme Pants on Fire!", "Facebook, NBA vs. NFL meme, Sept. 18, 2014", "Capitol Hill Blue, \"Congress: America\u2019s Criminal Class,\" Aug. 1999", "Snopes, \"Congress Mend,\" April 2012", "FactCheck.org, \"An Unlawful Congress?\" April 22, 2009", "Advanced\u00a0Congressional Quarterly\u00a0search, Sept. 23, 2014", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
