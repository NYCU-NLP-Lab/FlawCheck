He\u2019s an awful pick. He\u2019s ancient, showing pretty severe signs of dementia, doesn\u2019t believe in legalizing weed, wrote a bill that is a huge contributor to our mass incarceration problem, oh yeah, and he\u2019s a creepy rapist.

Donald Trump was 70 at his inauguration, would be 74 if he is reelected and 78 if he served the full term. Ronald Reagan was 69 when he took office and ended his presidency at age 77, the oldest president at retirement.", "While\u00a0the \"ancient\" charge appeared to\u00a0relate\u00a0to Biden's\u00a0possible difficulty caring out his public duties, there are a number of\u00a0people in public service who are in their mid- to late 70s if not older. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key figure in the White House efforts to fight\u00a0the COVID-19 pandemic, is 79. Among current serving members of Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, is 80; Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, is 86; Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., is 86; Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is 87; Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., is 86; Sen.

We rate this as missing context.", "The Trump campaign, the president, and some GOP members have tried to raise public concern and\u00a0score political points by claiming\u00a0that Biden is suffering from dementia. The News & Observer did a fact check of a charge by Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., who repeatedly accused the former vice president of mental deficiency. \u201cHe does have signs of dementia,\u201d Murphy told the newspaper, adding that Biden is not \u201cphysically up or mentally up for the job.\u201d He cited Biden\u2019s speech patterns and said \u201cI don\u2019t think one has to be a rocket scientist\u201d to see it.", "According to the National Institute of Aging, a medical assessment of dementia includes medical history, physical exam and neurological tests. It can also include cognitive tests, laboratory tests and brain scans. There is no information in the public record regarding any such test of Biden.", "Regarding Biden's occasional halting or halting speaking pattern, the former vice president has acknowledged a\u00a0lifelong struggle with stuttering. According to The Atlantic, which reported extensively on the issue, \"His verbal stumbles have voters worried about his mental fitness. Maybe they\u2019d be more understanding if they knew he\u2019s still fighting a stutter.\"", "More:Fact check: Joe Biden called troops 'stupid bastards,' but only 'jokingly'", "The issue has been\u00a0clouded by politics, particularly by the Trump campaign and the president, to portray \"Sleepy Joe\" Biden has being mentally unfit for the job. Public polling, however, has cut both ways on the issue, with a Fox News poll in July\u00a0finding that\u00a047% of voters thought Biden had the mental soundness to serve effectively as president, compared with 43% for Trump.", "Our\u00a0assessment: Dementia is a condition that must be determined by medical tests and there is no evidence linking Biden to it. We rate this claim as false.", "Biden's position would liberalize laws governing marijuana but would stop short of legalizing it. His official policy position from the\u00a0campaign\u00a0website: \"Biden believes no one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, he will decriminalize cannabis use and automatically expunge prior convictions. And, he will support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes, leave decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and reschedule cannabis as a schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts.\"", "At a campaign stop in New Hampshire in February, Biden responded to a query by marijuana legalization advocate Don Murphy of the Marijuana Policy Project by saying, \"I think it is at the point where it has to be, basically, legalized,\" POLITICO reported, quoting from a recording of Biden's remarks. Biden's campaign told POLITICO that in his remarks on the recording, he was simply \"restating his cannabis policy,\" which includes eliminating criminal penalties linked to marijuana, erasing marijuana-related criminal records and \"letting states set their own policies regarding legalization of recreational marijuana while further effort is made to study the effects of cannabis use.\"", "Our assessment: Biden does not support legalizing the use of marijuana, rather comes up to the edge by calling for de-criminalizing it.

From 1980-94, the nation's prison population more than doubled on a per capita basis, from 139 prisoners per 100,000 American residents to 387, according to the federal government's Bureau of Justice Statistics for 1994. By contrast, from 1994 \u2014 the year the crime bill was passed \u2014 to 1995, the inmate population increased by 6.7%.

In 1989, the federal and state inmate population swelled by a whopping 13.5% as 84,764 new inmates joined the prison ranks.", "Our assessment: While the crime bill did increase the prison population in states, it did not bring about a mass incarceration relative to earlier years. Rather, it coincided with a slowdown in the annual grown of the state and federal prison population. We rate this claim as false.", "As there have never been any suggestions of any formal rape accusation against Biden, the claim appears to refer to suggestions of over-familiarity in public settings with some women and children. As the campaign season got underway in 2019, seven women\u00a0accused Joe Biden of touching them in an overly familiar way that made them feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, Slate reported. None accused him of making sexual gestures or sexual harassment, or\u00a0attempted rape.", "As an\u00a0example,\u00a0Vail Kohnert-Yount, who said she was a White House intern in the spring of 2013, told The Washington Post that she tried to exit the basement of the West Wing one day when she was asked to step aside so Biden could enter. She\u00a0said\u00a0Biden approached her to introduce himself and shake her hand.", "\u201cHe then put his hand on the back of my head and pressed his forehead to my forehead while he talked to me,\"\u00a0 Kohnert-Yount said in a statement to the newspaper.\u00a0\"I was so shocked that it was hard to focus on what he was saying. I remember he told me I was a \u2018pretty girl.\u2019\"", "Biden, on his Twitter account,\u00a0responded to such accusations by issuing a video April 3, 2019, saying that he\u00a0hugged people or grabbed their shoulders because of a desire to \u201cmake a human connection\u201d and comfort people during stressful times.\u00a0He noted that \u201csocial norms are changing\u201d and pledged to be more\u00a0\u201cmindful and respectful of people\u2019s personal space.\u201d", "Our assessment: While Biden has been accused on several occasions of being overfly friendly, touchy, or at times \"creepy,\" he has never been accused of being a rapist. We rate this claim as false.", "After publication, the Instagram user, Elizabeth Hudy, noted in a lengthy reply that the use of \"ancient\" was done as \"artistic flair.\" Regarding dementia, she said, \"Just because he has not taken any tests of mental fitness does not mean that his struggles do not exist.\"", "On the crime bill, she noted that\u00a0we said it had increased incarceration (just note as dramatically as in previous years) but added,\u00a0\"we agree! It seems only that your final consensus disagrees with us both. Odd.\" As for taking issue with her charges of Biden as a \"rapist,\" she said, \"Biden is a rapist \u2014 this is perhaps your most deplorable instance of ignoring reality. Diluting what these women experienced to nothing more than 'over-familiarity' is disgusting.\"", "Our research finds that the issues raised in the\u00a0attack are either false, unprovable, or in the case of marijuana legalization, accurate.
