Barack Obama roused the crowd at a Feb. 19, 2008, rally in Houston, Texas, when he went after inequities in corporate America.", "\"I believe in the free market,\" Obama said. \"I know Texans believe in entrepreneurship. We are an independent and a self-reliant people. We don't believe in government doing what we can do for ourselves.\"", "\"But when we've got CEOs making more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers are making in a year... \" pause for applause from the audience, \"and it's the CEOs who are getting a tax break and workers are left with nothing, then something is wrong, and something has to change.\"", "Finding information to evaluate Obama's statistic was not easy.

Assuming a 40-hour work week, with 50 work weeks a year, the 10-minute average salary of the highest-paid CEOs is $12,083. At this salary, it would take 30 minutes to exceed the annual salary for a full-time worker.", "\u2022 Now in the same\n\nForbes\n\nreport on CEO compensation, Apple CEO Steve Jobs is listed as the highest-paid boss of America's 500 biggest companies at $646.6-million a year.
