Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch asserted while promoting a fall summit of small-business owners and officials of Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s administration.\n\n\"You probably already know we lead the nation in making cheese, and you definitely know the Packers will always be at the top,\" Kleefisch said while delivering the governor\u2019s statewide radio address Nov. 1, 2012. \"But did you know that Wisconsin still ranks first among the 50 states in manufacturing jobs per capita? That\u2019s right!\"\n\nKleefisch\u2019s radio statement also ran as an opinion piece that was published by various new outlets.\n\nIt\u2019s well documented that Walker promised in the 2010 governor\u2019s race that Wisconsin would add 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his first term, in January 2015. Through nearly two years of his four-year term, job gains total 31,911.\n\nIt\u2019s also pretty well known that Wisconsin has lost a big chunk of its manufacturing sector going back a decade or more.\n\nSo is it possible the state is still the king of making things?\n\nThere\u2019s more than one way to skin this statistical cat, but Wisconsin scores high on several manufacturing-job measures.\n\nManufacturing dependency: The factory sector here employs a bigger share of the state's workers than any other state except Indiana, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on Oct. 7, 2012.\n\nIdaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists Intl. reported in March 2012 that \"Indiana is 86% more concentrated in manufacturing than average and just nudges Wisconsin for the top spot in our analysis.\" Indiana is home to Subaru and Honda auto plants, which give the state a boost.\n\nManufacturing vs. government jobs: Calculations by the Wisconsin Budget Project have shown that Wisconsin and Indiana are neck-and-neck for the highest ratio of manufacturing jobs to government jobs in the nation -- a ratio viewed by some as a good measure of a state\u2019s economic health.\n\nBut Kleefisch referred to a third measure: Manufacturing jobs per capita.\n\nWe located U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports and crunched the numbers behind her claim. We separately enlisted Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Budget Project, an arm of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families.\n\nWisconsin -- as Kleefisch claimed -- tops Indiana and every other state when you compare factory jobs to the overall state population.\n\nPeacock took a slightly different tack, comparing those jobs to the overall pool of potential workers -- the non-institutional population age 16 and older.\n\n\"Wisconsin is #1, and by a much larger margin than I anticipated,\" Peacock said. \"What I found is that 10 percent of Wisconsin\u2019s population age 16 and older works in manufacturing. Indiana is #2 at 9.6 percent, followed by Iowa at 9.1 percent, and Kansas at 7.5 percent. \u00a0The national average is 4.9 percent.\"\n\nThat\u2019s good news and bad news, Peacock said.\n\nIt\u2019s a point of pride -- and manufacturing jobs are extremely important for Wisconsin. But the state economy might be stronger if it diversified and became less dependent upon a sector that will probably continue to decline as a percentage of the national workforce, Peacock said.\n\nKleefisch, though, is on target with the numbers.\n\nPart of the explanation is that Wisconsin dropped a smaller share of its manufacturing jobs than many other big factory-reliant states in the 2000s. Those job losses in the sector began to reverse in about January 2010, both nationally and in Wisconsin. Walker took office in January 2011.\n\nStill, though, Wisconsin is 150,000 manufacturing jobs short of its January 2000 total, according to September 2012 federal figures.\n\nOur rating\n\nKleefisch claimed that Wisconsin \"still ranks first among the 50 states in manufacturing jobs per capita.\"\n\nEconomists debate the wisdom of heavy reliance on that sector, but Kleefisch accurately describes the state\u2019s ranking.\n\nWe rate her statement True.", "Governor\u2019s weekly radio address, archived for Nov. 1, 2012\n\nInterview with Casey Himebauch, spokesperson, Lt.
