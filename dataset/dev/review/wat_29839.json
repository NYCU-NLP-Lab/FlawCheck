Sending out phony e-card notifications is therefore an effective method of camouflaging viruses and inducing unwitting recipients into clicking on links that install malicious programs onto their computers.", "A wave of malicious messages (like the one reproduced above) sent out in June 2007 employed that very technique, arriving in inboxes bearing subject lines such as \"You've received a postcard from a family member!\" The messages contained URLs that recipients were supposed to visit to retrieve their e-cards, but those URLs actually pointed to servers hosting a variety of malware (including a variant of the Storm Trojan, \"an aggressive piece of malware that has been hijacking computers to serve as attacker bots\" since early 2007) that was furtively installed onto victims' PCs. (Generally, only unpatched Windows-based systems were vulnerable.)", "However, although the fake greeting card or postcard lure for delivering viruses may be used again in the future, warnings like the ones referenced above are several years old and no longer pose any threat to computer users who have relatively up-to-date anti-virus software. For the most part, messages currently forwarded by well-intended people to warn others about the Postcard virus merely contribute to confusion by including hoax elements within them, as well as links to our article about the \"Virtual Card for You\" hoax. Other versions of the postcard virus warning erroneously combine it with elements of the Invitation virus hoax:", "Get this E-mail message sent around to your contacts ASAP.
