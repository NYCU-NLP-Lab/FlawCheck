["About this rating", "In August 2017, as an odd story appeared about President Donald Trump's strategist and former Breitbart editor-in-chief Steve Bannon calling a New Republic writer and rambling about everything from white nationalism to foreign policy, an image appeared separately showing him with a bloody lip and collar:", "This was not a genuine photograph of Steve Bannon. It was created and posted by satire outlet The Onion on 14 August 2017, and published with the headline: \"Nervous Steve Bannon Binge-Eats Entire Class of Interns Amid Calls for Removal\".", "The humor site utilized a genuine photograph of Bannon and then added a little blood near his lips and collar.
