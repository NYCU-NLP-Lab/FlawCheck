Del. Scott Lingamfelter, R-Prince William, has proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow an unspecified portion to be spent on job training and education for veterans. The measure would have to be passed two years in a row by legislators and then approved by voters before it would become law.", "The VEA, which represents about 50,000 teachers and public education professionals, says schools can\u2019t afford to lose any funding. In a Jan. 2 blog post, the organization said state support for public schools still hasn\u2019t recovered from cuts during the Great Recession. \"School funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation,\" the VEA wrote.", "We\u2019re not taking sides on Lingamfelter\u2019s resolution. But we did wonder whether the VEA\u2019s claim about about the 16 percent drop in state support for schools, when adjusted for inflation, is correct.", "Robley Jones, the VEA\u2019s director of government relations and research, told us the figure came from a study released in August by the Commonwealth Institute, a liberal think tank.", "The institute updated its findings in November and now predicts that public education spending, when adjusted for inflation, will drop by 17 percent between the 2008-09 school year and the 2015-16 year. The calculation is largely based on data of past spending and inflation rates. The finding also assumes that the General Assembly will not adjust its education budget for this school year and that inflation rates will not markedly change through mid 2016.", "We did our own rough calculations, seeking to avoid assumptions about future budget levels and inflation. That meant focusing on data available from 2008 through 2014. We relied on a 10-year spread sheet on public school spending supplied by the Virginia Department of Education and an inflation calculator furnished online by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here\u2019s what we found:", "Schools may recoup a small portion of its losses this budget year, which began July 1, 2014. The state is budgeted to pay an average of $4,983 per student -- a 3 percent increase over the previous school year. The national inflation rate during the final half of 2014 was nearly flat.", "We should finally note that the state is one of three funding sources for public education. On average in 2013, school systems received about 51 percent of their money from their locality, 41 percent from the state and 8 percent from the federal government. The state contributes higher shares to poorer localities and lower shares to wealthier ones.", "Data taking into account all three money sources shows an average total of $11,316 was spent per Virginia student in the 2008-09 school year and that fell to $11,257 in 2012-13, the latest year available. When adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s an 8.6 percent drop.", "The VEA\u2019s comment, however, was clearly focused on state funding levels and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll judge it on.", "Our ruling", "The VEA says the state\u2019s \"funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation.\"", "Data we gathered shows that Virginia\u2019s funding per student, when adjusted for inflation, dropped by roughly 16.3 percent between the 2008-09 school and the 2013-14 year.", "We rate the VEA\u2019s statement True.", "Virginia Education Association, \"Let\u2019s do right by veterans and students,\" Jan. 2, 2015.", "Emails and interview with Robley Jones, director of government relations and research for the Virginia Education Association, Jan. 6, 2015.", "Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission, \"Special Report: State Spending on Standards of Quality (SOQ) Costs, 2010 Update,\" December 2010.", "State Budget, Appendix A,\" Aid for Public Education,\" 2014-2015.", "State Budget, Appendix B, \"Aid for Public Education\", 2015-2016.", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, \"Consumer Price Index Detailed Report Tables,\" 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014.", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, CPI Inflation Calculator, assessed Jan. 8, 2015..", "Virginia Lottery, \"Virginia Lottery revenue distribution,\" 1989-2014.", "Legislative Information Service, HJ536, Dec. 29, 2014.", "Virginia Education Association, \"Who we are,\" assessed Jan. 8, 2015.", "Interview with Michael Cassidy, president of The Commonwealth Institute, Jan. 7, 2015.", "Interview with Mitchell Cole, research assistant at The Commonwealth Institute, Jan. 7, 2015", "Interviews and emails with Charles Pyle, spokesman for the Virginia Department of Education, Jan. 6-8, 2015.", "Virginia Department of Education, \"Summary of the Amended 2008-2010 Biennial Budget,\" March 5, 2010.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
