Twenty states have joined the lawsuit, including West Virginia.", "Morrisey, as attorney general, signed the lawsuit on behalf of the state. His campaign told PolitiFact in 2018 that he does not intend to leave people uninsured, calling instead for coverage to be reinstated within the Affordable Care Act\u2019s successor. However, President Donald Trump and other Republicans have not yet offered a plan to do so.", "Defenders of the law, like Petsonk, warn that overturning the law could make it hard for Americans to secure health coverage.", "So is Petsonk correct that a ruling supporting the plaintiffs \"would eliminate health care for over 800,000 West Virginians\"?

(The analysis excluded Americans over 65, since they receive health coverage under Medicare and their ability to secure coverage would not be affected if the law is struck down.)", "This is a bit lower than 800,000.", "However, the bigger caveat is that the group didn\u2019t say that this many people in West Virginia would see their health insurance eliminated, which was the word Petsonk used in his tweet.", "Instead, a plaintiff\u2019s victory at the Supreme Court, the group said, means people with pre-existing conditions \"could face higher premiums, face benefit exclusions, or be denied coverage altogether \u2026 if they ever needed to turn to the individual market for coverage.\"", "In other words, some of these West Virginians could be forced to pay more or see certain conditions excluded from coverage. These are negative outcomes, but they fall short of having their coverage eliminated.", "So how many people could see their coverage go away entirely? The Center for American Progress report pegged that number at 162,000, a substantially lower number.", "Another estimate has been published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
