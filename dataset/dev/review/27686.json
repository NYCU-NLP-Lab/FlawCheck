This happened nearly 4 years back, and has been revealed through a RTI which could compound the difficulties of the Modi government (translated).\u201d", "The report further says that an investigative journalist named Navneet Chaturvedi had filed a RTI and claimed that the government transferred 268 tonnes of gold abroad in July 2014, for which he has the relevant documents. It states, \u201cHe claims that the gold was with the RBI in June 2011, but in 2015 this was revealed and it was found that 268 tonnes of gold was missing from the RBI balance sheet.

The total gold stock of the Reserve Bank of India has remained consistent throughout, and has in fact increased marginally in 2017-18.", "Let us take 2013-14, the final year of the UPA-II regime. The RBI annual report 2013-14 states that the total volume of gold held by the Central bank is 557.75 tonnes, \u201cof which 292.26 metric tonnes are held as an asset of the Issue Department and the balance 265.49 metric tonnes is treated as part of the other assets of the banking department.\u201d It may be noted that \u2018Gold held in Issue Department\u2019 refers to gold which is held by the RBI within the country as a cover for the total currency notes issued, whereas \u2018Gold held in Banking Department\u2019 is gold which is held overseas.", "The annual report for 2017-18 states, \u201cThe Reserve Bank holds 566.23 metric tonnes of gold, of which 292.30 metric tonnes are held as backing for Notes issued as on June 30, 2018 (Table XII.6). The value of gold held as backing for notes issued increased by 7.70 per cent from `690.30 billion as on June 30, 2017 to `743.49 billion as on June 30, 2018, primarily on account of depreciation of Rupee vis-\u00e0-vis USD.\u201d", "The comparison of the numbers in the two reports viz. 2013-14 and 2017-18, clearly show that there has been not a decline in the volume of gold held, but in fact a modest increase of 8.48 tonnes, from 557.75 tonnes in 2013-14 to 566.23 tonnes in 2017-18. Moreover, the volume of gold held in the banking department has remained steady- it was 265.49 tonnes in 2013-14, which rose to 273.93 in 2017-18.

Simply put, this is a flawed reading of the balance sheet.", "The petitioner has only referred to the Issue Department of the balance sheet. Under this section, only the gold which is within the country is listed. Hence, the gold reserve of the RBI \u2018held outside India\u2019 is shown as nil. The gold which is kept outside India is reflected in the Banking Department of the balance sheet. The petitioner, by focusing only on one section of the balance sheet, ended up with a flawed understanding of the management of gold reserves of the RBI.", "The petitioner has conflated the gold assets of the Issue Department with the entire gold reserve of the RBI. As pointed out above, the gold assets which are not part of the Issue Department are placed under \u2018other assets\u2019 in the balance sheet of the Banking Department. As can be seen below, the gold \u2018Held outside India\u2019 section under Issue Department shows a blank, whereas the Banking Department reflects the overseas gold reserve in the \u2018Balances held abroad\u2019 section.", "The Reserve Bank of India meanwhile rubbished these recent \u2018reports\u2019, clarifying via a press note that no gold was transferred out of the country in 2014 or after, adding that \u201cit is a normal practice for Central Banks world over, to keep their gold reserves overseas with Central Banks of other countries like the Bank of England for safe custody.\u201d", "The claim that the Modi government secretly transported over 200 tonnes of gold overseas from the RBI\u2019s gold reserves is patently false, and premised on erroneous reading of the balance sheet of the central bank.", "Donate Now", "Arjun Sidharth is a writer with Alt News.
