SHO Rajendra Kumar said, \u201cThat day, this young man was drunk and roaming in the park. He closely passed a child who was playing in one of the corners of the park and it was dark at that time. The mother of the child made some comment on the man as she was suspicious of him. In response, the man misbehaved with the woman by making an ill-comment. Some more people got involved in the matter after which he tried to flee from the scene but was later caught and a few more men joined. Following this, he was beaten up by them.
