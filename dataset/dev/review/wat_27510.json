["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Republican Brendan Doherty has been mining U.S. Rep. David Cicilline\u2019s legal and legislative resume recently, pointing out unsavory law clients Cicilline represented as a criminal defense lawyer and criticizing him for votes that he took during his eight years in the Rhode Island House of Representatives.\n\nIn an Oct. 9, 2012, news release, Doherty accused Cicilline, a freshman Democrat, of voting against two bills in the mid-1990s that would have imposed mandatory sentences for certain domestic violence and child abuse offenses. We examined Doherty\u2019s claim and ruled it True.\n\nLast week \u00a0the Cicilline campaign \u00a0decided two could play that game, releasing a television ad that labeled Doherty\u2019s attacks \"outrageous.\"\n\nThe ad cited anti-crime bills Cicilline supported in the legislature on behalf of women, the elderly and other victims of crimes, including cases of sexual abuse.\n\nWe decided to check Cicilline\u2019s list, checking Journals of the Rhode Island House, state statutes, and our own news files. We found that the ad accurately cited the legislation and Cicilline\u2019s votes.\n\nThe first involved crimes against the elderly.\n\nIn 1998, Cicilline was among a group of legislators who supported a bill called the Elderly Violence Protection Act. It established that particular crimes should be charged differently if they were committed against a victim older than 60. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn July 14, 1998, he made a motion, which was approved, to add breaking and entering to that list. \u00a0He was the only one of the group of sponsors or seconders to discuss the act on the floor. It passed on a 69-3 vote and ultimately became law.\n\u00a0\nIn the 2000 legislative session, Cicilline proposed legislation that would have created a crime of indecent solicitation of a child under 14 for the purpose of sexual molestation. It didn\u2019t pass that year. But in 2004, two years after Cicilline had left the state House for the Providence mayor\u2019s office, a similar bill was enacted, though it set the age at 18, rather than 14.\n\nThe next year Cicilline introduced a bill that would have eliminated the statute of limitations for lawsuits filed by victims of child sexual abuse. The existing law said someone so harmed had seven years to file a suit. The bill didn\u2019t pass and the seven-year limit remains in effect today.\n\nIn 2002, he submitted a bill that would have prohibited anyone who has been the subject of a restraining order from owning firearms.\n\nThe existing law forbade people who had been convicted of a crime of violence, a felony or who were under home confinement from owning a gun. The bill didn\u2019t pass.\n\nOur ruling", "Cicilline campaign TV ad says Cicilline, as a state representative, voted for tougher anti-crime bills.\n\nWe verified that Cicilline supported the bills cited in the ad, though not all of them became law.\n\nWe find his statement True.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.
