["President Obama discusses health care at a town hall in New Hampshire.", "At a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., President Barack Obama was asked about his support of a \"universal\" health coverage and whether his plan would result in the government taking over health care.", "In his answer, Obama made a point that caught our attention: \"I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter,\" Obama said.", "That raised some eyebrows here in the PolitiFact newsroom because we recently spent a fair amount of time analyzing Obama's statements on single-payer. Before we delve into that, here's the exchange in Portsmouth:", "Question: \"Mr. President, you've been quoted over the years \u2014 when you were a senator and perhaps even before then \u2014 that you were essentially a supporter of a universal plan. I'm beginning to see that you're changing that.\u00a0 Do you honestly believe that? Because that is my concern.\u00a0 I'm on Medicare, but I still worry that if we go to a public option, period, that the private companies, the insurance companies, rather than competing \u2014 because who can compete with the government; the answer is nobody.\u00a0 So my question is do you still \u2014 as yourself, now \u2014 support a universal plan?\u00a0 Or are you open to the private industry still being maintained?\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nObama: \"Well, I think it's an excellent question, so I appreciate the chance to respond.\u00a0 First of all, I want to make a distinction between a universal plan versus a single-payer plan, because those are two different things.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"A single-payer plan would be a plan like Medicare for all, or the kind of plan that they have in Canada, where basically government is the only person \u2014 is the only entity that pays for all health care.\u00a0 Everybody has a government-paid-for plan, even though in, depending on which country, the doctors are still private or the hospitals might still be private.\u00a0 In some countries, the doctors work for the government and the hospitals are owned by the government.\u00a0 But the point is, is that government pays for everything, like Medicare for all.\u00a0 That is a single-payer plan.", "\"I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter because, frankly, we historically have had a employer-based system in this country with private insurers, and for us to transition to a system like that I believe would be too disruptive.\u00a0 So what would end up happening would be, a lot of people who currently have employer-based health care would suddenly find themselves dropped, and they would have to go into an entirely new system that had not been fully set up yet.\u00a0 And I would be concerned about the potential destructiveness of that kind of transition.", "\"All right?\u00a0 So I'm not promoting a single-payer plan.\" (His answer continued at some length as he explained his plan. You can read the full transcript of the town hall\n\nhere\n\n.)", "We see two major points that contradict Obama's statement in different ways.", "First, at several town halls this year, Obama has been asked by single-payer\n\nsupporters\n\nwhy he doesn't propose a single-payer system. Obama's consistent answer has been that if he were designing a health care system \"from scratch,\" he would go with a single payer system. So that certainly indicates philosophical support for the idea, even if Obama has also consistently concluded that single-payer is not politically feasible.", "But there's also the matter of a\n\nYouTube video\n\nfrom June 2003, when Obama was a state senator in Illinois and a longshot candidate for the U.S. Senate. Back then, he plainly indicated he supported a single-payer system.", "\"I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program,\" Obama said. \"I see no reason why the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent of its gross national product on health care, cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody. And that's what Jim is talking about when he says everybody in, nobody out. A single-payer health care plan, a universal health care plan. That's what I\u2019d like to see. But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we've got to take back the White House, we've got to take back the Senate, and we've got to take back the House.\"", "We previously delved into this video in great \u2014 some might say excruciating \u2014\u00a0 detail, even discovering the identity of \"Jim.\" You can read more about the politics of health care in Illinois from that time by reading our complete item, \"\n\nObama statements on single-payer have changed a bit.\n\n\"", "Suffice to say, Obama's public remarks and statements have moderated since 2003.\n\n\nIn other statements, Obama has spoken favorably of single-payer in concept, but always adding qualifiers.", "But the 2003 video strikes a very different tone from the remarks above. After weighing all the evidence, we concluded that Obama, as a candidate who was trying to appeal to a liberal electorate, took a strong position on single payer, but then over the years moderated his position to appeal to a broader national audience. We rated him a\n\nHalf Flip\n\non our Flip-O-Meter, a tool we use to gauge when political leaders and others change positions.", "Getting back to Obama's statement in Portsmouth, he said, \"I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter because, frankly, we historically have had a employer-based system in this country with private insurers, and for us to transition to a system like that I believe would be too disruptive.\"", "But he\n\nhas\n\nsaid in the past he supports a single-payer plan, and the questioner was correct that Obama's thinking has evolved over the years. Obama's answer strikes us as too artful. The 2003 YouTube video shows at one time he supported a single-payer system with little to no reservation. We agree that Obama does not support single payer now, but it's not correct to say that he has never supported it, which is certainly the impression you get from the answer he gave at the town hall. We rate his statement False.", "Physicians for a National Health Program, via YouTube,\n\nBarack Obama on single payer in 2003", "Interview with Quentin Young of\n\nPhysicians for a National Health Program\n\n\n\nInterview with Jim Duffett of\n\nCampaign for Better Health Care\n\n\n\nIllinois Department of Public Health,\n\nThe Health Care Justice Act\n\nand the\n\nAdequate Health Care Task Force\n\n\n\nIllinois General Assembly,\n\nThe Health Care Justice Act\n\n, July 1, 2004\n\n\nObama town hall transcripts\n\n\nInterview with Dr. Wayne Lerner\n\n\n\nThe Audacity of Hope\n\n, by Barack Obama", "Chicago Tribune, Obama has center in his sights, April 27, 2004", "Associated Press, Democratic Senate hopefuls call for drug cost negotiation, Feb. 9, 2004", "Associated Press, Obama moving cautiously on health care plan, April 5, 2007\n\n\nAssociated Press, Illinois U.S. Senate candidates on health care, Feb. 9, 2004\u00a0\n\n\nChicago Tribune, Obama prods voters on health care - Candidate seeks input before unveiling plan , April 4, 2007\n\n\nChicago Tribune, Obama's record a plus, a minus; Votes in Senate defy easy labels, October 8, 2004\n\n\nHeritage Foundation,\n\n\nSingle Payer: Why Government-Run Health Care Will Harm Both Patients and Doctors\n\n, April 3, 2009\n\n\nBoston Globe,\n\nHealthy examples: Plenty of countries get health care right\n\n, July 5, 2009", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
