["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on October 9, 2020", "President Donald Trump and his supporters on social media are citing unverified \u201cRussian intelligence\u201d from 2016 as evidence that Hillary Clinton \u201cwas behind the entire Russian collusion hoax.\u201d But that so-called intelligence is largely a reflection of publicly available information at the time. Federal investigations since then have documented multiple links between Trump associates and individuals tied to the Russian government.", "Hillary Clinton ran for president four years ago, but dubious claims about her continue to churn as the Trump administration rekindles allegations that ties between the president\u2019s 2016 campaign and Russia are part of a \u201choax.\u201d", "One such claim arose shortly before the first presidential debate on Sept. 29. Clinton, of course, is not a candidate. But Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe wrote a one-page letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham on the day of the debate that said \u201cRussian intelligence\u201d in July 2016 had claimed that Clinton \u201capproved a campaign plan to stir up a scandal against U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Putin and the Russians\u2019 hacking of the Democratic National Committee.\u201d", "Ratcliffe followed with an important caveat, writing that the U.S. intelligence community \u201cdoes not know the accuracy of this allegation or the extent to which the Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication.\u201d", "Despite that unverified and questionable provenance, partisan websites and social media pages seized on the claim as proof that Clinton was responsible for the appearance of links between the Trump campaign and Russia.\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was among those who initially spread it on social media, saying, \u201cThe Russia hoax was Hillary\u2019s plan.\u201d", "In reality, the connections between Trump campaign associates and individuals tied to the Russian government during the 2016 election have been well documented in reports from special counsel Robert S. Mueller and the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee. Both found evidence that justified the investigation into those ties, although neither report found evidence of a criminal conspiracy.", "\u201cIn sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away,\u201d the Mueller report said. \u201cUltimately, the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\u201d", "The Senate report, which was\u00a0released Aug. 18, detailed former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s connections to Russia and Ukraine, and found \u201chis high-level access and willingness to share information with individuals closely affiliated with the Russian intelligence services \u2026 represented a grave counterintelligence threat.\u201d", "Manafort was one of six men involved with Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign who have either pleaded guilty or been found guilty of crimes uncovered during the Mueller probe.", "It is also well documented that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered computer networks and accounts related to the Democratic Party to be hacked in order to leak damaging information about Clinton and help Trump\u2019s campaign. A joint assessment by the CIA, FBI and the National Security Agency resulted in a 2017 report\u00a0that detailed the extent of the Russian influence campaign.", "WikiLeaks released the information hacked by Russian government intelligence operatives and, according to the final volume of the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report, \u201cthe Trump Campaign sought to maximize the impact of those leaks to aid Trump\u2019s electoral prospects.\u201d", "The committee report said: \u201cStaff on the Trump Campaign sought advance notice about WikiLeaks releases, created messaging strategies to promote and share the materials in anticipation of and following their release, and encouraged further leaks.\u201d", "Campaign officials looked to Trump\u2019s longtime associate and adviser Roger Stone for insights about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans to release information, and Stone would relay his purported knowledge to Trump or senior aides, according to the report. The committee, however, couldn\u2019t \u201creliably determine the extent of authentic, non-public knowledge about WikiLeaks that Stone obtained.\u201d", "Neither the Mueller report nor the Senate Intelligence Committee report suggest that Clinton orchestrated any of this.", "But on Oct. 6, a week after his letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ratcliffe, who served as a Republican\u00a0congressman\u00a0from Texas until he became the\u00a0director of national intelligence\u00a0on May 26,\u00a0said the president instructed him to declassify \u201cadditional documents.\u201d", "Trump took to Twitter the same day, announcing: \u201cI have fully authorized the total Declassification of any & all documents pertaining to the single greatest political CRIME in American History, the Russia Hoax. Likewise, the Hillary Clinton Email Scandal. No redactions!\u201d", "So far, this has included a heavily redacted memorandum from the CIA to the FBI and two pages of heavily redacted notes\u00a0that former CIA director John Brennan had taken in 2016.", "According to Ratcliffe\u2019s letter, Brennan\u2019s notes said that the Russian intelligence analysis included the \u201calleged approval by Hillary Clinton on July 26, 2016, of a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisers to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by Russian security services.\u201d", "Brennan dismissed the publication of those documents as being politically motivated. In an\u00a0interview\u00a0with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, he called Ratcliffe\u2019s move \u201cselective declassification\u201d that is \u201cdesigned to advance the political interests of Donald Trump and Republicans who are aligned with him.\u201d", "Brennan explained, \u201cThese were my notes from the 2016 period when I briefed President Obama and the rest of the national security council team about what the Russians were up to and I was giving examples of the type of access that the US intelligence community had to Russian information and what the Russians were talking about and alleging.\u201d", "But what \u201cthe Russians were talking about\u201d in late July 2016 merely reflected what was playing out in public at that time.", "In mid-June of 2016, the Democratic National Committee disclosed its servers had been hacked and the firm it hired to analyze the breach traced the hack to Russia. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks released nearly 20,000 DNC emails, and two days later Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in an interview with CNN that the timing of the release \u2014 shortly before the Democratic National Convention \u2014 suggested that Russia was trying to help Trump\u2019s campaign.", "At a July 27, 2016, press conference, Trump said he doubted that Russia was responsible for hacking the DNC computer network, but invited Russia to find Clinton\u2019s personal emails that had been deleted before she left office. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said.", "Four days later, Clinton\u00a0suggested\u00a0in an interview on Fox News Sunday that Russia was helping Trump.", "\u201cWe know that Russian intelligence services hacked into the DNC and we know that they arranged for a lot of those emails to be released and we know that Donald Trump has shown a very troubling willingness to back up Putin, to support Putin,\u201d she said.", "Clinton\u2019s campaign also\u00a0criticized\u00a0Trump\u2019s call for the Russian government to \u201cfind\u201d her emails.", "But that\u2019s not a scandal that Clinton \u201cstirred up.\u201d She was responding to\u00a0Russia\u2019s actions and\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0words.", "There is no evidence that she was responsible for the federal counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign ties with Russia. The fact is, multiple federal reports, including the Mueller and Senate reports, trace the origins of the investigation to Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos.", "As we\u00a0have written, the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general said the FBI launched its investigation after Papadopoulos told a \u201cFriendly Foreign Government\u201d (an Australian diplomat in London, according to the New York Times) that the campaign had received information about Russia having dirt on Clinton.", "So, claims like this one \u2014 \u201cHillary Clinton was behind the entire Russian collusion hoax all along\u201d \u2014 made by Republican Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, along with a call to \u201c#LockHerUp,\u201d are unfounded.", "But that hasn\u2019t stopped such claims from spreading. Collins\u2019 original tweet was shared more than 14,000 times, and a conservative group called FreedomWorks made the quote into a meme that\u2019s been shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook.", "Other major Trump allies are spreading similar messages.", "Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, wrote on Facebook, with a link to the Fox News story about Brennan\u2019s declassified notes, \u201cCROOKED Hillary denied our country a peaceful transition of power. SHE concocted the Russia hoax!\u201d", "Anti-Muslim activist Brigitte Gabriel asked for \u201cnationally televised hearings about how the Russian probe was a HOAX.\u201d And Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida claimed on Facebook, \u201cThe Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton regime completely fabricated the Russia hoax. It was all FAKE.\u201d", "All of those assertions ignore the findings of multiple federal investigations and they eschew confirmed U.S. intelligence in favor of unverified Russian intelligence.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
