["About this rating", "On 9 May 2019, the Farmington Tribune website posted an article reporting that New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had released a post on her Facebook page confirming her plans to make Ramadan a state holiday:", "\u201cAs Ramadan begins I would like to wish the Muslim community of New Mexico a very blessed month of spiritual reflection. May you be surrounded by love and community during this special time. Ramadan Kareem to all those celebrating. We will be making this a State Holiday as of Friday,\u201d posted Governor Grisham.", "Farmington Tribune's source within the Governor's office tells us that the post and the Governor's Order, are an attempt to appease the Muslim community in New Mexico. It is based on fears that the community might burn a historic New Mexico cathedral, and \u201cwe're basically out of money, so we can't afford to repair anything,\u201d said our source.", "Of course, Ramadan isn't a discrete \"holiday\" in the sense that we typically use the word \u2014 a single day of (religious) festivity or recreation \u2014 but instead the name of a month on the Islamic calendar, throughout which observant Muslims fast every day from dawn until sunset. So a \"state holiday\" for Ramadan would encompass 29-30 days, a rather unreasonable amount of time to be giving government employees off each year (in addition to all the other existing state holidays).", "None of this report was true, however, as the Farmington Tribune is not a news site but rather a regional satirical page \u2014 albeit one that has been criticized for not making its parodical nature clear:", "A new Facebook page called \u201cThe Farmington Tribune\u201d that aims to be a satirical online news site for the Four Corners is causing some ruckus and confusion because its creators haven\u2019t explicitly identified its intent.", "The website\u2019s posts are often filled with borderline true stories that change only a few key details \u2013 using a different tactic than many similar satirical publications like The Onion and Clickhole utilize.", "\u201cThe real danger is, this leads to misinformation,\u201d said Elizabeth Skewes, an associate professor of journalism and media studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who reviewed the Tribune\u2019s Facebook page.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine to do humor, but they ought to be more responsible about it, especially since some people are being misled. There\u2019s nothing there to indicate they\u2019re trying to be satire, and that\u2019s not in the interest of transparency.\u201d", "Romeo, Jonathan. \u00a0 Satirical Website \u2018The Farmington Tribune\u2019 Digs at Four Corners Issues.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Journal. \u00a0 5 October 2018.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
