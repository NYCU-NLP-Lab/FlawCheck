["About this rating", "On Feb. 3, 2021, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office published a news release with the header \"McCarthy (Q-CA) Fails to Lead, Hands Keys to Party to Greene\":", "The press release and reference to \"Q\" is a dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is a California Republican. The \"Q\" swipe was in reference to his refusal to discipline U.S. Rep.
