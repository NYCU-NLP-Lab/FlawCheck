["About this rating", "In 2005, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), and George W. Bush signed it into law. That law codified legally that the gun manufacturing industry could not be held liable in civil court for crimes \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse\u201d of firearms or ammunition.", "In the wake of mass shootings and gun-violence, debate often turns to possible legal remedies to limit questionable gun sales or enact tougher gun control measures, and the PLCAA was the result of a failed effort to do that. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, an increasing number of city governments, including New York City in 2000, took a new legal approach \u2014 they began suing the firearm industry for \"creating a public nuisance\" in their cities.", "The PLCAA was passed in response to an increasing number of lawsuits as a way to protect the industry. In a 2005 statement, George W. Bush explained his support for the bill:", "Our laws should punish criminals who use guns to commit crimes, not law-abiding manufacturers of lawful products. This legislation will further our efforts to stem frivolous lawsuits, which cause a logjam in America's courts, harm America's small businesses, and benefit a handful of lawyers at the expense of victims and consumers", "Opponents of the bill had a different take on the law. Speaking at the time of the bill\u2019s debate, Dennis Henigan of the Brady Legal Action Project, a gun-control advocacy group, argued:", "The gun lobby is trying to radically change the rules, to make irresponsible gun dealers and the makers of defective guns the only business[es] in America exempt from long standing principles of negligence, nuisance and product liability.", "This law, officially adopted on 26 October 2005, is the law to which Hillary Clinton was referring in 2015 when she stated \"the gun industry and gun sellers are the only business in America that is totally free of liability for their behavior.\" Claims that they are totally free of liability, however, are not totally precise.", "The PLCAA actually spells out six exceptions to the law under which a gun manufacturer could be held liable from crimes committed with their products in a civil proceeding. A manufacturer could be held liable, for example, if they knowingly sell a weapon to someone planning on committing a \"crime of violence\" or a \"drug trafficking crime.\"", "Similarly, a manufacturer or seller could be sued if they broke federal or state law in the process of selling or making their product if the manufacturer or seller\u2019s action of breaking that law contributed substantially to the crime committed by the person with the gun.", "The liability exceptions provided to the gun industry for crimes committed with their products, though extremely narrowly defined, do exist. Because of this, we rank the claim that gun manufacturers have legal immunity from crimes committed with the weapons or ammunition they sell as mostly true.", "Chu, Vivian S. \u00a0 \u201cThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act: An Overview of Limiting Tort Liability of Gun Manufacturers.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Congressional Research Service. \u00a0 20 December 2012.", "United States Congressional Record. \u00a0 \"Public Law 109\u201392\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 26 October 2005.", "Reuters. \u00a0 \"New York to Sue Gun Industry.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 20 June 2000.", "UCSB American Presidency Project. \u00a0 \"Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Legislation.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 20 October 2005.", "Kurtzleben, Danielle. \u00a0 \u201cFACT CHECK: Are Gun-Makers 'Totally Free Of Liability For Their Behavior'?.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NPR. \u00a0 6 October 2015.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
