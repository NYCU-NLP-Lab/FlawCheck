["About this rating", "The disreputable web site Last Line of Defense jumped into the \"war on Christmas\" fray in December 2017 by publishing a false article claiming that a \"Muslim mayor\" in New Jersey had banned the word \"Christmas\":", "Earlier this year, Hoboken, New Jersey elected its first Muslim mayor. Due to take office in January, Ravi Bhalla received a Christmas gift from the current mayor, Dawn Zimmer: a chance to make one mayoral decree at the annual Christmas gala at the Patrick C. Farley Community Center on 5th and Brussels.", "Bhalla and Zimmer shook hands, then Bhalla shocked the roughly 200 citizens in attendance with his decree that \u201cthe word \u2018Christmas shall not be said at government functions.'\u201d", "This article is wrong on several fronts.", "First, Ravi Bhalla is not currently the mayor of Hoboken, as the article\u2019s headline implies. He was elected in 2017 and will take office in 2018, (as stated in the body of the article).", "Second, Bhalla is Sikh, not Muslim. Because he wears a turban, he is frequently subjected to Islamophobic rumors. For instance, Reagan Was Right, a sister web site of Last Line of Defense, published an article in November 2017 falsely claiming that Bhalla had vowed to \"glorify Allah\" with every decision he made in office.", "Not only did Bhalla not ban the word \"Christmas,\" he used it himself in a post on social media wishing Christmas-celebrators a merry one and complementing schoolchildren on their carol-singing. He also posted about lighting Hoboken's menorah for Hanukkah:", "The Last Line of Defense brands this sort of Islamophobic content as \"satire.\" The footer of the web site contains the Google definition for the word:", "The idea of a Muslim mayor's banning the word Christmas is related to the claim that there is a \"war\" against the extremely popular holiday, which has never been banned in the United States.", "Correction [19 December 2017]: Ravi Bhalla was not yet mayor at press time, as a previous version of this article implied.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
