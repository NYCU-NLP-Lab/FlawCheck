["While critiquing the president on his leadership of the economy, a state assemblyman reprised a popular -- and misleading -- Republican talking point.\n\nAssembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick said President Barack Obama has failed to deliver on a vow to push down the nation\u2019s jobless rate, fueling discontent among the unemployed.\n\n\"I think the American public, those who are unemployed, are somewhat angry. The president promised that if he spent money on a stimulus program that unemployment would go to 5.7 percent or 6 percent. Those were his words,\" Bramnick said in a Sept. 7 interview on NJToday. \"We've been stuck at 8 percent unemployment.\"\n\nPolitiFact and its partner sites have checked various iterations of this claim, each time rating it Mostly False.\n\nMost recently, PolitiFact Ohio gave Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Latta a Mostly False for saying that Obama promised that with the stimulus plan, \"unemployment would never go above 8 percent. He even said it would be 6 percent by now.\"\n\nWhile such claims have an element of truth -- top economic advisers in the incoming Obama administration released a report projecting that if the stimulus plan passed the unemployment rate would peak around 8 percent before dropping to less than 6 percent by now -- we found no evidence the president or his administration ever made a promise.\n\nBramnick owned up to that part, saying, \"I'm guilty of using a word that may not have been his word.\"\n\nBut, he said, \"I\u2019m very comfortable with my statement. Though you\u2019re right it wasn\u2019t a promise, it was material he used for Congress and others to rely on passing the stimulus program.\"\n\nBramnick, like other Republicans, cited as support for his statement a Jan. 9, 2009 report from Christina Romer, the incoming chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, who would serve as the vice president's top economic adviser.\n\nThe report -- released more than a month before the stimulus bill, officially called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, was signed into law -- estimated the impact of Obama\u2019s plan on job creation.\n\nWithout the stimulus plan, the unemployment rate was estimated to top off around 9 percent in 2010 before dropping off to roughly 6 percent by now.\n\nBut with the stimulus plan, the report projected the nation\u2019s jobless rate would peak near 8 percent in 2009 before falling to about 5.5 percent by now.\n\nWhat we know now is that even with the stimulus plan the unemployment rate topped off at 10 percent in October 2009. It has since dropped, hitting 8.1 percent last month.\n\nSo the estimates in the report were wrong.\n\nBut they were projections, not a guarantee as Republicans suggest. And the projections were made with plenty of disclaimers.\n\nIn the beginning of the report, the authors write, \"It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,\" noting that there is \"fundamental uncertainty\" with estimating the effects of any program and \"the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nBramnick said \"the president promised that if he spent money on a stimulus program that unemployment would go to 5.7 percent or 6 percent. Those were his words.\"\n\nWe found no evidence the president or his advisers ever made a public pledge that the stimulus would drive the unemployment rate down to the figures Bramnick cites.\n\nTwo economic advisers estimated in a 2009 report that with the stimulus plan, the unemployment rate would peak near 8 percent before dropping to less than 6 percent by now.\n\nBut those projections came with heavy disclaimers, with the authors emphasizing the considerable uncertainty of their estimates.\n\nThose are critical details Bramnick\u2019s statement ignores.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "NJToday, Assembly GOP Leader Says Voters Choose Candidate, Not Party Platform, Sept. 7, 2012\n\nE-mail interview with Ben DeMarzo, chief of staff for Assemblyman Jon Bramnick, Sept. 10, 2012\n\nInterview with Jon Bramnick, State Assembly Republican Leader, Sept. 10, 2012\n\nWhite House, The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan, Jan. 9, 2009\n\nWhite House\u2019s YouTube Account, 1/24/09: Your Weekly Address, Jan. 24, 2009\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Population Survey, accessed Sept. 11, 2012\n\nPolitiFact Ohio, Bob Latta says Obama promised the stimulus plan would have unemployment at 6 percent by now, May 17, 2012\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey, Chris Christie claims Obama said unemployment would never top 8 percent if the stimulus was passed, Feb. 27, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, Amid good jobs report, an old 'promise' resurfaces, Jan. 6, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, Mitt Romney says president promised peak of 8 percent unemployment, Feb. 8, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPolitiFact Ohio, John Boehner says Obama promised the stimulus would keep unemployment below 8 percent, Oct. 13, 2011\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPolitiFact, Rep.
