Also, Bernie Marcus, the co-founder of Home Depot, gave millions to Trump's 2016 campaign.", "The meme gave the false impression that these donations happened around the same time when they did not. It also failed to mention that Marcus retired from his position in 2002 and that political action committees associated with both Lowe's and Home Depot have contributed money to both major political parties, but more toward Republicans, in the 2020 federal election cycle.", "In early June 2020, a meme comparing two popular U.S. home improvement chains spread across social media:", "The facts presented are true, but some context was missing.", "It's true that Lowe's has created a $25 million grant for minority-owned small businesses trying to reopen after being forced to close due to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.

He vowed to again support Trump in his 2020 run against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.", "Marcus, a philanthropist who gives billions of dollars away to various causes, is generally a large-ticket financial supporter of Republican politicians and organizations. But he also retired from his position as Home Depot's company chairman in 2002.
