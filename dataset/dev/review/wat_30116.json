I DO NOT APOLOGIZE FOR SENDING THIS, BECAUSE ITS THE TRUTH,\" the chain e-mail states. \"If any other of our presidents had doubled the national debt, which had taken more than two centuries to accumulate, in one year, would you have approved?\"\n\nNear the end of the chain e-mail, the message adds: \"Every statement and action in this email is factual and directly attributable to Barrack Hussein Obama. Every bumble is a matter of record and completely verifiable.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey already debunked a chain e-mail claim that Obama added more to the national debt in his first term than his 43 predecessors combined -- but doubling the debt in one year?\n\nThat brings this claim to a new extreme and, as federal data proves, it\u2019s completely bogus.\n\nThe national debt has increased significantly during Obama\u2019s tenure, but it never doubled in one year. The debt hasn\u2019t even doubled over the roughly three and a half years since the president took office.\n\nThe chain e-mail includes various other statements about Obama\u2019s time in the White House, from his use of a teleprompter to the gift he gave to the Queen of England. Check out this story from FactCheck.org about all of the claims made in the e-mail.\n\nNow, let\u2019s explain how the national debt has increased under Obama.\n\nThere are two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt.\n\nThe debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, debt held by the public was about $6.3 trillion and total debt stood at roughly $10.6 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s \"Debt to the Penny\" calculator.\n\nA year later, debt held by the public was about $7.8 trillion and total debt was about $12.3 trillion. Those figures represent over-the-year increases of about 24 percent and 16 percent in the respective categories.\n\nBoth forms of debt continued to increase in the two subsequent years, but at a declining pace.\n\nBetween Jan. 20, 2010 and Jan. 20, 2011, debt held by the public grew by about 20.5 percent and total debt increased by roughly 14 percent.\n\nFrom Jan. 20, 2011 to Jan. 20, 2012, debt held by the public went up by around 11.3 percent, while total debt increased by about 8.4 percent.\n\nWhen PolitiFact New Jersey received the chain e-mail on July 10, debt held by the public stood at about $11 trillion and total debt was about $15.9 trillion. Compared to Obama\u2019s inauguration, that\u2019s an increase of roughly 75.6 percent and 49.5 percent, respectively.\n\nSo, starting with the inauguration, the largest over-the-year increase in either form of national debt was about 24 percent. Over the course of roughly three and a half years, both forms of debt have risen sharply, but still haven\u2019t doubled.\n\nThe factors behind debt increases over the last decade include legislation approved by Obama, such as the stimulus bill signed in February 2009 and tax cuts enacted in December 2010, according to a study released in April 2011 by the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative.\n\nBut other contributing factors were initiated under President George W. Bush, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the analysis shows. Experts also have told us the weak economy has contributed to the higher debt.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey claims Obama \"doubled the national debt, which had taken more than two centuries to accumulate, in one year.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the national debt has increased significantly since Obama took office, but it\u2019s outrageous to claim it doubled in one year.\n\nStarting with his inauguration, the largest over-the-year increase in either form of national debt was about 24 percent. Even after roughly three and-a-half years into his presidency, both forms of debt still have not doubled.\n\nWe\u2019re just left with three words to describe this claim: Pants on Fire!", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "Chain e-mail, Our President, received by PolitiFact New Jersey on July 10, 2012\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey, Obama has added more to national debt than the previous 43 presidents combined, chain e-mail states, May 4, 2012\n\nFactCheck.org, Obama\u2019s \u2018Bumbles\u2019, June 17, 2011\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury, Debt to the Penny, accessed July 19-20, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
