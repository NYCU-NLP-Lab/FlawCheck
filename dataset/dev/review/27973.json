(AP)", "Trump claimed that \u201cnumerous provisions\u201d of the U.S. Constitution give him the power to open or close state economies, but he didn\u2019t cite any specifically.", "Legal experts said that the U.S. Constitution does not give Trump \u201ctotal\u201d power over the states, even during an emergency such as a pandemic.", "States maintain police powers and the authority to set rules related to public health, such as social distancing and business closures.", "President Donald Trump was asked during his White House briefing to explain his tweets in which he said that it\u2019s up to him \u2014 not governors \u2014 to re-open states amid the COVID-19 pandemic.", "\"What provision in the Constitution gives the president the power to open or close state economies?\" a reporter asked Trump April 13.", "\"Numerous provisions,\" Trump replied.\u00a0 \"We\u2019ll give you a legal brief if you want.\"", "Reporters pressed Trump for details, but he never cited specific provisions in the Constitution or federal law.", "When a reporter asked again, Trump said, \"The authority is total, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s got to be.\"", "The White House did not respond to our emails seeking Trump\u2019s evidence.", "The 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states. A reporter asked Trump how he would overcome that restriction.", "Trump sidestepped the question: \"Well if some states refuse to open, I would like to see that person run for election. They\u2019re going to open. They\u2019re going to all open.\"", "Federalism, which is a key component of our Constitution, means that the national government is responsible for broad governance, while states and cities have authority over local issues.", "The president is the top elected official in the country, but he does not have supreme power to dictate all rules for states and local governments. The federal government only has powers given to it in the U.S. Constitution; the rest are reserved for the states, said Polly J. Price, a professor of law and global health at Emory University.", "Trump does have some authority with respect to reopening the country such as on federal property including military bases within states, Price said.", "But formal declaration of a \"national emergency\" does not confer do-whatever-is-needed authority on the president, said University of Texas law professor Robert Chesney.", "\"The president very clearly does not have total authority over state and local governments,\" Chesney said. \"It is preposterous to claim such authority in our system, in which federalism has always been a bedrock element. It is equally preposterous to claim that state and local leaders require the president\u2019s approval for anything. States are not mere political subdivisions of the federal government.\"", "Issues with respect to social distancing and business closures are state matters. That means that Trump does not actually call the shots about re-opening swimming pools in Miami, gyms in Sacramento or barber shops in Cleveland. Both Democratic and Republican governors have said they control their own state orders, not Trump.", "This isn\u2019t the first time that Trump has made the case that he has unlimited power. In 2019, he said that Article 2 of the Constitution gave him \"the right to do whatever I want as president.\" Article 2 gives the president \"executive power,\" but that\u2019s not the same as total power over the states.", "Legal experts say no part of the Constitution gives the president unlimited power.", "\"There is no authority. You can\u2019t point to any clause of the Constitution that supports that,\" said David Schultz, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and political science professor at Hamline University.", "When the framers drafted the Constitution, they kept in mind fear of King George III and wanted to avoid absolute power of a king, Schultz said. The Constitution aims to break up political power.", "\"That\u2019s why the president doesn\u2019t have total power,\" he said.", "Trump said he has \"total\" authority to reopen the states amid the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Trump and the White House have not explained what parts of the Constitution or laws he is referring to that he thinks give him \"total\" authority over governors.", "Governors have the power to set rules to protect their residents\u2019 public health such as closing swimming pools and schools and requiring social distancing. Trump does not have the power to undo the governors\u2019 orders.", "In this case, his exaggeration is so vast that it qualifies as ridiculous. By our definition, that means his statement rates Pants on Fire.", "Rev.com, Donald Trump Coronavirus Press Conference Transcript, April 13, 2020", "CNN, Fact check: Trump falsely claims the president has 'total' authority over coronavirus restrictions, April 13, 2020", "New York Times, Trump Insists He Has \u2018Total\u2019 Authority to Supersede Governors, April 13, 2020", "Washington Post, While bemoaning Mueller probe, Trump falsely says the Constitution gives him \u2018the right to do whatever I want\u2019 July 23, 2019", "Washington Post, Trump says his \u2018authority is total.\u2019 Constitutional experts have \u2018no idea\u2019 where he got that.
