He estimated that Rhode Island spends $40 million annually fighting marijuana.)", "We decided to focus on the first half of his statement, dealing with Colorado revenue.", "We asked Aubin where he got his numbers. He responded that he relied on the State of Colorado's Department of Revenue, as well as a story from Channel 7-KMGH, the Denver ABC News affiliate.", "We pulled Colorado\u2019s tax records ourselves.

Denver, for example, received $128,586.", "Most of the money goes into the state general fund. But voters dedicated the first $40 million in excise taxes annually to a statewide school construction fund, administered by the state Department of Education. So far, that \u00a0tax has generated $10 million for the fund.", "The monthly revenue from marijuana has increased steadily. In January, the total collected in taxes and fee was $3.5 million; in October, it was $7.6 million.", "We also looked at news articles about the tax implications of legalizing marijuana.
