The shooting sparked a national debate about the relationship between law enforcement and African-Americans and the use of deadly force.", "Ferguson is in the social media spotlight nearly five years later, as people connected to the protests have been found dead.", "One Facebook post, shared more than 3,500 times, cries foul play, saying that the deaths of \"six of the most prominent activists\" was no coincidence as they were all found \"burned to death in their cars,\" implying that they were victims of a larger conspiracy theory.", "The full post reads:", "\"I need people to wake up and realise that SIX of the most prominent activists during the Ferguson riots have all been found burned to death in their cars.

But they were not all found burned to death in their cars as the post claims. The other cases were ruled as suicides, an accidental drowning and a fentanyl overdose.", "Let\u2019s break this down.", "DeAndre Joshua", "On Nov. 24, 2014, the morning after a grand jury declined to indict Wilson, 20-year-old DeAndre Joshua was found dead, reportedly inside a burned car after being shot in the head.", "The timing, as well as Joshua reportedly being close friends with Dorian Johnson, who was with Michael Brown on the day of the shooting, led many to speculate if the events were connected. But Joshua\u2019s family dispelled rumors that he was a \"key witness\" in Brown\u2019s case, saying in a New York Times article \"he had known nothing about Mr. Brown\u2019s death and never testified before the grand jury.\"", "Shawn Gray", "Shawn Gray, a 23-year-old who went missing the same week Joshua died, was later found drowned in the River Des Peres. The city\u2019s medical examiner later ruled that the cause of death was an accidental drowning, with alcohol poisoning as a major contributing factor, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported. There were unproven rumors that Gray, like Joshua, was killed after testifying in front of a grand jury in the Brown case. But Gray\u2019s family also dismissed those rumors, saying he had no connection to the case.", "Neither Joshua nor Gray were \"prominent activists.\" It\u2019s important to note that even if both men had testified, their deaths came after the grand jury chose not to indict Wilson.", "Darren Seals", "In September 2016, 29-year-old Darren Seals suffered a similar death to Joshua: his body was found inside a burning car after having been shot. Seals was a prominent figure in the protests and is seen in a video comforting Brown\u2019s mother after the grand jury\u2019s decision.", "At the time of Seals\u2019 death, St. Louis County police acknowledged the similarities of the tragedies and told outlets \"anything\u2019s a possibility\" and that detectives are \"always going to look into different avenues, or if it\u2019s the same kind of motive.\"", "Sgt.

Writer Jelani Cobb traveled to Ferguson to speak with the community and found people pondered \"all kinds of possible culprits \u2026 from white supremicists to local and federal law enforcement, to armed militia members\" to explain the deaths.", "Cobb went over some ways in which the theory doesn\u2019t quite hold up: \"St. Louis proper has one of the most alarming homicide rates in the country. In 2017, it was the most alarming, having the highest murder rate, according to an analysis of FBI data. By comparison, Chicago was No. 9.
