["About this rating", "In April 2015, web site NationalReport.net\u00a0published a piece titled, \u201cCalifornia Implements Statewide Ban On All .45 ACP Ammunition.\u201d\u00a0 The piece read, in part:", "The California Legislature has passed a controversial Assembly Bill that creates a ban on the future sale and ownership of all .45 ACP ammo. The bill states that the ban on the popular ammunition is in effect immediately, however does include a 60 day grace period prior to state law enforcement enforcing the ban.\nThough the ban has created a clear divide among the citizens of California, it\u2019s said to be widely supported by political figures across the state. Many politicians and citizens alike feel that that ban is a clear infringement of California citizen\u2019s second amendment rights, however; many feel that the ban is a positive step towards much needed gun control.", "As .45 ACP\u00a0ammunition is enormously popular,\u00a0the article immediately caused a furor in gun and ammunition forums and on social media.", "Some were taken in initially, particularly since the article was also published under the now-suspended spoof web address NYTimes.com.co, but commenters quickly discovered that the story was a hoax.", "NationalReport.net is a satire site.

On 9 December 2015, the New York Times breathed new life into the piece\u00a0when it published an editorial titled, \u201cAn Opening for States to Restrict Guns,\u201d which linked to the hoax site in the following paragraph:", "States and cities have passed laws restricting or banning certain\u00a0types of weapons, magazines and ammunition, and prohibiting certain classes of people, like those convicted of stalking or multiple instances of drunken driving, from possessing guns. Some have also imposed universal background checks and safe-storage requirements on gun owners.", "While California does restrict certain types of \u201cunreasonably dangerous ammunition,\u201d such as bullets designed to penetrate body armor or metal,\u00a0.45 ACP ammunition has not been banned.", "[article-meta]", "Brooke Binkowski is a former editor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
