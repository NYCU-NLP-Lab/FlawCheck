["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on May 31, 2018", "Has someone \u201cbeen a lobbyist\u201d if the person was registered as such but never had any clients? What if that registration was later retroactively deactivated? Those are the questions in a dispute in the Ohio Senate race.", "Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown\u2019s campaign is airing a TV ad that claims\u00a0his opponent, Republican Rep. Jim Renacci, has \u201cbeen a lobbyist even while in Congress.\u201d Renacci\u2019s campaign calls the claim \u201cfalse.\u201d", "Renacci, an accountant and businessman, was first registered as a lobbyist in 2008, when he and two others launched Smokerise International Group, a consulting firm, in Wadsworth, Ohio, where Renacci had just served as mayor. In 2010, Renacci was elected to Congress in Ohio\u2019s 16th District.\u00a0Smokerise still listed him as a registered lobbyist when he entered Congress in January 2011 until May 2011, when the firm terminated.", "But Renacci\u2019s campaign says paperwork had been filed by the company\u2019s lawyer ending Renacci\u2019s registration as of Aug. 1, 2009. However, another form needed to be filed as well, and that amended form for 2009 wasn\u2019t submitted until March 29 of this year.", "Regardless of what the lobbying forms indicated, Renacci\u2019s campaign communications director,\u00a0Brittany Martinez, says that \u201cneither Jim Renacci nor anyone else at Smokerise ever engaged in lobbying at any point in time.\u201d", "There\u2019s no indication on any of Smokerise\u2019s various filings from 2008 to 2012, which list no clients, that Renacci did any lobbying. All but three of its 21 federal filings say there was no lobbying activity, and the three that list some activity describe it as \u201cconsulting\u201d by the firm\u2019s lawyer.", "House ethics rules also prohibit lawmakers from lobbying the federal government while in office. The rules state: \u201cIn no event may a Member, officer, or employee participate in lobbying or advising on lobbying of either Congress or the Executive Branch on behalf of any private organization or individual, even on an uncompensated basis, as that would conflict with a Member\u2019s general obligation to the public.\u201d", "Brown\u2019s campaign communications director, Preston Maddock, maintains that Renacci \u201cwas a registered lobbyist while serving in Congress.\u201d But that\u2019s not the whole story.", "Brown\u2019s TV ad starts off by saying there are \u201c68 teachers,\u201d \u201c15 farmers\u201d and \u201cfour pilots\u201d in the U.S. Congress. \u201cBut only one lobbyist,\u201d the narrator says, with an image of Renacci on screen. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Jim Renacci\u2019s been a lobbyist even while in Congress.\u201d", "The support for the claim is a March 28 Associated Press story on Renacci\u2019s failure to disclose about $50,000 in political contributions he made \u201cwhile registered as a Washington lobbyist starting in the late 2000s.\u201d", "The AP found \u201cfive reporting periods from 2008 to 2010 while the Ohio Republican was registered as a lobbyist when he either failed to file the required disclosure form or reported giving no political contributions when he had given.\u201d Lobbyists are required to disclose contributions they make of $200 or more to federal politicians or candidates, as well as political action committees and party committees.", "The campaign told the AP that Smokerise\u2019s registration of Renacci as a lobbyist had been precautionary.", "The firm registered as a lobbying organization on May 20, 2008, with an address on Smokerise Drive. The federal registration form said the company was a \u201cConsulting firm which will include legislative affairs\u201d and that its lobbying issues would be \u201cAerospace, Defense and Homeland Security Industries.\u201d", "It listed three lobbyists, including Renacci. Smokerise continued to file quarterly federal reports until 2012, with nearly all of them labeled \u201cno activity\u201d and none listing a client other than Smokerise itself. The firm filed a termination report\u00a0in May 2011, and amended that report in July 2012 to list Renacci and the firm\u2019s other two members as \u201cno longer expected to act as a lobbyist.\u201d", "Renacci\u2019s campaign says he worked for the firm as an accountant, and it sent us this statement from Laura Mills, the lawyer for Smokerise:\u00a0\u201cAt no point has Jim Renacci ever engaged in any work or tasks as a lobbyist on anyone\u2019s behalf and Sherrod Brown\u2019s assertion that he has performed such tasks is absurd and patently false and unsupported by any evidence. In addition, Sherrod Brown\u2019s claim that Jim Renacci was a lobbyist while serving in Congress is also false.\u201d", "Technically, back in 2011, Renacci was registered as a lobbyist for four months after he was sworn in for his first term as a U.S. representative, even if he didn\u2019t do any work as a lobbyist. He, in fact, filed a mid-year lobbying contribution report for 2011 on June 26, 2012.", "But his campaign describes that as a mistake, saying Mills had filed\u00a0paperwork in 2009 terminating Renacci\u2019s registration as of Aug. 1 of that year. That paperwork isn\u2019t available online, and Mills had to file\u00a0an amended 2009 third quarter report, retroactively listing Renacci as no longer being a lobbyist. That amended report was filed on March 29, the day after the Associated Press story ran.", "Martinez, Renacci\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, sent us a Lobbying Disclosure Act \u201caccount summary\u201d that says Renacci was \u201cinactive\u201d as of Aug. 1, 2009, though there\u2019s no date on that form. Martinez said Mills filed the amended report when it appeared Renacci\u2019s termination date wasn\u2019t accurately listed in that report.", "Renacci continued to file lobbying contribution reports until Smokerise\u2019s termination, but Martinez told us that was an error. She said that Smokerise \u201cinadvertently\u201d continued to file contribution reports on his behalf. Those forms are signed, electronically, by Renacci.", "Martinez emphasizes that Renacci never engaged in lobbying.", "We asked Brown\u2019s campaign if it had any evidence that showed Renacci actually did any lobbying. Campaign spokesman Maddock told us the ad \u201cnever makes that claim.\u201d", "\u201cIt says, \u2018Jim Renacci\u2019s been a lobbyist even while in Congress,\u2019 which is true,\u201d he said in an email to FactCheck.org.", "Sure, Renacci was briefly registered as one at the time, but the claim leaves the false impression that Renacci had \u201cbeen a lobbyist\u201d who actually did what lobbyists do \u2014 lobby.\u00a0The ad includes\u00a0the sound of a cash register three times when it mentions the word \u201clobbyist,\u201d leaving the impression that Renacci earned money as a lobbyist. And while Renacci\u2019s paperwork wasn\u2019t in order in the past, his former consulting firm has now retroactively terminated his registration as of 2009. That\u2019s part of the whole story, too.", "The ad goes on to highlight two votes, claiming Renacci \u201cvoted to make it easier for lobbyists to hold key government positions.\u00a0And harder to investigate conflicts of interests.\u201d", "The first claim concerns a party-line vote\u00a0in November 2016 on \u201cordering the previous question,\u201d a measure that could allow the minority party to bring legislation to the floor. But Democrats lost that battle in the GOP-controlled House by a 231-181 margin. The Democratic leader\u2019s website says the Democrats would have forced a vote on a bill to amend the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 to block registered lobbyists from holding positions on presidential transition teams. At the time, the Trump administration transition team was facing criticism for including several lobbyists.", "So, Renacci didn\u2019t make it easier for lobbyists to serve on transition teams. Instead, he voted, along with his party, to block a vote on a measure that would make it harder for lobbyists to serve on transition teams.", "The second vote highlighted in the ad refers to a rules change that the House Republicans approved on a largely party-line vote (only four Republicans voted against it). Among other things, the rules were changed to say the House Ethics Committee \u201cmay not take any action that would deny any person any right or protection provided under the Constitution of the United States.\u201d", "We take no position on the failed motion or the rule change, but the underlying premise of the ad \u2014 that\u00a0Renacci has \u201cbeen a lobbyist even while in Congress\u201d \u2013\u00a0is misleading. There is no evidence that Renacci ever lobbied Congress.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
