Anyone can call in for \u2018what\u2019s on your mind?\u2019", "\u201cA guy came on, based in metro Melbourne, says he\u2019s totally respecting all the lockdowns rules. However he has a friend who\u2019s [sic] dad just died at 79 years old. A Greek guy, it\u2019s been in the news.", "\u201cThe dad was in hospital for 2 weeks for late stage terminal cancer. After that he was placed back into the nursing home.", "\u201cNow to be placed back in the nursing home, all aged care returning need to be tested negative for covid. He was allowed back into the nursing home. So he definitely did not test positive for covid otherwise he would not be allowed back in.", "\u201cHe died the next day in the nursing home. His death was labeled as covid.", "\u201cThe family were upset & asked why did they put that on the death certificate when that wasn\u2019t true? The nursing home turned around & said don\u2019t you want a payout for the death?", "\u201cThe Australian govt is handing out $25,000 to all nursing homes who label covid as the main cause of deaths on death certificates.", "\u201cAnother friend verifies this story. She\u2019s got a friend who\u2019s father in law in Melbourne just died in a nursing home.\u201d", "The Mike E & Emma show is broadcast on Sydney-based radio station The Edge between 6am to 9am on weekdays.", "The post did not provide details of the name or location of the purported care home or the name of the man who allegedly died.", "An identical claim was also shared in Facebook posts here, here, here, here, here, and here.", "The claim, however, is false.", "Radio station segment", "A spokesperson for The Edge told AFP that the information in the misleading posts relates\u00a0to a segment\u00a0conducted by its breakfast show hosts Mike E Etheridge and Emma Lisbona with a caller on August 7.", "The station said it decided not to re-broadcast or share the segment that included\u00a0an anonymous caller from the general public\u00a0on its social media platforms after the initial live broadcast because the claims made by the caller\u00a0contained \u201cpotentially inaccurate information\u201d.", "\u201cDuring the two minute call, the hosts of the Breakfast program were clearly surprised by the information that the caller provided, and were openly skeptical about its veracity. One host referred to it as sounding like a conspiracy theory, also adding that he wouldn\u2019t take the caller\u2019s word on it,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email on August 11, 2020.", "\u201cGiven the considerable public interest in COVID-19, The Edge is very careful to ensure that it does not generate, disseminate or promote any false information regarding COVID-19 or government policy regarding COVID-19. In the case of this caller on August 7th, the information was immediately recognized as potentially inaccurate information and was not further distributed beyond the live broadcast so was not repeated on the station\u2019s online, podcast or social media assets.\u201d", "Government response", "In response to the misleading post, an Australian Department of Health spokesperson told AFP via email on August 7, 2020: \u201cThe comments made in the Facebook post are false.\u201d", "\u201cAustralians are encouraged to rely on reputable and authoritative sources of information to help them make informed choices and stay up to date,\u201d the spokesperson added.", "Death certificates", "The misleading posts imply that nursing homes in the city of Melbourne,\u00a0situated in the Australian state of Victoria, can issue death certificates in the event of a resident\u2019s death.", "But this briefing note on the state\u2019s Department of Health & Human Services website explains that in Victoria, only a registered medical practitioner can certify a death or complete a Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD).", "\u201cThe legislative requirement for a registered medical practitioner to \u2018certify death\u2019 (a MCCD) under section 37 of the Births Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1996 remains unchanged,\u201d the briefing note reads.", "\u201cThe MCCD can \u2018only\u2019 be completed by a registered medical practitioner. To \u2018certify death\u2019 a registered medical practitioner is required to make a diagnosis of the cause of death which requires specialist knowledge.\u201d", "Hoax report", "Whilst the misleading posts did not contain the name of specific care home or the man who allegedly died, a keyword search on Google found some of the details in the posts corresponded with this report published by Australian broadcaster ABC on July 29, 2020.", "The report refers to the death of 79-year-old Apostolis Barbousas, an Australian man of Greek descent, at a care home in Melbourne after he contracted COVID-19. The report makes no mention of Barbousas suffering from terminal cancer before his death.", "This article was updated on August 13, 2020 to clarify that the misleading claims were made during a radio segment\u00a0that included a call with an anonymous caller.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
