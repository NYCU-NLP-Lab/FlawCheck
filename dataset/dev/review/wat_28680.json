None of these videos contains images of the alleged sex crime \u2014 just descriptions based on unnamed sources who purportedly viewed it.", "One YouTube video, which received nearly 190,000 views, attributes the existence of the\u00a0\u201c\u2018Horrific\u2019 Hillary Clinton snuff film\u201d only to \u201creliable sources who have viewed the material and confirmed the content is worse than any nightmare.\u201d", "A link to the yournewswire.com story posted on the popular Facebook group \u201cDonald Trump Commander in Chief 2020\u201d garnered more than 1,500 shares.

Monsters around us!
