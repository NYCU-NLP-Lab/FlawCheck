["Much of the misinformation circulating widely amid the hard-fought 2020 election boils down to people unfamiliar with election processes making assumptions \u2014 trumpeting something as fraud when the issue is actually that they don\u2019t understand the process.", "We saw a classic example of this in the latest baseless Gateway Pundit story about Wisconsin vote counting.", "The far-right purveyor\u00a0of\u00a0election misinformation\u00a0published a story Nov. 28\u00a0with this headline: \u201cBREAKING EXCLUSIVE: THOUSANDS of fake votes found at Wisconsin Recount in Dane County \u2013 Photos and Report from GOP Observer.\u201d", "The story \u2014 which also linked to a long-since debunked claim about a \u201cdump\u201d of votes for Democrat Joe Biden in the middle of the night \u2014 contained nothing approaching proof of this claim.", "Fact check:Viral photo shows fake logo and slogan for Dominion Voting Systems", "Here\u2019s why this is both wrong and ridiculous.", "The closest thing to proof presented in the story is a sentence saying the signature (actually referring to initials) MLW was used on the \u201cfake votes.\u201d", "It then shows a picture of a ballot with those initials.", "But those initials are under a section titled \u201cAbsentee ballot issued by.\u201d It\u2019s where the issuing clerk puts their initials on every ballot. The Madison city clerk is Maribeth L. Witzel-Behl \u2014 in line with the initials cited in the story.", "In other words, those repeated initials are exactly what and where you would expect to find repeated initials on thousands of ballots.", "Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell confirmed in an email the initials are simply those of the Madison clerk.", "When asked for proof that this picture showed votes were fake, Gateway Pundit Editor Jim Hoft changed the headline within minutes to say the votes were \u201csuspect\u201d rather than fake. And he added a line to the story saying, \u201cMadison County attorneys contacted The Gateway Pundit to say the ballots were signed by the city clerk in Madison, Wisconsin.\u201d", "Of course, Hoft didn\u2019t pass along this information to readers until he was challenged on the matter, and after the story had collected thousands of social media shares and comments.", "Aside from bungling the location \u2014 Madison is a city in Dane County \u2014 Hoft\u2019s change points out the obvious reason for the repeated initials, while still asserting there is something underhanded about the ballots\u00a0\u2013 which there isn\u2019t.", "Hoft did not offer any other proof of his amended claim in the story or an email exchange.", "Fact check:Pennsylvania mail-in ballot claim mixes primary, general election data", "We rate this claim FALSE because it is not supported by our research. Two versions of this story claimed initials proved \"fake\" or \"suspect\" votes were discovered during the recent recount in Dane County, Wis. Neither claim has any basis in reality.", "The repeated initials aren\u2019t those of\u00a0a voter; they\u2019re initials of the\u00a0clerk who issued the absentee ballots. That\u2019s not sketchy; it\u2019s just a basic element of how elections are administered.", "Contact Eric Litke at (414) 225-5061 or elitke@jrn.com.
