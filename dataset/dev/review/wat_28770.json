["An old story that keys off Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s opposition to abortion has raised hackles on the Internet, but almost all of its contents are fabricated.", "\"Mike Pence: \u2018Allowing Rape Victims To Have Abortions Will Lead To Women Trying To Get Raped\u2019,\" reads the headline on a July 17, 2016, story on Politicot.com.", "The story has been reblogged by several other sites, and has regained popularity on Facebook following Pence\u2019s address at the Jan. 27 March For Life in Washington. It was flagged by Facebook as part of the social media giant\u2019s attempts to stamp out fake news on its site.", "The post opens by saying Pence, who was governor of Indiana at the time, had signed a restrictive abortion bill. It then goes on to quote Pence as saying the bill didn\u2019t have an exception for victims of rape because \"we\u2019d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion.\"", "To be clear, Pence never said these things. The story originated on a family of websites known for creating stories based on real events, but with made-up details in what it describes as an attempt to be funny.", "Politicot.com is part of the Newslo network of sites, which we\u2019ve written about before, including one fake story about Pence calling Michelle Obama \"the most vulgar first lady we\u2019ve ever had.\" We rated that Pants On Fire!", "The site describes itself as a \"hybrid News/Satire platform\" that focuses on \"entertainment.\" The only indication that the stories might be fake is a \"Show Facts\" button that highlight what is true, leaving the reader to surmise that the rest of the story is contrived.", "In this case, what Politicot.com deems as \"facts\" is limited to the opening paragraph, which noted Pence had \"recently\" signed a bill restricting abortions.", "Pence did sign an abortion bill in March 2016 that prevented women from getting an abortion due to the race, gender, or disability of the fetus. Indiana already was one of the most restrictive states in the country for women seeking abortions.", "The Politicot.com story seems to have been timed to react to Pence being picked as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate on July 15. The site did not respond to our request for clarification.", "We\u2019ve acknowledged in the past that Politicot.com\u2019s related sites don\u2019t do a good enough job of pointing out their stories are fake, and exacerbate problems by building contrived details upon real news events. This story is no different, and plenty of other sites posted it as truth.", "We rate this claim Pants On Fire!", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/99addd99-9735-4cbb-9db7-4c23c53cd885", "Politicot.com, \"Mike Pence: \u2018Allowing Rape Victims To Have Abortions Will Lead To Women Trying To Get Raped\u2019,\" July 17, 2016", "Indianapolis Star, \"Pence signs new abortion restrictions into law with a prayer,\" March 24, 2016", "CNN, \"Donald Trump selects Mike Pence as VP,\" July 16, 2016", "PunditFact, \"Website makes up story that Mike Pence called Michelle Obama vulgar,\" Dec. 20, 2016", "PunditFact, \"Fact-checking fake news reveals how hard it is to kill pervasive \u2018nasty weed\u2019 online,\" Jan. 27, 2017", "CNN, \"Vice President Mike Pence speech right at home at March for Life,\" Jan. 27, 2017", "Indiana General Assembly, House Bill 1337, accessed Feb. 1, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
