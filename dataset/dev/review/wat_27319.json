["By Robert Farley", "Posted on February 7, 2020", "Joe Biden falsely claimed that a hot mic at a NATO reception caught \u201cleaders of the free world\u201d privately saying \u201cthey didn\u2019t think [President Donald Trump] knew anything, they didn\u2019t trust him, et cetera.\u201d Biden has turned Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s mild ribbing about Trump holding long, unscheduled press interviews into something far worse.", "To be clear, none of the world leaders in the video said they \u201cdidn\u2019t think [Trump] knew anything, they didn\u2019t trust him.\u201d", "During a CNN town hall in New Hampshire on Feb. 5, the former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate argued that under Trump, the U.S. has \u201cdistanced ourselves so badly from our allies.\u201d", "\u201cAnd if you think I\u2019m exaggerating, look what happened on the 70th anniversary of NATO,\u201d Biden said. \u201cOK, 70th anniversary, a great historic accomplishment. After the president left, there was an unfortunate circumstance where our allies, the leaders of the free world, were making fun of Trump, pointing out they didn\u2019t think he knew anything, they didn\u2019t trust him, et cetera. It wasn\u2019t just an embarrassment to the United States, as a country. It was devastating in terms of the \u2014 it says a lot about whether or not the rest of the world and the intelligence communities are willing to work with us, share everything with us.\u201d", "Much has been made of a video that captured some of the private conversation between Trudeau, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron, Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands, and Princess Anne at a Buckingham Palace reception on Dec. 3.", "The video shows Johnson asking Macron: \u201cIs that why you were late?\u201d", "Trudeau then interjects: \u201cHe was late \u2018cause he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top every time.\u201d", "\u201cOh yeah, yeah, yeah, 40 minutes. He announced \u2026\u201d Trudeau added. The video cuts out before he finishes that sentence. (Earlier that day, Macron had participated in a 38-minute press event with Trump.)", "The video then resumes with Trudeau saying, \u201cI just watched, I watched his team\u2019s jaws just drop to the floor.\u201d", "The following day, Trudeau confirmed he was talking about Trump in the video and clarified the meaning of his comments.", "\u201cLast night I made a reference to the fact that there was an unscheduled press conference before my meeting with President Trump and I was happy to take part of it but it was certainly notable, and I\u2019ve had a number of good conversations with the president over the course of this day and yesterday,\u201d Trudeau said.", "Trudeau said his comment, \u201cI watched his team\u2019s jaws just drop to the floor,\u201d was a reference to Trump\u2019s announcement that this year\u2019s G-7 summit would be held at Camp David. (Trump had originally proposed holding the summit at the Trump National Doral Golf Club in Miami, drawing criticism from Democrats and some Republicans.)", "At a press conference, Johnson said it was \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d to suggest from the video that he didn\u2019t take Trump seriously.", "Trump clearly did not like Trudeau\u2019s comments. In a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Dec. 4, Trump was asked if he had seen the video, and Trump called Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced.\u201d", "It\u2019s certainly arguable that Trudeau, at least, was \u201cmaking fun of Trump,\u201d as Biden said.", "But Trudeau\u2019s overheard remarks and his explanation of those comments make clear that he was simply making a joke about Trump holding lengthy press conferences. There is no evidence that those leaders were \u201cpointing out they didn\u2019t think he knew anything, they didn\u2019t trust him.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
