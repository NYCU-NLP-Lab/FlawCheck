["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on December 8, 2020", "Viral posts falsely claim that Dominion voting machines were \u201cseized\u201d in Ware County, Georgia, and that votes were found to have been \u201cswitched\u201d for Joe Biden. No such seizure occurred and there was no such finding, according to local and state election officials. Trump handily won the county with 70% of the vote.", "On the same day that Georgia recertified its election results, affirming President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s win in that state, a top elections official again took to debunking falsehoods about the state.", "In part, Gabriel Sterling, Georgia\u2019s voting systems implementation manager, addressed a viral claim spread on social media \u2014 including Facebook and Twitter \u2014 positing that Dominion voting machines in Ware County have been \u201cseized.\u201d Dominion Voting Systems has been a frequent target of conspiracy theories in the aftermath of the presidential election.", "\u201cThere are no seized machines in Ware County. Not true,\u201d Sterling, a Republican, said in a press conference Dec. 7. \u201cDid not happen.\u201d", "The false claim was amplified by some elected Republican officials, including a city councilman in Marysville, Ohio.", "On Dec. 6, Aaron Carpenter, the Ohio councilman, wrote that \u201cthe big news you need to hear about today is Ware County, Georgia,\u201d where \u201cDominion machines were seized.\u201d His tweet was shared more than 40,000 times.", "Two days earlier, Georgia\u2019s Rep. Jody Hice posted a tweet: \u201cYesterday we learned a forensics examination of a Ware County, GA #DominionVotingSystems machine found votes were switched from @realDonaldTrump to @JoeBiden. This is one machine in one county in one state. Did this happen elsewhere? We need to know! EXAMINE ALL THE MACHINES!\u201d", "But the claims are baseless \u2014 a \u201clie,\u201d according to Carlos Nelson, the Ware County elections supervisor. He said he had \u201cno idea where that came from.\u201d", "None \u201cof our equipment was seized,\u201d Nelson, a Democrat, told us in a phone interview. \u201cWe have all of our equipment in hand.\u201d", "Similar to Hice\u2019s tweet, a claim that appeared on social media \u2014 including a\u00a0popular post on the social media platform Parler \u2014 said that \u201cusing sequestered Dominion Equipment, Ware County\u201d found that \u201c37 Trump votes used in the equal sample run had been \u2018Switched\u2019 from Trump to Biden.\u201d", "Nelson\u2019s response: \u201cThere was no vote flipping.\u201d", "Instead, the 37 votes refers to the fact that during the statewide hand count that was done as part of a risk-limiting audit, Trump\u2019s votes in Ware County went up by 37 compared to the initial election results.", "\u201cA statewide hand recount as part of a post-election audit resulted in a difference of 37 additional votes for the president in Ware County,\u201d the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office also noted in a Dec. 7 press release addressing the claim. \u201cThat totals 0.26 percent, well below the average 1-2 percent variation demonstrated by academic research when comparing the accuracy of manual counts compared to machine counts because of normal human error.\u201d", "Nelson said that the error was made while scanning absentee ballots. The ballots are processed in batches and the machine rejected some flawed ballots (say, for a rip), causing workers to have to fix the ballots and resubmit the whole batch. That is not unusual, he said.", "But because the workers didn\u2019t erase the votes preceding the flawed ballots on some batches, the initial reporting reflected additional, incomplete batches, too.", "\u201cThe human error was in the absentee ballot portal,\u201d Nelson said.", "Nelson said the county realized the error after the election because the vote totals were slightly off, but the issue was accounted for and corrected during the hand tally done for the audit. The county\u2019s results were then affirmed during the formal, electronic recount in Georgia that was requested by the Trump campaign.", "In the end, the official recount put Trump up 38 votes and Biden down 42 votes in the county, compared to the initial results. That\u2019s out of 14,189 votes for president in the county. Small variations in a recount are common and expected.", "\u201cThe bottom line is this: The system worked as it was intended to work,\u201d Nelson said.", "Trump won about 70% of the vote in Ware County. The final recount recorded Biden winning Georgia by 11,779 votes.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
