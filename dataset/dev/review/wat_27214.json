But a prank post circulating on Facebook falsely states that the government is sending out checks every week and claim forms are already available.", "The Trump administration recently announced plans for a $1 trillion emergency stimulus package to alleviate economic strain caused by the coronavirus pandemic. According to a proposal by the Treasury Department, the funding includes loans to airlines and small businesses as well as direct payments to individuals.", "The proposal states that the individual payments would come in two rounds, with a total of \u201c$250 billion to be issued beginning April 6\u201d and \u201c$250 billion to be issued beginning May 18.\u201d Each payment to individuals \u201cwould be fixed and tiered based on income level and family size.\u201d", "On March 19, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said adults would initially receive $1,000 and children $500 within three weeks, and a second payment of the same amount in six weeks if the economic disruption continues.", "Details about these payments have not been finalized, and legislation still needs to be drafted and approved by Congress.", "But a series of viral Facebook posts wrongly claim that the government is sending out hundreds of dollars per week to each U.S. citizen \u201cstarting from\u201d either March 16 or March 17, depending on the post.", "\u201cAll US Citizens are Entitled to $700 USD per week to stay at home to avoid the spread of COVID-19 novel Coronavirus, starting from March 17, 2020,\u201d states one post, which has garnered more than 5,000 shares. \u201cThe Government grant pay is accessible to all no matter employment status.\u201d", "The post, accompanied by a \u201cBREAKING NEWS\u201d visual, includes a link that supposedly allows people to \u201cclaim\u201d their money. The link leads to a photo of a gorilla with its middle finger up \u2014 revealing that the post is a joke. The same picture was used as a prank in another series of misleading posts about workplace and school closings due to the coronavirus, which we reported in early March.", "Many commenters understood that the recent posts weren\u2019t accurate. But with the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to give out direct payments in the future, it\u2019s important to sort fact from fiction.", "The Treasury Department proposal states that there will be two payments, not weekly checks, starting on April 6 and May 18. It does not detail how much money each individual will receive, stating only that the amount will be determined in part by \u201cincome level and family size.\u201d", "In a March 19 interview on \u201cMornings with Maria\u201d on Fox Business, Mnuchin did provide dollar amounts for each of those payments \u2014 up to $1,000 for adults and $500 per child \u2014 but that is subject to negotiations with Congress before it can become law.", "A day earlier, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech that \u201ca single $1,000 check\u201d isn\u2019t enough.", "Update, April 1: The president signed the $2 trillion stimulus package into law on March 27.
