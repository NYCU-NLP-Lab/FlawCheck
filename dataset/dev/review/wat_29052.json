["A screenshot of an online article carrying the story has been circulating over the past few days in Kenya and India, among other places.", "A quick Google search allowed us to trace the screenshot to the website Thin Air Today -- we\u2019ve archived the post here. According to data from social media analysis tool CrowdTangle, it has been shared more than 3,000 times on Facebook via various accounts, and received more than 2,000 likes on Instagram since it was published on August 15, 2019.", "However, the website says in a small disclaimer on the bottom of the web page that all of its content is satirical.", "The owner of the website confirmed this in a direct message on Twitter. \u201cI have a satirical aviation-based website, just for fun,\u201d he told AFP Fact-Check, declining to give his name. \u201cAnd for the aviation community. The goal is not to spread fake news but have some fun and think.\u201d", "Other sites have missed the satirical nature of the story", "The story may have been intended as light-hearted fiction, but other websites have since reproduced it without clarifying that it was made up for fun. The Middle East Monitor and Zambian entertainment site Tumfweko relayed the story, as did India\u2019s Times Now before issuing a correction.", "On social media, some users doubted whether the story could be true, while others appeared intrigued by the expensive mistake. Many said they wished that their loved ones would make similar gaffes on their birthdays.", "It\u2019s not that easy to buy an Airbus A350-1000", "According to Airbus\u2019 guide prices for 2018 -- the latest available --\u00a0one A350-1000 costs a whopping $366.5 million, meaning the Saudi victim of the story would have accidentally paid around $733 million for the two planes, despite thinking that what he was getting were model aircrafts.", "\u201cI got lost in currency conversions, I thought it was a bit expensive but still reasonable,\u201d he is quoted as saying in the Thin Air Today post, which says he paid with American Express following a confusing conversation with Airbus staff due to his lack of English.", "In fact, buying a passenger jet from Airbus is not nearly as easy as the story might suggest.", "AFP contacted Airbus media relations manager Matthieu Duvelleroy, who explained that purchasing an A350-1000 is a long process with various different stages.", "\u201cFirst, there needs to be an interest by an airline or a government upon which discussions on the needs will take place. After this, a call for tender will be made followed by price negotiations which could involve the board,\u201d Duvelleroy told us by email.", "\u201cOnce the pricing has been agreed on, contracts will be drafted and signed then the first payment and validation of the scheduled of payment made. The parties will agree on the date of delivery in terms of the actual production plan,\" said Duvelleroy, adding that there were \u201cmany other processes\u201d along the way.", "It is not, contrary to the story, possible to buy an Airbus jet using a personal credit card.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t really buy A350 with your personal credit card,\u201d Duvelleroy said. \u201cThis seems to be fake news.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
