Not long after that, several media outlets published stories claiming that Trump had lied about her college degree. \u00a0The GOP Convention program stated that Trump attended \"University in Slovenia\" where she obtained a degree in architecture and design:", "Born on April 26, 1970 in Slovenia, Melania Knauss began her modeling career at the age of sixteen. At the age of eighteen, she signed with a modeling agency in Milan. After obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia, Melania was jetting between photo shoots in Paris and Milan, finally settling in New York in 1996.", "This same claim appeared on Melania Trump's personal web site when this article was first published:", "Shortly afterwards, the MelaniaTrump.com site was scrubbed from the Internet, and the domain was redirected to the web site for the Trump Organization (Trump.com).  That corporate site contains no mention of Melania's purported degree, or any other biographical information about her.", "There is no \"University in Slovenia,\" nor is there a \"University of Slovenia.\" The country contains several colleges, including the University of Ljubljana, which other news outlets have reported (without citation) was where Melania obtained her degree.

Even after she met Jerko and began dabbling in modeling, she preferred to go home after work, to be with her equally quiet and reserved sister. \u201cShe kept to herself, she was a loner.
