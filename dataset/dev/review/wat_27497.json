The rest depends primarily on thermal sources like natural gas, coal and nuclear.", "As Webber put it, Texas is \"in a gas-dominated energy system.\"", "During the outage, all sources of power generation in Texas were operating beneath normal levels, including wind. However, Webber said, \"the level of failure of the gas system is pretty spectacular.\"", "Newell agreed with Webber, saying that the primary problem is that thermal power plants were not built to withstand the cold. They began to go offline just as freezing temperatures boosted the demand for heating, causing ERCOT to impose rolling blackouts.", "On Feb. 16, demand for power skyrocketed nearly 17 gigawatts past normal levels, while thermal generators lost more than 20 gigawatts of power, Newell said.
