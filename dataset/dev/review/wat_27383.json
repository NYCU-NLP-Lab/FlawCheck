["By Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on February 17, 2021", "President Joe Biden got some facts wrong and spun others in a Feb. 16 town hall that aired on CNN.", "The town hall was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.", "Biden said it was \u201cnot true\u201d that he had revised his 100-day school reopening goal to mean a majority of schools only need to be open one day a week, claiming that was \u201cwhat was reported.\u201d", "It\u2019s what was reported because that\u2019s exactly what White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.", "As we noted in our story \u201cBiden\u2019s Underwhelming School Reopening Goal,\u201d two studies that looked at random samples of school districts around the country estimated that a majority of schools were already offering in-person school at least one day a week, and had been doing so before Biden took office.", "At his town hall, Biden told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that his 100-day goal is to have a majority of kindergarten through eighth grade schools open five days a week, and he blamed the confusion on \u201ca mistake in the communication.\u201d", "Cooper: Well, let me ask you, your administration had set a goal to open the majority of schools in your first 100 days. You\u2019re now saying that means those schools may only be open for at least one day a week \u2014", "Biden: No, that\u2019s not true. That\u2019s what was reported. That\u2019s not true. That was a mistake in the communication. But what I\u2019m talking about is I said opening the majority of schools in K through eighth grade, because they\u2019re the easiest to open, the most needed to be open in terms of the impact on children and families having to stay at home.", "Cooper:\u00a0So when do you think that would be K through eight, at least five days a week if possible?", "Biden:\u00a0I think we\u2019ll be close to that at the end of the first 100 days.", "Biden\u2019s answer may have left the impression that the media had misreported the specifics of his goal. But that\u2019s not the case.", "The fine-print addition to Biden\u2019s stated 100-day goal was detailed by Psaki in a Feb. 9\u00a0press briefing,\u00a0when a reporter asked what exactly Biden\u2019s definition of \u201copen schools\u201d was.", "\u201cHis goal that he set is to have the majority of schools \u2014 so, more than 50 percent \u2014 open by day 100 of his presidency,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cAnd that means some teaching in classrooms. So, at least one day a week. Hopefully, it\u2019s more. And obviously, it is as much as is safe in each school and local district.\u201d Later, she put it his way: \u201cteaching at least one day a week in the majority of schools, by day 100.\u201d", "Psaki did not move off that clarification of the goal when asked at a\u00a0press conference\u00a0the following day why Biden had never \u201cmentioned the small print that that was just going to be for one day a week.\u201d Psaki said, essentially, that no one had asked.", "\u201cThe president made a \u2014 set a goal of reopening the majority of schools within 100 days, and when you asked what that meant, I answered the question,\u201d Psaki said.", "Psaki described that narrower goal as \u201cour own effort to \u2026 set a bold and ambitious agenda for how we\u2019re going to measure ourselves and progress.\u201d She added that the administration hoped to \u201cexceed\u201d that goal.", "Indeed, as we have written, the U.S. may already be exceeding the goal defined by Psaki. According to\u00a0Burbio, a company that\u00a0aggregates school event information and\u00a0tracks school reopenings,\u00a040.6% of K-12 students in the U.S. are attending schools that offer traditional, in-person learning; 25.5% are attending schools that offer hybrid, or two to three days a week in-person learning; and 33.9% are attending schools that offer \u201cvirtual only\u201d school.", "In other words, as of Feb. 10, an estimated 66.1% of K-12 students attended schools that offer either traditional in-person instruction every day, or hybrid instruction \u2014 at least one day a week in person.", "Reaching the goal as stated by Biden may take a little longer. As we said, Burbio estimates that about 40% of K-12 students in the U.S. are attending regular, full-time, in-person school.", "We should note that the Burbio data is for K-12 students, and Biden\u2019s goal is specifically for kindergarten through eighth grade \u2014 not high schools \u2014 a\u00a0caveat\u00a0Biden has been adding since late December. At the town hall, Biden said his goal has been focused on the earlier grades \u201cbecause they\u2019re the easiest to open, the most needed to be open in terms of the impact on children and families having to stay home\u201d and because high school students \u201csocialize a lot more and they\u2019re older and they transmit more than young kids do.\u201d", "The Department of Education\u00a0says\u00a0it will begin collecting data on the status of elementary and middle school reopenings, but that information is not yet available.", "Biden made some confusing comments on the amount of COVID-19 vaccines that were available when he took office, and his remarks left the false impression that the preceding administration had contracted for fewer vaccines than it actually had.", "Biden said when he took office \u201cthere was only 50 million doses that were available. We have now, by the end of July we\u2019ll have over 600 million doses, enough to vaccinate every single American.\u201d", "Shortly after that, he said that \u201cwe got into office and found out the supply, there was no backlog, I mean there was nothing in the refrigerator figuratively and literally speaking.\u201d", "The latter comment appeared to contradict his earlier statement that there were 50 million doses available when he was inaugurated, but Biden said \u201cthere was no backlog.\u201d", "That\u2019s not surprising, given the Washington Post had reported on Jan. 15 that the Trump administration had stopped holding in reserve second doses of the vaccines and had begun sending those to states in late December. (Both of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized so far \u2014 from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna \u2014 require two shots, spaced a few weeks apart.) The then-incoming Biden administration also had supported such a policy of not holding back doses.", "There was a backlog in terms of allocated vaccines not yet being administered. As of the morning of Jan. 30, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said nearly 50 million doses had been distributed and nearly 30 million had been administered. As of the morning of Feb. 17, 56.2 million doses have been administered out of 72.4 million delivered, according to the CDC.", "Overall, there have been issues with vaccine supply. A late December NBC News analysis determined: \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine distribution program needs a major shot in the arm because at the current rate, it would take almost 10 years to inoculate enough Americans to get the pandemic under control.\u201d", "As for Biden\u2019s comment that \u201cby the end of July we\u2019ll have over 600 million doses,\u201d that was the plan of Donald Trump\u2019s administration, too, though that plan depended on other vaccines in development getting authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. The Biden administration asked Pfizer and Moderna, the only two companies that now have authorized COVID-19 vaccines, to provide the U.S. with more.", "According to the Government Accountability Office, \u201cAs of December 31, 2020, the government had at least 800 million vaccine doses under contract expected to be delivered by July 31, 2021, pending any issues with clinical trials, EUA issuance, or other factors.\u201d Those doses included vaccines from four companies who have not yet received FDA authorization.", "In the town hall, Biden said: \u201cWe\u2019ve moved out, went to the Pfizer and Moderna and said, can you produce more vaccine and more rapidly? They not only agreed to go from 200 to 400, then they agreed to go to 600 million doses.\u201d", "Pfizer and Moderna had already agreed to go to 400 million doses (200 million each) in December. The initial agreement with the Trump administration was for 200 million doses total from the two companies, but the administration made agreements for another 200 million total by July 31, according to the GAO report.", "The Biden administration announced this month the two companies would provide another 200 million doses by then, for a total of 600 million.", "When asked what he would do to increase the number of available vaccines for Black and Hispanic people, Biden overstated what his administration has done.", "Biden wrongly claimed that Federally Qualified Health Centers, or FQHCs, would now receive 1 million vaccines\u00a0per week.\u00a0But that\u2019s the\u00a0total\u00a0number of vaccines that they will receive \u2014 at least initially.", "Biden:\u00a0That\u2019s why last week I opened up, I met with the Black Caucus in the United States Congress and agreed that I would \u2014 all of the \u2014 all of community health centers now, which take care of the toughest of the toughest neighborhoods in terms of illness, they are going to get a million doses, you know, a week, and how we\u2019re going to move forward because they\u2019re in the neighborhood.", "On Feb. 9, the Biden administration\u00a0announced\u00a0that FQHCs would receive vaccines for their clients, beginning Feb. 15. On the day of the announcement, Psaki, the White House press secretary,\u00a0said, \u201cUltimately, in this initial program phase, we plan to reach 250 community health centers. And again, across this initial phase, our goal is to allocate 1 million doses during this phase. That\u2019s 500,000 first doses and 500,000 second doses.\u201d", "Biden claimed, without evidence, that racehorse owners receive tax breaks worth almost $9 billion. The president made that remark while advocating for having the federal government pay to provide free tuition for community college students.", "Biden:\u00a0Everyone should be able to go to community college for free, for free. That costs $9 billion. And we should pay for it. And the tax policies we have now, we should be able to pay for you. You spend almost that much money as a break for people who own racehorses.", "Biden is right that it would cost about $9 billion to provide free tuition at the two-year colleges,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Department of Education. But we found no evidence of a $9 billion tax break for racehorse owners. The White House did not provide any evidence, and tax and budget experts we interviewed were left scratching their heads trying to figure out what the president meant.", "There was criticism late last year of certain tax provisions contained in a\u00a0massive $2.3 trillion bill\u00a0that then-President Trump\u00a0signed into law\u00a0on Dec. 27 to fund the government and provide COVID-19 relief.", "Among other things, the bill contained\u00a0provisions that benefited racehorse owners. \u201cThe provision most people focus on is the special cost-recovery rule for racehorses age 2 or younger,\u201d\u00a0Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told us.", "\u201cMost horses must be depreciated over 7 years, but one of the tax extenders temporarily allows these young horses to be depreciated over just 3 years,\u201d Gleckman explained. \u201cThis is scheduled to expire at the end of 2021.\u201d", "But the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress\u2019 nonpartisan scorekeeper,\u00a0said\u00a0that provision had no impact on federal revenues,\u00a0despite criticism\u00a0of it. \u201cSpecial depreciation rules for young racehorses may be indefensible as tax policy but they don\u2019t cost the government a lot of money, at least in the context of the federal budget,\u201d Gleckman said.", "\u201cHorse breeding overall is a relatively small business as these things go: about $1b annually in revenues\u201d for all North American breeders, Gleckman said, citing\u00a02019 data\u00a0from the Jockey Club.\u00a0Alicia Hughes, a spokeswoman for the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, also cited the $1 billion in annual revenues in an email to us about Biden\u2019s statement.", "\u201cThe President is NOT correct when he says the tax break for horse owners costs almost $9 billion \u2013 especially when the total sales figures for horses at public auction is only around $1 billion,\u201d she said.", "Alex Waldrop,\u00a0CEO of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, said:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t really know what he\u2019s referring to.\u201d He was not alone.", "Steve Ellis, president of the government waste watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Biden\u2019s remark about racehorse owners \u201cleaves me scratching my head,\u201d adding, \u201cfor the life of me I can\u2019t figure out what he was referencing beyond this relatively small provision.\u201d", "Biden said there is \u201cconsensus among economists left, right, and center\u201d that \u201cwe can\u2019t spend too much\u201d in a COVID-19 relief bill. In fact, even some center-left-leaning economists have raised concerns that Biden\u2019s proposed $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan may be too large.", "Cooper: You\u2019ve made passing COVID relief bill the focus of your first 100 days. Those on the right say the proposal is too big. Some on the left say it\u2019s not big enough. Are you committed to passing $1.9 trillion bill or is that final number still up for negotiation?", "Biden: I\u2019m committed to pass \u2014 look, here\u2019s \u2014 some of you are probably economists or college professors or you\u2019re teachers in school. This is the first time in my career \u2014 and as you can tell, I\u2019m over 30 \u2014 the first time in my career that there is a consensus among economists left, right, and center that is over \u2014 and including the IMF and in Europe, that overwhelming consensus is, in order to grow the economy a year, two, three, and four down the line, we can\u2019t spend too much.", "In fact, there has been spirited debate among center-left economists about just that.", "In an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0published in the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0on Feb. 5, Larry Summers, former U.S. treasury secretary to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama\u2019s National Economic Council chair, argued that legislators needed to consider the potential risk that the spending is too large.", "\u201cJudged relative to either the macroeconomic output gap or declines in family incomes, the proposed covid-19 relief package appears very large,\u201d Summers wrote.", "Summers warned the massive spending package could trigger a sharp rise in inflation and could hinder future \u201cpublic investments that should be the nation\u2019s highest priority.\u201d", "Former International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard echoed Summers\u2019 concerns,\u00a0writing\u00a0on Twitter on Feb. 5, \u201cI am known as a dove. I believe that the absolute priority is to protect people and firms affected by covid. Still, I agree with Summers. The 1.9 trillion program could overheat the economy so badly as to be counterproductive. Protection can be achieved with less.\u201d", "The following day, Blanchard\u00a0added, \u201cLet me double down and go through some numbers. I agree that too much is better than too little and we should aim for some overheating. The question is how much. Much too much is both possible and harmful. I think this package is too much.\u201d", "Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, told the\u00a0New York Times, \u201cWe\u2019re already in uncharted territory.\u201d Noting that fourth-quarter gross domestic product was only about $119 billion below where it was a year ago, Holtz-Eakin said, \u201cDo we need another $1.9 trillion to deal with that problem? I have an arithmetic problem with where we are.\u201d", "In\u00a0an analysis\u00a0of Biden\u2019s plan, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculated that the $1.9 trillion proposal would \u201clikely be enough to close the output gap\u201d between actual and potential GDP \u201ctwo to three times over.\u201d That \u201covershoot could be beneficial\u201d the report states, but the authors also warned it could \u201cpose risks to the economy and the fiscal outlook.\u201d", "\u201cWhile the economy can operate above its long-term potential for periods of time, it cannot do so indefinitely or sustainably,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cOne possibility is that the excess funds are economically ineffective, adding to the debt without improving the economy.\u201d The excess stimulus could also lead to higher inflation, the report states, and could lead to \u201can economic cliff or crash as the stimulus fades.\u201d", "To be sure, there are also\u00a0many\u00a0economists\u00a0who\u00a0think\u00a0the stimulus package proposed by Biden is appropriately sized. We\u2019re not going to wade into how many economists may agree or disagree with Biden\u2019s proposal, let alone who is right, but as the examples we cited above show, Biden was stretching the facts when he claimed there is \u201cconsensus among economists left, right, and center\u201d that \u201cwe can\u2019t spend too much.\u201d", "In talking about his support for a $15 federal minimum wage, Biden mixed up his talking points, wrongly saying that if the current rate had been indexed for inflation, it would be $20 an hour now.", "Biden: For example, if it went \u2014 if we gradually increased it \u2014 when we indexed it at $7.20, if we kept it indexed by \u2014 to inflation, people would be making 20 bucks an hour right now.", "The federal minimum wage was set at $7.25 in July 2009, and it remains there today. If it had been tied to inflation, however, it would be $8.81, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 inflation calculator.", "The left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, however, did say that the minimum wage would be more than $20 if it had kept pace with worker productivity, not inflation. The White House press office referred us to that report. \u201cWhile the national minimum wage did rise roughly in step with productivity growth from its inception in 1938 until 1968, in the more than five decades since then, it has not even kept pace with inflation,\u201d senior economist Dean Baker wrote in January 2020. \u201cHowever, if the minimum wage did rise in step with productivity growth since 1968 it would be over $24 an hour today.\u201d", "While answering a question on whether he would sign immigration legislation that did not include a pathway to citizenship for the millions of people already living in the U.S. illegally, Biden wrongly said that most of the unauthorized population is not Hispanic and came to the U.S. legally but overstayed their visas.", "\u201cThe vast majority of the people, those 11 million undocumented, they\u2019re not Hispanics,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey\u2019re people who came on a visa, was able to buy a ticket to get in a plane, and didn\u2019t go home. They didn\u2019t come across the Rio Grande and swim.\u201d", "That\u2019s false.", "A\u00a0February 2020 report\u00a0written by\u00a0Robert Warren\u00a0of the Center for Migration Studies estimated that, of the 10.6 million people in the U.S. illegally in 2018, \u201cabout 5.7 million (54 percent) entered across the border, and 4.9 million (46 percent) entered with a temporary visa and overstayed.\u201d", "The report does make the point that a majority of the 4 million of the total unauthorized population who arrived between 2010 and 2018 originally came to the U.S. legally.", "\u201cOf those, 2.6 million (66 percent) overstayed their temporary visas, and 1.3 million (34 percent) entered illegally across the border,\u201d it said.", "And though the report doesn\u2019t offer a breakdown by race or ethnicity, it does show that at least 70% of individuals in the U.S. illegally, as of 2018, are estimated to have come from primarily Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. Mexico alone (5.11 million) accounted for nearly half (48%) of the unauthorized population in the U.S. in 2018, the report said.", "Those figures are similar to the most recent country-of-origin\u00a0estimates\u00a0from the Migration Policy Institute.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
