Thom Tillis claims that his Democratic opponent is out of touch with most North Carolinians.", "And he saved one of his more memorable accusations against Cal Cunningham for his closing statement in the Sept. 14 debate on WRAL.", "\"Cal criticizes tax breaks for the wealthy, but when Cal was making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, he got a $40,000 tax incentive to update his butler\u2019s pantry,\" Tillis said in his closing statement. (Around the 58-minute mark of this video).", "\"I didn\u2019t know what a butler\u2019s pantry was because we didn\u2019t have them in the trailer parks I grew up in,\" he said. \"But really, he may have qualified for it but used that.

Richard Burr questioned his opponent\u2019s use of the same tax credits back in 2016.)", "So what\u2019s the truth about Cunningham\u2019s use of the tax credit and his home renovation?", "Cunningham did receive a $38,000 tax credit for renovations to his house, which is considered a historic property.", "A butler\u2019s pantry was one part of several renovations.", "The \"butler\u2019s pantry\" and \"wet bar\" were two terms used by an inspector to describe the same area in Cunningham\u2019s kitchen.

At the same time, some who qualify might be middle-class.
