["A video of a woman delivering a speech on Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s special status, criticising the Indian government, is viral on social media with the claim that she is the granddaughter of Maharaja Hari Singh, the last ruler of the princely state of J&K. The woman can be heard saying, \u201cWhen the Indian constitution was made, Nehru called Sheikh Abdullah that how shall we define your relationship with us. To which Sheikh Abdullah at that time said, the article which we have given to in the instrument of annexation those should be reflected and nothing else. Because it is temporary and it is conditional and it can remain there only till the dispute is resolved. So, it is temporary in that sense. Because I want to tell it to the Indian public that India has not given us any special status which other states can also ask. In fact, they have taken power from us and they have taken our sovereignty and our whole struggle is for the restoration of that sovereignty.\u201d", "#Khalistan Brilliantly explained.
