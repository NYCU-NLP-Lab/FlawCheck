Next time someone puts them on a pedestal and says we can't question their judgement on guns or whatever, show them this image.\"", "So, Parsa claims that 34 of the 47 founding fathers shown in the painting were slaveholders.", "With the caveat that there is no one definitive source on this question, we also counted 34.", "We contacted more than a dozen historians and historical organizations. None knew of a list that identified how many of the men in the painting were slaveholders.", "\"I would have assumed that it would be easy to find out how many owned slaves, but it is surprisingly elusive,\" Baylor University history professor Thomas Kidd told us.", "Starting with evidence Parsa provided to back up his claim, we did our own research on each of the 47.
