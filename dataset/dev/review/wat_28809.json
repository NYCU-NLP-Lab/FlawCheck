It may, however, be noted that these claims are false. Moreover, the video is not recent.", "To ascertain the origin of the video and the correct narrative, Alt News used specific key words and found several news reports. The said incident had indeed occurred in Bihar. However, there was no reference to either RSS or Bajrang Dal in any of these reports. The incident had taken place in Bihiya town of Bhojpur district in August 2018. The woman was suspected to be involved in the death of a youth whose body was found near the railway station. This resulted in protests, and the woman, who lived in a red-light area nearby, was dragged out and assaulted on the street. Moreover, it may be noted that RJD leader Kaushal Kishore Yadav was among 16 people arrested for the violence at Bihiya.", "It may be reiterated that an old video has been shared with a false narrative.
