Fred Upton, for his voting record on health care.", "\"He voted a dozen times to kick thousands of Michigan families off their health insurance and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions,\" an ad from Hoadley states.", "The basis of Hoadley\u2019s attack is Upton\u2019s consistent opposition to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which barred insurance companies from discriminating \u2014 in pricing and coverage \u2014 against people with preexisting medical conditions, such as cancer survivors and kids with diabetes as Hoadley\u2019s ad notes.", "The ACA also introduced federal subsidies for Americans to buy coverage in the individual insurance market and for states to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income Americans.", "In 2019, more than 500,000 Michiganders were covered under plans purchased in the individual market, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

If the law is repealed or struck down by the Supreme Court, many could face higher costs for health insurance, lose automatic coverage or become unable to afford coverage.", "A New York Times analysis says as many as 21 million people would be at risk of becoming uninsured.", "They would also lose protection under ACA provisions that bar discrimination against people with preexisting medical conditions.
