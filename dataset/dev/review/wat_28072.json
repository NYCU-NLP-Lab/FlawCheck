["By Joseph A. Gambardello", "Posted on November 20, 2020", "A dubious website claims without evidence that Philadelphia mob boss Joseph \u201cSkinny Joey\u201d Merlino stuffed ballot boxes for Joe Biden and the Democrats \u2014 and would testify about the scheme in exchange for a presidential pardon. Merlino\u2019s attorney denies the claim, which originated on a website operated by a self-described \u201cpro-Trump\u201d political consultant.", "Since President Donald Trump\u2019s baseless allegation at the Sept. 29 presidential debate that \u201cbad things happen in Philadelphia\u201d during elections, the city of Philadelphia has been the target of false claims of voting irregularities, as we\u2019ve reported.", "The shade cast on the city took another twist on Nov. 14, in a story published by The Buffalo Chronicle, a website operated by a right-wing political consultant that is regularly found to publish disinformation. The Chronicle article \u2014 which cites no named sources \u2014 claims South Philadelphia mob boss Joseph \u201cSkinny Joey\u201d Merlino and associates stuffed ballot boxes with 300,000 fraudulent votes for President-elect Joe Biden.", "The story claims the scheme was supported by Democrats in the Philadelphia elections office and netted $3 million for Merlino and his associates. It also claims Merlino might be willing to drop a dime on the operation in public hearings in exchange for a pardon for all his past crimes from Trump \u2014 setting the stage for Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature to deny certification of the state\u2019s 20 electoral votes.", "But Merlino \u2014 who served a 14-year prison sentence for extortion and illegal gambling \u2014\u00a0has called the claims \u201ccrazy,\u201d according to his lawyer. A spokesman for Philadelphia election officials said the story is \u201cludicrous.\u201d And a Philadelphia mob expert said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d", "Still, the bogus tale went viral on Nov. 16 after Jordan Sekulow, the son of Trump attorney Jay Sekulow, tweeted it with the admonition: \u201cFollow all leads.\u201d The story was picked up by far-right websites, such as Gateway Pundit, and spread on Facebook and other social media platforms. One Facebook user, @TheHipHopPatriot, posted a video calling the story \u201cbreaking news.\u201d", "According to unofficial results, more than 604,000 votes in Philadelphia went to Biden and over 132,000 to Trump. Lawyers for Trump\u2019s campaign, led by his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, have been trying without success to challenge the vote in Philadelphia and other Pennsylvania counties.", "Even Giuliani, who has made no headway on discrediting the Pennsylvania election in court, alluded to the story in an interview on Fox Business on Nov. 17, but said it was \u201cfar-fetched.\u201d", "The Chronicle\u2019s story says the scheme involved the production of 300,000 raw ballots, which were filled in with Sharpie markers in a 60-hour operation at two homes before being dropped off \u201cin non-descript boxes\u201d at the vote counting center at the Pennsylvania Convention Center.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just ludicrous to suggest anyone but authorized election officials could bring ballot boxes into the Convention Center,\u201d Kevin Feeley, spokesman for the City Commissioners Office, which oversees elections, told us in a phone interview.", "He said stories like this are \u201ca disservice to all the decent, hard-working people who strive to make our elections transparent.\u201d", "The story claims that besides a presidential pardon, Merlino\u2019s motivation for exposing the operation included multimillion-dollar book deals and a clean record so he could fish and hunt on federal land and even get a job with the National Park Service.", "\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of him hunting or fishing or wanting to go to a wildlife preserve,\u201d George Anastasia, an author and former reporter on organized crime at the Philadelphia Inquirer, told us in a phone interview. He noted that Merlino is currently living in Florida on supervised release for a gambling conviction.", "Anastasia said he first thought the Chronicle story was satire. \u201cIt stretches credulity. It does not make any sense,\u201d said Anastasia, who could not recall mob involvement in election-day shenanigans in the past.", "Merlino\u2019s attorney, John Meringolo, did not respond to our request for comment, but he told the New York Daily News that after reading the Chronicle story, Merlino said, \u201cthese people are crazy.\u201d", "\u201cMy client categorically denies all the allegations and Joey would rather die than ever be a snitch,\u201d Meringolo told the New York Daily News.", "The Buffalo Chronicle and its publisher, Matthew Ricchiazzi, a self-described \u201cpro-Trump\u201d political consultant in western New York, have a reputation for spreading disinformation.", "Last year, a joint investigation by BuzzFeed and the Toronto Star found that Ricchiazzi \u201cpublished unsigned articles based on unnamed sources that allege backroom dealings at the highest levels of the Canadian government\u201d during Canada\u2019s election. \u201cSeveral of the stories have been deemed false or unsupported by news organizations,\u201d the report said.", "BuzzFeed News and the Star said their investigation \u201cconfirmed that Ricchiazzi once offered to publish positive or negative coverage of political candidates for a fee.\u201d The fees: $200 for a positive story, $400 for a negative story about an opponent.", "Twitter has suspended both the Chronicle\u2019s and Ricchiazzi\u2019s accounts, the news organizations reported.", "The CBC\u2019s news program, \u201cThe National,\u201d also took a look at the Chronicle during a segment on the impact of fake news on the Canadian election, sending co-host Adrienne Arsenault to Buffalo, only to discover the site\u2019s listed address was an abandoned building.", "The Chronicle\u2019s fabricated story about Merlino again highlights the need for readers to check the source of a story and its content, and to see if the information is supported by solid reporting using legitimate, identifiable sources.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
