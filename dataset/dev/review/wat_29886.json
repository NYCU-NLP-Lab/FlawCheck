It further suggests that due to high unemployment in the country, a huge crowd of youth had gathered for admissions and the police in Jalandhar had to control them by resorting to lathi-charge. They were caught on a live wire while trying to escape and many of them lost their lives, the claim concludes.", "\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092c\u0947\u0930\u094b\u091c\u093c\u0917\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0907\u0924\u0928\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u093f \u0915\u0941\u091b \u0938\u0940\u091f \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u090f\u092f\u0930\u092b\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0938 \u092d\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0907\u0924\u0928\u0940 \u092d\u0940\u0921\u093c \u0939\u094b \u0917\u0908 \u0915\u093f \u091c\u0932\u0902\u0927\u0930 \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938 \u0928\u0947 \u0932\u093e\u0920\u0940\u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091c \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e ! \u0935\u094b \u0926\u0940\u0935\u093e\u0930 \u092b\u093e\u0902\u0926\u0915\u0930 \u092d\u093e\u0917\u0928\u0947 \u0932\u0917\u0947 \u0924\u094b live wire \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u091d\u0941\u0932\u0938 \u0917\u090f, \u0915\u0908 \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u094c\u0924 \u0939\u094b \u0917\u0908 !", "\u0932\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928, \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0902 370 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948 ! \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0939\u093e\u0932 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u0941\u0927 \u0915\u094c\u0928 \u0932\u0947\u0917\u093e? pic.twitter.com/UHeeWcn3UJ", "\u2014 Gabbar \ud83d\udc2f (@Gabbar0099) August 6, 2019", "The video with the accompanying text has been widely circulated on Facebook and Twitter.
