Lewis, now a veteran congressman from Atlanta, recently used another approach to voice his criticism concerning what he sees as another form of racial injustice.", "Lewis, a Democrat, co-wrote an op-ed that focused on his belief that African-Americans are being treated unfairly in the criminal justice system. The problem starts early, wrote Lewis and Bryan Stevenson, who teaches law at New York University.", "\"Black children constitute 18 percent of the nation's public school population but 40 percent of the children who are suspended or expelled,\" they wrote.", "PolitiFact Georgia read the op-ed and wondered about the statistics they used to back up their argument.

We rated that statement Half True.", "Brenda Jones, a spokeswoman for Lewis, said Stevenson culled the information from a U.S. Department of Education online warehouse of school suspensions and expulsions. Jones said they relied on a 2009-2010 survey to come up with the numbers and a 2012 Children\u2019s Defense Fund report on the subject.", "\"The results from the schools surveyed show public school systems where Black students represented 18 percent of students but 46 percent of those suspended more than once and 39 percent of those expelled,\" Jones said in one email.", "U.S. Department of Education researchers looked at 85 percent of the nation\u2019s public school students in some 72,000 schools in a widely publicized report released in March 2012.
