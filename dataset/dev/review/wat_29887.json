["About this rating", "The long-running controversy surrounding protests by some National Football League players during the national anthem took yet another turn in late December 2017, when reports emerged that league bosses had decided to stop funding military and other charities, and shift their donations to the Black Lives Matter movement.", "On 14 December, Facebook user Kevin Schmersal posted, with no citations or supporting evidence:", "The NFL has removed their financial donations to military families and given that money to Black Lives Matter.", "This claim is false on its face. There is no plan for any funding to be provided to the Black Lives Matter movement, and reports to that effect misrepresent the details of an agreement between the NFL and protesting players which would reportedly see $89 million provided for social justice activities over the next seven years.", "On 1 December 2017, an obscure web site called Patriot.Report published a story with the inaccurate headline \"NFL Betrays Military and Cancer Victims, Donates to Black Lives Matter,\" while Breitbart.com reported that the NFL was \"siphoning\" donations from breast cancer and military charities to fund social justice programs.\u00a0 These reports are based on a 30 November 2017 story in which San Francisco 49ers player Eric Reid said that the league would be shifting funds from existing charitable commitments in order to pay for an $89 million social justice program over the next seven years:", "\u201cIn the discussion that we had, Malcolm conveyed to us\u2014based on discussions that he had with the NFL\u2014that the money would come from funds that are already allocated to breast cancer awareness and Salute to Service,\u201d Reid said in an interview with Slate. \u201cSo it would really be no skin off the owners\u2019 backs: They would just move the money from those programs to this one.\u201d", "\u201cWe didn\u2019t agree with that, because we weren\u2019t trying to cut other worthy programs,\u201d he added, discussing his and other players\u2019 decision, announced on Wednesday, to leave the Players Coalition. \u201cThey moved forward anyways.\u201d", "The social justice funding was agreed between NFL officials and the Players Coalition, a group of NFL players at the forefront of ongoing national anthem protests that\u00a0 emerged in response to racial and social injustice, in particular police brutality against African-American men.", "However, none of the funding will go to the Black Lives Matter movement. According to ESPN, a quarter of the money is slated to be provided to the United Negro College Fund, which provides scholarships for black students to attend historically black universities; another quarter will go to Dream Corps, which supports and funds social justice initiatives focused on criminal justice reform; the remaining 50 percent will go to the Players Coalition.", "Reid also told Slate that he and others had left the Players Coalition over this arrangement, because they did not want to \"cut other worthy programs.\"", "\"Salute to Service\" is the NFL's \"military appreciation\" campaign, which involves recognition of the United States military and its members at games as well as donations to military-related charities such as the Wounded Warrior Project and the Pat Tillman Foundation.", "The NFL's Vice President for Communications, Brian McCarthy, called Eric Reid's claims \"absolutely false.\" McCarthy told us in an e-mail:", "This new program will supplement, and not replace, our other key social responsibility efforts, including Salute to Service, cancer awareness, domestic violence/sexual assault and youth programs.", "When asked whether this meant team owners would be required to provide separate, additional funding for the $89 million social justice program, rather than simply reallocating existing donations, McCarthy said:", "The league office and also the clubs will contribute funds. There\u2019s no effect on other existing programs.", "We asked representatives for both Eric Reid and Malcolm Jenkins whether they could clarify or explain the contradiction, but we did not receive a response from either in time for publication.", "Garcia, Arturo.\u00a0 \"Why Are NFL Players on the Sidelines for the National Anthem?\"\r\n\u00a0 Snopes.com.\u00a0 25 October 2016.", "Flynn, Daniel J.\u00a0 \"Anthem Kneeler Says NFL Siphoning from Breast Cancer, Military Donations to Give Social Justice Causes $89 Million.\"\r\n\u00a0 Breitbart.\u00a0 1 December 2017.", "Stalh, Jeremy.\u00a0 \"'It's a Charade.'\"\r\n\u00a0 Slate.\u00a0 30 November 2017.", "Trotter, Jim; Reid, Jason.\u00a0 \"Sources: NFL Agrees to Commit $89M Over Seven Years to Social Justice Causes.\"\r\n\u00a0 ESPN.\u00a0 30 November 2017.", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
