["About this rating", "On 30 December 2017, the web site reaganwasright.com published an article reporting that a federal judge had ruled that \"three items of Sharia law\" were now deemed to be legal in the state of Texas:", "If you\u2019re a Muslim living in the state of Texas you can now legally beat your wife for looking at another man, crush the fingers of those who steal from you and defend your sacred Moon God with \u201cthe same resolve as if you were defending your person.\u201d This comes after an Obama-appointed Federal Judge ruled in favor of a man convicted of doing all of those things.", "The judge stated in his ruling that a man who had just come from war-torn Syria couldn\u2019t possibly have known that the things that are common and typical to him are against the law in America. Unfortunately, this particular judge has no idea what he\u2019s just done. By overturning the conviction and not just dismissing the case, he set precedent. That precedent, until lawmakers can change it, says that Muslims are allowed to do these things under Texas law.", "Observant readers might notice the paucity of detail in this article: nowhere does it identify the \"Syrian\" man whose conviction was supposedly overturned, the judge who issued the ruling, which court heard the case, the text of the decision, or any other actual aspect of the story.", "This is hardly surprising, as the story originated with reaganwasright.com, one of a network of fake news sites that traffics in clickbait political trolling falsely labeled as \"satire.\"", "This article wasn't even original for a troll, as it was largely similar to another piece on the same subject published the previous year.", "Eagleton, Flagg. \u00a0 \"Federal Judge Rules 3 Items of Sharia Law Now Legal in Texas.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 reaganwasright.com. \u00a0 30 December 2017.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
