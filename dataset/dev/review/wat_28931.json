It would have applied to pharmacists and other health care providers, but it did not become law.\n\nThe bill would have:", "Asked to respond to the Planned Parenthood Advocates flier, Jill Bader, spokeswoman for Walker\u2019s gubernatorial campaign, said it was \"completely false\" that the bill had anything to do with birth control.\n\nBut news stories at the time described how Walker\u2019s bill targeted RU-486, an abortion pill, and the \"morning-after\" pill, which prevents a pregnancy. The articles also told how the proposal could have allowed pharmacists to refuse to dispense most other forms of birth control.\n\n\"Could\" and \"most\" are the operative words.\n\nBut both Harrington and Matt Sande of Pro-Life Wisconsin say the protections for pharmacists in Walker\u2019s bill would have applied to the dispensing of all types of birth control.\n\nBack to the claim about Walker.\n\nThe claim does not address pills or devices, but rather how pharmacists would have been allowed to function had the bill become law.\n\nPlanned Parenthood says flatly: Pharmacists would have been able to block women from getting birth control.\n\nIn truth, the effects would have been more limited.\n\nAn individual pharmacist could have refused to fill a particular birth control prescription. But women could have gotten the prescription filled by another pharmacist, perhaps at the same counter, or at another pharmacy. In many places, that might have amounted to an inconvenience, though in areas with few pharmacies, a refusal by one pharmacist could have created a bigger burden.\n\nAs for the 2010 race, both candidates have given their views on the issue: Barrett says he opposes efforts to allow pharmacists to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions; Walker says he supports allowing pharmacists to refuse to fill emergency contraception prescriptions on moral grounds.\n\nThe claim by Planned Parenthood is still off the mark.\n\nIn an effort to paint Walker as extreme, the group\u2019s lobbying arm says in a direct mail piece that Walker \"tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women\u2019s access to birth control.\" That bill might have made it more difficult for some women to get contraceptives at some pharmacies, depending on who was on duty. But words matter -- the possible narrowing of access to birth control in some cases isn\u2019t the same as blocking it in all cases.", "We rate the claim as Barely True.", "E-mail interview with Scott Walker for governor campaign spokeswoman Jill Bader, Oct. 12, 2010\n\nInterview with Pro-Life Wisconsin Director of Legislative Affairs Matt Sande, Oct. 12, 2010\n\nInterviews with Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin spokeswoman Amanda Harrington, Oct. 11 and 13, 2010\n\nMayo Clinic, \"morning-after pill\" definition\n\nMayo Clinic, medical abortion (RU-486)\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, Panel backs bill on ethics, medical duties, by Associated Press, April 19, 2001\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, When health care, morality collide, April 12, 2001\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, Abortion, birth control are wedge issues in governor's race, Oct. 2, 2010\n\nPlanned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin, Barrett endorsement news release, June 7, 2010 \u00a0\n\nPlanned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin, flier", "Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, Planned Parenthood Advocates of WI Election Fund (PPAWI PAC)", "Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, Organizations employing lobbyists in 2009-2010", "Wisconsin Legislature, History of Assembly Bill 168", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
