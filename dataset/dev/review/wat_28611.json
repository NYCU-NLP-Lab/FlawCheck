["By Katherine Hartzell", "Posted on September 13, 2019", "A conservative rant circulating on Facebook has been falsely credited to the actor Tim Allen.", "A post\u00a0shared by thousands of Facebook users begins, \u201cTim Allen is credited with writing this,\u201d and includes a photograph of the actor and comedian. The post includes several conservative viewpoints, such as, \u201cWe are one election away from open borders, socialism, gun confiscation, and full-term abortion nationally,\u201d and \u201cI am grateful that Hillary Clinton is not the president of the United States of America.\u201d It also makes false claims about Chelsea Clinton, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and \u201cthe Obamacare website\u201d that have already been debunked.", "However, there is no evidence that the right-wing rant was written by Allen, and his publicist told us he didn\u2019t author it. \u201cThe statement you are referring to was not written by my client,\u201d Allen\u2019s publicist, Marleah Leslie, told us in an email.", "We also did not find the post on Allen\u2019s official Facebook or Twitter accounts, nor did we find any articles attributing it to him when we searched the Nexis and Google News databases.", "Allen is a known conservative who supported Republican John Kasich for president in 2016 and has described himself as \u201ckind of an anarchist\u201d who is for whatever \u201cpolitical party is for more responsible use of our money.\u201d", "Several Facebook posts crediting the rant to the actor and comedian appeared after a different user named Tim Allen posted the statement on Aug. 25. The shared name may have been what sparked the confusion.", "This is not the first time something like this has happened. In May, we wrote about another viral rant that was misattributed to comedian and television host Steve Harvey after it was shared by another Facebook user who goes by the same name.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
