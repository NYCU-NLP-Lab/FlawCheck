It got four retweets and 13 likes \u2014 not bad considering SoyBoy2020 has only five followers.", "Under normal circumstances, it might have ended there. But by the end of June 1, #dcblackout had become a viral conspiracy theory on Twitter, highlighting how uncertainty surrounding Black Lives Matter protests around the country can lead to the rapid spread of misinformation on social media.", "On May 31, demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after a white officer kneeled on his neck, hit a fever pitch in Washington, D.C. Protesters faced off with police and National Guard troops overnight. Multiple fires burned near the White House, and the Washington Monument was surrounded by smoke.", "In the early hours of June 1, Twitter users like SoyBoy2020 used the chaos to plant the seeds of a false narrative about a government crackdown on protesters.", "The hoax goes like this: To quell unrest at Black Lives Matter demonstrations, officials in Washington started \"jamming all communications.\" That move prevented protesters from using their cell phones to contact each other.", "\"how does dc go from being on fire to being completely silent?? somethings not adding up,\" wrote one of the first Twitter users to share the hashtag, which has been mentioned hundreds of thousands of times.", "RELATED:\u00a0Fact-checking misinformation about the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis", "Washington officials say there\u2019s no evidence to support allegations of a communication blackout in the city.", "\"This appears to be misinformation.

That doesn't happen naturally.\"", "Using a tool called Botometer, which detects whether Twitter accounts have bot-like characteristics, we determined that dozens of the accounts that first shared #dcblackout appear to be automated or partially automated. Others pivoted from tweeting infrequently or about other subjects to posting about Black Lives Matter protests \u2014 one sign that a coordinated disinformation campaign is afoot.", "As people started waking up on the East Coast, the hashtag quickly grew as it was shared among protest sympathizers looking for answers.

This hashtag looks like misinformation. \"No social media from DC\" because we were asleep. Stop scaring people. #dcsafe", "Botometer suggests that Bethany is a real account holder.
