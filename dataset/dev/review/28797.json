["About this rating", "On 7 December 2016, entertainment web site The Onion published a satirical article reporting that the city of Chicago had sent out snowplows to clear more than eighteen inches of bullet casings from the streets:", "Promising that every effort would be made to limit the impact on residents\u2019 day-to-day lives, Chicago officials announced Wednesday that a fleet of plows was working around the clock to clear more than 18 inches of fresh bullet casings that had blanketed the metropolitan area overnight.", "Sources at the city\u2019s Department of Streets and Sanitation confirmed that over 250 ammunition-removal vehicles had been deployed to deal with the knee-deep layer of spent cartridges, which have been steadily accumulating on Chicago\u2019s streets, alleys, and pedestrian walkways since the previous evening.", "This article is a work of satire and does not describe a real event. The Onion is a well-known purveyor of satirical stories, but some people, unfamiliar with the site, mistook it for a genuine news item. However, it contains little truth. While there is an issue of violent crime in Chicago, the city does not employ \"ammunition removal vehicles\" to clear the streets of bullet casings.", "This is not the first story from The Onion to fool its readers. The web site has previously published articles about Cuban refugees clinging to the bottom of Air Force One, SeaWorld transferring orcas in giant plastic bags, and Pokemon Go! characters screaming when they come within a mile of a sex predator.", "Unlike fake news or propaganda outlets that often aim to mislead or scare their readers, The Onion is a genuine satire publication.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
