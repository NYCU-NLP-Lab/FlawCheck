The piece (originally titled \"Paul Ryan Says Free School Lunches Give Kids \u2018An Empty Soul'\") reported:", "The Wisconsin Republican who recently took aim at the War on Poverty said during his CPAC speech that the Obama administration's free school lunch program is offering Americans \"a full stomach \u2014 and an empty soul\"", "Paul Ryan says that free lunches provided to children by government programs give kids \u201ca full stomach \u2014 and an empty soul.\u201d", "In a speech he made at Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the country\u2019s largest gathering of conservative leaders and activists, Thursday, he shared this story he heard from Eloise Anderson, who serves in the cabinet for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker:", "\u201cShe once met a young boy from a poor family.

I don\u2019t think the problem is too many people are working. I think the problem is not enough people can find work. And if people leave the workforce, our economy will shrink. There will be less opportunity, not more. The Left is making a big mistake here. What they\u2019re offering people is a full stomach and an empty soul.
