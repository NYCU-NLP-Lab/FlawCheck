["Vice President Kamala Harris, right, and Denis McDonough bump elbows after McDunough was ceremonially sworn in by Harris as secretary of Veterans Affairs, Feb. 9, in Washington. Social media posts falsely claim she said she will close the department. (AP)", "The U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs offers services and benefits for American military veterans and their families, but a statement falsely attributed to Vice President Kamala Harris on social media suggests she doesn\u2019t support the agency\u2019s work.", "\"The United States government cannot continue to pay for the every need of what has become a special class of citizen,\" the statement says. \"Veterans are equal to us, not better than. Veterans Affairs coddles them. It creates a dependency upon us which is not doing these former soldiers any good. They need to learn to live on their own two feet and be responsible adults. The easiest way to assist them on this journey is to cut them off. Within these next four years, we will be shuttering the VA, taking away soldier welfare. The money saved will go to better use in assisting refugee families. These poor folks seek asylum with us and need a boost and it is our responsibility as a nation to provide it.\"", "The statement concludes with this jab: \"So here\u2019s a message to the soldier boys. Get a job.\"", "If it seems unbelievable that the vice president would say something like this about members of the military, that\u2019s because she didn\u2019t.", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
