He faces Democrat David Holmes, a mediator, on the November 2016 ballot.", "Confirmed: Daugherty's smaller raises", "Earlier this year, we found Mostly False a candidate\u2019s claim that Daugherty had voted to raise his 2016 salary 19.6 percent.", "Daugherty had voted to adopt the county budget including pay raises for the four commissioners. Separately, though, he set his own increased salary at $93,000, which was $8,400 less than what the budget authorized for commissioners. For 2016 then, Daugherty\u2019s pay went up 3.2 percent from his 2015 salary of $90,109.", "For that fact check, we also confirmed that while the county\u2019s 2015 budget provided for each of the commissioners to be paid $98,463, Daugherty was actually paid $90,109 that year, or 8.5 percent less than his colleagues, according to the county\u2019s 2015 actual expenditures data.", "We also found that earlier, after Daugherty rejoined the body in 2013, he accepted a salary of $90,109 for fiscal 2013, according to his signed affidavit. At the time, that was about 5.7 percent less than the budgeted salary for each commissioner.", "Pay cuts every year?", "For this fact check, we wondered about the claim on Daugherty\u2019s campaign site that he\u2019s taken an 8 percent pay cut every year on the court.", "Asked to explain his claim, Daugherty said by phone that each time that he voted for annual county budgets including pay raises for commissioners, he followed up by directing the county to give him less of a raise. \"We make $103,000 this year, and I\u2019ve elected to take $93,000, which is probably more than 8 percent\" less, Daugherty said. \"What I do is, each year I take somewhere -- at least 8 percent\" less.", "Daugherty added: \"I have never voted to give myself a raise.\"", "Hold that thought: Daugherty may not have voted for pay raises but he\u2019s accepted them--albeit in smaller increments than his colleagues. Also, records we obtained from the county\u2019s archival budget documents covering county fiscal years that begin in October of each preceding year mostly indicate he\u2019s not demanded actual pay cuts.", "The specifics: In 2003, when Daugherty won a special election to succeed Margaret Moore on the court, the salary for the Precinct 3 commissioner had already been set at $67,570, or 9.39 percent less than the court\u2019s adopted salary for that fiscal year of $73,915.", "In 2004, Daugherty\u2019s salary shrunk to $66,523, for a 1.55 percent decrease.

That holds up for each year of his interrupted tenure, we confirmed, with the exception of the year he returned to the court, fiscal 2013. That year, Daugherty\u2019s salary was 5.74 percent less than the court\u2019s adopted salary for commissioners.", "By phone, Daugherty disputed the notion that he\u2019d said on his campaign site that every year he took an 8 percent pay cut.", "\"I guess you can read it however you want; I think it\u2019s pretty straightforward,\" Daugherty said. \"Each year whatever the salary is, I take, on\u00a0average, 8 percent less than that \u2026 some of this stuff you have to put in a bumper sticker kind of a size. You can get so verbose with it and get people so confused about \u2018what the hell is he saying?\u2019", "\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s difficult to understand,\" Daugherty said. \"If people say, \u2018tell me what you mean by that,\u2019 well, the salary for 2016 and 2017 is $103,000. I\u2019ve signed an affidavit that I only want to be paid $93,000.
