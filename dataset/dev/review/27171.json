["About this rating", "After the police shooting of 20-year-old Latrell Allen in Chicago's Englewood community on the afternoon of Aug. 9, 2020, unrest in that city extended through that night and into the early morning hours of the following day, with looters hitting some stores in Chicago\u2019s wealthiest shopping district on North Michigan Avenue.", "The following evening, members of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement held a solidarity rally in that city with some of the people who had been arrested for looting the night before. Shortly after those events, social media users began circulating a meme stemming from that event, quoting a \"BLM leader & organizer\" named Ariel Atkins as saying, \"I don't care if someone decides to loot, because that makes sure that person eats or has clothes. Anything they want to take, they can, because these businesses have insurance\":", "That was an accurate quote, according to Chicago NBC affiliate WMAQ-TV, who reported on the Aug. 10 event:", "Members of Black Lives Matter held a solidarity rally on Monday night [August 10] with the more than 100 individuals who were arrested after a night of looting and unrest in Chicago.", "The rally was held at the South Loop police station where organizers say those individuals are currently being held in custody.", "\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone decides to loot a Gucci or a Macy\u2019s or a Nike store, because that makes sure that person eats,\u201d Ariel Atkins, a BLM organizer, said. \u201cThat makes sure that person has clothes.\u201d", "Black Lives Matter Chicago organized the rally after overnight unrest throughout the city, with police saying that more than 100 individuals were taken into custody for a variety of offenses, including looting.", "\u201cThat is reparations,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cAnything they wanted to take, they can take it because these businesses have insurance.\u201d", "Atkins said essentially the same thing a few days later, when she was interviewed by Chicago NPR station WBEZ on the subject of \"why she supports looting\":", "A lot of people are really attacking our pages. They\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, you support the looters.\u2019 And yeah, we do, 100%. That\u2019s reparations. And like however people choose to protest, especially if it was definitely in line with what happened with the shooting, which would be powerful to see people reacting ... without organizers just being like, \u2018We\u2019re angry and this is what we\u2019re gonna do. We\u2019re gonna take the power back.\u2019", "I feel like these stores, these Macy\u2019s, these Guccis, the PNC Banks, they\u2019re not here for us. The city puts way more money and investment into spending time and protecting their spaces and making sure that they exist. And yet our people are constantly being pushed out of the city ... Unemployment is incredibly high, like we are in an incredible situation, and the fact that anybody gives a s*** about these businesses over what is happening in this city right now and the pain that people are in and the suffering that is taking place, I don\u2019t care. I will support the looters \u2018till the end of the day. If that\u2019s what they need to do in order to eat, then that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do to eat .... The whole idea of criminality is based on racism anyway, because criminality is punishing people for things that they have needed to do to survive or just the way that society has affected them with white supremacist B.S. So it\u2019s like her deciding what is criminal and what isn\u2019t.", "WMAQ-TV [Chicago]. \u00a0 \"Black Lives Matter Holds Rally Supporting Individuals Arrested in Chicago Looting Monday.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 10 August 2020.", "Black, Curtis. &nbps; \"Latrell Allen Police Shooting Exposes Gaps in Body Camera and Foot Pursuit Policies.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Chicago Reporter. \u00a0 14 August 2020.", "Yoon-Ji Kang, Esther. \u00a0 \"Officers Disrespected Englewood Residents Following Police Shooting, Activists Say.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 WBEZ [Chicago]. \u00a0 10 August 2020.", "Wildeboer, Rob and Chip Mitchell. \u00a0 \"Officers Disrespected Englewood Residents Following Police Shooting, Activists Say.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 WBEZ [Chicago]. \u00a0 12 August 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
