["About this rating", "On Sept. 3, 2020, The Atlantic published an article entitled \"Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are \u2018Losers\u2019 and \u2018Suckers,\u2019\" which detailed numerous derogatory remarks U.S. President Donald Trump allegedly made at the expense of members of the armed services.", "For example, reporter Jeffrey Goldberg wrote that Trump was furious when flags were lowered at half-staff to honor McCain after his death in August 2018, saying: \"What the fuck are we doing that for? Guy was a fucking loser.\"", "As the article spread on social media, President Trump took to Twitter to issue a denial, and said that he never called McCain a loser:", "While Trump writes that he \"never called John [McCain] a loser,\" this simply isn't true. In fact, Trump himself once tweeted an article quoting Trump saying that McCain was a loser.", "The article Trump shared in July 2015 was referring to an appearance then-candidate Trump made at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa. Conservative pollster Frank Luntz asked Trump if it was appropriate for a man running for the country's highest office to refer to McCain \u2014 a war hero and navy pilot who became a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down over Vietnam \u2014 as a \"dummy.\"", "Trump said: \"He lost [the 2008 election], so I never liked him as much after that because I don't like losers.\"", "When Luntz repeated that McCain was a war hero, Trump said: \"He's not a war hero. He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured.\"", "Here's a video from C-Span of Trump's response:", "As for the comments reported in The Atlantic article, Goldberg cites \"three sources with direct knowledge of this event.\" News outlets such as The Associated Press have been able to confirm some of The Atlantic's reporting with other military officials, and Miles Taylor, a Republican Trump appointee who served as the chief of staff to the United States secretary of homeland security until he resigned after allegedly witnessing Trump offering pardons to those who implemented illegal immigration policies, said that he could confirm that Trump was angry about lowering the flags for McCain after his death:", "McFadden, Robert. \u00a0 \"John McCain, War Hero, Senator, Presidential Contender, Dies at 81.'\" \u00a0\r\n\u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 25 August 2018.", "Goldberg, Jeffrey. \u00a0 \"Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are \u2018Losers\u2019 and \u2018Suckers.\u2019'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Atlantic. \u00a0 3 September 2020.", "Solender, Andrew. \u00a0 \"\u2018If You Get In Trouble I\u2019ll Pardon You\u2019: Ex-DHS Official Miles Taylor Says Trump Promised Protection For Illegal Policies.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Forbes. \u00a0 25 August 2020.", "Laporta, James. \u00a0 \"Report: Trump Disparaged US War Dead as \u2018Losers,\u2019 \u2018Suckers.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Associated Press. \u00a0 4 September 2020.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
