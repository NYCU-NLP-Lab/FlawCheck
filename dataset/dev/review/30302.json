But people were curious if this piece of trivia holds up.", "In short, it doesn\u2019t. The world in which Jesus lived was all a part of the Roman Empire, not necessarily a collection of separate sovereign nations. That makes it hard to call baby Jesus an illegal anything.", "What did Jesus do?", "Eller told PunditFact his comment was more about putting the plight of Jesus in the perspective of the modern world, not the bureaucratic details of his time.", "\"Jesus was clearly an immigrant, and fled violence in his day,\" Eller said. \"Many undocumented American immigrants have fled the most violent and desperate situations on the planet in search of survival and a better life.\"", "In the context of modern boundaries, border crossings between Israel and Egypt these days are contentious, but mostly because Israel aims to stop migrants and terrorists from coming into the country.

Verses 17-23 say Joseph moved the family back to Nazareth after Herod died.", "That\u2019s what the Bible says, but the historical context matters.", "To be clear, the Herodian Kingdom did largely correspond to what we now know as modern-day Israel. It was a client state subservient to the Roman Empire, ruled by Herod the Great, who had been appointed king by the Roman Senate.", "Egypt, or Aegyptus, was a Roman province and run by a prefect appointed by the emperor. There were many administrative vagaries among the vast territory Rome controlled at the time, but experts told us one thing was clear: Anyone who lived in the empire could pretty much go wherever they wanted. Well, as long as they paid their taxes.", "Clifford Ando, professor of classics, history and law at the University of Chicago, said historical accounts of the period offer an incomplete picture. But for the most part, we can say the empire did not restrict movement in a way comparable to requiring paperwork to cross provinces. There were customs stations in ports and on roads to tax goods, but nothing like a border patrol.", "\"Rome did think of itself as keeping loose track of the borders of the empire, and of course it took a periodic census, and so did loosely record where people resided and owned property once a cycle,\" Ando said. \"That's not the same thing as saying you couldn't move.\"", "By the second century C.E., subjects moving to a new province were required to register with the government, he said, but only if they planned to settle there.

In a historical context, however, Herod\u2019s kingdom and the province of Egypt were ultimately governed by the Roman Empire, and weren\u2019t separate nations as we know them now.
