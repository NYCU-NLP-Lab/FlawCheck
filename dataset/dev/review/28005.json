["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Cook County Board President and mayoral candidate Toni Preckwinkle has a\u00a0campaign ad claiming she had a big role in exposing details behind the deadly police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.", "\"Sixteen shots. Nine in the back. Facts that the police and city officials tried to bury. Facts that Toni Preckwinkle brought to light,\" a narrator says in the 30-second spot. \"It was Toni who made sure Laquan McDonald\u2019s autopsy went public. Toni, who called for the dash cam footage to be released.\"", "McDonald was shot and killed on Oct. 20, 2014, by then Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke, later convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated assault. But for more than a year after McDonald\u2019s death the city withheld video footage of the shooting and Van Dyke remained on the force.", "Preckwinkle\u2019s ad was quickly met with a flurry of criticism from both her opponents in the mayoral race as well as community activists. They accused her of politicizing McDonald\u2019s death and exaggerating her role in bringing the facts of the shooting to light for personal gain.", "We wondered how much credit Preckwinkle could reasonably take for helping to make public two key pieces of evidence which contradicted the city\u2019s official narrative that Van Dyke shot McDonald in self-defense.", "The first claim in Preckwinkle\u2019s ad checks out.", "Preckwinkle used her authority over the Cook County medical examiner\u2019s office to unearth the details of McDonald\u2019s death that were being kept under wraps. She first described the autopsy results to Jamie Kalven, an award-winning writer whose Invisible Institute has played a central role in investigating police abuse cases in Chicago. Kalven broke the story behind the McDonald shooting in February 2015, revealing that Van Dyke pumped 16 shots into McDonald and nine of those struck the teen in the back.", "Kalven has recounted multiple times the story of Preckwinkle\u2019s assistance in helping him pry loose details of the McDonald autopsy.", "\"She agreed to see what she could find out and I was out for a run headed to Washington Park in the snow on a winter night in Chicago and Toni pulled up alongside me on 51st Street and gestured to me to get into her vehicle, which I did. She didn\u2019t say hello, she clearly was shaken. And she said, \u201816 shots \u2014 front and back,\u2019\" Kalven later recalled for WBEZ.", "However, we could find no evidence to support the second beat of Preckwinkle\u2019s TV ad claim \u2014 that she had pressured the city to make public the police dash cam video of the incident.", "The Emanuel administration resisted release of the video for more than a year after the shooting even in the face of a lawsuit filed by independent journalist Brandon Smith. But on Nov. 19, 2015, Cook County Judge Franklin Valderrama ruled in Smith\u2019s favor and ordered the video\u2019s release, which came five days later.", "We asked Preckwinkle\u2019s campaign for evidence that she had spoken up about the video prior to Valderrama\u2019s order. Spokeswoman Monica Trevino sent us several articles quoting Preckwinkle criticizing city officials for having delayed releasing the footage. But the articles all made clear that Preckwinkle weighed in only after the judge did and the video release was a fait accompli.", "We also checked with Matt Topic, the government transparency and media lawyer who represented Smith in his suit. Topic also provides outside counsel to the Better Government Association, but the BGA, which operates PolitiFact Illinois, had no involvement in the legal case brought by Smith.", "Topic told us in an email he was not aware of Preckwinkle calling for the video\u2019s release ahead of the judge\u2019s order and said she filed nothing with the court to support Smith\u2019s position in the case.", "Topic was among those who called Preckwinkle out last week for inflating her role in bringing the true story of McDonald\u2019s death to light.", "\"Rather than use this any further for political purposes, I'd like to hear the candidates acknowledge that there is a serious ongoing secrecy problem requiring immediate attention on day one and their specific proposals and commitments on how they are going to address it,\" Topic wrote in a Twitter thread.", "Preckwinkle claims she was instrumental in releasing the details of McDonald\u2019s autopsy. That much is true.", "But Preckwinkle\u2019s ad also asserts she called for the city to release the dash cam footage of the shooting. We could find no evidence of her doing so before a judge had already ordered the release.", "Preckwinkle\u2019s ad is partially accurate and leaves out important details, so we we rate it Half True.", "HALF TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.", "Click here\u00a0for more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "\"New Preckwinkle $750K ad buy touts her role in exposing Laquan McDonald shooting,\" Chicago Sun-Times, Jan. 9, 2019", "\"Preckwinkle accused of inflating role in Laquan McDonald case,\" Chicago Sun-Times, Jan. 10, 2019", "\"Activists Call Preckwinkle Laquan Ad \u2018Slap To The Face,\u2019\" WBEZ, Jan. 10, 2019", "\"16 Shots,\" Invisible Institute, Feb. 10, 2015", "\"16 Shots: Pattern and Practice,\" WBEZ, Aug. 30, 2018", "Chicago Newsroom, Oct. 25, 2018", "\"How Toni Preckwinkle rose from Hyde Park also-ran to Cook County boss,\" Chicago Tribune, Dec. 20, 2018", "\"Laquan McDonald timeline: The shooting, the video and the verdict,\" Chicago Tribune, Oct. 5, 2018", "Email and phone interview: Monica Trevino, Preckwinkle spokeswoman, Jan. 10, 2019", "\"Anita Alvarez Is 'Very Confident' About Murder Charges For Chicago Cop,\" Chicagoist, Nov. 24, 2015", "\"Preckwinkle calls for changes to CPD,\" ABC 7, Dec. 4, 2015", "Email interview: Matt Topic, Jan. 12, 2019", "Twitter thread, Matt Topic, Jan. 11, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
