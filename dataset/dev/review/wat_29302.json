["By Robert Farley", "Posted on December 4, 2018", "Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that $21 trillion worth of \u201cPentagon accounting errors\u201d could finance two-thirds of Medicare for All. It can\u2019t.", "The misguided tweet is based on a tally by university researchers who found $21 trillion worth of untraceable transactions in the Department of Defense between 1998 and 2015. It\u2019s a legitimate problem the Pentagon says it\u2019s trying to fix. But transactions \u2014 which can be counted multiple times as they pass through accounts \u2014 are not the same as spending.", "The U.S. actually spent a total of a little over $9 trillion on defense in those years. Even if the U.S. had eliminated the entire defense budget for those years, that wouldn\u2019t cover two-thirds of\u00a0 Medicare for All.", "Ocasio-Cortez, an incoming Democratic representative,\u00a0supports The Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act, a House bill that would expand Medicare into a universal health care program. An Urban Institute analysis of a similar Medicare for All plan proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016 put the cost to the federal government at about $32 trillion over 10 years. (While the federal government would pick up the tab, Ocasio-Cortez argues that Medicare for All would reduce health care spending overall.)", "Those are the figures that underpin a Dec. 2 tweet from Ocasio-Cortez, who claimed two-thirds of the federal cost of Medicare for All could be funded by \u201c$21T in Pentagon accounting errors.\u201d", "$21 TRILLION of Pentagon financial transactions \u201ccould not be traced, documented, or explained.\u201d", "$21T in Pentagon accounting errors. Medicare for All costs ~$32T.", "That means 66% of Medicare for All could have been funded already by the Pentagon.", "And that\u2019s before our premiums. https://t.co/soT6GSmDSG", "\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) December 2, 2018", "The misleading tweet cites a story in The Nation that includes the line, \u201cIn all, at least a mind-boggling $21 trillion of Pentagon financial transactions between 1998 and 2015 could not be traced, documented, or explained, concluded Skidmore.\u201d", "That\u2019s a reference to research by Mark Skidmore, an economics professor at Michigan State University, and Catherine Austin Fitts, a former assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the first Bush administration. The two looked into trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of \u201cunsupported journal voucher adjustments\u201d identified by the Office of the Comptroller at the Department of Defense.", "In a podcast on Dec. 2, Skidmore described \u201cunsupported adjustments\u201d as \u201cessentially transactions that our own government says we can\u2019t verify.\u201d Skidmore and a small team of researchers tracked $21 trillion of such vouchers between 1998 and 2015 \u2014 an \u201calmost unfathomable amount of money,\u201d Skidmore said.", "In his report, Skidmore writes, \u201cThe ongoing and repeated nature of the unsupported journal voucher adjustments coupled with the seemingly enormous size of the adjustments warrants the attention of both citizens and elected officials.\u201d", "In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee in January, David Norquist, the Pentagon\u2019s comptroller, acknowledged that the amount of unsupported journal vouchers at the Pentagon is a \u201cproblem that needs to be fixed,\u201d but he said characterizing it as lost money is inaccurate.", "Indeed, the discrepancies were behind a Department of Defense announcement last month that it failed its first-ever comprehensive audit, a massive effort undertaken by some 1,200 auditors.", "\u201cThough we were unable to achieve a clean (unmodified) opinion, the audit provides us with a powerful additional method to identify accounting and financial reporting issues as well as their root causes, target and develop corrective actions, prioritize business process reforms, and verify the proper remediation of audit findings,\u201d Norquist wrote about the audit.", "However, defense budget experts told us Ocasio-Cortez is misinterpreting what the $21 trillion figure identified by Skidmore represents. It is not an amount of missing or wasted money that could simply be reallocated to other government functions, such as health care.", "\u201cThe whole thing is misleading,\u201d said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.", "The entire Department of Defense budget during the period of 1998 to 2015 was about $9.2 trillion dollars. That\u2019s how much was actually spent, Harrison told us in a phone interview.", "\u201cThey are talking about transactions,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cIf money goes in one account, and it is transferred to a different agency. That money gets counted every time there\u2019s a transaction, even if they are internal.\u201d As a result, he said, Skidmore is double- and triple-counting the same funds.", "In other words, said Travis Sharp, a research fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, \u201cthe $21 trillion figure counts the dollar value of accounting adjustments, not the dollars themselves, meaning a single dollar could be counted multiple times as it moves around.\u201d", "Sharp used the analogy of a married couple that has two separate checking accounts. \u201cEach month, they move $100 dollars from one account to the other temporarily to meet the minimum balance requirement, but afterward they move the $100 back to the first account,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cAfter 12 months, how much money was involved in their adjustments? The most reasonable answer is $100. Using the technique employed to reach the $21 trillion figure, however, the answer would be $2,400 (i.e. $100 moves twice each month = $200 x 12 months = $2,400). This analogy illustrates the problem with thinking of the $21 trillion as wasted money, though clearly DoD must strengthen its accounting practices.\u201d", "Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, wrote to us via email that defense spending cuts would come nowhere near covering the cost of Medicare for All.", "\u201cActually, over the next decade, defense discretionary spending is projected to total $7 trillion,\u201d Goldwein said. \u201cSo even ELIMINATING defense spending \u2013 obviously a ridiculous notion even for the most anti-military politician \u2013 would only pay for about one fifth to one quarter of Medicare for all.\u201d", "Sharp noted that the Pentagon\u2019s recent audit indicates the Department of Defense has $2.8 trillion worth of assets (see page 23). \u201cSo, you would have to sell everything DoD owns 8 times over to raise $21 trillion,\u201d Sharp told us.", "In fact, the Department of Defense has not received $21 trillion in (nominal) funding across the entirety of American history, said Christopher Sherwood, a Department of Defense spokesman. He pointed to historical budget data kept by the White House Office of Management and Budget (see Table 3.1), that shows defense spending from 1940 through 2017 came to a total of just over $17 trillion.", "\u201cMoney Congress appropriates for DoD stays at the Department of the Treasury until they make a payment on behalf of DoD,\u201d Sherwood told us via email. \u201cAny funds that remain unspent at the end of the period of availability will remain at the Department of the Treasury and are no longer available to DoD at that point.\u201d", "It\u2019s also wrong to assume the transactions represent improperly spent money.", "\u201cJust because the money can\u2019t be traced, documented, or explained doesn\u2019t mean that it is 100% wasteful and easy to cut,\u201d Goldwein said. \u201c\u2026 There is no way we can cut enough waste in defense to pay for a large share of Medicare for All.\u201d", "Harrison likened the unsupported transactions to an employee submitting an expense report at work, and not having all of the receipts. It doesn\u2019t mean that the employee is attempting to defraud the company.", "\u201cThe vast majority [in the defense budget] is legitimately spent,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cPeople may disagree with whether it was needed, but it was spent for the purpose that Congress appropriated it for.\u201d", "Sherwood, the Pentagon spokesman, said, \u201cWhile DoD systems were designed to execute and report budgetary information, many were not originally designed to support private sector financial statement preparation, so this causes a significant number of adjustments.\u201d And those adjustments can quickly accumulate to massive numbers over time. \u201cIf the person did not have time to do adequate research or if it was the valuation of older equipment where the records did not exist, then it would be an \u2018unsupported adjustment,'\u201d Sherwood said.", "Sherwood said the Pentagon is \u201cactively working to fix this problem by improving system interfaces.\u201d But he said not to expect that it will result in any windfall of cash. \u201cThe savings it will create is by reducing the labor needed to manually enter the Journal Vouchers and reducing the time it takes to perform research, but that is it,\u201d he said.", "In a follow-up tweet, Ocasio-Cortez said that her point was \u201cto say that we only demand fiscal details w/ health+edu, rarely elsewhere.\u201d", "But that\u2019s not what her original tweet stated. Rather, it argued that \u201cPentagon accounting errors\u201d could finance two-thirds of Medicare for All. And that\u2019s simply not the case.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
