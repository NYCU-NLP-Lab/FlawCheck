["About this rating", "In mid-September 2015, a number of disreputable, click-baiting web sites published items with misleading headlines such as \"BREAKING: Sadie Robertson in Horrible Accident \u2014 Please Pray\"; and \"Sadie Robertson Shared Horrible News \u2014 She Needs Our Prayers!\" Those alarming headlines understandably led many fans to believe Duck Dynasty star Sadie Robertson had been seriously injured in a terrible automobile wreck, and an unofficial Facebook fan page for Sadie Robertson was soon flooded with anxious posts from followers who feared the young woman had been gravely injured and was clinging to life.", "None of these items about Robertson's car accident linked to any news accounts or information from the Robertson clan to substantiate the traffic-driving alarm that subsequently spread on social media sites. However, all of them tacked on a link to a 15 September 2015 Instagram post published by Robertson herself which revealed that her \"horrible car accident\" had resulted in no injuries to her more serious than a swollen knee and a sore neck:", "current mood. but thankful I'm okay - got into a car accident this morning. I walked away with just a swollen knee and a sore neck. the other person is fine as well. the Lord protected me & I will praise His name for that 9.15.15", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
