["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on March 13, 2019", "Q:\u00a0Did House passage of H.R. 1 allow noncitizens to vote?", "A: No. That bill would enact a host of changes to election laws, but it does not permit noncitizens to vote.", "Is it true that the Democrats in the House of Representatives voted for the right of illegal immigrants to vote in the US?", "When Democrats reclaimed control of the House in January, they\u00a0introduced\u00a0H.R. 1 \u2014\u00a0a bill number designated to signal the importance of this legislation, which is designed to combat political corruption and increase voter participation. The bill, known as For the People Act, keeps a campaign pledge\u00a0from\u00a0the midterm election.", "The bill passed the House along party lines on March 8, but it\u2019s unlikely to move forward. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already said the Republican-controlled chamber would not take it up.", "Even so, the measure has generated confusion among readers and social media users, where distortions and falsehoods about the bill have spread.", "\u201cHR1 passed. Allowing illegal immigrants (foreigners) to vote,\u201d a popular Facebook post\u00a0claims.", "The\u00a0comprehensive\u00a0bill, which would\u00a0make\u00a0numerous changes to election laws, doesn\u2019t do that.", "Among the many things the bill would do, if it were ever to become law: make\u00a0Election Day a federal holiday; require states to automatically register eligible voters; compel states to create independent commissions to oversee redistricting; implement campaign-finance and election-security changes; and require presidential and vice presidential candidates to release 10 years of tax returns. Trump in 2016 broke with the tradition of past presidential candidates by not releasing his tax returns.", "The confusion regarding noncitizens stems from the use of a legislative maneuver,\u00a0known as a motion to recommit, that represented the last opportunity for the Republicans to amend the bill before it was passed.", "On March 8, the same day the House cast its final vote on the bill, Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw introduced a Motion to Recommit H.R. 1\u00a0to the Judiciary Committee with instructions to add language condemning voting by \u201cillegal immigrants.\u201d", "But \u201csense of Congress\u201d provisions, such as the one offered by Crenshaw, have \u201cno force of law,\u201d as explained in a Congressional Research Service report.", "\u201cA \u2018sense of\u2019 resolution is not legally binding because it is not presented to the President for his signature,\u201d the CRS report said. \u201cEven if a \u2018sense of\u2019 provision is incorporated into a bill that becomes law, such provisions merely express the opinion of Congress or the relevant chamber. They have no formal effect on public policy and have no force of law.\u201d", "Federal law explicitly\u00a0prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections, and no state has allowed it since the 1920s.", "The vast majority of House Democrats\u00a0voted\u00a0against Crenshaw\u2019s motion, as did one Republican,\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Justin Amash\u00a0of Michigan.", "Crenshaw, while speaking on the floor of the House, invoked San Francisco as an example of noncitizens voting: \u201cThe city of San Francisco has effectively cancelled out the votes of its citizens and replaced it with illegals\u2019.\u201d", "But he failed to specify that noncitizens in San Francisco only have the right to vote in school board elections. (The motion he proposed, however, makes that clear.) As we\u2019ve written before, the city allows noncitizens, including those in the country illegally, to vote in school board elections if they are the parent or guardian of a student.", "A total of 12 jurisdictions throughout the country allow noncitizen residents to vote in some local elections regardless of legal status, according to Ron Hayduk, a professor of political science at San Francisco State University who studies immigrant voting and has advocated allowing noncitizens to vote. Those jurisdictions include San Francisco (for school board elections), Chicago (for local school council elections) and 10 towns in Maryland\u00a0where noncitizens can vote in local races.", "And, as we\u2019ve written previously,\u00a0experts say\u00a0voter fraud by noncitizens is rare, in part because of the consequences, which could include deportation.", "Even though Crenshaw\u2019s motion would have had no policy effect if approved,\u00a0Democrats\u2019 rejection of it became the subject of headlines such as this one in the Washington Times: \u201cHouse votes in favor of illegal immigrant voting.\u201d", "A website known for distributing false news, News Punch \u2014 formerly known as Your News Wire \u2014 carried a similar headline and opened with the misleading claim that \u201cHouse Democrats voted Friday to allow illegal immigrants to vote in American elections \u2014 turning their back on the U.S. Constitution.\u201d", "Likewise,\u00a0Republican Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana told reporters on March 12 that \u201clast week, we had legislation on the floor to prevent people that are here illegally from voting. And you saw Democrats vote against that. In essence, voting to allow people here illegally to vote in elections and to use taxpayer funds to help people\u00a0here illegally to vote.\u201d", "Again, that\u2019s misleading: The motion would have had no effect on the law, and there was no vote to give immigrants in the country illegally the right to vote. Voting by noncitizens is prohibited in federal and state elections, as well as almost all local elections \u2014 save for a few exceptions on the local level.
