In several cities, ACORN employees offered them advice about how to skirt housing and tax laws.", "ACORN notes that we haven't seen all of the uncut versions of all of the videos, but suffice to say it doesn't look very good.", "ACORN admitted as much when chief executive Bertha Lewis referred to the conduct as \"the indefensible action of a handful of our employees.\" ACORN has canned or suspended some of the employees, and ordered mandatory training for employees and an independent review. Meanwhile, a number of Republican lawmakers \u2014 who have long been critical of the voter registration practices of this left-leaning group \u2014 have called for a federal investigation and to cut off all federal funding to the group.", "While ACORN has taken a public beating, some conservatives renewed accusations of close past ties between President Barack Obama and ACORN.", "\"Is it time for him (Obama) to weigh in on this group (ACORN), with which he does have some considerable ties, or at least he did?\" Fox News' Megyn Kelly asked Republican strategist Karl Rove on Sept. 16, 2009.\n\n\"Yeah, he used to be a lawyer for them,\" Rove replied.", "\"Look, it is a problem for him,\" Rove said. \"This is a key element of his campaign. They played a huge role in voter registration efforts last year.\"", "Obama has not commented on the ACORN situation this week. But the same day Kelly raised the question on Fox, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs condemned the comments made by ACORN employees on some of the videos.", "\"Obviously the conduct that you see on those tapes is completely unacceptable,\" Gibbs said in a daily press briefing on Sept. 16. \"I think everyone would agree with that.\"", "But what about Obama's ties to ACORN? Was Rove correct that Obama used to be a lawyer for ACORN?", "We first looked at this during the presidential race when the Sen. John McCain campaign made a similar claim about Obama.", "And here's the skinny:", "Obama graduated from law school in 1991, worked on the book that would become his memoir  Dreams From My Father  , and directed a voter registration drive in 1992. After that, Obama went to work for a civil rights law firm then named Davis, Miner, Barnhill and Galland. (It is now known only as Miner, Barnhill and Galland.) The firm's specialty is civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development work.", "Obama and two other attorneys represented ACORN in a 1995 federal civil lawsuit against the state of Illinois\u00a0\u2014 Gov. James Edgar and other state officials were the named defendants\u00a0\u2014 to demand that it enforce a new federal law known as \"motor voter,\" which allowed people to register to vote when they got their drivers' licenses. There were five other named plaintiffs in the case, but ACORN was the lead plaintiff. Among the groups that sided with ACORN in the matter: the U.S. Department of Justice and the League of Women Voters. The courts concluded that Illinois had to enforce the law, and the case generated several federal court orders through 1995 and 1996.", "During the final presidential debate on Oct. 15, 2008, Republican opponent McCain said the country deserved to know \"the full extent of Sen.

Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.\n\n\"It had nothing to do with us. We were not involved. The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.\"", "But as evidence of deeper ties, some have pointed to that voter registration drive we mentioned earlier, one that Obama directed in 1992 for Project Vote, a nonprofit focused on voter rights and education.", "Back in 1992, Project Vote and ACORN were separate organizations with common goals: getting people to vote, especially low-income, minority and young voters.

But Obama was never a staff attorney for ACORN. He did not do ongoing work for the organization. He handled o  ne  case along with two other attorneys. ACORN was one of several plaintiffs.
