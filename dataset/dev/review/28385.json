["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Democrat Lois Frankel bashed her Republican congressional opponent Adam Hasner and portrayed him as a hypocrite in a recent attack ad.\n\nIn the ad, Hasner says, \"I'll never accept a pay increase.\" A narrator then notes, \"But Hasner voted to raise his pay four times.\" In this fact-check, we will evaluate the ad's claim.\n\nWe previously fact-checked a claim in an ad by the YG Action Fund, a conservative PAC, that Frankel \"took a 40 percent pay raise\" as mayor while West Palm Beach \"lost jobs.\" We ruled that claim Half True -- she did get a 40 percent raise, but the ad misrepresented the employment picture.\n\nHasner said he\u2019ll reject a pay increase\n\nIn Frankel\u2019s ad, Hasner said, \"I\u2019ll never accept a pay increase.\" It\u2019s not evident in the ad when he said that.\n\nThe answer is that Hasner has repeatedly said it while running for Congress -- a federal job that currently pays $174,000 a year job.\n\nBut Hasner\u2019s pay raise votes relate to his former job in the state House, where he served from 2003 to 2010. In the state House, Hasner earned between $29,328 and $31,932 a year.\n\nWhen state workers get raises, legislators get automatic salary adjustments in July of the following year unless they pass a bill to prevent the raise. Both situations occurred during Hasner\u2019s tenure: He got raises some years, and other years members prevented the raises or even took a cut as a symbolic gesture to voters amid an economic downturn.\n\nFrankel points to votes for pay raises Hasner took in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2010.\n\nAll four votes were appropriations bills that legislators must pass to pay for state workers\u2019 salaries and expenses to keep government functioning -- they were not stand-alone votes on pay raises. We confirmed these votes, and found that the appropriations bills passed the House with wide margins.\n\nWe agree with the first three votes cited by Frankel -- Hasner voted in favor of appropriations bills in 2003, 2005 and 2006 that led to salary raises between 2 and 3.6 percent for legislators.\n\nBut the fourth vote -- the one in 2010 -- comes with a major caveat: lawmakers accidentally gave themselves a pay raise when they meant to take a pay cut, blaming it on a \"drafting error,\" according to the Florida Times-Union. The article stated that Hasner, the majority leader, promised to fix the bill in negotiations with the Senate. Ultimately their salaries remained the same as the previous year: $29,697\n\nLegislators voted for pay cuts in 2008 and 2009 that took effect that same year. Hasner also had a few years where his salary remained flat.\n\nHasner claimed credit for the pay cut in 2008. The Sun-Sentinel wrote that the pay cut was proposed by state Rep. Ron Saunders, D-Key West, in a meeting and then by state Rep. Juan Zapata, R-Miami, on the House floor. Hasner, the House majority leader, told the Sentinel that he worked behind the scenes to get the pay cut:\n\n\"Just because Juan Zapata was the name behind the amendment doesn't mean I wasn't a catalyst behind the idea. Leadership is more than just putting your name on something.\"\n\nHasner gave PolitiFact a similar account: \"You don\u2019t put your name on every amendment when you are majority leader. ... I led the effort to cut my pay in the state Legislature when things got tough.\" (He reiterated that he led the pay cut effort in a September speech.)", "Overall, Hasner entered the House in 2003 making $29,328. His pay peaked in 2007 at $31,932. He left the House in 2010 making $29,697.\n\n Our ruling\n\nFrankel\u2019s ad says Hasner said \"I'll never accept a pay increase,\" but he \"voted to raise his pay four times.\" We have several criticisms of this claim.\n\nFor starters, Frankel didn\u2019t make it clear that Hasner said he would never accept a pay increase if elected to Congress -- it's possible to view the ad and falsely think he said that while accepting pay raises in the state House. There is a significant difference between saying that he would freeze his own congressional pay at around $174,000 and voting for overall budget bills that included measly pay raises in the state House that took his pay from $29,328 to $31,932 (and then back down again).\n\nAlso, Frankel omits that Hasner\u2019s pay was frozen or cut for a few of his years in the House. And for one of those votes he did vote for a pay raise, but then House members said that was an accident, and they ultimately didn\u2019t get a raise. Yes, Frankel says that he \"voted\" for the pay raises -- not that he \"received\" them. Right away Hasner said that was a mistake and would be fixed, and it was.\n\nThere is a small kernel of truth here: Hasner did vote for three overall budgets that allowed himself to get a small pay raise.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "Lois Frankel campaign, TV ad \"Real,\" \u00a0Sept. 19, \u00a02012\n\nYouTube, Adam Hasner campaign ad \"Start\", Sept. 17, 2012\n\nAdam Hasner campaign website, Lead by example, Accessed Oct. 1, \u00a02012\n\nAdam Hasner campaign website, Fact-checking Lois Frankel\u2019s new attack ad \u2018Real,\u2019Sept. 23, 2012\n\nPolitiFact,\"Super PAC attacks Lois Frankel over pay raise, jobs record,\"Sept. 28, 2012\n\nPolitiFact,\"Mitt Romney would cut millionaires taxes, Barack Obama says,\"Aug. 3, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, \"Barack Obama \u00a0ad says Paul Ryan\u2019s Medicare Plan could raise costs for Medicare beneficiaries by $6,000 each ,\" Aug. 23, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, \"Chain e-mail says Congress raised own salaries while acting to kill Social Security benefit hikes,\"Jan. 22, 2010\n\nFlorida House administration, \u00a0Florida Legislature member salaries, 1969-2012", "Florida statutes, 11.13 compensation of members, Accessed Oct. 1, 2012\n\nFlorida House, Senate Bill 4A House vote, May 27, 2003\n\nFlorida House, Senate Bill 2600\u00a0and House vote, May \u00a06, 2005\n\nFlorida House, House Bill 5001and House vote, May 5, 2006\n\nFlorida House, House Bill 5003\u00a0and House vote, April 10, \u00a02008\n\nFlorida House, House Bill 5001and House vote, April 1, 2010\n\nTampa Bay Times, \"Lawmakers don\u2019t merit raise now, says one,\" Accessed in Nexis, June 7, 2003\n\nTallahassee Democrat, \"Legislature approves budget; several other bills pass as session ends,\" Accessed in Nexis, May 7, 2005\n\n South \u00a0Florida Sun-Sentinel, \"Hasner airs first TV ad, claiming credit for legislator pay cut,\"Aug. 25, 2008\n\nFlorida Times-Union, \"House OKs budget on party-line vote,\" Accessed in Nexis, April 2, 2010\n\nPensacola News-Journal, \"State workers spared pay cuts,\" Accessed in Nexis, April 27, 2010\n\nMiami Herald\u2019s Naked Politics blog,\"Hasner and Frankel disagree on Ryan plan,\"Sept. 24, \u00a02012\n\nInterview, Ryan Duffy, spokesman for the Florida House Leadership, Sept. 28, 2012\n\nInterview, Joshua Karp, spokesman for Lois Frankel\u2019s campaign, Sept. 28, 2012\n\nInterview, Brad Herold, campaign manager for Adam Hasner, Sept. 28, 2012\n\nInterview, Adam \u00a0Hasner, \u00a0Congressional \u00a0candidate, Oct. 1, 2012\n\nInterview, Steve Dutton, Committee on House Administration, Oct. 1, 2012\n\nInterview, Pete Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union, Oct. 1, \u00a02012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
