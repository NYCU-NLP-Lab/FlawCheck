["A website called ILoveNativeAmericans.us ran a fake news story about President Donald Trump wanting to deport Native Americans to India.", "A fake news story contended that President Donald Trump conflated Native Americans with people actually from India, and wanted to deport them to the South Asian subcontinent.", "\"Trump wants to deport American Indians to India,\" read the headline on an April 25, 2017, post on ILoveNativeAmericans.us. The post was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to winnow fake news from users\u2019 feeds.", "ILoveNativeAmericans.us ostensibly is a site filled with stories about or of interest to Native Americans. But there\u2019s evidence it\u2019s a fake news outlet however, not the least of which is that the site insisted to a commenter questioning the story that \"this is real, it was on TV.\"", "We received no response when we tried to contact the administrator via the Gmail address the site provided. The site is registered to someone in Kosovo.", "The story falsely quoted Trump in a bogus Fox News interview as saying, \"I\u2019ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can\u2019t trust these Indians.\"", "Also included are two images of tweets, allegedly from Feb. 13. The tweets are actually fakes. As all devoted PolitiFacters know, it\u2019s quite easy to fake a tweet from any account, and Trump is a popular target. There\u2019s no record of Trump actually tweeting such things about Native Americans.", "Moreover, the story itself came from a parody site called The-Postillon.com, which first posted the article on Feb. 13.", "The-Postillon.com calls itself \"honest news\" on its banner, but its FAQ section notes that \"everything you can read here is satire and therefore all made-up.\" Unlike many parody sites, the FAQ also lists several staffers, and gives readers explicit permission to repost edited articles with attribution. The site is registered in Roubaix, France.", "The story has made it onto other suspect aggregators similar to I LoveNativeAmericans.us. One version appeared on WeLoveNative.com on Feb. 28, while it showed up (and was then removed) on NativeAmericans.news on March 4. Both websites also are registered to addresses in Kosovo.", "There has been some concern that Trump\u2019s immigration efforts may affect Indians in the United States \u2014 some 300,000 illegal immigrants are Indians, according to the Times of India. Possible changes in the H-1B temporary visa program also are likely to affect Indians here.", "But Trump didn\u2019t make these statements, and there\u2019s no executive order deporting Native Americans to another country.", "We rate the statement Pants On Fire!", "ILoveNativeAmericans.us, \"Trump wants to deport American Indians to India,\" April 25, 2017", "The-Postillon.com, \"Trump wants to deport American Indians to India,\" Feb. 13, 2017", "Times of India, \"Donald Trump's immigration plans could impact 3 lakh Indian-Americans,\" Feb. 22, 2017", "WeLoveNative.com, \"Trump wants to deport American Indians to India,\" Feb. 28, 2017", "NativeAmericans.news via Internet Archive, \"Trump wants to deport American Indians to India,\" March 4, 2017", "PunditFact.com, \"A fake in 140 characters: How not to get tripped up by hoax Twitter accounts,\" March 14, 2017", "New York Times, \"How Trump\u2019s \u2018Hire American\u2019 Order May Affect Tech Worker Visas,\" April 18, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
