AJC PHOTO/Jason Getz", "The Common Core State Standards have become a hot-button issue in some areas of metro Atlanta. Opponents run the gamut: state lawmakers, conservative groups, tea party members, parents and some school board members.", "Many see adoption of the standards as a backdoor way for the federal government \u00a0to implement a national curriculum and take away local control of education.", "A self-described citizen activist from Fayette County, Angela Bean, has been one of the opposition leaders, and she has taken the anti-Common Core message on the road to various school and community meetings. In a newspaper article this month, Bean -- who is also an executive board member of the Fayette County Republican Party -- identifies another reason for hating Common Core:", "There are concerns about the longitudinal data system that goes along with Common Core, Bean told The Newnan Times-Herald. The system is designed to collect up to 400 data points on each child, which can include personally identifiable data.", "Does Common Core allow for this amount of extensive data collection? And, if so, what data is being collected? We checked with the initiative\u2019s founders for more information.", "Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states, the District of Columbia and two U.S. territories. The standards were created after years of discussion by private nonprofit education groups and state education departments, and they are designed to better prepare students for college and careers, and ensure that students in all states learn the same academic concepts in the same grades.", "The Obama administration has used its education funding grant process to encourage states to adhere to the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core.", "Georgia\u2019s state Board of Education adopted Common Core performance standards on July 8, 2010.

Organization officials said there are no data collection requirements with Common Core, and they address the issue on its website.", "\"States are still responsible as they were previously to report their accountability (on tests and other student assessments), but Common Core doesn\u2019t add any new data reporting, said Margaret Millar, the CCSSO\u2019s director of membership services.", "Kathleen Porter-Magee, an education expert at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute who has studied Common Core, agreed that there are no requirements for any sort of data collection or data mining.", "\"If a state chooses to collect achievement data, that is a decision the state chooses to make,\" she said. \"But is is not lumped in with Common Core.\"", "So, if Common Core doesn\u2019t have a data collection component, or require data collection, has Georgia decided to collect data independently?", "Turner Nolt, with the Georgia Education Department, initially responded to Bean\u2019s statements in another article, also printed in The Newnan Times-Herald. In that response, Turner Nolt refutes the claims that Georgia is participating in a data collection system, known as inBloom. That system is one of several education data collection systems, but it is not aligned with Common Core, state and and national experts maintain. (Some individual Georgia school districts are participating in inBloom. We reached out to company officials for specifics but did not receive a response by press time)", "The state Education Department does collect student data annually and makes that data available in a user-friendly format for teachers and other school officials in its Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS) Grant Program.

The categories include: a student\u2019s name, grade, gender, ethnicity, birth date, attendance, enrollment history, test scores, courses taken and grade received, and any subgroup (example: English language learner, retained, economically disadvantaged).", "Each of the categories has dozens of data points that can vary depending on how many tests each student takes, those test scores, the number of courses taken and the length of time a student has been in school.", "Turner Nolt said the data in the state\u2019s SLDS system has been collected for years, but that the information is now computerized. The systems does collect personally identifiable data, as Bean claimed, but the information is not shared beyond the student\u2019s teachers and school administrators, Turner Nolt said.", "To sum up, Bean claimed a data system companion of Common Core collects up to 400 data points on each child, which can include personally identifiable data.", "Bean\u2019s claim incorrectly intertwines Common Core and a data collection system. Our research found that Common Core does not include a data collection component. Georgia\u2019s Education Department does collect student data as part of a separate annual collection cycle, then provides the information in a digital format for teachers and school officials to use.", "Bean\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts about the separation of Common Core and data collection.", "We rated her claim Mostly False.", "Newnan Times-Herald, \"Common Core opposed in Senoia,\" Sarah Fay Campbell, June 1, 2013", "Newnan Times-Herald, \"State defends Common Core model,\" Sarah Fay Campbell, June 5, 2013", "Phone interview, Angela Bean, June 11, 2013", "Phone interview, Kathleen Porter-Magee, senior director, High Quality Standards Program, \u00a0Thomas B.
