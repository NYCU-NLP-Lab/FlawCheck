["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on March 20, 2020 | Updated on March 27, 2020", "Following a flawed rollout of test kits in the U.S. for the new coronavirus, politicians have given inaccurate information related to the diagnostic tests distributed by the World Health Organization.", "Biden\u2019s comments came during his one-on-one March 15 Democratic debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders, when he responded to a question about whether Trump was justified in complaining that inherited bureaucratic red tape hampered the administration\u2019s response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.", "Biden, March 15: No, look, the World Health Organization offered \u2014 offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own.", "Biden is right that the U.S. wanted to make its own test, but he leaves out important context \u2014 including the fact that many countries with the scientific capability designed their own tests, and that the WHO test kits are largely meant for less wealthy countries with weaker health systems. And he\u2019s wrong that the U.S. ever \u201crefused\u201d a test from the WHO.", "Trump\u2019s claim appeared at the end of a March 17 press conference, when a reporter asked the president about Biden\u2019s claim.", "Two other coronavirus task force members stepped in to respond, with coronavirus coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx discussing the importance of quality control and alluding to potential test defects, and Adm. Brett Giroir refuting the idea that the U.S. refused tests from the WHO.", "After both had spoken, Trump summarized things by saying, \u201cSo, number one, nothing was offered. Number two, it was a bad test. Otherwise, it was wonderful.\u201d Trump is correct on the first point, but incorrect on the second \u2014 evidence indicates the test has performed well.", "Biden may have gotten the impression that the U.S. \u201crefused\u201d test kits from the WHO from a news report. A March 6 Politico story his campaign sent to us refers to the \u201cTrump administration\u2019s decision to forgo a World Health Organization test\u201d and mentions that 60 countries received WHO tests. But Biden\u2019s comments distort the situation.", "\u201cTo our knowledge, no discussions occurred between WHO and CDC (or other USG agencies) about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the US,\u201d WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told us in an emailed statement. \u201cThis is consistent with experience since the US does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity.\u201d", "This point was also made by Giroir, a coronavirus task force member and the person in charge of coordinating diagnostic testing.", "Speaking in the same press conference in which Trump would incorrectly call the WHO test \u201cbad,\u201d Giroir said that when he became involved in the COVID-19 effort, he called the most \u201csenior officials at the WHO as I could find,\u201d and \u201cas far as I can tell from sources that should know, no one ever offered a test that we refused.\u201d", "And during a CNN/Facebook town hall on March 19, Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme, also debunked the notion.", "\u201cWHO developed the tests mainly to support countries with weaker health systems,\u201d he said, noting that the U.S. has a \u201cfabulous\u201d scientific system and \u201ca wonderful capacity\u201d to develop tests. \u201cSo no, we did not offer the tests to the U.S., which would be standard practice,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we were asked, obviously, we would have responded.\u201d", "The WHO told us that countries \u201cdid not have to pay\u201d for the tests it distributed, which were produced by a manufacturer in Germany.", "Rangarajan Sampath, the chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, told us that the WHO tests are typically intended for low- and middle-income countries that lack the ability to test.", "In part, this is because any assay, or test, the WHO might choose to produce could be easily manufactured in the U.S. or European Union, Sampath said, so the agency doesn\u2019t usually supply kits to those countries.", "Still, he said, any nation \u2014 even wealthy ones \u2014 can request a test kit from the WHO. \u201cThey don\u2019t restrict them to low- and middle-income countries,\u201d he said.", "The WHO did not share a list of the 120 countries that it said\u00a0were sent nearly 1.5 million tests as of March 16, but a survey of agency statements reveals that many are concentrated in poorer parts of the world that have less scientific expertise than the U.S.", "Around 40 of them appear to be African Union countries, which the WHO\u2019s director-general said had acquired the ability to test by Feb. 26 \u201cusing lab kits sent by WHO.\u201d The WHO has also said it assisted 29 countries in the Americas \u2014 including some Caribbean islands and much of South and Central America \u2014 and nations in Southeast Asia with testing supplies and training.", "Countries the WHO has specifically named include Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia and North Korea.", "Special attention has also been given to Iran, which on March 2 the WHO said it had supplied with 100,000 tests and on March 11 said it had given another 40,000 tests. That tally suggests that just under 10% of all the tests the WHO shipped went to Iran.", "Biden presents the U.S. decision to make its own test as a critical error. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not respond to our questions about its testing decisions. But it\u2019s not unusual for the U.S. to proceed in this manner, and the agency likely started creating its test before any other test protocols were publicly available.", "Sampath said it\u2019s common for nations with the scientific know-how to develop their own diagnostics. And indeed, the U.S. is one of several countries, such as China, Japan, Thailand and France, that did so for COVID-19.", "As soon as the genome sequences of the new virus were released, Sampath said, various countries immediately started developing their own protocols and their own assays.", "And the CDC did develop a viable test very rapidly.\u00a0It\u2019s not clear exactly when the test was first ready, but the agency successfully used its own test to identify the nation\u2019s first COVID-19 case on Jan. 20 and a CDC report suggests the test was operational at least two days earlier.", "As we\u2019ve explained before, the CDC ran into trouble in February when it scaled up production of its test kits to send out to public health labs around the country. The agency attributed the problem to a manufacturing defect with one of the three sets of reagents used to identify the virus.", "A little over two weeks after announcing the problem, the agency provided a fix, telling labs that the problematic assay using the third set of reagents could be scrapped without sacrificing test accuracy. But the manufacturing snafu, along with other limitations on which tests could be used and which labs could do testing, delayed the expansion of the nation\u2019s testing capacity. The U.S., however, was never without the ability to test for COVID-19.", "Sampath noted that even if the CDC had opted to use another test design, manufacturing errors could have still been a problem.", "\u201cNo matter which primers they were using,\u201d he said, referring to one component of the test, \u201cthey could have had the same issue.\u201d", "It\u2019s worth pausing here to explain that the test the WHO has distributed is a modified version of the diagnostic test created by researchers at the Charit\u00e9, a medical research institute in Berlin.", "As with the CDC test, the German test uses a molecular biology technique known as the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to scan through a patient sample to see if the virus is present. Both tests are largely the same, but the short passages of the viral genome that each test checks for are different.", "Because the test did not originate with the WHO, it is not fully accurate to call the test the \u201cWHO test.\u201d", "In a March 7 statement, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn claimed as much, saying that the \u201cWHO does not have its own test that it is distributing globally,\u201d and that the organization has \u201conly posted on its website protocols from some test developers, such as the CDC.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that the WHO didn\u2019t develop its own test from scratch, but as we have already relayed, the organization has distributed more than 1 million tests, which is what many people have called \u201cthe WHO test.\u201d (And for the purposes of this article, when we refer to the WHO test or test kit, we are referring to the tests the agency has shipped around the world.)", "\u201cThe WHO selected this particular test for global distribution as it was modeled on the earliest published PCR protocol,\u201d a WHO spokesperson told us, referring to the lab technique underpinning all of the molecular assays. The German protocol was first made available on Jan. 13 and announced in a press release on Jan. 16.", "On the WHO website, the German test is listed along with designs from six other countries, including the United States\u2019 submission. A disclaimer notes that the order of the listing \u201cis by country\u201d and \u201cdoes not imply any preference of WHO,\u201d and that the protocols \u201chave not yet been validated through a WHO process.\u201d", "In other words, as Sampath told us, the WHO hasn\u2019t endorsed a particular test and hasn\u2019t said one is better than another, even though it did choose one to mass produce.", "That brings us to how well the WHO test performs \u2014 and Trump\u2019s false claim that the test was \u201cbad.\u201d", "Trump may have concluded this from the way Birx responded when asked about Biden\u2019s claim. She emphasized quality control of testing kits and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help to put out a test where 50% or 47% are false positives.\u201d", "False positives are instances in which a test says a person has the disease when a person doesn\u2019t \u2014 and should test negative. In the reverse problem, a person who has the disease can test negative when they are actually positive, in what\u2019s called a false negative.", "But there is no evidence that the WHO test doesn\u2019t work well. Sampath, whose organization is now testing different COVID-19 assays from various manufacturers to provide independent verification for countries, said there are \u201cno known issues\u201d with the test. The WHO\u2019s Ryan also said in a CNN interview that the test has performed \u201cextremely well in the field, in multiple countries.\u201d", "\u201cThe test has been validated in three external laboratories, adapted by WHO and manufactured in line with international quality standards,\u201d a WHO spokesperson said. \u201cIt has shown consistently good performance in laboratory and clinical use, and neither a significant number of false-positive nor false-negative results have been reported.\u201d", "The White House and the vice president\u2019s office did not respond to our requests for comment or clarification. But Birx told the New York Times that the test she alluded to with a 47 to 50% false positive rate was not the WHO test, but rather a diagnostic used in China.", "A study there found that 47% or more of people who didn\u2019t have symptoms and had been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 might have been improperly flagged as having the disease. The paper, however, has been retracted, and the English-language abstract didn\u2019t report the test\u2019s overall false positive rate.", "NPR reported the retraction after FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn referenced the study again in an on-air interview. According to NPR, the retraction occurred a few days after publication on March 5. The retraction was not indicated on PubMed, the National Library of Medicine\u2019s biomedical literature database, until March 26.", "Updated, March 24: We added a video to this story.", "Updated, March 27: We have updated this story to include information about the retraction of a Chinese study about a COVID-19 diagnostic test.\u00a0When we published our story on March 20, and even after we updated it on March 24,\u00a0PubMed had yet to indicate\u00a0that the paper had been retracted.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
