Shoutout to liars and those pretentious and superfluous people. May your conscience be stirred. Special shoutout to Mema Leni.\u201d", "\"Mema\" is Tagalog slang for someone who speaks nonsensical things.", "The posts were published after Typhoon Vamco made landfall in the Philippines November 11, causing major flooding and leaving\u00a0scores of\u00a0people dead.

This isn\u2019t true. In fact, it\u2019s just the six of us together in going around... We took photos and videos ourselves...\"", "The second and third images in the misleading posts' collage are photos of Robredo being filmed inside a building.
