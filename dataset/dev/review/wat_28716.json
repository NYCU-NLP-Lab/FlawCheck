["Will Weatherford said he thought many would-be Medicaid patients should \"have some skin in the game.\" (AP photo)", "Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford has been a vocal opponent of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. He\u2019s no fan of the law\u2019s proposed Medicaid expansion, especially.", "During an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board on Feb. 27, Weatherford played down the need for Medicaid expansion, which the Legislature rejected last year.", "He said many Floridians who might have enrolled under an expanded Medicaid system can now buy affordable private insurance from the federal website HealthCare.gov.", "\"If you live above the 100 percent of the poverty rate today, which is about 400,000 of the 800,000 who would qualify for Medicaid expansion, half of the people who qualify for Medicaid expansion today can buy a health care plan for $30 a month on the exchange,\" he said.", "Weatherford added that he thought people in that income range \"should be able to afford $30 a month and have some skin in the game.\"", "We wondered if half of the people who would have been eligible under a potential Medicaid expansion could get a private insurance plan for $30 a month.", "We ran the numbers and found that Weatherford had a point that many people who would have been eligible for Medicaid can buy plans from healthcare.gov for $30 a month. But it\u2019s not half of them, it\u2019s a good bit less. Showing you why is going to involve a deep dive into how the health care law works.", "Medicaid math", "The federal government offered to pay all the costs initially for states to expand Medicaid, a health insurance program for the poor, and 90 percent in later years. But Florida opted not to expand coverage. Just how many people would have been covered under the potential Florida expansion is hard to gauge. Estimates put it at about 1.3 million.", "The government uses the federal poverty level as the measure to determine a person\u2019s eligibility to receive assistance for government programs such as Medicaid and, in the case of the Affordable Care Act, eligibility for insurance subsidies. For 2014, the poverty level is set at $11,670 for a single person and $23,850 for a family of four.", "Florida\u2019s Medicaid program has more than 3 million enrollees, but many residents don\u2019t qualify under the program\u2019s guidelines. Some people, like young adults and parents, have to be at 22 percent of the Federal Poverty Level or below to qualify, but most single adults without children don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid at all. The federal law intended to allow all poor adults into the program, but Florida opted not to expand the program.", "Who gets tax credits?", "The federal health care law intended for the very poor to get Medicaid and for low-wage workers to get tax credits to buy private insurance.", "The law splits those groups up by income, using definitions based on the federal poverty level. People who make 138 percent of the poverty level or lower would be eligible for Medicaid. People who make between 138 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level would get subsidies to buy private insurance on sites like HealthCare.gov.", "It doesn\u2019t work like that in Florida, though, because the state chose not to expand Medicaid.", "In states that don\u2019t expand Medicaid, the law also allows people making between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level to shop for private insurance with subsidies. (Why that\u2019s the case is another complicated story, which we will address in a separate report.)", "Weatherford is right that those people can buy insurance on the exchange. So how much will it cost them?", "The president\u2019s health care law keeps premium costs low for households making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level by providing tax credits to purchase insurance. The size of the tax credit is adjusted based on the cost of the second-least expensive silver option available in the marketplace. (Plans can be bronze, silver, gold or platinum, with the most generous -- and expensive -- plans being platinum.)", "Break out your calculators: The second-cheapest silver plan can only cost 2 percent of an individual\u2019s annual income for households making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. For a person making $16,104, that\u2019s an annual premium of $322, or $26 a month.", "By plugging demographic and salary information into HealthCare.gov, we can see how this rule bears out.", "For example, a 35-year-old single man living in Pinellas County and making $16,104 a year (138 percent of the federal poverty level) is \"eligible for a premium tax credit\" of up to $198 a month, according to HealthCare.gov. That individual could find a Bronze level plan from Humana for $0 a month (yes, zero dollars), albeit with a $6,300 deductible. He could also buy six other plans from various providers for $30 a month or less.", "What about a family of four (two adults and two children under 18) living in Miami-Dade County making exactly 100 percent the federal poverty level, or $23,850 a year?", "The children may be eligible for Medicaid through the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, HealthCare.gov says. The parents would have to buy insurance on the federal marketplace, but they would be eligible for a tax credit of up to $712 a month.", "With the tax credit, there are several Bronze options that would cost nothing, but the deductible would be capped at $12,600 a year. There are eight other options for less than $30 a month.", "Those individuals would also be eligible for co-payment assistance, which is available to individuals and families making up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level.", "It\u2019s not as good of a deal for those individuals as Medicaid would have been, which basically costs nothing for recipients, but Weatherford is right they could find coverage for pretty cheap.", "But what if you\u2019re a family of four making $12,599 a year, \u00a0just one dollar less than the federal poverty level?", "The parents would no longer be eligible for any financial assistance toward their premiums. The same plans that would cost nothing to the family making $12,600, now cost $555 a month or more.", "Rachel Garfield, a senior researcher for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care research group, said those individuals making less than 100 percent the federal poverty level would likely be stuck in a situation where they couldn\u2019t afford coverage and would remain uninsured. The law says they cannot be penalized for not having insurance, because affordable coverage is not available to them.", "Other estimates", "So Weatherford is correct that some people can buy insurance for cheap on the federal marketplace. But is it half of the people who would have been covered by a Medicaid expansion?", "Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, said it appeared the speaker had gotten confused about his numbers. Mellowe cited a Kaiser Family Foundation study that said there are about 1.3 million uninsured Floridians making 138 percent of the federal poverty level or less.", "Of those people, about one-third earn enough to buy cheap coverage on the marketplace.", "In another study released in August 2012, the Urban Institute also found almost 1.3 million people would be eligible in an expansion. Of those, 300,000 had income between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about 23 percent, and would be eligible to buy in the marketplace.", "Weatherford\u2019s office told us his numbers were based on an estimate from staff analysts projecting that about 937,000 Floridians would be eligible under an expansion. Of those, about 314,000 were between 100 and 138 percent, meaning they now can buy insurance on the federal exchange. That\u2019s about 30 percent, though, not half.", "Spokesman Ryan Duffy said projections showed 402,000 Floridians between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level were expected to enroll over 10 years based on population and economic trends, and that\u2019s the figure to which Weatherford was referring. The speaker said \"today,\" though, not 10 years from now.", "Our ruling", "Weatherford said that about half of Florida residents who would qualify for a Medicaid expansion \"can buy a health care plan for $30 a month on the exchange.\"", "Thanks to an unintended quirk of the law, there are somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 people who can buy cheap coverage on the federal marketplace without the Medicaid expansion. Using premium tax credits, many could find insurance premiums below $30 a month.", "But that\u2019s not half of the individuals who would have qualified for the Medicaid expansion. It\u2019s actually a much lower number, closer to 25 to 33 percent, depending on the study.", "We rate the claim Half True.", "Tampa Bay Times Buzz blog, \"Education, Medicaid expansion among topics for Legislature, Weatherford says,\" Feb. 27, 2014", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Can Florida afford to say no to Medicaid expansion?,\" July 20, 2012", "Kaiser Family Foundation, \"Explaining Health Care Reform: Questions About Health Insurance Subsidies,\" July 2012", "Urban Institute, \"Opting in to the Medicaid Expansion under the ACA: Who Are the Uninsured Adults Who Could Gain Health Insurance Coverage?,\" August 2012", "Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, \"Florida\u2019s Medicaid Choice: Understanding Implications of Supreme Court Ruling on Affordable Health Care Act,\" November 2012", "Miami Herald, \"Study says expanding Medicaid could save Florida money,\" Nov. 15, 2012", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Chris Smith says Florida No. 2 in uninsured,\" March 8, 2013", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Weatherford says 85 percent of people covered by Medicaid expansion are \"single, childless\" adults,\" March 25, 2013", "U.S. News and World Report, \"The Obamacare Subsidy You Could Be Missing,\" May 7, 2013", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Will Weatherford says expanding Medicaid would 'drastically' expand country's deficit,\" May 16, 2013", "Kaiser Family Foundation, \"The Coverage Gap: Uninsured Poor Adults in States that Do Not Expand Medicaid,\" Oct. 23, 2013", "Sarasota Herald-Tribune, \"ACA problems undermine Medicaid expansion chances,\" Nov. 15, 2013", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Scott won't answer question on Medicaid for more Floridians,\" Dec. 11, 2013", "Health Affairs Blog, \"Opting Out Of Medicaid Expansion: The Health And Financial Impacts,\" Jan. 30, 2014", "Tampa Bay Buzz blog, \"Study: Medicaid expansion would prevent more than 1,000 deaths in Florida,\" Jan. 31, 2014", "Sarasota Herald-Tribune, \"Despite worries over not growing Medicaid, issue stays on Florida's back burner,\" Feb. 1, 2014", "Tampa Bay Times Buzz blog, \"Congressional Democrats blast Rick Scott for turning back on Medicaid expansion,\" Feb. 5, 2014", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Rick Scott opposed Medicaid expansion before he supported it,\" Feb. 25, 2014", "Miami Herald, \"Unexpected demand causes another Florida Health Choices delay,\" Feb. 16, 2014", "Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, \"Florida\u2019s Medicaid Choice: options and Implications,\" Spring 2014", "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2014 Poverty Guidelines, accessed March 3, 2014", "FloridaHealthFinder.gov, Florida Medicaid reference FAQ, accessed March 4, 2014", "Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, Florida Medicaid FAQ, accessed March 4, 2014", "HealthCare.gov, \"Is my state expanding Medicaid coverage?,\" accessed March 5, 2014", "Social Services Estimating Conference, \"Estimates Related to Federal Affordable Care Act: \u00a0\u00a0Title XIX (Medicaid) & Title XXI (CHIP) Programs,\" accessed March 5, 2014", "American Public Health Association, \"Medicaid Expansion FAQ,\" accessed March 5, 2014", "Florida Legislature Office of Economic and Demographic Research, \"Economic Analysis of PPACA and Medicaid Expansion,\" accessed March 5, 2014", "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \"Health Insurance Marketplace Premiums for 2014,\" accessed March 5, 2014", "Various searches for health insurance options in Florida via HealthCare.gov, March 5, 2014", "Office of the Speaker, In-house Medicaid expansion eligibility projections, accessed March 6, 2014", "Phone and email interviews with Ryan Duffy, communications director for Will Weatherford, March 3-6, 2014", "Phone interview with Emma Sandoe, spokeswoman for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, March 5, 2014", "Phone interview with Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, March 5, 2014", "Phone interview with Rachel Garfield, senior researcher at the Kaiser Family Foundation, March 5, 2014", "Phone interview with John McDonough, director of the Harvard Center for Public Health Leadership, March 6, 2014", "Email interview with Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, March 6, 2014", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
