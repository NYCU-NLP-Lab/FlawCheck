["A text screenshot-turned meme is going around the internet claiming that law enforcement is warning the public about someone injecting poison into the caps of water bottles.", "The post, shared on Facebook, appears to show a screenshot of a text message with \"spread the word\" written across the bottom.

It goes on to say that \"a few people already died in the Richmond area,\" and said \"the sheriff\" just made an announcement.", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The staff at the Bennington Walmart have been extremely cooperative and helpful with the investigation.\"", "A rumor re-circulating on social media claims that law enforcement officials have asked people to check the caps of bottled water because someone is puncturing them to inject the water with poison. The warning message also said multiple people have already died as a result of the poisoning \"in the Richmond area.\"", "There are no credible news or police reports that support such a claim, nor has there been any official warnings or product recalls.
