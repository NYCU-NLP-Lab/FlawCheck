["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Questions about Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as Secretary of State aren\u2019t going away.", "One part of the story that remains unknown, CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar says, is when exactly Clinton wiped her email server clean.", "The answer could be an important marker in the Clinton email story, as House Republicans continue to press for answers to Clinton\u2019s reaction to the death of four U.S. officials in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.", "Keilar, who interviewed Clinton on July 7, said on CNN's State of the Union\u00a0July 12 that\u00a0she was \"surprised\" Clinton \"didn\u2019t show a little more contrition\" about her use of a private email account and seemed a bit irked by Clinton\u2019s spin that she \"never had a subpoena.\" (She did, though Keilar and Clinton interpreted the point differently.)", "\"What the campaign will say is I was asking her about facing a subpoena that she wiped her server. They\u2019ll say that\u2019s not true,\" Keilar said. \"But the other thing is, the campaign hasn't been clear about when she wiped her server of her work emails, so there's no way to even really completely fact-check what she's saying, because they don't want to get into all of the details of those things.\"", "We were curious about Keilar\u2019s claim that Clinton \"hasn\u2019t been clear\" about when she wiped her server clean.", "The Clintons began using the private server in question when President Bill Clinton was in office, Hillary Clinton said at a press conference March 10, 2015. According to Clinton, it contained around 30,000 personal emails and 30,000 work-related emails from during her tenure as Secretary of State.", "Clinton said she deleted the personal emails \u2014 \"emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations,\" she said \u2014 sometime in the fall of 2014 and sometime after the State Department asked on Oct. 28 for Clinton\u2019s work-related correspondence.", "Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails and communication relevant to her role as head diplomat to the State Department on Dec. 5. Sometime after that, the entire server was \"wiped clean,\" said Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Benghazi committee, on March 27.", "When exactly did that happen? Keilar has a point when she says it\u2019s unclear.", "The Clinton campaign told us the work-related emails were deleted off the server shortly after they were turned over to the State Department on Dec. 5. They referred us to a letter Clinton\u2019s lawyer David Kendall wrote to Gowdy. The Benghazi committee subpoenaed Clinton\u2019s emails on March 4, 2015, and Gowdy asked for the physical server about two weeks later on March 19.", "According to Kendall\u2019s letter, dated March 27, the emails relevant to Benghazi were in the State Department\u2019s possession and the committee had no legal right to the server. What\u2019s more, what Gowdy wanted no longer existed.", "\"During the fall of 2014, Secretary Clinton\u2019s legal representative reviewed her [email\u00a0protected] account for the time period from Jan. 21, 2009,\u00a0through Feb. 1, 2013,\" Kendall wrote. \"After the review was completed to identify and provide to the Department of State all of the secretary's work-related and potentially work-related emails, the secretary chose not to keep her non-record personal emails and asked that her account (which was no longer in active use) be set to retain only the most recent 60 days of email.\"", "\"No emails from [email\u00a0protected] for the time period Jan. 21, 2009, through Feb. 1, 2013, reside on the server. Thus, there are no [email\u00a0protected] e-mails from Secretary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate and legally authorized.\"", "To recap, Clinton\u2019s private server was wiped clean \u2014technically, filtering out emails older than 60 days \u2014 sometime between Dec. 5, 2014, and March 27, 2015. No clearer timeline has been stated.", "Why does this matter?", "After receiving Kendall\u2019s letter, Gowdy issued a statement accusing Clinton of \"unilaterally\" and \"permanently\" deleting all the emails when she wiped the server. The Clinton campaign and Kendall, meanwhile, contend that all the emails relevant to Benghazi and her time as Secretary of State still exist and are in State Department\u2019s possession.", "Our ruling", "Keilar said, \"The (Clinton) campaign hasn\u2019t been clear about when she wiped her server of her work emails.\"", "The Clinton campaign told us the work-related emails were deleted off the server \"shortly after\" she turned them over to the State Department on Dec. 5, 2014, but did not provide a date.", "The paper trail so far gives us a window of sometime between December 2014 and March 2015, but no more.", "That\u2019s better than nothing, but Keilar is largely correct when she says the picture isn\u2019t clear.
