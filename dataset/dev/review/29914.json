It would apply retroactively to the nearly 750 inmates on California's death row.", "Proposition 66, meanwhile, would keep the death penalty but proposes a faster appeals process.", "Campaigns for the competing ballot measures are making numerous claims as they seek to persuade voters.", "A provocative statement by the Yes On 62 campaign on its\u00a0twitter page caught our attention:\n\n\"California is home to the largest death row population in the Western Hemisphere.\"", "The Yes On 62 campaign to abolish California's death penalty made the claim at the center of this fact check on its twitter page above.", "Home to nearly 40 million people, California leads the way in many numerical categories. We wondered, however, whether that includes this somber grouping.", "Our research", "The largest death row populations in the Western Hemisphere belong to states within the United States, not separate countries, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.

California has fewer people on death row than are condemned to die across the United States. So, how could it have \"the largest death row population\" in the Western Hemisphere?", "Experts explain it this way: In the United States, death sentences are primarily the product of state courts. The federal government plays less of a role compared to central governments in other countries. As a result, the size of death rows have long been tracked by state and not necessarily as a national, comprehensive total.", "\"It may be a dramatic way of making the point,\" Dunham said of the Yes On 62 claim. \"But the point is still accurate.\"", "We used a similar interpretation of the claim as we examined its accuracy.", "Frank Zimring, a law professor and death penalty expert at UC Berkeley, agreed California has the largest death row in the Western Hemisphere.
