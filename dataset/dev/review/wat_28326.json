And I still think there is a greater message: he\u2019s an awfully big killer to have received the Peace Prize, and I would have said the same thing about (former President George W.) Bush,\" he told PolitiFact.\n\nBut is Barack Obama really a warmonger? And does the Dalai Lama (winner, 1989) know about this?\n\nFirst, a crash course in cruise missiles. They include everything from the short-range Chinese Eagle Strike missile to the U.S. Tomahawk Land Attack missile, which has a range of 1,500 miles.\n\nThe Federation of American Scientists, an independent Washington-based group created in 1945 to analyze national security issues related to science and technology, defines cruise missiles as \"an unmanned self-propelled guided vehicle that sustains flight through aerodynamic lift for most of its flight path and whose primary mission is to place an ordnance or special payload on a target.\"\n\nMore simply put, cruise missiles, often fired from sea or air, are jet-propelled, as opposed to rocket-propelled missiles. Rather than the arc of a rocket, they fly more like a plane to avoid radar.\n\nAt least 12 exporting countries -- Great Britain, the United States, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and Taiwan -- have developed them, according to the FAS website, and dozens of other countries have some variant in their arsenals.\n\nThey aren\u2019t cheap, either -- Tomahawks now cost about $1.1 million apiece, the Navy said recently.\n\nCruise missiles can trace their antecedents to the infamous German V-1, or \"buzz bomb,\" of World War II. And some countries have had short-range, anti-ship cruise missiles for years.\n\nJohn Pike, the director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Washington-based website of military information, said the U.S. relied on them as part of its nuclear arsenal for most of the Cold War and then began to deploy them as conventional weapons.\n\nPike said current-day cruise missiles\u2019 major debut came in 1991 during the Gulf War under President George H.W. Bush. That campaign saw almost 300 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired.\n\nAn elite group\n\nGiven the limited time frame that cruise missiles have been used, the number of Nobel laureates who could have fired them is limited.\n\nFor starters, Nobel laureates such as the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (1997), Burmese human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyi (1991) and Doctors Without Borders (1999) aren\u2019t going to be firing cruise missiles -- ever.\n\nSimilarly, while the United States fired them in Serbia as part of a NATO air campaign, they can\u2019t be attributed to 1991 Nobel laureate Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, which had peacekeeping troops in the Balkans.\n\nAnd former President Jimmy Carter, who won the prize in 2002, was not directly involved in any major hostilities while in office, outside of trying to rescue the American Embassy hostages in Iran.\n\nMikhail Gorbachev (Nobel, 1990) was known for helping to end the Cold War and reducing the nuclear arsenal, but did preside over the Soviet Union during its final years in its invasion of Afghanistan. Pike noted that western accounts of the Soviet war in Afghanistan are \"necessarily incomplete,\" but says he \"cannot imagine what type of cruise missile they would have used\" there.\n\nAnd while the Israelis have also developed cruise missiles over the years, some reportedly for nuclear purposes, they have held them largely in check.\n\nAccounts of the 1973 Yom Kippur War indicate that the Egyptians used about two dozen short-range Soviet-made anti-ship cruise missiles against the Israelis, which would implicate then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat (who won the Nobel along with Israel\u2019s Menachem Begin in 1978). And the Israelis reportedly fired anti-ship Gabriel missiles at Egyptian and Syrian targets, sinking 10 of their boats.\n\nBut even if these were to be considered true cruise missiles, future Israeli prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, who shared the prize with Yasser Arafat in 1994, were not in power at the time, nor was Begin. And the numbers fall short of U.S. salvos.", "The Obama Tally", "So is Obama a cruise-missile-firing standout among Nobel laureates?\n\nHe has fired at least 192, according to the Pentagon\u2019s March 28 briefing about Libya, and is the fourth American president in a row to launch them. But he's the only president in that group to win the peace prize.\n\nVice President Al Gore, who went on to win his Nobel in 2007 for his work on global warming, supported the American use of cruise missiles in the 1999 NATO effort to protect Kosovo. And, in fact, as president, Bill Clinton deployed Tomahawks repeatedly, sending well over 600 cruise missiles during his administration at targets in Iraq, Serbia, Sudan and Afghanistan. But, Clinton was commander in chief, not Gore.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize winner, former Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, has been linked to the secret bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War. But he and Richard Nixon used bombers, not nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, for that campaign.\n\nExperts said they believe the sign's claim about Obama and cruise missiles appears technically true, but also merits some context.\n\nGeorge R. Lucas Jr., the chairman in ethics at the Stockdale Center for Ethical Leadership at the U.S. Naval Academy and a professor of ethics and public policy at the Naval Postgraduate School, said by e-mail that the statement was probably \"true by definition\" and undoubtedly \"deliberately ironic\" to score a point.\n\n\"My own sense is that this president (has) behaved very responsibly with the use of military force, but that, like all recent presidents, he has faced circumstances that are profoundly complex, and in which the decisions to use force are open to question and criticism,\" Lucas wrote.\n\nFor his part, Obama, in a March 28, 2011, speech, defended the Libyan strikes, saying they were for a humanitarian purpose, intended to save the city of Benghazi \"and the people within.\"\n\nBased on our review of historical records and interviews with military historians, it appears the sign along the New Hampshire highway is correct. The next closest contender was Sadat during the Yom Kippur war, but it appears he was far short of the number fired by Obama, even in combination with other laureates. If we hear of additional evidence, we'll revisit this item. But in the meantime, the numbers indicate the sign is correct.
