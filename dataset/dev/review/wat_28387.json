["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 27, 2019", "Ukrainian prosecutors said they have expanded their investigation involving Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma, a gas company in Ukraine. But no \u201cindictment\u201d has been announced, as false headlines circulating on social media claim.", "A lot has been written in recent months about Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, and Hunter Biden, who sat on the company\u2019s board of directors when his father, Joe Biden, was vice president. Not all of it has been accurate.", "Erroneous posts circulating on social media and viral headlines falsely claim that the head of Burisma has been \u201cindicted\u201d by Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general. No such announcement has been made.", "Ukrainian Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka did announce last month that his office would review a number of previous cases involving senior officials who worked under former President Viktor Yanukovych, including some cases related to former Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources Mykola Zlochevsky.", "Zlochevsky is the founder of Burisma, which had been the focus of previous investigations. (Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship to Burisma was alluded to in the July\u00a0phone call\u00a0between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky, which has spurred the House impeachment inquiry into Trump.)", "On Nov. 20, the same day the falsehood about the \u201cindictment\u201d began to circulate, Reuters reported that Ryaboshapka announced his office had expanded the existing probe to investigate suspicions of Zlochevsky \u201cembezzling state funds\u201d on \u201can especially large scale,\u201d but few details were provided. Reuters reported that the probe was \u201ceffectively on hold\u201d because Zlochevsky\u2019s whereabouts are unknown.", "False word of an \u201cindictment\u201d evidently was a misrepresentation of a separate press conference earlier the same day, in which two Ukrainian members of Parliament floated a number of claims relating to Zlochevsky and corruption in Ukraine. Among the claims was an unconfirmed allegation that the company paid Hunter Biden and three other board members\u00a0\u2014 his investment company partner Devon Archer, former Poland President Aleksander Kwasniewski and investment banker Alan Apter \u2014 about $16.5 million.", "The previous investigations into Zlochevsky concerned \u201ctax violations, money-laundering and licences given to Burisma during the period where Zlochevsky was a minister,\u201d according to Reuters.\u00a0Zlochevsky served as minister of ecology and natural resources from 2010 until 2012; he was also a deputy secretary for the country\u2019s National Security and Defense Council from 2012 to 2014.", "The time period of the new allegations of embezzlement isn\u2019t clear, so we can\u2019t say if the expanded probe includes the time when Biden served on the board.", "As we\u2019ve previously written, Hunter Biden served on Burisma\u2019s board from 2014 to 2019. Biden reportedly made up to $50,000 per month for his role \u2014 which therefore could have amounted to $3 million during his time on the board from April 2014 to April 2019. In an interview with ABC News, Hunter Biden was asked about reports that he made $50,000 per month at Burisma. He said that, as a private citizen, he did not have to answer questions about how much money he earned. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s all been reported.\u201d", "In October, when Ryaboshapka announced the review of previous investigations relating to Zlochevsky, the prosecutor general \u201ctold Reuters \u2026 he was not aware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden,\u201d according to the news organization.", "One of the first websites to push the erroneous \u201cindictment\u201d claim, ZeroHedge, initially claimed in its headline that the allegations made by the Ukrainian members of Parliament were actually from a \u201cUkrainian Indictment.\u201d It later changed the headline to say that the claims were those of a \u201cUkrainian MP.\u201d", "Other\u00a0reports, such as one by the Gateway Pundit and a YouTube video by One America News Network, have not been updated and continue to present the nonexistent indictment as fact. And yet other posts falsely claim there was an indictment against the gas company itself or CEO Taras Burdeinyi.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
