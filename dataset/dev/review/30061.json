["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on September 1, 2020 | Updated on September 2, 2020", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn\u2019t drastically reduced the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19, but posts making that bogus claim have been circulating widely \u2014 with the help of President Donald Trump, who retweeted one such claim on Aug. 30.", "Twitter has since removed the original tweet, which came from an account dedicated to the pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon. But the claim is still readily available on all the major\u00a0social\u00a0media\u00a0platforms. In fact, the\u00a0same QAnon account that posted the now-deleted tweet\u00a0includes a screenshot\u00a0version\u00a0featuring the president\u2019s retweet.", "The post Trump highlighted said: \u201cThis week the CDC quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6% of all the 153,504 deaths recorded actually died from Covid. That\u2019s 9,210 deaths. The other 94% had 2 to 3 other serious illnesses and the overwhelming majority were of very advanced age.\u201d", "But that\u2019s not what the CDC information says.", "In weekly updates provided on the CDC\u2019s website, the agency includes information on additional conditions present in patients who died with COVID-19. These other illnesses or conditions found to be present in a patient are called comorbidities. The agency also includes a chart detailing the number of patients with each additional condition.", "For the week referenced in the claim, the CDC explained that the chart \u201cshows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned.\u201d", "That means that 6% of those who died with COVID-19 through Aug. 15 didn\u2019t have any other reported conditions.", "It does not mean that the CDC has \u201cquietly updated\u201d the number of deaths associated with COVID-19 to a fraction of what had been reported. It\u2019s also not new information; the agency has been providing the same information since May.", "Asked\u00a0about Trump\u2019s tweet during a press briefing on Aug. 31, though, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that \u201che was highlighting new CDC information that came out that was worth noting.\u201d", "At that time, the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. had passed 183,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, and the total number of cases across the country had passed 6 million.", "McEnany said that the president was not trying to downplay the death toll.", "The following morning, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, clarified what the CDC data mean.", "He noted that the 6% figure includes cases where COVID-19 was listed as the only cause of death. \u201cThat does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of Covid didn\u2019t die of Covid-19. They did,\u201d Fauci said on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d", "\u201cSo the numbers you\u2019ve been hearing \u2014 the 180,000-plus deaths \u2014 are real deaths from Covid-19. Let [there] not be any confusion about that,\u201d Fauci said.", "Other versions of the claim are misleading, rather than being strictly false. One example is a headline on the conservative outlet Gateway Pundit, which announced: \u201cThis Week CDC Quietly Updated COVID-19 Numbers \u2013 Only 9,210 Americans Died From COVID-19 Alone \u2013 Rest Had Different Other Serious Illnesses.\u201d", "The president retweeted a link to that, too, and the phrase \u201conly 6%\u201d trended on Twitter.", "Several\u00a0media outlets flipped the percentage and reported that 94% of COVID-19 deaths had \u201cunderlying medical conditions.\u201d", "But the data on which all of this is based come from death certificates, which list any causes or conditions that contributed to a person\u2019s death. In the case of COVID-19, the disease often causes other serious conditions, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Those two conditions are among the ailments with the highest counts in the CDC\u2019s comorbidity chart. Some long-term conditions\u00a0that\u00a0increase the risk for severe COVID-19,\u00a0such as\u00a0diabetes or hypertension,\u00a0were also listed.", "The underlying cause of death, however, is the condition that started the chain of events that led to a person\u2019s death. In 92% of all deaths that mention COVID-19, that disease is listed as the underlying cause of death, Jeff Lancashire, spokesman for the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics, told FactCheck.org in an email.", "As the epidemiologist and science writer Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz explained in a recent post, \u201cit\u2019s pretty rare that someone wouldn\u2019t have at least one issue caused by coronavirus prior to their death, and all it means is that in 94% of cases people who had COVID-19 also developed other issues, or had other problems at the same time.\u201d", "Meyerowitz-Katz notes that influenza and pneumonia are listed as the most common concurrent diseases, which isn\u2019t surprising. \u201cSimilarly,\u201d he writes, \u201crespiratory failure, something that the coronavirus directly causes, is listed here as a \u2018comorbidity\u2019 that 55,000 people had.\u201d", "So, it\u2019s misleading to say that 94% of those who died with COVID-19 also had other ailments without explaining that the disease causes other serious illnesses. And it\u2019s wrong to claim that only 6% of the recorded COVID-19 deaths were caused by the disease.", "Update, Sept. 2: In an interview with Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham that aired Sept. 1, Trump made this false claim himself, saying, \u201cI saw a statistic come out the other day, talking about only 6% of the people actually died from COVID, which is a very interest[ing], that they died for \u2014 from other reasons.\u201d", "Ingraham corrected him, explaining that those who die from COVID-19 often have other conditions, but COVID-19 \u201cmight ultimately have been the key morbidity.\u201d", "\u201cBut it\u2019s an interesting statistic,\u201d Trump responded.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
