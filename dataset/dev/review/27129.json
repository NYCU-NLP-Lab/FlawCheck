["About this rating", "In August 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump urged consumers to boycott tires sold by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., asserting that the Ohio-based company had \"announced a ban on MAGA hats\" (i.e., hat's bearing Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan). Goodyear countered by stating that they had not specifically \"banned\" MAGA hats, but had only asked associates to \"refrain from workplace expressions in support of political campaigning for any candidate or political party\" -- a policy that would discourage the wearing of apparel promoting the candidacy of not just Trump, but of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, or of any other candidate for office.", "Shortly afterwards, social media users began circulating an image of a purported tweet from Trump, an angry broadside directed at Goodyear which was chock full of egregious misspellings supposedly documenting how \"stupid\" the president \"really\" is:", "This image was a fabrication, not a genuine tweet issued by Trump. The only message Trump tweeted about Goodyear was the following. Although it may not be 100% factually accurate, it contained no misspellings:", "Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. \u00a0 \"Trump Urges Snub of Goodyear Over Alleged Ban on Hats.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 20 August 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
