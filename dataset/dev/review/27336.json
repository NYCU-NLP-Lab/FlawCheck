["This week, Hilary Duff took to Instagram Stories to share recent memories from her holiday break\u00a0\u2014 including the case of pink eye she claims\u00a0resulted from\u00a0frequent COVID-19 tests.", "Her posts, which stayed online for just 24 hours, were captured by BuzzFeed.", "\"Then my eye\u00a0started to look weird.....and hurt....a lot,\" she wrote. \"Took a little trip to the emergency room.\u00a0I got an eye infection from all the COVID tests at work...cuz you know, 2020 and all.\"", "\"PS.... My eye was fine, needed antibiotics,\" Duff added.", "Her experience was reshared by celebrity news\u00a0accounts like\u00a0Access Online.", "\"#HilaryDuff\u00a0was handed one final gift from 2020: an eye infection from too many COVID-19 tests!\u00a0The CDC has not reported eye infections as a common side effect of coronavirus testing, but many film and TV sets are testing at a high frequency to remain in production safely,\" they wrote.", "Duff has\u00a0not responded to a request from USA TODAY for comment.", "Despite what Duff has claimed, there is no reason to believe that frequent COVID-19 tests actually cause pink eye.", "First, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0does not list eye infections as a side effect of nasal swab tests for\u00a0COVID-19.", "Second, at least five\u00a0doctors\u00a0have said it's\u00a0unlikely that Duff contracted pink eye\u00a0from COVID-19 tests.", "Dr.\u00a0Christopher F. Thompson,\u00a0an ear, nose and throat specialist at Providence Mission Hospital in Orange County, California,\u00a0told Health\u00a0that \"a\u00a0COVID-19 test should not cause an eye infection.\"", "\"A COVID-19 swab is a small, sterile probe that collects mucus,\"\u00a0he said. \"It is placed along the nasal cavity floor to the nasopharynx (the upper part of the throat, behind the nose). The eye is separated from the nasal cavity by a fibrous layer called the periorbita, as well as bone (lamina papyracea). The tear duct does drain into the nasal cavity, but a swab does not disrupt this tear duct. Therefore, a swab in the nose shouldn't cause an eye infection.\"", "Dr. Brian Toy,\u00a0an ophthalmologist at the University of Southern California\u2019s Roski Eye Institute, told Yahoo Life that it \"seems\u00a0very unlikely\" that Duff contracted pink eye from COVID-19 tests.", "\u201cThe swabs that they use for COVID tests are sterile, and when they\u2019re administered by a trained nurse or technician, they\u2019re not causing unnecessary trauma, so it seems unlikely that nasal swabs would be causing eye infections,\" he said.", "He added that surgeons routinely insert instruments into the nose to preform sinus surgery, and there is no increased risk of eye infection as a result.", "Dr. Dara Kass,\u00a0an emergency room doctor at Columbia University Medical Center in New York,\u00a0also\u00a0told Yahoo Life\u00a0that \"it is\u00a0unclear how a nasal swab could give you an eye infection.", "\"It\u2019s more likely that she got it in her community and they were incidentally related,\" Kass said.", "Dr.\u00a0Thomas Russo,\u00a0chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York, told\u00a0Shape\u00a0that \"there is no evidence of biologic plausibility that getting a COVID test could give you an eye infection.\"", "And Dr.\u00a0Amesh A. Adalja, an infections disease expert at\u00a0the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore,\u00a0also told Shape\u00a0that\u00a0conjunctivitis has not been an issue for other individuals who receive frequent COVID-19 tests.", "\"There are plenty of people who get tested all the time with no issues,\" she said. \"NBA and NHL players were tested daily during their seasons and there were no reports of eye infections as a result.\"", "Based on our research, the claim that frequent\u00a0COVID-19 tests are reported to cause pink eye is MISSING CONTEXT. Hilary Duff claimed on her Instagram Stories that her recent case of conjunctivitis was due to routine tests. But at least five doctors said that it's unlikely that Duff contracted pink eye\u00a0from COVID-19 tests. Overall, there is no reason to believe there's a connection between the two.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
