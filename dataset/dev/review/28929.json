["\u201cStrange how this keeps happening,\u201d Donald Trump Jr\u00a0wrote in an October 1, 2020 tweet sharing a photo of eight mail-in ballots allegedly sent to an apartment in Washington, DC, adding: \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop someone from filling all of these out and returning them?\u201d", "The president has contributed to fears that mail-in voting in the 2020 election will lead to massive fraud. However, experts say the system is safe, and some\u00a0states, such as Washington, have been conducting mail-in voting on a large scale for years.", "Other posts highlighted similar problems with mail-in ballots on social media over the last week of September, pointing to the alleged potential for fraud.", "AFP Fact Check looked into each case. In instances where ballots were in fact sent in error, election officials said that measures such as signature verification would stave off the threat of voter fraud.", "Signature verification is done automatically by machines, or manually by humans in some counties.", "The biggest threat is not overcounting but undercounting, as some ballots can be rejected if voters change signatures, Theodore Allen, an Associate Professor of Engineering at The Ohio State University, who worked on several election projects, told AFP by email.", "The tweet shared by the president's son refers to another account that claims a friend received eight ballots, all of which were addressed to previous tenants, and none to her.", "This occurred because, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the DC Board of Elections (DCBOE) decided to automatically send mail-in ballots to voters registered in the District in the first week of October.", "Previous tenants who did not register their change of address will receive ballots, but the current residents would not be able to fill them in in their place, Nick Jacobs, a spokesman for the DCBOE, told AFP by phone.", "\u201cThe simple answer is that it can\u2019t happen, we have a signature verification. If it\u2019s not signed or the signatures don\u2019t match, it\u2019s not processed,\u201d Jacobs said, adding that situations such as the one described in the tweet are \u201chappening a little bit,\u201d particularly in group house settings when people forget to change their address.", "People voting by mail can track their ballot on the DCBOE\u2019s website, and find out whether their signature has been accepted.", "\u201cI got proof. My grandfather passed away December 31, 2014. We just got his ballot today,\u201d text accompanying a photo of an envelope from New Mexico\u2019s Dona Ana County Bureau of Elections says in a Facebook post.", "\u201cIs this why NM is a Democratic state ?\u201d the post asks.", "However, according to Dona Ana County Clerk Amanda Lopez Askin, the envelope actually shows a mail-in ballot application. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these applications were automatically sent to all voters in 10\u00a0of the state\u2019s 33 counties, including Dona Ana, ahead of the general election.", "In past years, ballot applications were not automatically sent. New Mexico\u2019s Senate Bill 4, signed into law in June 2020\u00a0 granted county clerks the right to choose to apply this practice.", "\u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate that rampant misinformation on a very innocuous application that is sent for voters\u2019 convenience is being used as a claim of voter fraud,\u201d Askin said by phone.", "Askin said that chances of fraud in this case were slim. A person would have to provide \u201cvery specific information\u201d as well as the voter\u2019s signature, which would then be compared at\u00a0the county clerk\u2019s office and rejected if proven falsified.", "Another Facebook post alleged that a woman in the Wisconsin city of Oak Creek had received two ballots ahead of the general election. The Facebook user advised everyone to \u201cvote in person\u201d because \u201cthis vote is going to be a scam!\u201d", "But the photo actually shows a ballot for the November 3 general election\u00a0as well as one for the August primary, Oak Creek city clerk Catherine Roesk\u00a0said by phone.", "The date on the bottom envelope in the photo is\u00a0 from June 2020, which indicates it was for a prior election.", "\u201cWe didn\u2019t even have ballots for this (November 3) election until the 17th of September so\u2026 busted,\u201d Roeske said.", "\u201cThis is how rumors get started,\u201d she added, expressing frustration that all the money her city spent on mailing voting material could lead to such an accusation.", "Roeske looked into the voting registry and said it showed that the person named on the ballots in the photo had indeed received two ballots, and had not sent back the June one.", "Even had someone received two ballots, they could only have voted once, Roeske said. Each ballot has a barcode that allows the board of elections to count every vote using machines. \u201cWe take that tracking information, and it shows the ballot\u2019s received,\u201d she said. As in other states, signatures are also verified.", "Many residents of the Garden State complained about receiving ballots not addressed to them. One man in Mercer County said he received two mail-in ballots for his parents, who had died eight years ago. Another complained about receiving one for his mother-in-law who died five years ago, and a third said he got one for a woman who had been dead 17 years.", "Unlike the New Mexico case, the ballots in those photos are indeed proper mail-in ballots, not applications. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the same story all over the state,\u201d Paula Sollami Covello, Mercer County Clerk, said by phone.", "These situations occur \u201cbecause the registration offices rely on getting a letter notifying them someone\u2019s passed away,\u201d she said. Those deceased individuals were always registered as voters, \u201cbut it\u2019s only this year that it was discovered because we were mandated to send everybody a ballot.\u201d", "In prior years, New Jersey residents would have had to request a mail-in ballot, but in light of the pandemic, an executive order by Democratic governor Phil Murphy required election officials to automatically send ballots to all active registered voters.", "Covello, who has administered New Jersey\u2019s mail-in voting since 2009, says these errors don\u2019t threaten the integrity of the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s worked out very well for us, we\u2019ve seen very little instance of fraud.\u201d", "Covello said that ballots received for deceased individuals should be returned to the sender with the word \u201cdeceased\u201d written on the envelope.", "According to Kimberly Burnett, spokeswoman for New Jersey\u2019s Middlesex County government, forged signatures on returned ballots \u201cwill be flagged by Board of Elections staff when researching signatures.\u201d", "She added in an email that \u201ca flagged ballot will be referred to the county prosecutor for election fraud if our office determines a voter is deceased through a post-election audit.\u201d", "A Florida Man was charged with voter fraud after requesting a ballot for this deceased wife, claiming he wanted to \u201ctest the system to see if it worked.\u201d\u00a0Supervisor of Elections staff conducted a routine check to process her application\u00a0and noticed she had died in 2018.", "AFP Fact Check has debunked other claims about mail-in voting, including the false story of a Texas man caught after filling 1,700 ballots, or claims that adding a stamp will expedite mail-in ballots in the mail.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
