["About this rating", "Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 crime drama\u00a0The Godfather\u00a0remains a hugely influential film decades after its release, and perhaps the one scene from that movie most\u00a0often referenced in pop culture is\u00a0one in which producer Jack Woltz, who unwisely refused a request from the Corleone family to cast Johnny Fontane (Don Corleone's godson) in his new film, awoke to find the severed head of his prize thoroughbred in his bed:", "Even those\u00a0who haven't\u00a0actually seen the famous film itself probably recognize\u00a0The Godfather as the origin of the \"horse head scene\" when they encounter references to it in other works of pop culture:", "The Godfather\u00a0was shot about a decade before\u00a0the Screen Actors Guild adopted\u00a0the American Humane Society's \"Guidelines for the Safe Use of Animals in Filmed Media\" [PDF], so it's reasonable to be concerned that at least one horse\u00a0was sacrificed for the film.\u00a0It's true that the horse's head in The Godfather was genuine, but untrue that the animal it came from was killed specifically for that scene:", "The studio had encouraged Francis Ford Coppola to use a fake horse head, but he didn\u2019t like the mock-up. His scouts found a horse ready for slaughter at a dog-food plant in New Jersey. The art director picked one that looked like the horse in the film and said, \u201cWhen that one is slaughtered, send us the head.\u201d Coppola later remembered, \u201cOne day, a crate with dry ice came with this horse\u2019s head in it.\u201d", "The authenticity of the horse's head was addressed by Coppola after the 2001 release of\u00a0The Godfather DVD Collection, in which the filmmaker recalled that animal rights activists were troubled by the imagery:", "Coppola also reports that he received heated letters from animal activists regarding the horse's head that is found in the bed of Hollywood producer Jack Woltz (John Marley). They thought the filmmakers had killed a horse for the scene. It was in fact a real head, Coppola says, but it came from a slaughterhouse where horses were being destroyed for dog food. He says a member of the production went to the company, chose a horse that resembled Woltz's prized thoroughbred and asked that when the time came, the head be sent to the filmmakers. Shortly thereafter, the company sent them a box with the head wrapped in ice.", "And so one of the most memorable scenes in movie history was born.", "Another movie's animals were perhaps not so lucky. \u00a0Pernicious, but unverified rumors about the 1970 motion picture Patton claim that mules were shot, clubbed to death, or poisoned during its filming \u2014 charges that 20th-Century Fox vehemently denied.", "King, Susan. \u00a0\u00a0 \"Godfather 'Goodies.'\"\r\n \u00a0  \u00a0 Los Angeles Times.  \u00a0\u00a0 11 October 2001.", "Rawlings, Nate.  \u00a0\u00a0 \"The Anniversary You Can\u2019t Refuse: 40 Things You Didn't Know About The Godfather.\"\r\n \u00a0  \u00a0 Time.  \u00a0\u00a0 14 March 2012.", "American Humane Association. \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Guidelines for the Safe Use of Animals in Filmed Media.\"\r\n \u00a0  \u00a0 June 2009.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
