["As the election nears, a\u00a0post about President Donald Trump looks\u00a0to highlight his record on military events, claiming he stands out from most modern presidents\u00a0in terms of new conflicts\u00a0involving the United States.", "The Oct. 24 post simply reads, \u201cDid ya know? This was the 1st 4 year term with outa new war since Eisenhower.\u201d\u00a0The poster did not respond to USA TODAY's requests for comment.", "Dwight Eisenhower was president from 1953-61.", "A similar claim was made by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., during the Republican National Convention, saying that Trump was the first president since Ronald Reagan to not wage a new war. Reagan was six presidents after Eisenhower, serving from 1981-89.", "Fact check:False Kamala Harris claim uses image from 2019 trip to Iowa", "The accuracy of the claim depends in part on the definition of war.", "The United States has only formally declared war in five conflicts \u2014 the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II \u2014 against 11 countries. Formal declarations are rare, in part, because they give the president additional powers at home. The rarity makes it a bad\u00a0metric for this\u00a0fact-check, as military entanglements that are considered wars, such as the Vietnam War or the Iraq War, would be exempt.", "Most conflicts in which the United States engages\u00a0involve \u201cauthorizations of military force\u201d from Congress to the president. These authorizations go all the way back to John Adams.", "Eisenhower received an authorization for military force from Congress in 1957, in his second term, to manage escalating tensions in the Middle East. He sent nearly 150,000 troops to Lebanon in 1958.", "The next authorization was under President Lyndon B. Johnson in Vietnam, a conflict in which Americans had been involved for more than a decade.", "The next declaration was under Reagan in 1983 in Lebanon.", "In 1991, authorization was made for the Persian Gulf War while President George H.W. Bush was in office. In 2001, authorizations were given for the War on Terror under President George W. Bush, and for the Iraq War in 2003.", "This leaves Presidents John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama off the list of presidents who waged new wars that were authorized in some way by Congress.", "Fact check:Estimated taxpayer burden for Trump's golf outings is hard to pin down", "However, that doesn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t military conflicts.", "Clinton, with authorization from the United Nations and money from Congress, brought the United States into the Bosnian War, and Obama brought the United States into the Libyan Civil War in 2011 under similar circumstances. Since both military engagements are referred to as wars, for purposes of this fact-check, we will consider them new wars the country entered.", "Get these in your inbox: We're fact checking the news and sending it to your inbox. Sign up here.", "More ambiguously, Kennedy grappled with the Bay of Pigs, a military engagement that went down as an \u201cinvasion,\u201d but never a war.", "Nixon governed through the Vietnam War, but didn\u2019t start any foreign wars. Ford is not credited with starting any new wars either, and Carter famously considers it the proudest accomplishment of his one-term presidency that he never started any new wars, instead relying on negotiations.", "Fact check:Flint, Michigan, councilman, a lifelong Democrat, has endorsed Trump", "We rate this claim FALSE, based on our research. Trump's term in office\u00a0has not been the first four-year term since Eisenhower without a new war. Carter, Ford and Nixon all served after Eisenhower and did not bring the country into new wars.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
