But that\u2019s not correct, according to a report released May 23 by the office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services. This report appears to be the one Lankford is referring to because with one crucial exception, the numbers in his post fit with those in the report.", "The Health and Human Services study did find that in 25 of the 39 states studied, rates doubled (or more) over the period analyzed. But the period analyzed wasn\u2019t the past year.", "In reality, the report compares premiums in 2013 -- a year before the Affordable Care Act took full effect -- to premiums in 2017. That\u2019s a span of four years.", "We should also note that the HHS comparison looked at individually purchased policies, not employer-sponsored plans. Lankford did not note that distinction.", "But there are bigger concerns than the time frame -- namely, that the 2013 figure and the 2017 figure aren\u2019t an apples-to-apples comparison.", "And what\u2019s different about the numbers tend to make the premium increases look larger, and the Affordable Care Act look worse.", "\u2022 The 2017 figure ignores all subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.", "Comparing premium levels in 2013 and 2017 ignores that most policyholders in 2017 were able to obtain subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.

Cynthia Cox, associate director for health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation, pointed to federal data showing that in Oklahoma -- Lankford\u2019s home state -- the average plan on the marketplace cost $620 before subsidies and $79 after subsidies.", "In any case, the after-subsidy figure is what really matters for the consumer, not the published rate they never have to pay.", "\u2022 The comparison doesn't take into account that, due to the Affordable Care Act, plans in 2017 covered more than plans in 2013 did.", "One explanation for why premiums rose between 2013 and 2017 is that the Affordable Care Act required all plans to cover certain basic services that were not mandatory previously.

Some, however, still buy their individual plans outside of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. It\u2019s not a trivial percentage: One estimate published in the journal Health Affairs found that 40 percent of individual-market plans were sold off the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.", "These plans were not considered in the Health and Human Services study. In addition, the Health and Human Services study only looked at Affordable Care Act marketplaces run by the federal government, not those run by the states on their own. This matters, Cox said, because states that run their own exchanges have seen lower-than-average premium growth, in part because the customer base for their marketplaces have tended to be healthier.", "So, if the study had looked at state-run marketplaces, not just the federal marketplaces, the premium figure for 2017 might have been lower.", "Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, agreed with the critiques listed here and said that the Affordable Care Act is \"not in a death spiral or collapsing.\" Still, she added that problems with the marketplaces should not be overlooked. \"The markets are clearly still in churn.

Also, just because subsidies are available to some Americans doesn't mean that premium increases aren't problematic for many families,\" Jordan said.", "Lankford said, \"This year, a majority of states are seeing premiums and costs double\" under Obamacare.", "A recent Health and Human Services study found that individual-market premiums in many states had doubled -- but over four years, not \"this year.\"", "But the comparison itself is flawed.
