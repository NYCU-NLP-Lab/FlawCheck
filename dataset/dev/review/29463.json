["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on August 9, 2016", "Donald Trump speculates on Twitter that Shahram Amiri \u2014 an Iranian nuclear scientist who defected to the U.S. and reportedly became a CIA spy \u2014 was executed in Iran recently \u201cbecause of Hillary Clinton\u2019s hacked emails.\u201d There is no evidence of that.", "To the contrary, it had been widely reported for years that Amiri was a CIA informant. The first news story on Amiri providing the U.S. with information on Iran\u2019s nuclear program appeared in March 2010 \u2014 nearly four months before Clinton\u2019s aides at the State Department referenced Amiri (without naming him) in emails.", "Furthermore, there is no evidence that Clinton\u2019s emails were \u201chacked,\u201d as Trump said.", "The emails sent by Clinton\u2019s aides in July 2010 were among the more than 30,000 work-related emails housed on Clinton\u2019s private server and released by the State Department in batches since June 2015. An FBI investigation \u201cdid not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton\u2019s personal e-mail domain \u2026 was successfully hacked,\u201d FBI\u00a0Director James Comey said on July 5, although he added that\u00a0\u201cit is possible that hostile actors gained access\u201d to Clinton\u2019s server.", "Trump tweeted about Amiri\u2019s execution Aug. 8 \u2014 a day after the Iranian government confirmed that the scientist-turned-spy was killed:", "Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U.S. because of Hillary Clinton's hacked emails.", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 8, 2016", "The bizarre case of\u00a0Shahram Amiri became public in the fall of 2009, when Amiri disappeared during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. In an Oct. 8, 2009, article, the Associated Press wrote\u00a0that the Iranians accused the U.S. of being involved in Amiri\u2019s disappearance.", "\u201cThe disappearance of an Iranian nuclear scientist on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in June is raising questions about whether he defected and gave the West information on Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d the AP wrote.", "At the time, State Department spokesman Ian C. Kelly told reporters\u00a0that he wasn\u2019t aware of any State Department involvement in Amiri\u2019s disappearance.", "On March 31, 2010, ABC News reported that Amiri indeed had defected to the U.S. in what was described as an \u201cintelligence coup.\u201d", "\u201cAmiri has been extensively debriefed since his defection by the CIA, according to the people briefed on the situation. They say Amiri helped to confirm U.S. intelligence assessments about the Iranian nuclear program,\u201d ABC News reported. State Department spokesman Mark Toner declined to comment on the ABC News report.", "In June 2010, Iranian state television showed a video of Amiri in which he claimed that he was captured by the U.S. in Saudi Arabia and brought to the U.S. against his will. An Associated Press article on June 7, 2010, quoted Amiri as saying he was \u201cheavily tortured and pressured by U.S. intelligence.\u201d", "State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley denied that the U.S. had kidnapped Amiri. \u201cWe are not in the habit of going around the world and kidnapping people,\u201d Crowley said at a June 8, 2010, press briefing.", "A month later, Amiri turned up at the Pakistani embassy\u00a0in Washington, D.C., requesting to return to Iran. In an AP story on July 13, 2010, unnamed U.S. officials said Amiri voluntarily defected to the U.S., and Clinton was quoted as saying that Amiri was\u00a0free to go home.", "\u201cThese are decisions that are his alone to make,\u201d Clinton told reporters at the time.", "The Washington Post reported on July 15, 2010, that Amiri \u201cwas paid more than $5 million by the agency to provide intelligence on Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d citing unnamed U.S. officials.

So how can Trump blame \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s hacked emails\u201d for Amiri\u2019s recent execution?", "After Iran announced Amiri was put to death, there were articles that correctly noted that Amiri was referenced in two of Clinton\u2019s emails that had been released by the State Department. Both emails were mentioned in an Aug. 8 story by Fox News that carried the headline \u201cExecuted Iranian scientist discussed in Clinton server emails, fueling GOP accusations.\u201d", "The first email was sent by special envoy Richard Morningstar to senior adviser Jacob Sullivan on July 5, 2010 \u2014 which was a little more than three months after the ABC News article that identified Amiri as a CIA informant. The second email was sent by Sullivan to Clinton on July 12, 2010.\u00a0Neither email identified Amiri by name, referring to him as\u00a0\u201cour person\u201d and \u201cthe gentleman.\u201d", "Fox News, Aug. 8:\u00a0The email by Richard Morningstar, a former State Department special envoy for Eurasian energy, concludes, \u201cOur person won\u2019t be able to do anything anyway. If he has to leave, so be it.\u201d", "Another email, sent by Sullivan on July 12, 2010, appears to obliquely refer to the scientist just hours before his appearance at the Pakistani Embassy became widely known.", "\u201cThe gentleman \u2026 has apparently gone to his country\u2019s interests section because he is unhappy with how much time it has taken to facilitate his departure,\u201d Sullivan wrote. \u201cThis could lead to problematic news stories in the next 24 hours.\u201d", "The Fox News story noted that Amiri had been publicly identified as a U.S. spy \u201cgoing back years,\u201d so \u201cit\u2019s unclear whether those [email] references put him at any additional risk.\u201d", "On CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Aug. 7, Republican Sen.
