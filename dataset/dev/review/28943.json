Only his highly paid consultants, who are laughing all the way to the bank, still support him...And by the way, he did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis!\"", "Bloomberg made his leadership skills a significant part of his argument for why voters should have considered him for the White House, so we wondered about the president\u2019s criticism. Even though Bloomberg has dropped out of the presidential contest, he has said he will spend money to defeat Trump, and Trump has continued to feud with him on Twitter.", "We checked with the Trump campaign, and Deputy Communications Director Zach Parkinson sent us several examples of times when Bloomberg\u2019s approval rating suffered\u00a0in times of crisis. We also looked for examples.", "They include:", "2009: During a nationwide economic crisis, Bloomberg\u2019s approval ratings dipped, according to a Marist Poll.

As a candidate, Bloomberg seemed like a longshot on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, the day in which the city was to hold its primary election. But during the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, his popularity rose, and he narrowly won the general election.", "The 2001 mayor\u2019s race could have hinged on many factors, not least of which that Bloomberg vastly outspent his rival, Democrat Mark Green.", "The Bloomberg campaign did not respond to emails about this fact-check. Bloomberg, however,\u00a0 laid out his case for his experience handling crises as mayor in a television ad filmed in late February. The ad highlighted his experience dealing with the aftermath of Sept. 11, the blackout of 2003, West Nile virus, and Hurricane Sandy.", "Bloomberg has also expressed his ambivalence about polls in the past, telling The Atlantic magazine in 2012, \"If I finish my term in office \u2026 and have high approval ratings, then I wasted my last years in office. That high approval rating means you don\u2019t upset anybody.\"", "Trump tweeted that Bloomberg \"did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis!\"", "Sometimes Bloomberg\u2019s approval ratings fell when the city faced tough times, sometimes they didn't. Voters disapproved of his handling of\u00a0a big snowstorm, Occupy Wall Street protestors and a\u00a0financial crisis.
