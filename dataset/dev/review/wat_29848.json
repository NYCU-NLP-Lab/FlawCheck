["About this rating", "On Dec. 18 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for Moderna's COVID-19 mRNA vaccine \u2014 the second vaccine to make it to this stage of approval. Readers asked us if U.S. President Donald Trump has any financial interest in the company, which received $483 million from the Operation Warp Speed vaccine development initiative.", "In terms of direct stock ownership, the answer is no. In terms of indirect stock ownership through externally managed funds, the answer is effectively no as well.", "A look at Trump's most recent financial disclosure forms (for the 2019 business year) show no ownership of Moderna, Inc. stocks. As we have discussed in previous fact checks about Trump's alleged COVID-19 financial conflicts of interest, much of the president's investment income, as disclosed on his annual financial disclosure forms, comes from three family trusts, each of which are, in part, invested in mutual funds whose earnings come from a shared pool of investments. These family trusts are, according to those forms, administered without Trump\u2019s input by J.P Morgan, an investment bank and financial-services firm, and neither Trump nor J.P. Morgan controls what stocks these funds are invested in at any given time.", "In some cases, these mutual funds include holdings in pharmaceutical companies. Several of them, for example, are partially invested in the company AstraZeneca, which is also in the race to produce a COVID-19. At least one mutual fund included in all three Trump family trusts owns an extremely minor stake in Moderna at the time of this reporting. That fund \u2014 JP Morgan's Global Research Enhanced Index Equity UCITS ETF \u2014 is 0.07% invested in Moderna. An indirect interest such as this does not constitute ownership of Moderna stock, however. As such, the claim is \"False.\"", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
