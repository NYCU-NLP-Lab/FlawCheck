Despite a winning team. Despite a popular Saturday night concert series. And despite a cheap ticket, the Rays say.\n\nThe disappointing turnstile receipts played prominently into Sternberg's announcement June 21, 2010, that the team wants to explore options for a new stadium outside St. Petersburg, specifically in Tampa and Hillsborough County. Rays officials are convinced that a new, modern ballpark constructed closer to the region's geographic center could boost attendance by 7,000 to 8,000 fans a game.\n\n\"We have learned that it's not just about winning,\" Sternberg said. \"It's not about ticket prices. And it certainly isn't about a lack of interest in this team.\n\n\"Our prices have been judged the most affordable in all of professional sports. Our television ratings have grown dramatically. And our standing in the community has never been higher. Our customers are our fans. We need to be in a location that is convenient for our fans to reach. And we need to be in a place that makes us attractive to the region's businesses and community.\"\n\nSternberg claims the Rays have done everything to make baseball work in downtown St. Petersburg, including cutting prices to the bottom in all of professional sports.\n\nPolitiFact Florida got a call from the bullpen to check it out.\n\nThe Rays directed us to a 2009 fan survey from ESPN Magazine called the Ultimate Standings. The survey ranks teams in each professional sport (baseball, football, hockey and basketball) in eight different categories. Scores in seven of the eight categories came from 50,000 responses to ESPN.com. An eighth category -- which tried to measure wins versus revenues -- was computed by researchers at the University of Oregon.\n\nThe results were then weighted to create an overall score. The Rays ranked 16th overall out of 122 professional sports teams.\n\nBut that's not what we're checking.\n\nOne of the individual categories was Affordability, and specifically asked fans to rate teams in terms of ticket prices, parking prices and concessions prices. According to ESPN, the Rays ranked No. 2 overall in ticket prices, No. 1 in parking prices and No. 5 in concession prices.\n\nThat made the Rays the most affordable franchise in all of professional sports, according to the ESPN survey, just like Sternberg said.\n\nBut we're not sure how much weight the ranking actually should hold.\n\nTake parking, where the Rays ranked first. Depending on the game, it costs anywhere from $10 to $25 to park at Tropicana Field. The New York Mets -- who ranked 111th in parking prices in the survey --charge $19 for all games. The San Diego Padres -- who ranked 108th in parking -- charge less than the Rays, between $8 and $15. The NFL's Denver Broncos charge between $20 and $30 to park and rank 68th. Parking is $18 a game for the NBA's Golden State Warriors, which somehow ranks 106th.", "Now, the Rays point out that if you have four people in your car you can park for free. And we'll point out that if you live in New York, Philadelphia, Boston or Washington, you'll most likely take public transportation meaning you won't have to pay for parking either. We also feel obligated to note that the four people free parking rule only applies to Sunday games and a select other few home dates. The rest of the time, the first 100 cars with four or more will park for free up to an hour before game time.", "Trying to consider the relative cost of tickets is even more challenging. The Rays charge a different price for the same seat depending on who they are playing and what night of the week the game is on. Baseball, of course, also has a built in advantage because teams play 81 home games a year compared to half that for hockey and basketball and just eight regular-season home games for football (Fewer games means a smaller supply of seats, which translates into higher prices).\n\nStill, for the sake of argument, let's see how much it cost to buy an outfield seat at a handful of Thursday's baseball games -- not counting those Ticketmaster fees.\n\nRays vs. San Diego Padres -- $17\nAtlanta at Chicago White Sox -- $17\nChicago Cubs at Seattle -- $32\nPittsburgh at Texas -- $30\nFlorida at Baltimore -- $15\nMinnesota at Milwaukee -- $30\nSan Francisco at Houston -- $18\n\nOf the seven games we looked at, the Rays have the second-cheapest outfield seat available. The team that has the cheapest option, the Baltimore Orioles, ranks 61st in terms of ticket pricing, according to ESPN. And the Brewers, who rank fourth in ticket pricing, have the second-most expensive ticket. Any of that make sense?\n\nDoesn't to us either.\n\nAnd here's the point. Sternberg accurately cites an ESPN study in saying that the Rays have been \"judged the most affordable (team) in all of professional sports.\" But we're not sure an ESPN survey of 50,000 fans represents a true picture of the affordability of the Rays, or any of the other 121 professional sports franchises.\n\nThere are so many variables when it comes to ticket pricing -- be it the opponent or the day of the week -- or parking, or concession prices that it's just hard to make a fair judgment. Because the survey is suspect, we rate Sternberg's statement Mostly True.", "MLB.com, Rays: Expand search for new ballpark, June 21, 2010\n\nBaseball Reference, Rays attendance figures, accessed June 23, 2010\n\nESPN, Ultimate Standings 2009\n\nTampa Bay Rays, e-mail interview with Carmen Molina, June 23, 2010\n\nSt. Petersburg Times, Rays owner, St. Pete in stadium stalemate, June 21, 2010\n\nTampa Bay Rays, parking information, accessed June 23, 2010\n\nNew York Mets, parking information, accessed June 23, 2010\n\nSan Diego Padres, parking information, accessed June 23, 2010\n\nGolden State Warriors, parking information, accessed June 23, 2010\n\nDenver Broncos, parking information, accessed June 23, 2010\n\nTampa Bay Rays, ticket prices versus San Diego Padres for June 24, 2010\n\nChicago White Sox, ticket prices versus Atlanta Braves for June 24, 2010\n\nSeattle Mariners, ticket prices versus Chicago Cubs for June 24, 2010\n\nTexas Rangers, ticket prices versus Pittsburgh Pirates for June 24, 2010\n\nBaltimore Orioles, ticket prices versus Florida Marlins for June 24, 2010\n\nMilwaukee Brewers, ticket prices versus Minnesota Twins for June 24, 2010\n\nHouston Astros, ticket prices versus San Francisco Giants for June 24, 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
