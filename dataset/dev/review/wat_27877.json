["After weeks of discussion, maneuvering and protests, Governor-elect Scott Walker is taking a sharp new tack on the proposed Madison-Milwaukee high-speed rail link.\n\nWalker transition director John Hiller issued this statement Nov. 18, 2010: \"The Madison-Milwaukee train line is dead.\"\n\nIt was quoted in the JSOnline story headlined \"Rail backers turn up heat on Walker\" and repeated on television, and again several days later in USA Today.\n\nHiller may as well have quoted directly from Meinhardt Raabe, the late Jefferson County, Wis., actor who played the Munchkin coroner in the \"Wizard of Oz\":\n\n\"As Coroner I must aver, I thoroughly examined her. And she's not only merely dead, she's really most sincerely dead.\"\n\nAt issue, of course, is the $810 million federal grant the state sought and won to extend Amtrak service from Milwaukee to Madison. The project is to be one link in a Midwest network of new high-speed rail service. Walker argues the state can not afford the operating expense of the train and has vowed to kill the project.\n\nAs recently as Nov. 10, Hiller put it all in the future tense: \"Governor-elect Scott Walker is going to fulfill his campaign promise to stop the construction of the Madison-Milwaukee train line.\"\n\nSo what changed? Is the train really most sincerely dead even before Walker takes office?\n\nFirst, although it was Hiller who made the comment, he\u2019s a Walker appointee. When we followed up with Walker\u2019s office, transition spokesman Cullen Werwie simply repeated the statement. As such, we\u2019ll treat it as a statement from Walker himself.\n\nIn many ways, the comment recalls one made by U.S. Transportation Secretary Raymond LaHood, who declared at a Labor Day rally in Milwaukee: \"It\u2019s coming. Nobody can stop this train.\"\n\nIt was stated as fact, not an opinion or promise or prediction of the future. We looked at that statement and ruled it False, noting there were many ways Walker, once in office, could kill the project.\n\nThe key, of course, was once in office. And that happens Jan. 3.\n\nIn the meantime, there are plenty of people -- including President Barack Obama -- who support this project. And, if anything, the public discussion has recently centered on finding a way to answer one of Walker\u2019s chief objections: the annual state subsidy to operate the train.\n\nThat subsidy has been estimated at anywhere between $750,000 and $7.5 million, depending on whether the feds pick up the vast majority of the cost. LaHood\u2019s office declined to discuss the matter with us.\n\nAmong the things that could still happen:\n\nAn outside group could cover the operating shortfall: Madison Mayor David Cieslewicz has said the city might be willing to help with the operating costs, noting his city\u2019s chamber of commerce and other business groups support the project.\n\n\"We\u2019re willing to take a look at some of the operating expenses,\" said Cieslewicz aide Chris Klein. \"If that\u2019s the issue, we\u2019re willing to help.\"\n\nSo far, there\u2019s no action taken by the Madison City Council on the matter, but the mayor is willing to \"sit down and have a conversation about it,\" said Rachel Strauch-Nelson, communications director.\n\nCongress could take a new look at it: \u00a0U.S. Rep. Tom Petri (R-Wisconsin) supported the train for years because that was the wish of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle and his predecessor Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson. But then Petri backed away from it after Walker won. (That earned a Full Flop rating.)\n\nIf the project is killed, Petri says, he favors using the money for deficit reduction rather than seeing it spent in other states. But even he\u2019s not writing the obituary just yet.\n\nPetri told PolitiFact Wisconsin the operating cost was relatively minor in the context of the entire state budget -- and he expressed interest in gestures from Madison to help pay the operating costs. Petri, a long-time member of the House Transportation Committee, says he, too, is willing to talk about the project before it\u2019s written off.\n\n\"I\u2019d like to see a decision made on a common sense agreed up set of facts,\" Petri said, adding that leaders must decide \"whether it makes sense to pay penalties and back out.\"\n\nWe asked Walker\u2019s office how they would handle offers from Cieslewicz, Petri, the Obama administration or anyone else. For instance, would Walker support the route if there was no state subsidy involved? Walker\u2019s press secretary Cullen Werwie said the governor-elect team wasn\u2019t going to speculate.\n\n\"There\u2019s been a lot of \u2018what ifs\u2019,\" Werwie said. \"We haven\u2019t seen any legitimate proposal.\"\n\n\"He\u2019s following through on his campaign promise\" to stop the train, Werwie said of Walker.\n\nIn a Nov. 24, 2010 radio appearance, Walker told WTMJ-AM (620) radio host Charlie Sykes he remains against the train: \"It doesn\u2019t matter where the money goes back to or what it is for.\" Walker told Sykes his team has talked with the federal DOT about other possible uses of the money but provided no details.\n\nMeanwhile, the parameters of the discussion have changed in key ways since the Nov. 2 election. And they may continue to change:", "Beyond all that, two key mechanisms that Walker said he could use to kill the train -- refusing to budget operational funding and canceling contracts -- haven\u2019t happened. And Walker can\u2019t do either until he is in office.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nScott Walker, via a top transition official, says the Madison-Milwaukee train is dead. But train backers -- some with large municipal budgets -- aren\u2019t going away. Neither is the Sierra Club, Wisconsin Citizen Action, organized labor and other groups that have rallied on the project\u2019s behalf. And neither is the Obama administration, which, for now, holds the purse strings on this project. The train may well be on its deathbed, it hasn\u2019t yet passed to the stationhouse in the sky\n\nJust as LaHood\u2019s pronouncement was premature -- and False -- this one is, too.", "E-mails and interview, Cullen Werwie, spokesman, Scott Walker transition office.
