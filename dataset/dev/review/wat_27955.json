The agency does not charge any premium from the bank depositors but banks do pay a nominal premium for the cover.", "In conclusion, it is true that deposits up to Rs 1 lakh are insured with banks. However, this is only in case a bank fails. Deposit insurance protects the depositors from losing their money in full. It ensures part recovery. So in case of a bank failure, a depositor doesn\u2019t lose all their money. The limit was set many years ago and may not be relevant today (Considering the change in valuation of rupee across the years). The government is reportedly considering to review the deposits guarantee limit. The last revised limit came into effect on May 1, 1993, when it was increased from Rs 30,000 to Rs 1,00,000. Furthermore, this regulation that the banks have to incorporate information about \u2018deposit insurance cover\u2019 along with the limit of coverage upfront in the passbook has been in place since 2017.", "Donate Now", "Jignesh is a writer and researcher at Alt News.
