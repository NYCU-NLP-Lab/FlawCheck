While there is photographic and video evidence that the president's hair may not be as full as it once was (he is, by the way, 73 years old), we've also encountered quite a few fake photographs that purported to show Trump as nearly bald.", "In August 2019, we encountered yet another example of follicle fakery.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\"", "The creator of the doctored photograph shown above retouched it to make Trump's hair appear thinner than normal.
