The Trump campaign demanded Kelly\u2019s removal from the Jan. 28 debate, but the network refused, inciting the billionaire\u2019s ire and a boycott.", "In response, the network wrote in an official statement:", "\"Donald Trump is refusing to debate seven of his fellow presidential candidates on stage that night, which is near unprecedented.", "\"We\u2019re not sure how Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute, but it should be clear to the American public by now that this is rooted in one thing \u2013 Megyn Kelly, whom he has viciously attacked since August and has now spent four days demanding be removed from the debate stage. Capitulating to politicians\u2019 ultimatums about a debate moderator violates all journalistic standards, as do threats, including the one leveled by Trump\u2019s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski toward Megyn Kelly.\"", "We were curious about Fox\u2019s assertion that Trump\u2019s decision is \"near unprecedented.\"", "We didn\u2019t hear back from the network, but our research finds Fox\u2019s claim is slightly exaggerated. Many other candidates on both sides of the aisle have ditched debate, but the clearest connection to Trump happened more than 35 years ago, when then-frontrunner Ronald Reagan skipped the final debate before the Iowa caucus in 1980.", "Let\u2019s go through some examples of candidates passing up the chance to debate, tracing back from the cycle we\u2019re in now.", "2016 cycle", "Trump\u2019s Fox News debate boycott marks the third time Trump has threatened to pull out of a debate (though he has showed up to all of them so far). But Trump isn\u2019t the only candidate who\u2019s toyed with the idea, and one candidate actually beat Trump to it.", "After failing to qualify for the main debate, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul skipped the undercard round hosted by Fox Business News and Facebook on Jan. 16. \"I won\u2019t participate in anything that\u2019s not first-tier because we have a first-tier campaign,\" Paul said.", "Paul\u2019s self-extraction from the earlier debate isn\u2019t quite the same thing as Trump, the front runner, pulling out of the prime time event in Iowa days before the Iowa caucuses. But Paul isn\u2019t the only other example, and Trump isn\u2019t the only leading candidate to have refused to debate.", "2012 cycle", "There were 20 GOP primary debates in 2012.

Huntsman then skipped another CNN debate to attend a town hall forum instead.", "Five out of seven Republican candidates (Romney, Huntsman, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and Texas Rep. Ron Paul) bowed out of a Newsmax debate scheduled for Dec. 27, 2011, \u2014 with Trump as the moderator.", "While the others cited conflicting schedules or didn\u2019t say why they were declining, the Ron Paul campaign specifically named Trump himself as the reason, saying, \"Mr. Trump\u2019s participation will contribute to an unwanted circus-like atmosphere.\"", "Only former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Kentucky Sen. Rick Santorum accepted the invitation. The debate was cancelled after Trump withdrew from moderating.
