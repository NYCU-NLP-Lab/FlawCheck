["A razor-thin margin, a slow vote count and a presidential election hanging in the balance created the perfect storm for misinformation in Wisconsin.", "Dozens of misleading claims on Facebook and Instagram centered on an overnight jump in the Democratic vote. Most cited (without attribution) a chart published by FiveThirtyEight.com showing how the Wisconsin race changed as results were reported,\u00a0sparking an array of unfounded conspiracy theories. It showed a sharp uptick in Democratic votes at around 4 a.m. in the morning on Nov. 4.", "A conservative website trumpeted this as \"Voter Fraud in Wisconsin.\" One widely shared Facebook post called it a \"ballot dump,\" while another referred to the votes as being \"found.\" President Donald Trump\u00a0promoted the same narrative when he tweeted about 9 a.m. that his lead in key states \"started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted.\"", "We\u2019ll focus on an Instagram post from Wednesday morning that showed a screenshot of the chart with a caption that asserted the \u201cBiden votes came out of NOWHERE.\u201d The text accompanying said \u201cWe. Are. Being. Lied. To.\u201d", "Claims that this chart proves voter fraud of any kind are flat wrong. This only rings true for someone who hasn\u2019t paid attention to Wisconsin\u2019s demographics and voting mechanics.", "Fact check:Wisconsin has more registered voters than ballots cast", "The increase in the chart simply shows when the City of Milwaukee reported its absentee ballot results. We knew well before the election that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to vote absentee, that it takes longer to count such ballots, and that Milwaukee is a Democratic stronghold.", "\"We are not finding ballots,\" Julietta Henry, director of elections for Milwaukee County, told PolitiFact. \"Ballots are being counted.\"", "Democratic nominee Joe Biden passed Trump in Wisconsin about 3:30 a.m. on Nov. 4 because the City of Milwaukee reported its 170,000 absentee votes all at the same time. The votes were reported together because Milwaukee and 38 other communities used a central count location. Other communities counted absentee ballots at the polling places, and reported them earlier along with their in-person vote totals.", "From 3:26 to 3:44 a.m. in The Associated Press election reporting stream, the vote for Biden jumped by 149,520 (9.2% of Biden's total votes) and Trump's vote jumped by 31,803 votes (2% of his total votes). Milwaukee County accounted for nearly all of that jump.", "Biden doing well in Milwaukee absentee ballots should be the furthest thing from a surprise. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the city of Milwaukee by 77%-18%. And polling leading up to the election showed 81% of the people planning to vote absentee in Wisconsin supported Biden.", "We reached out to Instagram user the_typical_liberal, one of the more prominent accounts to post this claim, but did not hear back.", "Fact check:Arizona election departments confirm Sharpies can be used on ballots", "We rate this claim FALSE because it is not supported by our research. The vote tally in Wisconsin jumped at 3:30 a.m. on Nov. 4 because that\u2019s when officials finished counting the city of Milwaukee\u2019s absentee ballots. That group of votes leaning hard left was fully expected since absentee ballots in Wisconsin lean heavily Democratic, as does Milwaukee as a whole. In short, that spike in the voting count wasn\u2019t fraud, it just shows when officials finished counting those legitimate votes.", "Contact Eric Litke at (414) 225-5061 or elitke@jrn.com.
