["\u201cOn Wednesday, they took Pelosi\u2019s laptop\u2026 she's frantic. There were some people in there that were special forces mixed with Antifa, and they took her laptop, and they have that data,\u201d retired Air Force lieutenant general Thomas McInerney said in a video included in this January 9\u00a0Facebook post.", "The claim also appeared on Facebook here and here, on Twitter here, on YouTube here, and in online articles -- one of them from InfoWars, which was founded by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones -- here and here.", "The president\u2019s supporters disrupted the session of Congress in which lawmakers met to certify Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election. For months, Trump had repeatedly and falsely claimed that the vote was plagued by widespread fraud. He made those claims again in a speech in Washington shortly before the breach of the Capitol.", "Lawmakers later reconvened and voted to formally certify Biden\u2019s win, though several members of Congress continued to object to the decision. Facing mounting political pressure, Trump acknowledged that his presidency was ending and promised a smooth transition to the Democratic administration that will be led by Biden.", "AFP Fact Check has previously debunked claims that Antifa -- a structureless movement that says it is dedicated to fighting fascism online and in public -- stormed the Capitol.", "The claim that special forces took Pelosi\u2019s laptop is also unfounded.", "\u201cThere are no reports or information about anyone who is currently or was previously assigned to any USSOCOM organizations having anything to do with the theft of Speaker Pelosi\u2019s laptop or anything else that may be missing from the Capitol,\u201d a spokesman for the US Special Operations Command told AFP by email on January 12, 2021.", "A spokesman for the US Army Special Operations Command likewise said he had no information about the alleged incident.", "\u201cAs of this time, I have no knowledge of any of that,\u201d he said by phone on January 11.", "Asked about the laptop claim, Drew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, referred AFP to a January 8\u00a0tweet in which he wrote: \u201cA laptop from a conference room was stolen. It was a laptop that was only used for presentations.\u201d", "Some posts claimed that Pelosi\u2019s seized laptop was the source of a letter from the speaker to Portland, Oregon Mayor Ted Wheeler suggesting how to respond to \u201criots\u201d in the northwestern US city. But AFP Fact Check reported here that the letter is fake.", "After a long career in the Air Force, McInerney became a military analyst. But he was sharply criticized for saying on Fox Business Network in 2018 that torture \u201cworked\u201d on John McCain, the late senator for Arizona who was subjected to brutal treatment while held prisoner during the Vietnam War.", "McInerney was also frequently cited as the source in posts falsely saying that five US soldiers were killed during a raid in Germany targeting a CIA server farm. That claim was debunked by AFP Fact Check here.", "Video of McInerney\u2019s remarks shows that he attempted to link the alleged loss of the laptop to the push by Pelosi -- a regular target of false claims\u00a0-- to remove Trump from office.", "\u201cSo you\u2019d say, \u2018Well look, you only got 12 days or whatever it is \u2018till the 20th, why worry about it, just let him go out.\u2019 No, they are terrified, because they have that data,\u201d McInerney said.", "In reality, efforts to remove Trump are tied to his role in stoking the anger that led to deadly unrest at the Capitol.", "The House of Representatives was expected to vote late on January 12 on a bid to get Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet to invoke the US Constitution\u2019s 25th Amendment.", "Doing so would install Pence as acting president, but Trump is unlikely to be removed this way.", "Democrats will follow up the 25th Amendment vote with impeachment proceedings in the House the following day. The single charge of \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d is all but certain to get majority support.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
