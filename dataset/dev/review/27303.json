["By Rem Rieder", "Posted on July 15, 2020", "In July 14\u00a0remarks in the White House Rose Garden, President Donald Trump made a series of false, misleading and unsupported statements about the novel coronavirus and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s position on it.", "Trump, July 14: [Biden] opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus. He was totally against it. \u201cXenophobic,\u201d he called me. \u201cXenophobic.\u201d A month later, he admitted I was right.", "We would\u2019ve had thousands of people additionally die if we let people come in from heavily-infected China. But we stopped it; we did a travel ban in January. Nancy Pelosi was dancing on the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco a month later, and even later than that, and others too. They all thought what I did was a terrible mistake. \u2026", "And I was a crowd of one, because even experts didn\u2019t want to do it. They thought it was a mistake. \u2026 And we saved tens of thousands of lives, but we actually saved millions of lives by closing \u2014 by closing up, we saved millions, potentially millions of lives. Could be \u2014 a number that we\u2019re actually working on \u2014 but it could be 2- to 3 million lives. \u2026. But if we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional lives would have been lost.", "We\u2019ll examine the errors one by one.", "Not a \u201ctravel ban.\u201d First, as he repeatedly does, the president incorrectly describes the action that he took regarding travel from China, where the coronavirus was discovered last December. As we have previously reported, it wasn\u2019t a \u201ctravel ban.\u201d", "On Jan. 31, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced that certain non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the last two weeks would be barred from entering the United States. U.S. citizens and permanent residents and their immediate families were exempt from the restrictions.", "A\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story\u00a0on April 4 found that nearly 40,000 people had flown on direct flights from China to the United States in the two months after the travel restrictions went into effect on Feb. 2. So this was hardly a ban.", "Impact of travel restrictions. As he has before, Trump said that the travel restrictions \u201csaved tens of thousands of lives.\u201d But as we reported, there is no evidence to support this, and the White House has provided none.", "The few studies that have been done estimate travel restrictions the United States and other countries enacted on China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. Past studies also have found travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases, but do little to contain them.", "We found no study that looked only at the U.S. travel restrictions Trump instituted, and we found only one study, which wasn\u2019t peer-reviewed, on Australia, that found an impact on decreasing the number of deaths \u2014 but the study had a major limitation. It didn\u2019t consider any impact of cases coming to Australia from other countries besides China.", "As we\u2019ve written, it\u2019s possible the U.S. travel restrictions on China had some impact in slowing the importation of cases, but we don\u2019t have evidence of that, or of what the magnitude of the impact would be.", "Biden supported China travel restrictions. Trump charged without evidence or elaboration that if he had listened to Biden, \u201chundreds of thousands of additional lives would have been lost.\u201d We asked the White House what he was referring to, but it provided no response, nor did the Trump campaign.", "It seems likely the president was referring to the travel restrictions, since he said that Biden \u201copposed my very strict travel ban.\u201d In fact, Biden took no position on the China restrictions when they were implemented.", "On March 12, Biden tweeted:", "A wall will not stop the coronavirus.", "Banning all travel from Europe \u2014 or any other part of the world \u2014 will not stop it.", "This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet \u2014 and we need a plan to combat it.", "\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) March 13, 2020", "As we have written, Biden\u2019s campaign said on April 3 that Biden backed Trump\u2019s decision to impose travel restrictions on China.", "\u201cJoe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager,\u00a0told CNN. \u201cScience supported this ban, therefore he did too.\u201d", "Biden called Trump \u201cxenophobic.\u201d\u00a0Trump is right that Biden called him xenophobic. But Biden didn\u2019t make clear why he said that. The Biden campaign has said that was not in connection with the China travel restrictions.", "As we have written, on the day the White House announced the restrictions, Biden said at a\u00a0campaign event in Iowa\u00a0that as the pandemic unfolds, Americans \u201cneed to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria and xenophobia \u2013 hysterical xenophobia \u2013 and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.\u201d", "The Biden campaign\u00a0says\u00a0Biden\u2019s \u201creference to xenophobia was about Trump\u2019s long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China,\u201d and that he was not talking about the travel rules.", "HHS experts backed restrictions.\u00a0Trump is also incorrect, as we have written, when he says that when it came to the travel restrictions, \u201cI was a crowd of one, because even experts didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d", "HHS Secretary Azar told reporters on Feb. 7, \u201cThe travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental. These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.\u201d", "\u201cClosing up\u201d saved lives. We don\u2019t know whether Trump is on target when he says that the lockdowns imposed by many states may have saved \u201cmillions\u201d of lives. A study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley published on June 8 in the journal Nature found that lockdowns had prevented 60 million infections in the United States.", "The study didn\u2019t say how many lives were saved, but the lead researcher, Solomon Hsiang, did say the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect \u201cinfections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.\u201d A study by researchers at the Imperial College London estimated lockdowns saved about 3.1 million lives in 11 European countries.", "Columbia University researchers concluded that 36,000 fewer deaths from the coronavirus would have occurred if the U.S. had imposed social distancing one week earlier in March.", "Pelosi in Chinatown. Finally, Trump is wrong when he once again says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was \u201cdancing on the streets of Chinatown\u201d well after he imposed his travel restrictions. Trump has repeatedly falsely described Pelosi\u2019s trip to Chinatown.", "As we have\u00a0written, Pelosi traveled to Chinatown on Feb. 24 in an effort to bolster the neighborhood\u2019s restaurants and shops. Their business had fallen sharply in the wake of the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic, which as we said originated in China.", "The visit came three weeks before six Bay Area counties\u00a0implemented\u00a0shelter-in-place restrictions. On the day of Pelosi\u2019s visit, Trump\u00a0tweeted\u00a0this about the virus: \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d", "For a time Pelosi\u2019s visit became a staple in Trump\u2019s remarks. He variously described her as holding a \u201crally\u201d in Chinatown, having\u00a0or\u00a0wanting\u00a0to have\u00a0\u201cparties\u201d\u00a0or a\u00a0\u201cstreet party\u201d\u00a0there, and encouraging people to\u00a0go to a \u201cbig parade.\u201d In May, Trump shifted to\u00a0references to Pelosi \u201cdancing in the streets of San Francisco in Chinatown.\u201d None of these things ever happened. She was interviewed as she shopped.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising. We rely on grants and individual donations from people like you. Please consider a donation.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
