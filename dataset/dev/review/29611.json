Sherrod Brown when his Senate Appropriations Subcommittee held a hearing on the department's proposed budget for fiscal 2012.\n\nThe Ohio Democrat called for a national manufacturing strategy, which is the goal of a bipartisan bill he introduced this month with Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican.\n\nBut Brown also asked Commerce Secretary Gary Locke what the department is doing to attract foreign investment to the United States. Foreign companies \"tend to invest in manufacturing\" and to spend money on research and development, Brown said.\n\n\"Foreign companies in the United States have a significantly higher unionization rate than other companies overall,\" he added.\n\nThat caught PolitiFact Ohio by surprise.\n\nWe knew that union membership has declined significantly since the 1980s, but we also knew that the United Auto Workers has struggled to organize workers at foreign-owned factories, mainly in the South. None of the factories operated by foreign automakers in the region has union workers.\n\nBrown said he understood the surprise, given our auto-centric perspective, but assured us he could back up his statement.\n\nHe went a step further and provided specific numbers in a statement from his office: 12.4 percent of workers at foreign-owned U.S. subsidiaries are union employees while fewer than 7 percent of private-sector workers in the U.S. are union employees.\n\nIn support, Brown's staff referred us to the Organization for International Investment, a Washington-based business association representing U.S. operations of global companies. Its statistics, we confirmed, are drawn from publicly available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nTheir figures showed:", "In sum, U.S. employees of foreign-owned companies have a higher rate of union membership than the U.S. workforce as a whole, and a much higher rate than workers in the private sector.\n\nBrown's statement rates as True.", "CQ Congressional Transcripts, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science, and Related Agencies hearing on proposed fiscal 2012 appropriations for the Commerce Department, April 14, 2011\n\nDaily Finance, \"United Auto Workers Push to Unionize Foreign-Owned U.S. Auto Factories,\" Jan. 12 2011\n\nLos Angeles Times, \"Who wants a union?
