Raiding money from their pensions to fund the President\u2019s wasteful vanity project is outrageous. Our servicemembers deserve better,\" Harris said on March 8 on Twitter and Facebook.", "Is the Trump administration really planning to raid military pensions?", "FactCheck.org, along with some social media users who commented on Harris\u2019 posts, described her claim as misleading or wrong. We decided to fact-check her provocative statement ourselves.", "Background on Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration", "Democratic leaders have called Trump\u2019s emergency declaration a power grab, and some Republicans also said it sets a dangerous precedent.", "The move allows the president to transfer $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall, according to the White House. It also gives him the ability to tap $2.5 billion from drug interdiction programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund.", "Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement in February: \"The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.\"", "The House and Senate voted this month to block the declaration.

Does that constitute a cut? In my opinion, no.
