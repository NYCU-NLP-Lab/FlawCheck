It is expected that the suggested new names \u2014 which individuals can submit here \u2014 will be reviewed in the coming months with a final decision made by the board on April 19, 2021.", "The move comes after a \u201cblue-ribbon panel\u201d was formed in May 2018 to identify and provide a framework to change the names of schools named for \u201chistorical figures who engaged in the enslavement and subjugation of human beings,\u201d as well as those associated with the oppression of women, those whose actions led to genocide, and those who otherwise \u201csignificantly diminished the opportunities\u201d of individuals and their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.", "Forty-four schools across the 46 campuses are included in the panel\u2019s list, from early education schools to high schools.
