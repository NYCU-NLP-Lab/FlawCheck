Let\u2019s pop the hood.\n\nFirst, a bit of history.\n\nOver several decades, it\u2019s become much tougher for citizens in Wisconsin to sue and win when claiming negligence by their local units of government.\n\nHow much tougher?\n\nIn a 2009 Wisconsin Supreme Court opinion, Justice David Prosser, a former Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, said that \"so far as government responsibility for torts is concerned, immunity has become the rule and liability has become the rare exception.\"\n\n\"Justice,\" wrote Prosser, \"has been confined to a crawl space too narrow for most tort victims to fit.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, except in cases involving unheeded warnings over dangers involving actions they absolutely should have taken, public agencies are shielded from liability. That\u2019s because of state laws and court rulings.\n\nA notable and longstanding exception to that -- under a state \"highway defects\" law dating to 1849, a year after statehood -- allows up to $50,000 in civil damages when highways and sidewalks are poorly maintained and lead to vehicle damage or bodily injury.\n\nThe bill up for debate would eliminate nearly all of that statute. Local governments have sought this for years, hoping to avoid what they see as the \"automatic\" liability for defects, and get more discretion over when and how to do highway repairs -- as state officials have. Former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle vetoed a previous attempt.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s unique about the defective highways statute (893.83): Plaintiffs don\u2019t have to clear the high legal bar they would in winning a case against the government over other mistakes.\n\nThey don\u2019t have to show government had an absolute duty to do the specific thing in dispute -- that duty is presumed under that existing law.\n\nNotably, the law creates a \"right to recover\" damages from government.\n\nMany of the cases are routinely settled before getting to court -- that\u2019s how strong the law is.\n\nIf the cases reach trial, jurors have to decide if damages stemmed from known road defects -- and whether the municipality kept the highway \"reasonably safe for public travel,\" according to jury instructions in place since 1974.\n\n\"With winter conditions, it\u2019s awfully difficult to make sure highways are maintained every second, every hour of every day,\" said Andrew Phillips, a lawyer representing the Wisconsin Counties Association. Counties do most of the highway work.\n\nHe\u2019s talking about potholes and defective shoulders, among other things -- problems that have been litigated all the way to the state\u2019s highest courts.\n\nThe money stakes are not sky high, but significant: over a decade, counties served by Wisconsin County Mutual Insurance paid out $950,000 in these cases. That doesn\u2019t include all counties, or other municipalities.\n\nLet\u2019s turn back to the statement.\n\nAsked about its claims, the Association for Justice pointed us to the text of the bill.\n\nThe bill would eliminate the liability provisions except for damages resulting from the accumulation of snow or ice that has existed on a highway for at least three weeks. The chief backers of the bill, the Wisconsin Counties Association, acknowledge that.\n\nSo would that mean citizens could \"no longer sue\" and locals would not have a duty to repair, as the association claimed?\n\nThey couldn\u2019t sue under the highway defects statute -- but still could file a claim under a more general state law, according to Phillips, the lawyer for the counties group. Even Ann Jacobs, a personal injury lawyer speaking for the Association for Justice -- the group making the claim -- agreed.\n\nThe two sides also agree localities\u2019 legal exposure would drop if the more general state law (893.80) was the only route for plaintiffs.\n\nThe bottom line: People could still sue, though under less favorable circumstances from the complainant\u2019s viewpoint. The ultimate effect would be decided by judges.\n\nWhat about the second part of the claim? Would the bill eliminate the requirement that local governments repair roads?\n\nJacobs, of the trial lawyers\u2019 group, says it effectively does because enforcement of that duty would all but disappear without the specific liability statute.\n\n\"What good is a right without a remedy?\" Jacobs asked.\n\nEven the counties\u2019 attorney, Phillips, acknowledges that county decisions on when and how to repair highways would be more discretionary with the strict liability gone.\n\nThe Association for Justice, at a public hearing on the bill, made that point using this language: \"Local governments would not have a general duty to maintain highways and bridges\" if the bill passed.\n\nBut in its public news release, the group\u2019s claim went well past that -- leaving readers to believe road repairs would no longer be required.\n\nPhillips pointed us to Chapter 83.025 of state statutes: \"The county trunk system shall be marked and maintained by the county.\" And for towns, 82.03: \"The town board shall have the care and supervision of all highways under the town's jurisdiction.\"\n\nSo the locals still would have the obligation to repair.\n\nLet\u2019s patch this up and move on.\n\nA trial lawyers group contends that a bill would change a 162-year-old state law to \"make local governments' repair of roads, bridges and sidewalks no longer required by state law.\" It continued: \"Injured citizens could no longer sue them for bodily or auto damages.\"\n\nThe bill could have a big impact on local government liability for highway problems, though just how dramatic remains to be seen.\n\nBut the group\u2019s news release went too far in flatly claiming citizens could no longer sue, and asserting that highway repairs would no longer be required.\n\nWe rate this claim False.", "Wisconsin Association for Justice, press release, Oct. 31, 2011\n\nInterview with John Reinemann, lobbyist for Wisconsin Counties Association, Oct. 31, 2011\n\nInterview with Andrew Phillips, attorney representing Wisconsin Counties Association, Oct. 31, 2011\n\nInterview with Ann Jacobs, attorney, member of Wisconsin Association for Justice, Oct. 31, 2011\n\nInterview with Rep.
