Levels are elevated, even compared with the rest of China.\u201d", "The map indicates that 1351.65 \u00b5g/m3 of sulphur dioxide (SO2), a harmful gas most often emitted during fossil fuel combustion, was detected between February 10 and 17, 2020, in areas around Wuhan.", "The map was also shared alongside a similar claim\u00a0here, here, here and here on Twitter;\u00a0here, here, here and here on Facebook; and here on YouTube.", "It was shared alongside a similar claim\u00a0in other languages, such as here and here in Chinese, and here in Korean.", "Media reports featuring the purported map were also published here by MailOnline, the website for British newspaper The Daily Mail;\u00a0here by Malaysian newspaper China Press;\u00a0here by US newspaper The Epoch Times and here by US broadcaster New Tang Dynasty Television.", "The novel coronavirus epidemic has since killed at least 2,118 people and infected more than 74,000 others in China, AFP reported here on February 20.", "While the vast majority of deaths have been in Wuhan, claims that the map in the misleading posts shows elevated sulphur dioxide levels in the city is false.", "Windy.com, the animated weather forecast website where the map was created, said\u00a0the map represents a forecast based on NASA data.", "In an email to AFP on February 20, the website said: \u201cPlease note that Windy.com only visualizes a forecast of SO2, data for this prediction are obtained from NASA and their model NASA GEOS-5, that means Windy.com does not calculate any data on its own and further questions regarding model details about measurements should be directed to NASA only.
