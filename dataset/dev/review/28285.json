["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "(Mike De Sisti / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)", "In a Sept. 1, 2020 phone call with Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren, President Donald Trump urged Warren to reconsider the decision to push back the college football season because of the coronavirus pandemic", "Trump claims that his words and actions helped bring the season back.", "But several school leaders say the decision was made based on medical advice and increased availability of testing, not politics.", "Before President Donald Trump and several others close to him tested positive for coronavirus, there was the presidential debate.", "And in the debate, there was a claim \u2014 one that may have caused college athletes, parents, coaches and athletic conference leaders to scratch their heads.", "Amid a discussion on the economy at the Sept 29, 2020 debate in Cleveland, Trump said:", "\"I\u2019m the one who brought back football, by the way. I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I\u2019m very happy to do it.\"", "Even prior to the debate, more than 20 versions of an advertisement asserting that the president \"brought back\" college football were being shared on various Trump campaign Facebook pages in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and other Big Ten states \u2014 some of which are crucial for his reelection.", "The problem with that assertion is that Big Ten leaders don\u2019t seem to agree.", "Let\u2019s dig in.", "Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for backup for the president\u2019s claim, so we are left with what we know from past statements and media coverage of the matter.", "To be sure, Trump had been vocal with his opinion that college football should carry on as usual despite the coronavirus pandemic, and had been hard on the Big Ten for its initial decision to delay the start of the season.", "On Sept. 16, 2020, the day the conference announced it would return to fall football, Trump\u00a0 tweeted that it was his \"great honor to have helped\" and said on a Fox Sports Radio segment that the season was \"totally dead\" before he called Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren to discuss the matter.", "The president did speak with Warren on Sept. 1, 2020 and labeled the conversation \"productive,\" according to a Washington Post article posted that day.", "Various other reports said the league was offered federal assistance, presumably around testing of players and coaches, but those same reports in USA TODAY, the Washington Post and CBS Sports said the league had not requested and was not given any such assistance.", "Warren has said that the Big Ten itself will pay for the approximately 150,000 coronavirus tests needed to keep the season going from its planned Oct. 24, 2020 start through December.", "According to a Sept, 16, 2020 Washington Post article, conference officials and university leaders disputed Trump\u2019s claim, saying that medical advice and increased availability of rapid testing drove the decision to bring the season back, not politics.", "\"For me, it wasn\u2019t about political pressure,\" Northwestern University president Morton Schapiro told reporters on a Sept. 16, 2020 conference call. \"It wasn\u2019t about money. It wasn\u2019t about lawsuits. It wasn\u2019t about what everyone else is doing. It\u2019s about the unanimous opinion of our medical experts. That sort of evolved over the course of weeks.\"", "Added Ohio State team physician James Borchers, co-chair of the conference\u2019s Return to Competition Task Force medical subcommittee: \"Our ability to test consistently and uniformly amongst the conference and provide that was really important.\"", "Penn State athletic director Sandy Barbour said: \"If it was possible to get there safely, we were going to find a way. And that\u2019s what happened.\"", "According to a Sept 16, 2020 tweet from NBC White house correspondent Peter Alexander, a Big Ten university president told him that Trump\u2019s urgings did not impact the deliberations and that Trump\u2019s name came up in a negative light because \"no one wanted this to be political.\"", "Big Ten conference officials did not respond to our request for comment on the issue.", "Before we close, two notes about the way Trump phrased his claim.", "Big Ten football was never canceled. The initial decision \u2014 the one that was reversed \u2014 was to postpone the games until spring.", "Likewise, \"football\" was never canceled. Several major conferences \u2014 most notably the Big Ten and Pac 10 \u2014 had delayed seasons, but others including the SEC, ACC and Big 12 were already playing before the Big Ten decision came.", "So, in addition to inflating his role, Trump overstates the accomplishment he is boasting about.", "In the presidential debate, Trump claimed he \"brought back Big Ten football.\"", "But school and conference leaders jumped in to dispute that claim, saying that opportunities for continued rapid testing of players and other medical advice led them to undo their decision to play in the spring instead of the fall.", "It\u2019s clear that Trump urged the Big Ten to return this fall, but far less clear that his urging played into the final decision.", "We rate his claim Mostly False.", "Trump for Wisconsin Facebook advertisement, posted Sept. 24, 2020", "Washington Post, \"Trump tweets \u2018Play College Football!\u2019 as officials consider whether to cancel the season,\" Aug. 10, 2020", "CBS Sports, \"Big Ten cancels college football season for fall 2020, hopes to play in spring 2021,\" Aug. 11, 2020", "Tweet from President Donald Trump, Sept. 16, 2020", "Outkick, President Donald Trump joins Clay Travis to talk Big Ten football and more, accessed Oct. 4, 2020", "Washington Post, \"Trump speaks with Big Ten commissioner, pushes conference to play football this fall,\" Sept. 1, 2020", "USA TODAY, \"President Donald Trump, during debate, declares, 'I brought back Big Ten football,'\" Sept. 29, 2020", "Washington Post, \"Trump again says he \u2018brought back Big Ten football,\u2019 a claim disputed by many,\" Sept. 30, 2020", "CBS Sports, \"Big Ten neither requested nor received federal support in return to play 2020 college football season,\" Sept. 16, 2020", "Washington Post, \"After Big Ten changes course, schools say testing, not money or politics, made the difference,\" Sept. 16, 2020\nWashington Post, \"How and why the Big Ten decided to play football this fall,\" Sept. 16, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
