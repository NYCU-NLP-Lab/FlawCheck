["About this rating", "In February 2019, news websites in the United States and throughout the world reported that a relatively little-known English professor in the Pacific Northwest had \"branded\" Disney's classic children's film Mary Poppins as racist. The London Evening Standard, for exaple, reported:", "\"The classic family film 'Mary Poppins' has been branded racist by a US academic who accuses Dame Julie Andrews of 'blacking up' with soot while dancing with chimney sweeps. In a piece for the New York Times, Professor Daniel Pollack-Pelzner criticises one of the film's iconic moments, when Mary Poppins joins Dick Van Dyke's Bert to dance on a rooftop for the classic song 'Step in Time.'\"", "Similarly, the UK-based Metro news website wrote:", "\"Classic Disney film Mary Poppins has been branded \u2018racist\u2019 by a university professor who believes the scene with Mary and Bert dancing with the chimney sweeps features blackface. In the 1964 film, Mary and Bert take Jane and Michael on an all-singing and dancing tour of London with Bert\u2019s pals that begins with them flying up through the chimney. Famously, they become covered in soot and in a now infamous scene, Mary attempts to wipe it off only to discover that she has made it worse, and so owns the soot and adds more to her nose and cheeks. However Professor Daniel Pollack-Pelzner, an English and gender studies professor at Oregon\u2019s Linfield College, has now suggested that the scene in question is a reference to the original PL Travers books which associated chimney sweeps\u2019 blackened faces with racial caricatures.\"", "That characterization of the much-loved movie prompted a bemused and even outraged response from some commentators, as well as enquiries from Snopes readers about the authenticity of Pollack-Pelzner's opinion column. One reader asked, \"Is this real or satire? It feels crazy to me ...\" while another wrote, \"Please tell me it's a hoax!\"", "The opinion piece was indeed written by a professor of English literature at Linfield College, a small private college in McMinnville, Oregon.  Pollack-Pelzner's controversial column was published in the New York Times on 28 January 2019 and was a straightforward effort (i.e., not intended to be satirical or humorous).", "In that column, Pollack-Pelzner pointed to the thread of questionable racial imagery and stereotypes that run through the series of Mary Poppins books authored by Pamela Lyndon Travers and the classic 1964 film version, arguing that traces of that troubling material are echoed in the 2018 film sequel Mary Poppins Returns:", "\"Mary Poppins Returns,\" which picked up four Oscar nominations, is an enjoyably derivative film that seeks to inspire our nostalgia for the innocent fantasies of childhood, as well as the jolly holidays that the first \u201cMary Poppins\u201d film conjured for many adult viewers. Part of the new film\u2019s nostalgia, however, is bound up in a blackface performance tradition that persists throughout the Mary Poppins canon, from P. L. Travers\u2019s books to Disney\u2019s 1964 adaptation, with disturbing echoes in the studio\u2019s newest take on the material, 'Mary Poppins Returns.'", "One of the more indelible images from the 1964 film is of Mary Poppins blacking up. When the magical nanny (played by Julie Andrews) accompanies her young charges, Michael and Jane Banks, up their chimney, her face gets covered in soot, but instead of wiping it off, she gamely powders her nose and cheeks even blacker. Then she leads the children on a dancing exploration of London rooftops with Dick Van Dyke\u2019s sooty chimney sweep, Bert.", "This might seem like an innocuous comic scene if Travers\u2019s novels didn\u2019t associate chimney sweeps\u2019 blackened faces with racial caricature. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, you black heathen,\u201d a housemaid screams in \u201cMary Poppins Opens the Door\u201d (1943), as a sweep reaches out his darkened hand. When he tries to approach the cook, she threatens to quit: \u201cIf that Hottentot goes into the chimney, I shall go out the door,\u201d she says, using an archaic slur for black South Africans that recurs on page and screen.", "The 1964 film replays this racial panic in a farcical key. When the dark figures of the chimney sweeps step in time on a roof, a naval buffoon, Admiral Boom, shouts, \u201cWe\u2019re being attacked by Hottentots!\u201d and orders his cannon to be fired at the \u201ccheeky devils\" [see below]. We\u2019re in on the joke, such as it is: These aren\u2019t really black Africans; they\u2019re grinning white dancers in blackface. It\u2019s a parody of black menace; it\u2019s even posted on a white nationalist website as evidence of the film\u2019s racial hierarchy. And it\u2019s not only fools like the Admiral who invoke this language. In the 1952 novel \u201cMary Poppins in the Park,\u201d the nanny herself tells an upset young Michael, \u201cI understand that you\u2019re behaving like a Hottentot.\u201d", "Pollack-Pelzner, who studied history and English at Yale and Harvard, is an academic expert in Shakespearean adaptations but has also contributed cultural criticism and theater reviews for major publications including the New Yorker and the Atlantic Monthly.", "McShane, Asher. \u00a0 \"Mary Poppins Branded Racist by US Academic Over Scene Where She Gets Covered in Soot.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Evening Standard. \u00a0 5 February 2019.", "Lewis, Rebecca. \u00a0 \"Disney's Mary Poppins Branded 'Racist' as Chimney Sweep Scene Is 'Blackface.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Metro. \u00a0 3 February 2019.", "RT. \u00a0 \"NYT Flirts with Irrelevancy After Publishing Mary Poppins\u00a0Blackface Exclusive.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 30 January 2019.", "Fox News Insider. \u00a0 \"'Absolute Garbage': Webb Blasts NYT Piece That Claimed 'Mary Poppins' Scene Is Racist.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 5 February 2019.", "Lockett, Jon. \u00a0 \"'Flirting With Blackface': Mary Poppins Branded Racist by Ridiculous US Boffin Who Says She 'Blacked Up' with Soot on Face.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Sun. \u00a0 3 February 2019.", "Pollack-Pelzner, Daniel. \u00a0 \"'Mary Poppins,'and a Nanny's Shameful Flirting with Blackface.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 28 January 2019.", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
