["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on March 20, 2020", "After President Donald Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about\u201d the disbanding of a White House pandemic response office, the Democrats claimed that he \u201clied\u201d and pointed to Trump\u2019s earlier remarks about \u201csome of the people we cut\u201d as evidence. But those remarks were in response to a question about proposed budget cuts \u2014 not the anti-pandemic team in question.", "Several Democrats have criticized the Trump administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak by pointing to the dissolving of a team within the White House\u2019s National Security Council dedicated to coordinating a response to a pandemic. As we\u2019ve written before, in 2018, the administration did eliminate a key position that would have been involved in such a response \u2014 the senior director of the NSC\u2019s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense. But that doesn\u2019t mean the responsibilities of that office were eliminated.", "Administration officials have described a reorganization or streamlining of the NSC. An NSC spokesman told the Washington Post in May 2018 that the administration \u201cwill continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure.\u201d", "Some still have been critical of the elimination of the post or a separate global health team. For instance, the Center for Strategic & International Studies recommended in a November 2019\u00a0report restoring the position on the NSC as one of seven key changes to better protect the American public from global health threats.", "In a March 13 press conference, the president was asked \u201cwhat responsibility do you take\u201d for the \u201cdisband[ing]\u201d of the White House pandemic office, and he responded that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d", "\u201cAnd when you say \u2018me,\u2019 I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d the president said. \u201cI could ask perhaps \u2014 my administration \u2014 but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don\u2019t know anything about it. I mean, you say \u2014 you say we did that. I don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d", "(Trump\u2019s mention of \u201cTony\u201d was a reference to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.)", "The reporter made clear she was talking about \u201cthe reorganization that happened at the National Security Council,\u201d and Trump added: \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2014 it\u2019s the administration. Perhaps they do that. You know, people let people go.\u201d", "The next day, March 14, the Democratic National Committee tweeted: \u201cYesterday, Trump said he didn\u2019t disband the government\u2019s pandemic response team. He lied. Here he is earlier this year defending doing just that.\u201d", "The accompanying video showed Trump saying: \u201cSome of the people we cut, they haven\u2019t been used for many, many years. And if \u2014 if we ever need them, we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money \u2014 and I\u2019m a business person \u2014 I don\u2019t like having thousands of people around when you don\u2019t need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly.\u201d", "But those remarks came in a Feb. 26 press conference after Trump was asked about his proposed budget cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization.", "Reporter, Feb. 26: Your budgets have consistently called for enormous cuts to the CDC, the NIH, and the WHO. You\u2019ve talked a lot today about how these professionals are excellent, have been critical and necessary. Does this experience at all give you pause about those consistent cuts?", "Trump: No, because we \u2014 we can get money and we can increase staff. We know all the people. We know all the good people. It\u2019s a question I asked the doctors before. Some of the people we cut, they haven\u2019t been used for many, many years. And if \u2014 if we ever need them, we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money \u2014 and I\u2019m a business person \u2014 I don\u2019t like having thousands of people around when you don\u2019t need them.", "When we need them, we can get them back very quickly. For instance, we\u2019re bringing some people in tomorrow that are already in this, you know, great government that we have, and very specifically for this. We can build up very, very quickly. And we\u2019ve already done that. I mean, we really have built up. We have a great staff.", "Trump doesn\u2019t say to whom he\u2019s referring in talking about staffing cuts, but the question was about his proposed budget cuts, not the National Security Council global health security team. The NSC was not mentioned in the reporter\u2019s question or Trump\u2019s answer.", "As we\u2019ve said before, Trump has consistently proposed budgets that would cut funding for the CDC and NIH, but Congress hasn\u2019t enacted those proposals. The CDC\u2019s staff has decreased by 591 positions, or 5.4%, from December 2016 through March 2019, the most recent data available from the Office of Personnel Management.", "Daniel Wessel, a spokesperson for the DNC, told us that Trump didn\u2019t answer the question that was asked and was likely talking about the NSC issue, which had been in the news that day.", "\u201cTrump was not answering the question that he was asked, so we should not be held to the standard of what the question was,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cTrump\u2019s response on the day that headlines were breaking about the decision by his NSC to cut the pandemic response team was just as likely (probably more likely) about the pandemic response team than anything else.\u201d", "Wessel added that the point of whether Trump \u201clied \u2026 is moot,\u201d saying there have been several news stories \u201cthat showed Trump\u2019s administration and NSC led by John Bolton did indeed dismantle the pandemic response team in the spring of 2018.\u201d", "Zach Parkinson, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, told us: \u201cAs the full video makes clear, at no point in this exchange was the National Security Council or the Global Health Security Directorate team mentioned. The President was specifically asked about his proposed budgets, not any personnel reorganization or actions.\u201d", "Parkinson also said the claim that the NSC team was eliminated is \u201cfalse,\u201d saying, \u201cformer and current National Security Council officials have repeatedly said the team working on biodefense is still at the NSC.\u201d", "Others on Twitter, including celebrities and journalists, have retweeted a March 17 article by the Independent, a U.K. publication, that also linked Trump\u2019s Feb. 26 remarks to the NSC issue. The Democratic group Protect Our Care pointed to that article and wrongly said Trump made these comments \u201cin 2018.\u201d", "The Atlantic, also citing the Independent story, initially said the president\u2019s remarks were from 2018 but later corrected that.", "The Independent story didn\u2019t say the video was from two years ago but may have left that impression. \u201cA video has emerged of Donald Trump talking about cutting the US pandemic response team in 2018,\u201d it said. The date pertains to the cutting, not the video, which is merely a few weeks old.", "As we explained in a March 3 story, the administration did eliminate a key position at the NSC but that doesn\u2019t mean the entire \u201cteam\u201d was \u201cfired,\u201d as then-Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg said, or that all of the functions of the office were eliminated.", "The\u00a0Washington Post reported in May 2018 that then-National Security Adviser John Bolton dissolved the NSC\u2019s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense in a reorganization effort. Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer left his post as senior director of that office and wasn\u2019t replaced.", "President Barack Obama had created the NSC unit in 2016 after the yearslong Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Trump appointed Ziemer as senior director\u00a0in\u00a0April 2017, but Ziemer left about a year later. He now serves\u00a0as senior deputy assistant administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance at USAID.", "The Post said this was part of a \u201creorganization\u201d by Bolton and quoted an NSC spokesman as saying \u201cglobal health, global health security and biodefense\u201d would be addressed \u201cunder the new structure.\u201d The\u00a0Atlantic also reported at the time that some team members were shifted to other groups, and others took over some of Ziemer\u2019s duties.", "Tom Bossert, a former White House homeland security adviser who helped\u00a0develop the Trump administration\u2019s biodefense strategy and was the\u00a0designated lead\u00a0for coordinating the American response to a biological crisis, was also\u00a0reportedly\u00a0pushed out of the NSC when Bolton took over. Bossert\u00a0resigned\u00a0in April 2018, a day after Bolton started as national security adviser.", "Bossert was replaced with a series of people, but when Trump announced his coronavirus task force on Jan. 29, he did not name current homeland security adviser Julia Nesheiwat in any capacity.", "Bolton, as well as Tim Morrison, former senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense for the NSC, also have described the moves as a restructuring or consolidation. What was the Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense became part of the directorate on counterproliferation and biodefense.", "Morrison objected to claims that the office was \u201cdissolved,\u201d writing in the Post on March 16 that the administration \u201ccreate[d] the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate, which was the result of consolidating three directorates into one, given the obvious overlap between arms control and nonproliferation, weapons of mass destruction terrorism, and global health and biodefense. It is this reorganization that critics have misconstrued or intentionally misrepresented.\u201d", "Morrison led that directorate for a year, he wrote, before leaving that position. Another official replaced him, he said. The administration has decreased staffing at the NSC, something Morrison said was needed after \u201cbloat\u201d under the previous administration.", "We didn\u2019t get a statement from the White House when we asked about the NSC issue, but the Washington Post Fact Checker did. NSC spokesman John Ullyot told the Post: \u201cNo director-level positions were eliminated during this process, and the organization retained its subject matter expertise under a different organizational structure.\u201d", "Some have said the NSC needs a separate global health security point person or team \u2014 as the Center for Strategic & International Studies recommended. That\u2019s a matter of opinion, and we take no position on that.", "Three days before Morrison\u2019s op-ed, Beth Cameron, former senior director for the old NSC team \u2014 the global health security and biodefense office \u2014 wrote in the Post that disbanding that directorate \u201cleft an unclear structure and strategy for coordinating pandemic preparedness and response.\u201d", "Democratic senators had questioned the move at the time, as well as former government officials.", "Kenneth W. Bernard, who served in both former President Bill Clinton\u2019s and President George W. Bush\u2019s administrations, wrote in 2018 that this was the third time that an administration had \u201cdowngraded the importance of disease and bioterrorism threats in the hierarchy of national security issues.\u201d Bernard said he worked in such a post in 1998 but the Bush administration abolished it in 2001, then reopened it a year later after 9/11 and the 2001 anthrax attacks. He said Obama abolished it again after his election, but in his second term created the NSC office.", "Bolton responded to the recent criticism on Twitter on March 14, saying: \u201cClaims that streamlining NSC structures impaired our nation\u2019s bio defense are false. Global health remained a top NSC priority, and its expert team was critical to effectively handling the 2018-19 Africa Ebola crisis.\u201d", "Democratic Rep. Gerald Connolly and Republican Rep. Steve Chabot have introduced a bill that would require that the president create a global health security interagency council and \u201cappoint an employee of the National Security Council, serving at the senior director level or higher, to serve as Chair for the Council.\u201d", "Connolly asked Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a March 11 hearing whether it was a \u201cmistake\u201d to \u201cdismantle\u201d the office in the NSC devoted to global health and security. Fauci responded: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily characterize it as a mistake. I would say we worked very well with that office. It would be nice if the office was still there.\u201d", "We take no position on whether it was a mistake or not to eliminate the global health security post or restructure the NSC team.\u00a0But it\u2019s wrong for Democrats to cite Trump\u2019s remarks about \u201csome of the people we cut\u201d as proof that he \u201clied\u201d about not knowing what happened to the NSC team.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
