["By Rem Rieder", "Posted on June 10, 2020", "President Donald Trump falsely claimed, \u201cTijuana is the most heavily infected place anywhere in the world, as far as the plague is concerned,\u201d referring to the novel coronavirus.", "Trump made the inaccurate statement in remarks June 5 at a roundtable on supporting America\u2019s fishermen in Bangor, Maine.", "You don\u2019t have to look very far from the Mexican city to find a place with a much higher infection rate: the city of San Diego, California, right across the border.", "Tijuana has had 2,335 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to the latest statistics from the Baja California secretary of health. Mexico\u00a0estimates Tijuana\u2019s 2020 population at\u00a01,789,531 \u2013 which would result in an infection rate of 130.5 per 100,000 people. It currently has just 69 active cases.", "San Diego has had 3,880 COVID-19 cases and a rate of 273.3 cases per 100,000 through June 8, according to the county website. That\u2019s twice as high as Tijuana\u2019s rate.", "At the same time, though, COVID-19 has been much deadlier in Tijuana. The city has experienced 643 deaths, while all of San Diego County, which includes the city, has had 301.", "San Diego is hardly the only place with more infection than Tijuana.", "For example, the District of Columbia, home of the White House and the Trump International Hotel, has about half of Tijuana\u2019s population. Yet, according to Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Coronavirus Resource Center, the nation\u2019s capital, as of June 10, has had 9,474 cases of COVID-19, or 1,348.7 cases per 100,000 residents \u2014 a rate that is about 10 times higher than the Mexican city.", "And the numbers are far more dramatic in such big-city disease hotspots as Cook County, Illinois, Chicago\u2019s county, whose population of about 5.15 million has suffered 83,271 cases, and Los Angeles County, population about 10 million, with 65,945 cases.", "Queens County, New York, where Trump grew up, has had 62,466 cases for a rate of 2,741 cases per 100,000 \u2014 21 times Tijuana\u2019s rate, according to Johns Hopkins.", "And Palm Beach, Florida, home of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort, also has a far higher per capita rate than Tijuana. As of June 10, it has had 7,518 cases or 505.9 cases per 100,000 \u2013 nearly four times Tijuana\u2019s rate.", "Baja California Gov. Jaime Bonilla fired back at Trump\u2019s off-base shot at Tijuana. \u201cMr. Trump sees the straw in someone else\u2019s eye but does not see the beam in his own \u2014 instead of looking at the other side of the fence to see what is wrong, first take a look within your own house,\u201d Bonilla said.", "But Tijuana Mayor Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez said he felt Trump\u2019s pain.", "\u201cThe statements made by @realDonaldTrump are understandable, I don\u2019t judge it,\u201d the mayor tweeted. \u201cIn the country with the most Covid 19 deaths in the world, protests in more than 50 cities and elections on the doorstep, it is understandable that he has to distract attention from something or someone and it was our turn #Tijuana.\u201d", "Trump has mentioned Tijuana and the coronavirus before in connection with his campaign to build a wall to improve security along the Mexican border.", "Trump, May 5: And in Tijuana, right along the border, they have a tremendous outbreak. And we have just completed 172 miles of wall. And it\u2019s real wall, not the kind you were having built over the years that were sort of scoffed at, right?", "He sounded a similar note three weeks later.", "Trump, May 28: Mexico is having a very, very hard time, as you know, with COVID, especially along the border \u2026 with Tijuana and various places along the border. And fortunately, we have brand-new wall along there, and the wall is saving us.", "While Trump was wrong about Tijuana\u2019s numbers, there is no doubt Mexico, as so much of the world, has been hit hard by COVID-19. But not as badly as the United States.", "According to data from Johns Hopkins University as of June 10, Mexico has 124,301 cases and 14,649 deaths. There have been 1,973,230 cases and 111,694 deaths in the U.S. The U.S. has a death rate (34.14 deaths per 100,000 people) that is nearly three times Mexico\u2019s (11.61 deaths per 100,000).", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
