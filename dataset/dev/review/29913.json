Among them is D. Cole Phelps, an attorney running for state Senate in northeastern North Carolina\u2019s District 1 against Republican state Rep. Bob Steinburg.", "On Labor Day, Phelps claimed in a Facebook post that health care premiums in North Carolina are among the most expensive in the country.", "\"Health care premiums in North Carolina are now among the five highest states in the country \u2014 and rural health care is struggling,\"\u00a0Phelps posted on Sept. 1. \"Our opponent is protecting insurance company profits \u2014 not his constituents.

PolitiFact reached out to Phelps for the source of his information.", "To support his claim, Phelps cited a recent\u00a0WalletHub story, \"The Best and Worst States for Healthcare.\" WalletHub, which looked at all 50 states and Washington, D.C., ranked North Carolina\u2019s health care system 47th for overall care. The Tar Heel State ranked 45th for average monthly insurance premiums.", "But there\u2019s a key piece of information that\u2019s buried in the WalletHub story and that Phelps doesn\u2019t mention in his Facebook post: WalletHub only looked at health care plans through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.", "It didn\u2019t take into account premiums for insurance plans acquired through employers.", "More than 55 percent of Americans have employer-based health insurance plans, according to 2016 estimates by the\u00a0U.S. Census Bureau. In North Carolina, employer-based plans covered\u00a052 percent of all non-Medicare recipients during 2016, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health analysis organization.", "So, with that in mind, we wondered whether North Carolinians are paying some of the highest premiums for health insurance plans across the board. Here\u2019s what we found for both customers in the ACA markets as well as on employer-sponsored plans.", "True, for ACA premiums", "When it comes to premiums for people with plans through the Affordable Care Act, Kaiser found that North Carolina had the\u00a0seventh-highest average benchmark premiums in 2018. In 2017, NC had the\u00a0second-highest. More than 478,000 people\u00a0enrolled in such plans in 2018, KFF reports.", "However, the average benchmark isn\u2019t an accurate reflection of what most customers pay, said Craig Palosky, KFF communications director.", "Though the benchmark shows the full sticker price, it\u2019s \"not what people who get tax credits would end up paying,\" Palosky said. \" The distinction is important because the vast majority of marketplace customers do get tax credits \u2013 87 percent nationally and 94 percent in North Carolina.\"", "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, known as\u00a0CMS, is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

North Carolina\u2019s silver and gold ACA plans were both the fifth-most expensive in the country, he said.", "\"We\u2019ve found that competition is a large driver associated with lower premiums. NC hasn\u2019t had as robust competition as other states,\" Wengle said.", "Blue Cross Blue Shield is the only insurer to offer ACA plans\u00a0in all 100 NC counties, while Cigna offers plans in Wake, Johnston, Orange, Chatham and Nash counties. Another insurer, Centene, is\u00a0expected to enter the Wake and Durham markets\u00a0next year.", "Not true for employer-based insurance", "While North Carolina\u2019s government-subsidized plans are on the expensive side, PolitiFact couldn\u2019t find any evidence that NC\u2019s non-ACA premiums are among the highest in the country.", "Kaiser examines employer insurance data from the\u00a0Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which collects data from insurance providers and is part of the U.S\u00a0Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.", "KFF statistics from 2016 (the most recent year available) show that the average annual premium for a\u00a0single employee was $5,717\u00a0\u2014 one of the lowest averages in the country. Add a \"plus one\" (spouse or child) to the employee\u2019s coverage, and North Carolina still had\u00a0one of the lowest average premiums\u00a0in the U.S.", "Meanwhile, KFF found that premiums for employer-based family plans in NC were\u00a0middle-of-the-road.", "Statistics from the\u00a02017 MEPS\u00a0show that the average employer-plan premium for an employee in North Carolina is slightly below the national average.

Going by the latest\u00a0Census estimates, that\u2019s only 5 percent of North Carolina\u2019s population.", "Our ruling", "Phelps said health insurance premiums in North Carolina \"are now among the five highest states in the country.\" He has a point when it comes to premiums for ACA plans. Those plans, however, only affect a fraction of North Carolina\u2019s population. Millions of North Carolinians have plans on the private market, and data show that private plans in NC aren\u2019t among the most expensive in the country.
