One fire in particular, dubbed the Carr Fire, was among the most destructive in the state's history, killing six people and forcing tens of thousands of residents out of their homes.", "Amidst that inferno, residents of Shasta County, near the northern California city of Redding, gathered to provide comfort and assistance to others affected by the fire. Celebrity chef Guy Fieri, who lived around 160 miles south of Redding in Santa Rosa, joined them, helping the Salvation Army provide food for displaced residents.", "Fieri's involvement was the subject of some enthusiasm and speculation on social media, with one particularly viral tweet comparing the Food Network star to Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and asserting that Fieri had fed some 5,000 people:", "Another Twitter user responded with a claim about Fieri similarly intended to speak well of him: \"He became an ordained minister to officiate like 500 gay weddings he catered together on one day to honour his deceased sister ...\"", "'Feeding 5,000 Wildfire Evacuees'", "Fieri did volunteer his time and expertise in Redding County on 29 and 30 July 2018, helping the Salvation Army to feed more than a thousand evacuees from the Carr Fire.
