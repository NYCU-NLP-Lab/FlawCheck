["By Robert Farley", "Posted on January 16, 2020", "President Donald Trump used a truncated quote from Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer to falsely suggest that Steyer thinks \u201cDemocrats are going to destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control.\u201d That was Steyer paraphrasing what he says Trump\u2019s false line of attack will be in the general election.", "Trump seized on the out-of-context quote in a tweet sent out just a couple hours after the completion of the Democratic debate in Iowa on Jan. 14.", "I agree with him on this, 100%. But why would anyone vote Democrat? We are setting all time records with the economy! https://t.co/trTemE8iUz", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2020", "Trump referred to another tweet from Sarah Dolan Schneider, executive director of America Rising, a Republican super PAC that was founded \u201cfor the sole purpose of exposing the truth about Democrats through video tracking, research, and strategic communications.\u201d Her tweet included a video clip of Steyer, a former hedge fund manager, at the Democratic debate saying only, \u201cDemocrats are going to destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control.\u201d She commented, \u201cTRUE.\u201d", "Shortly after Trump posted his tweet, Steyer responded via Twitter, \u201cRead the transcript. It\u2019s actually perfect. I said you\u2019re a fraud and a failure \u2014 and I\u2019ll expose you. Now go to bed.\u201d", "The transcript of Steyer\u2019s comments at the debate makes clear how grossly the quote has been pulled out of context.", "Steyer, Jan. 14: Look, we know how Donald Trump is going to run for president. He\u2019s going to run on the economy. He\u2019s already told Americans last month in Florida, \u201cYou don\u2019t like me and I don\u2019t like you, but you\u2019re all going to vote for me because the Democrats are going to destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control.\u201d", "So let\u2019s be clear. I started a business by myself in one room. I didn\u2019t inherit a penny from my parents. I spent 30 years building that business into a multi-billion-dollar international business. Then I walked away from it and took the giving pledge and started organizing coalitions of ordinary Americans to take on unchecked corporate power.", "But whoever is going to beat Mr. Trump is going to have to beat him on the economy. And I have the experience and the expertise to show that he\u2019s a fake there and a fraud. \u2026 I can beat Trump on the economy. We\u2019re going to have to beat him on the economy. And I look forward to taking him down in the fall on the debate stage.", "In his comments about Democrats and the economy, Steyer was paraphrasing what Trump told a crowd at the Israeli American Council National Summit in Florida on Dec. 7.", "Trump, Dec. 7: A lot of you are in the real estate business, because I know you very well. You\u2019re brutal killers, not nice people at all. But you have to vote for me. You have no choice. You\u2019re not going to vote for Pocahontas [Trump\u2019s derogatory nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren], I can tell you that. You\u2019re not going to vote for the wealth tax. Yeah, let\u2019s take 100 percent of your wealth away. No, no, even if you don\u2019t like me, some of you don\u2019t, some of you I don\u2019t like at all, actually. And you\u2019re going to be my biggest supporters, because you\u2019ll be out of business in about 15 minutes if they [one of the Democratic presidential candidates] get in.", "In other words, Trump, who said in his tweet \u201cI agree\u201d with Steyer, was actually agreeing with his own comments made in Florida a month prior. Those comments do not reflect Steyer\u2019s position.", "The video featuring Steyer\u2019s shortened, out-of-context quote may have been intended as a joke, but it has been viewed 2.4 million times \u2014 at least in part due to a misleading boost from the president. There\u2019s no way to know how many of those viewers took the video seriously.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
