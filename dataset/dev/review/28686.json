If we think of fascism as a wound from the past that had almost healed, Trump in the White House was like ripping off the bandage and picking at the scab.\"", "Albright went on to describe\u00a0the rise of Benito Mussolini, Italy\u2019s fascist leader in the early 20th century. She wrote that Mussolini used the phrase \"drain the swamp\" when he made moves to overhaul the country\u2019s unpopular government bureaucracy.", "\"He knew that citizens were fed up with a bureaucracy that seemed to grow bigger and less efficient each year, so he insisted on daily roll calls in ministry offices and berated employees for arriving late to work or taking long lunches.", "\"He initiated a campaign to 'drenare la palude' ('drain the swamp') by firing more than 35,000 civil servants,\" Albright wrote.", "A PolitiFact reader was struck by this linguistic link\u00a0and wondered whether the Italian fascist leader had really been the source of Trump's famous phrase.\u00a0So we asked U.S. and Italian historians about it.", "We found that Mussolini\u2019s government made a big point of draining literal swamps, as public works projects, and he did conduct mass firings\u00a0of civil servants.\u00a0In addition, Mussolini touted the metaphor of purification as a defining principle of his political philosophy.", "\"We can understand fascism's social, agricultural, and racial policies through the concept of \u2018reclamation\u2019 \u2014 draining or cleansing something to regenerate or remake it,\" said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University and author of Fascist Modernities: Italy, 1922-1945.", "However, Mussolini does not seem to have used the Italian version of Trump\u2019s \"drain the swamp\" term.
