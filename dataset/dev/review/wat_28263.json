["About this rating", "On 27 September 2017, Wired magazine reported that Jared Kushner, United States President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and one of his senior advisors, has been registered to vote in New York as a woman:", "According to the records held by the New York State Board of Elections, Jared Corey Kushner is a woman.", "Is Kushner a woman? Did he just accidentally fill out the form incorrectly? Is he the victim of a malicious voter impersonation scheme? Unfortunately, there's absolutely no way to know for sure, because he has yet to provide WIRED with a comment. But based on his recent history with paperwork, option two seems like a pretty safe bet.", "The story went viral, in part because Kushner has a long history of allegedly misfiling forms, most infamously his national security questionnaires \u2014 which have, at various times, omitted numerous foreign contacts and which at one point listed some graduation dates and his own father-in-law\u2019s address incorrectly.", "Wired\u2019s information came from liberal opposition research group American Bridge, who used a third-party information source separate from the New York voter registration system to uncover the information about his voter registration status. Later reporting from the New York Daily News, however, quoted members of the New York City Board of Elections who said the blame was theirs \u2014 a data entry issue that likely stemmed from his gender being listed as \"unknown\" in earlier New Jersey registration rolls prior to filing in New York:", "The Nexis data cited by Wired is from 2009. In a New Jersey voter registration before 2009, Kushner's gender was listed as \"unknown.\"", "Board of Elections Executive Director Michael Ryan confirmed that this was an error on the board\u2019s part. He said it was \u201cimpossible to go back in time\u201d and figure out how the mistake happened, but he suspected Kushner\u2019s ambiguous New Jersey registration led to the mixup.", "Wired is correct that, during the time period in which Kushner was voting in New York and up until this week, his gender was officially entered into the New York City voter roll database system as \"female\". This mix-up, which was corrected internally after the story came out, cannot be blamed on Kushner\u2019s own inability to fill out his New York voter registration correctly; New York Daily News obtained Kushner\u2019s\u00a0 2011 New York City voter registration form, which clearly shows he checked off the box marked \u201cmale\u201d:", "We have reached out to the New York City Board of Elections to verify if the Daily News reporting is accurate, and will update this page if anything comes to light that changes that view.\u00a0 However, as the executive director of the New York City Board of Elections is on record as saying the mix up was a data-entry issue and not a filing issue, we rank the claim that Jared Kushner registered to vote as a female in New York as false.", "Feinberg, Ashley. \u00a0 \"Jared Kushner Voted as a Woman, According to His Registration.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Wired. \u00a0 27 September 2017.", "Chason, Rachel. \u00a0 \"A Database Error May Be Why Jared Kushner Is Registered to Vote as a Woman.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Washington Post. \u00a0 28 September 2017.", "Silverstein, Jason. \u00a0 \"Jared Kushner Actually Is Registered to Vote as a Male, Despite Database Error Saying Otherwise.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Daily News. \u00a0 28 September 2017.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
