Also, some doctors have explained to me the man appeared uninjured at the beginning of the video, but that isn't the case as he could have\u00a0internal infections.\n\n\t\"Based on that, first of all,\u00a0I\u00a0am here to take back\u00a0what I said unconditionally, and apologise for misleading you. This is unconditional.\n\n\t\"On the other hand, I've never been in favour of revenge. Whoever did that\u00a0should be punished by the law. They have also severely dampened the spirits of the protests as well as\u00a0the whole movement.\u00a0\n\n\t\"I'm not trying to defend myself but of course the same applies to those who stabbed\u00a0pro-democracy protesters,\u00a0causing their intestines to spill on the ground.
