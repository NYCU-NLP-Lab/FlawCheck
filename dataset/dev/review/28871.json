["About this rating", "In 1991, Joe Biden became an adjunct professor at Widener University Delaware Law School and taught occasional courses on constitutional law for approximately 20 years.", "However, Biden was not a full-time constitutional law professor.", "Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.", "On Oct. 15, 2020, Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden took questions during a town hall event aired on ABC News. At one point, Biden was asked by an audience member about the Supreme Court and the possible erosion of LGBTQ rights. As Biden answered, he mentioned something about his life that many viewers apparently found surprising: Biden said that he taught constitutional law for 21 years.", "Biden, who received a law degree from Syracuse University in 1968, served as an adjunct professor at Widener University Delaware Law School, where he taught constitutional law classes for approximately 20 years. Biden was not, however, a full-time professor, which some viewers may have assumed from the former vice president's comments about \"teaching constitutional law for 21 years.\"", "A screenshot of Biden's faculty member page that was archived from Widener University Delaware Law School's website in 2008 shows that the former vice president started as an adjunct professor in 1991.", "While Biden truly taught classes on constitutional law at the school, we're not entirely clear on some of the surrounding details.

Biden\u2019s class has always been one of the most popular seminars offered at Widener Law\u2019s Delaware campus, and usually has a waiting list of students hoping that a seat will open. Senator Biden was also the commencement speaker at Widener University\u2019s Chester campus in May 2006, and he received an honorary doctor of laws degree from the university in May of 2000. \u201cIf he is as good a Vice-President as he is a faculty member here, then the nation is in good hands,\u201d noted Dean Ammons. Discussing Senator Biden\u2019s future with the school, she declared, \u201cHe will just be on leave here, and I hope to see him back.\u201d", "Roll Call added some more details to Biden's teaching history in an article published the same year. The Washington, D.C. news site reported that Biden taught a seminar called \"Selected Topics in Constitutional Law\" alongside professor Robert Hayman, and that he tried to be present for at least half of the Saturday morning classes.", "While Biden's day job as a senator may have prevented him for teaching at every class, his schedule grew even more hectic when he was chosen as then-presidential candidate Barack Obama's running mate in 2008.
