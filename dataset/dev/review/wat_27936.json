But conservative personalities on social media falsely dismiss that achievement as \u201ca damn lie.\u201d", "The 2020 presidential election inspired a record number of voters. More than 146 million votes had been counted by early Nov. 6 \u2014 far surpassing the previous high of 136.7 million votes cast in the 2016 election.", "The number of votes that Biden has amassed has already made history. By Nov. 6, more than 73 million ballots had been counted for Biden, which exceeds the previous record of 69.4 million votes that Obama won in 2008.", "But as Biden\u2019s total continued to grow, social media posts baselessly questioned Biden\u2019s ability to break Obama\u2019s record. Former Fox News contributors and popular conservative personalities Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, also known as\u00a0Diamond and Silk, suggested in a Nov. 4 Facebook post that the reporting of Biden\u2019s record-breaking wasn\u2019t possible.", "\u201cThey want us to believe that Biden, who stayed in his basement, only came out long enough to do a few events with 6 circles, got more of the popular vote than any other President in history\u2026Even more than Obama?\u201d they said. \u201cThis is a damn lie and every American should be outraged!\u201d", "The duo repeated the claim on their Twitter account on Nov. 5, calling on followers to \u201cbe disgusted by this fraud!\u201d The original Facebook post has garnered over 77,000 reactions, while the tweet received more than 25,000 likes. The conservative duo, the Hodgetwins, echoed the baseless claim.", "In addition, Diamond and Silk\u2019s assertion in their post that Biden only did \u201ca few events with 6 circles\u201d in the months leading up to the campaign is also unfounded. Biden did not make as many campaign appearances as Trump did in the final weeks, but he held 33 campaign events in 20 states from Oct. 12 to Nov. 3, according to USA Today, which kept track of the candidates\u2019 travel. From Sept. 1 through Nov. 2, Biden made 11 visits to Pennsylvania alone, according to NBC10 in Philadelphia.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
