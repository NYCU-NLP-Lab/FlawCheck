By Democrats?", "With multiple investigations under way, we don\u2019t know whether there was collusion between members of the Trump team and Russian interference in the election.", "But that isn\u2019t the question. The question is whether Democrats plucked the idea out of thin air.", "A few highlights from the past year say otherwise.", "First, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report expressing with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government put its thumb on the scale in favor of Trump.", "\"We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,\" the Jan. 7, 2017 report said. \"Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary (Hillary) Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.

It started in July 2016, a full three months before the election. It was not invented, but was based on evidence serious and credible enough to launch an investigation.", "We can go further.", "Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating, and Republicans control both chambers. Democrats don\u2019t set the agenda.", "Steven Aftergood with the Federation of American Scientists, a group that advocates for more transparency in government, said the fact of a Trump campaign-Russia connection is well established.", "\"It is supported by statements from Trump family members and associates, who have described financial relationships with Russian sources,\" Aftergood said. \"The only question is whether the various Trump-Russia connections violated any laws. That is what the FBI and Congress are trying to determine.\"", "Lastly, former director of national intelligence James Clapper was asked in a May 12 MSNBC interview if he thought that the investigation was a witch hunt.", "\"I don\u2019t believe it is,\" Clapper answered.", "Our ruling", "Trump said, \"This Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.
