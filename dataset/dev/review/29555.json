During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997.", "By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion.", "But that\u2019s only two balanced budgets he can plausibly claim credit for. The federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, but for the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- Gingrich was no longer serving in\u00a0the House.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that even the two balanced budgets for which Gingrich can claim some credit were collective accomplishments by a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate.", "Our ruling", "Gingrich was off-base with this claim -- again. The budget was indeed balanced for four years, but it\u2019s a stretch for him to take credit for anything more than two of those years. We rate Gingrich\u2019s claim False.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/638b4582-eb6f-4e7e-b410-2bfdee9e7dd5", "PolitiFact, \"Newt Gingrich inaccurate in budget, debt claims in video announcement,\" May 11, 2011", "PolitiFact, \"Newt Gingrich repeats claim about his record of balancing budget, reducing debt,\" Dec. 16, 201", "Newt Gingrich campaign video, http://www.newt.org/", "White House historical Table 1:1, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals", "Treasury Direct, http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
