["\u201cJoe Biden called Trump supporters the \u2018dregs of society.\u2019 The idea that Biden is a unifier is a joke,\u201d the @TrumpWarRoom account, which is managed by the president\u2019s campaign, tweeted on October 6, 2020.", "The remark -- had Biden been hitting out at\u00a0people for supporting\u00a0the president -- would have been similar to 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton saying half of Trump\u2019s backers could be put \u201cinto what I call the basket of deplorables,\u201d a comment that hurt her in the election run-in.", "But Biden\u2019s full remarks at a September 2018 Human Rights Campaign dinner make clear he was opposing\u00a0discrimination rather than people's broader\u00a0political leanings.", "Biden did refer to supporters of Trump\u2019s administration in his remarks, but only to say that some want to roll back progress on LGBTQ rights.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve faced with an administration and some of its most ardent right-wing supporters from the Ku Klux Klan, the head of the Ku Klux Klan has endorsed, and the alt-right, who are trying to undo all the progress you have made,\u201d he said.", "Biden did not make the \u201cdregs of society\u201d comment until after an intervening three minutes in which he again criticized discrimination, in reference to what he termed \u201cthe forces of intolerance,\u201d not Trump supporters.", "\u201cDespite losing in the court and in the court of public opinion, these forces of intolerance remain determined to undermine and roll back the progress you all have made. This time, they, not you, have an ally in the White House. This time, they have an ally. They\u2019re a small percentage of the American people, virulent people, some of them the dregs of society,\u201d he said.", "AFP Fact check has previously debunked manipulated videos of Biden that Trump has spread on social media, as well as an ad from his campaign that featured doctored images of his Democratic rival, and a clip used to falsely claim that he botched the Pledge of Allegiance.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
