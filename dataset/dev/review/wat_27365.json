["About this rating", "In July 2020, California public health authorities published guidelines for places of worship and religious services to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. Among several recommendations to maintain safer social distancing, the guidelines said congregations must \u201cdiscontinue singing and chanting activities.\u201d", "However, these guidelines affected all places of worship and providers of religious services, not just churches or Christian organizations. Additionally, there is no penalty from the state for violating the guidelines.", "Snopes is still fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

In particular, activities such as singing and chanting negate the risk reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing.", "A notable example of a \"super-spreading event\" of COVID-19 occurred at a church choir rehearsal in Washington state, where 60 singers convened in Skagit County on March 10. Of those, 45 became ill with the virus and two died, despite attendees' best efforts to remain socially distant from each other. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization.\"", "The COVID-19 pandemic has become a political wedge issue in the the country's ongoing culture wars. Right-leaning media outlets seized on these new guidelines, writing headlines like, \"Outrage after California bans singing in churches amid coronavirus pandemic,\" and also, \"California\u2019s Governor Forbids Christians From Singing in Church Houses.\"", "These headlines are misleading.", "The state has no penalty for violating this guidance, so suggesting the state \"forbids\" any group from singing is an exaggeration. A spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health told us in an email, \"Californians are being encouraged to be responsible as the guidance is used to educate the public without the threat of fines and citations as the first course of action.\"", "Also, the guidance doesn't apply to Christian churches alone, it applies to all \"places of worship and providers of religious services and cultural ceremonies,\" meaning any faith or cultural institution is equally affected.", "Nevertheless, headlines that highlighted the fact that Christian church congregations would be affected prompted a spate of internet outrage and misleading claims that Christians were being unfairly singled out. For example:", "Per the Los Angeles Times, the Independence Day holiday \"marked the 15th consecutive day that California tallied record hospitalization numbers of confirmed coronavirus patients. On Saturday, the state recorded 5,669 patients with confirmed coronavirus infections in California hospitals \u2014 an increase of 62% over the previous two weeks.\"", "Kasler, Dale.\u00a0\"Houses of Worship Told to 'Discontinue Singing\u2019 Under Order from Newsom as Pandemic Worsens.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Sacramento Bee.\u00a02 July 2020.", "Lin, Rong Gong II, et al.\u00a0\"California Coronavirus Spikes Worsen Over Holiday Weekend.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Los Angeles Times.\u00a06 July 2020.", "California Department of Public Health.\u00a0\"COVID-19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Places of Worship and Providers of Religious Services and Cultural Ceremonies.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a02 July 2020.", "Read, Richard.\u00a0\"A Choir Decided to Go Ahead with Rehearsal.
