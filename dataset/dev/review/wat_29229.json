It's part of our recipe for success.", "While the origin of the Chick-fil-A rumor wasn't clear, its claims were easily (and repeatedly) debunked by the company themselves on Twitter and Facebook:", "Chick-fil-A has indicated that no plans are afoot to reverse their closed-on-Sunday policy and that claims to the contrary are entirely false.  A piece of \"satire\" from June 2020 spoofed on this notion using a headline of \"Chick-fil-A Now Open on Sunday But Only for Black People\"", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
