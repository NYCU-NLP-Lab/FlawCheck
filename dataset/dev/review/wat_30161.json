["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on September 25, 2020", "A Facebook user claims the cost of her\u00a0insulin dropped 75% thanks to \u201cTrumps Prescription Bill.\u201d There has been no such legislation passed,\u00a0and actions by the Trump administration aimed at lowering prescription drug costs have yet\u00a0to take\u00a0effect.", "President Donald Trump issued several executive orders over the summer aimed at lowering prescription drug prices \u2014 efforts that he emphasized during an event Sept. 24 event in North Carolina. Experts told us when he first issued the orders that the scope of their effects remained to be seen since the orders first required further action by the administration.", "On Facebook, however, one user\u2019s viral text post \u2014 published Sept. 15 and shared by more than 260,000 users \u2014 suggests that Trump\u2019s policies have already resulted in a 75% drop in her cost for insulin.", "\u201cI just returned from Walmart Pharmacy. If anyone wants to know who benefited from Trumps Prescription Bill you can \u2018quote\u2019 me,\u201d the post says \u201cI picked up my Insulin (3 month supply) and the cost has dropped from $173.86 down to $42.88\u2026\u2026big saving\u2026\u2026.and my test strips (2 boxes/100 per box) dropped from $10.00 per box to $1.00 per box. Promises made Promises Kept.\u201d", "But Trump\u2019s orders haven\u2019t gone into effect.", "Rachel Sachs, an associate professor at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law who has followed the administration\u2019s proposals, pointed out there is no such thing as Trump\u2019s \u201cPrescription Bill,\u201d adding, \u201cI can\u2019t think of any legislation that would\u2019ve had this effect.\u201d", "And \u201cthe administration hasn\u2019t implemented any of the executive orders the President issued in July,\u201d she told us in an email. \u201cThere\u2019s a voluntary insulin program that\u2019s going to go into effect next year (which is to say that it isn\u2019t in effect now), but it will only assist a subset of Medicare beneficiaries.\u201d", "Erin Trish, associate director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics, also told us by email that Trump\u2019s order and that insulin program \u201chave not yet been implemented, so they cannot be directly responsible for her reduced out-of-pocket spending.\u201d", "The cost of insulin, a hormone used to treat diabetes by controlling blood sugar, has been rapidly rising over the years.", "In May, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced that a number of Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans would voluntarily participate in a program to set the maximum copay for a month\u2019s supply of insulin at $35 per month.", "That program begins Jan. 1, 2021, and will apply to \u201ca subset of plans and enrollees, and not all insulin products have to be covered by all participating plans,\u201d according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. It does not affect costs for people who are uninsured or have other coverage.", "Then in July, as we\u2019ve previously explained, Trump announced several executive orders that are aimed at lowering prescription drug prices.", "Among the orders is one  relating specifically to insulin and epinephrine. It seeks to compel Federally Qualified Health Centers, which provide primary care in underserved areas, to make the drugs available at low prices to low-income individuals. The centers already provide a sliding scale based on income, though, so how much the costs would go down for those recipients depends on how the Department of Health and Human Services ultimately defines \u201clow-income.\u201d", "Another order calls for increasing drug importation since drugs, including insulin, can be found significantly cheaper in other countries. (Though experts say how that will be achieved \u2014 or what prices the U.S. will be able to secure \u2014 isn\u2019t clear yet.) Yet another order instructs the HHS secretary to test a payment model that ties Medicare prices for certain drugs to the lowest price paid among a number of other countries.", "But Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Program on Medicare Policy at KFF, said that there are \u201cdefinitely more administrative steps [that] need to be taken before any of those proposals can take effect and translate\u201d to any potential cost savings.", "An \u201cexecutive order isn\u2019t the same thing as concrete action when it comes to lowering prices,\u201d Cubanski said in a phone interview.", "The next steps for some of the orders \u2014 such as proposing rule-making, accepting public comments and issuing final rules \u2014 could take months or longer, Cubanski said. The actions could also be the subject of legal challenges by pharmaceutical companies, she said. And how exactly the policies affect prices will largely depend on the details of the rules.", "The administration did on Sept. 24 take a further step on the drug importation order by publishing a Food and Drug Administration regulation to allow states and others import drugs from Canada. But \u201cstates would still need to apply to participate and then would have to set up new programs to actually begin importing drugs,\u201d according to STAT, a health-focused news site.", "Trump also announced that day that the administration plans to send $200 gift certificates to some 33 million Medicare beneficiaries to help pay for prescription drugs. The exact details of who will get them and when aren\u2019t clear.", "The Facebook user behind the claim about her insulin cost told us in a phone interview that she actually wasn\u2019t quite sure what caused the change in price.", "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know \u2014 I renewed my prescription. They said that\u2019s what the price is,\u201d Katharine Wade, 71, who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, said. \u201cIt was a pleasant surprise.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t care where [the cost reduction] came from, I just appreciate it,\u201d she added.", "But Wade, who said she has Type 2 diabetes, confirmed that she received a five-pack of Novolin human insulin pens. Walmart sells those pens for $42.88 under the brand Relion \u2014 the same price Wade noted in her Facebook post and a price that has been in place since at least early 2019.", "That\u2019s a human insulin \u2014 as opposed to the more expensive insulin analog, which is often needed by patients with diabetes, especially Type 1 \u2014 and it can be purchased at Walmart pharmacies without a prescription. (Note: This type of insulin is older and can take longer to metabolize than newer versions and experts advise that people should consult a doctor before taking or switching medications.)", "A Walmart spokeswoman, Marilee McInnis, told us the company was not aware of any changes that would\u2019ve led to the type of decrease in costs described in the Facebook post.", "\u201cGenerally, the price of medications and devices often depend on the type of insurance being used, as well as the products themselves and cost differences when switching between brands,\u201d she said in an email.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
