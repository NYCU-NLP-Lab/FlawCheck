All the players used to kneel for the National Anthem. Now do you understand the ignorance of the current administration and his minions?\"", "\"Ponder this. What changed?\"", "The Facebook page\u2019s caption for the post, \"White History 101,\" seems to suggest that the practice only became a problem when Kaepernick, a black player, started to do it.", "The image has been shared over 10,000 times and was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "The photo is authentic, but it has nothing to do with protesting and was taken long after the national anthem played. We also checked a number of stories about the national anthem protests and couldn\u2019t find evidence that it was common for players to kneel prior to Kaepernick introducing the practice in 2016.", "A reverse-image search led us to the \"Lively Morgue\" Tumblr page, a blog set up by the New York Times to showcase photographs from the newspaper\u2019s archives.", "The picture of Namath was taken by sports photographer Barton Silverman when the New York Jets played the New England Patriots on Nov. 11, 1973.

The Jets won the game without him.", "A recap published the next day said that Woodall came out of the game after straining a tendon in his right elbow early in the second quarter.", "The Lively Morgue also provided a shot of the back of the photo, which was covered in clippings, stamps and notes. Though partially concealed, the original caption says the photo was taken in the third quarter, long after the national anthem would have played.", "Namath did appear on multiple Fox News shows in recent years and showed support for players\u2019 decision to protest, but has also said the flag needs to be respected, too.", "A post sharing a photo of Joe Namath claims he was kneeling during the national anthem and it was something \"all players\" used to do.", "The photo is legitimate, but it was taken sometime during the third quarter after Namath\u2019s teammate, Al Woodall, left the game due to an injury. We also found no evidence that it was regular practice for players to take a knee during the anthem.", "It was not a form of protest and was not during the national anthem.", "We rate this post False.", "Facebook post, Feb. 10, 2019", "Sports Illustrated, Joe Namath Supports NFL Players\u2019 Motivations for Protests, but Unsure About the Venue, Oct. 10, 2017", "Yahoo! sports, NFL reaches financial settlement with Colin Kaepernick, Eric Reid, Feb. 15, 2019", "The Independent, Taking a knee: Why are NFL players protesting and when did they start to kneel?, Feb. 4, 2019", "Reverse image search, Feb. 20, 2019", "Lively Morgue Tumblr, NYT photography archives, Nov. 11, 1973", "New York Times archives, Jets Win on Turnovers 33-13, Nov. 12, 1973", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
