["As Georgia politics reenter the spotlight following the 2020 election, claims that the state's governor didn't win the office fairly are resurfacing.", "A 2018 Facebook post depicts Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican,\u00a0with an infographic overlaid on the image that reads \"How Brian Kemp stole the Georgia election.\" It lists these three ways he \"stole\" the governorship:\u00a0canceled 1.4 million voter registrations since 2014, closed 214 polling places, mostly in nonwhite neighborhoods\u00a0and put 53,000 voters \"on hold,\" 70% of whom were Black.", "\"Hey GOP, I think we found your 'voter fraud,'\" the post reads. The person who shared the post did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.", "More:Stacey Abrams says investments pay off in Georgia", "Kemp ran against Democrat Stacey Abrams for governor 2018, and that is what the post is referring to \u2014\u00a0not the 2020 election. The post doesn't specify which election Kemp allegedly stole, but claims of voter suppression by Abrams and other critics followed him into the governorship for the reasons listed in the post.", "While Kemp ran for governor, he was also Georgia's secretary of state. The secretary of state is in charge of overseeing elections, which critics of Kemp's said made it impossible for the election to be fair and free of conflicts of interest.", "Charles Bullock, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, told USA TODAY that it's not uncommon for a secretary of state to continue holding that office while running.", "\"Every secretary of state who has run for reelection as secretary of state in Georgia has held onto the office during that,\" he said. \"It's just not that common for a secretary of state to run for governor.\"", "It's true that during his eight-year tenure in that role, Kemp's office canceled over 1.4 million voter registrations, with low-income and minority Georgians most likely\u00a0to have their registrations removed, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Over 668,000 of those registrations were canceled in 2017.", "Kemp's office told the Associated Press in 2018 that the process is \"voter roll maintenance\" aimed at protecting Georgia's elections against voter fraud. Bullock noted that maintaining the accuracy of voter lists\u00a0is permitted under law, which often means removing voters,\u00a0though states cannot remove voters simply for the act of not voting.", "More:From Southern lore to diverse community: Georgia's changing political makeup", "It's also true that 214 polling places closed during Kemp's tenure as secretary of state. A report released by the Leadership Conference Education Fund found that after a 2013 Supreme Court decision allowed certain states and cities to change voting laws and practices without federal approval, there was a surge in poll closures.", "A spokeswoman for the Georgia\u00a0Secretary of State's Office told USA TODAY in 2019 that state law allows individual counties to independently \"determine the appropriate amount of polling locations for their jurisdictions, whether decreasing or increasing depending on several factors,\u00a0including geography and cost.\" The report cites a 2015 memo from Kemp\u00a0encouraging county officials to merge polling places, though, citing the Supreme Court case,\u00a0USA TODAY previously reported.", "And, it's true that about 53,000 voter registrations were put on hold by Kemp a few weeks out from the 2018 election. Those\u00a0applications were flagged as a part of the state's \"exact match\" verification process, which requires that voter information must precisely match the information\u00a0on file with the Georgia Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration, according to the Associated Press. The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of those voter registrations on hold were Black people, despite the state's population being about 32% Black.", "Bullock explained those holds would not have stopped those Georgians from voting.", "\"All the person had to do is show up with their photo ID, which everyone has to have, and they would've been allowed to vote,\" he said. \"But by making that claim, maybe that did inspire some more of those people to make sure that they did vote \u2013\u00a0both Democrats and Republicans.\"", "Abrams lost to Kemp by nearly 55,000 votes in 2018. In her concession, Abrams said the outcome reflected voter suppression. Kemp has denied efforts to suppress voters on numerous occasions, USA TODAY previously reported.", "More:Voters look to Georgia to determine if GOP or Democrats will run the Senate", "\u201cKemp is fighting to protect the integrity of our elections and ensure that only legal citizens cast a ballot,\u201d Ryan Mahoney, a spokesman for Kemp, told the Associated Press in 2018.", "Bullock said that there's not much empirical evidence to suggest Kemp tried to suppress votes or steal the election \u2013\u00a0but the talking point is good politics.", "\"Think back to your own childhood \u2013\u00a0if your parents said don't do such and such, always that makes it far more attractive, so by saying Republicans are going to try to keep you from voting, the reaction from some Democrats is going to be, 'By God, I'm going to show them they can't,'\" he said. \"It'd make me more committed as a Democrat to go out and vote.\"", "The Facebook post has likely resurfaced in recent days due to Georgia's newfound spotlight, with voters swinging blue by a narrow margin in the presidential race and its two senatorial seats still up for grabs, the outcome deciding which party will control the Senate in the next Congress beginning in 2021.", "We rate the claim that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp \"stole\" the state's election in the three listed ways as PARTLY FALSE because some of the claim is unfounded. The election the post is referring to is the state's 2018 gubernatorial race \u2014 not the 2020 election. While Kemp was secretary of state, that office did cancel over 1.4 million voter registrations and put 53,000 voter registrations on hold. It's also true that 214 polling places were closed while he was in office, though individual counties make those decisions. But those actions can be explained as routine under state and federal law, and an expert explained there's not much empirical evidence supporting the assertion that Kemp either suppressed the vote or \"stole\" the election from Abrams.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
