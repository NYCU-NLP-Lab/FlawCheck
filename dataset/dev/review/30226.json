Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said on Meet the Press. \"But a write-in is very difficult, let's face it.\"", "This possibility also came up during a segment of CNN\u2019s The Lead with Jake Tapper. There, conservative pundit Amanda Carpenter said the task may be more than just difficult.", "\"There are \u2018sore loser\u2019 laws that would bar Luther Strange from pursuing a seat, having already lost the primary,\" said Carpenter, a former aide to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.", "In a tweet sent after her appearance on CNN, Carpenter said the state does have a sore loser law but asked her followers, \"Can someone definitively say whether that allows a primary loser to run a write-in campaign?\" She later tweeted, \"I understand Strange could not appear as a printed choice on ballot but a deliberate write-in campaign seems subject to challenge.\" (Carpenter did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)", "With a sitting U.S. senator pushing the idea of a Strange write-in campaign, we at least wanted to see if it is possible, or if Strange is barred from pursuing the seat in any way.", "The answer is there is an opening for Strange, legally.", "We\u2019ll walk you through how, and the other electoral machinations that are possible.", "No. According to Alabama Code 17-6-21(c) any withdrawal must occur at least 76 days before Election Day.

And that means the \u2018American rule\u2019 is not at play.\"", "In other words, if Muller\u2019s interpretation is correct, Jones would win even if Moore secured the most votes after withdrawing or being disowned by the party. That conflicts with what Merrill had said on Fox News.", "We did not hear back from the secretary of state\u2019s office to clarify this point.", "For the record, Strange said on Nov. 13 that it was \"highly unlikely\" that he would run for the seat in the wake of the revelations about Moore.
