Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin", "On Nov. 20, 2015, soon after the House passed a bill that would increase security checks on refugees from Iraq and Syria, Grothman appeared on conservative talker Jay Weber\u2019s show on WISN (1130-AM). In the appearance, he asserted President Barack Obama has basically an open-door policy when it comes to immigrants.", "\"Whether it\u2019s dealing with the Middle East or south of the border, Barack Obama is apparently not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come here and we\u2019ll see what happens,\" said Grothman, R-Campbellsport.", "Since Grothman made his statement in the context of the Syrian refugee bill, we\u2019ll evaluate the claim with that in mind. Obama plans to accept about 10,000 people from Syria in 2016.", "Refugee process", "Obama has said Syrian refugees coming into United States must follow the same vetting process as all other refugees. But Republicans argue that is not enough and more stringent background checks are necessary, given concerns about terrorists posing as refugees and slipping into the country.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at the vetting process for those seeking refuge in the United States.", "Those seeking refuge must find a United Nations Refugee Agency and identify themselves as a refugee. The U.N. collects data on the applicant, such as their date and place of birth. Applicants are interviewed to confirm need for resettlement.", "Refugees from active war zones, including Syria, already must undergo additional checks, such as iris scans that are checked against terrorist databases.", "The White House says less than 1 percent of the global refugee population is considered strong candidates to be admitted to the United States and make it past this first check.", "Then, applicants are received by a federally funded Resettlement Support Center overseas.", "An applicant file is created with identifying documents and security checks conducted. Candidates are screened by at least four U.S. security agencies -- National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department. The agencies check for security risks, such as ties to known bad actors, and criminal history.", "The process continues with a Homeland Security interview; those from Syria get an \"enhanced review,\" which means their documents are scrutinized more closely. Fingerprints are taken and screened against federal databases. A medical screening occurs. Cultural orientation classes are taken. Travel is booked. Finally, the refugees arrives in the United States.", "U.S. officials will eliminate any candidate who intelligence does not think will make a good candidate to enter the United States.", "\"Any doubt, they\u2019re out,\" said Melanie Nezer, vice president of policy and advocacy for the refugee assistance group HIAS.", "Grothman\u2019s backup", "Grothman\u2019s team sent a series of links to news articles and quotes from federal officials as evidence of Obama\u2019s stance on refugees.", "\"The idea that somehow they pose a more significant threat than all the tourists who pour into the United States every single day just doesn\u2019t jive with reality,\" Obama said in his remarks after a meeting with the Canadian prime minister Nov. 19, 2015.", "Grothman also included a quote from FBI Director James Comey\u2019s congressional testimony in October 2015.", "\"If we don\u2019t know much about somebody, there won\u2019t be anything in our data,\" Comey said. \"I can\u2019t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there\u2019s no risk associated with this.\"", "But Comey didn\u2019t say the system is failing, or that no vetting occurs.
