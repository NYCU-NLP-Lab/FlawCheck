The AP tracks the vote and ballot numbers using a network of reporters across the country who are in touch with local election officials. Those reporters record the tallies and call them into an AP clerk who enters that data into the AP system. The AP also gathers results from county and state websites.", "When the AP called the Michigan race for Biden, it did so based on data that was not yet posted on the secretary of state\u2019s website. A spokesperson for the office told us that its website is always the last place election results are updated, and that people should check county websites first for more up-to-date information.", "\"We only update the website when counties report their complete counts to us. Even after counting is finished in individual counties ... there are still administrative and procedural things they need to do before the transmission happens, so sometimes it takes time,\" the spokesperson said. \"This delay is no way indicative of fraud or cause for concern.\"", "Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said at 8 p.m. on Nov. 4 that all the counting had been completed statewide, the Detroit Free Press reported. By about 8:30 a.m. on Nov. 5, the secretary of state\u2019s website showed Biden winning by about 150,000 votes, more than twice the size of the lead he had when he was declared the winner.", "When Biden was declared the winner, he had more votes than Trump.
