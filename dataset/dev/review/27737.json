Various presidents since the country\u2019s founding can be considered racist, whether because they enslaved Black people, held racist beliefs, or used racist rhetoric.", "Multiple early presidents, including Thomas Jefferson, enslaved Black people. Andrew Jackson forced Native Americans from their lands, causing migrations in which many died. Andrew Johnson sought to undermine Reconstruction in the South after the Civil War.

Historians generally consider 10 of the first 12 presidents to fall into this category. (The exceptions were John Adams and his son John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts.)", "Most of these presidents were born in the slavery-era South. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, and John Tyler were born in and represented Virginia. Andrew Jackson was born in South Carolina and represented Tennessee; Zachary Taylor, who owned 100 people, was born in Virginia and resided in Louisiana; and James K.

This gambit \"re-set the clock on their bondage and precluded their freedom.\"", "On the other hand, Washington was initially opposed to Black troops during the Revolutionary War but changed his mind during the war, and he later said that his favorite unit was one that was half Black, said Paul Finkelman, the president of Gratz College in Pennsylvania who has written extensively about slavery. Washington also freed his enslaved people and set them up with land.", "Historians paint his contemporary, Jefferson, more negatively. In his writings, Jefferson \"said that Blacks are inferior\" and tried to justify it scientifically. While Jefferson claimed not to sell enslaved people except in limited cases, he regularly wrote to his plantation managers asking them to sell enslaved people because he needed the money, Finkelman said. And in her book, \"Founders as Fathers,\" Glover detailed the stark contrast between how Jefferson treated his acknowledged white family and his unacknowledged family with Sally Hemings, who was enslaved.", "A later president who enslaved people, Andrew Jackson, also worked for the forced relocations of Native Americans, during which many died.", "The roots of the federal takeover of Indian lands, often undergirded by notions of white superiority, dated back to the first five presidents, Glover said.

Wilson also held a White House screening of the pro-Ku Klux Klan film \"Birth of a Nation,\" which dovetailed with his nostalgia for the Confederacy. Wilson once wrote that \"domestic slaves were almost uniformly dealt with indulgently and even affectionately by their masters.\"", "Oswald Garrison Villard, a contemporary liberal journalist, wrote that Wilson\u2019s administration \"has allied itself with the forces of reaction, and put itself on the side of every torturer, of every oppressor, of every perpetrator of racial injustice in the South or the North.\"", "As open racism became less socially acceptable from politicians in the latter half of the 20th century, presidents\u2019 legacies on race became more complicated.
