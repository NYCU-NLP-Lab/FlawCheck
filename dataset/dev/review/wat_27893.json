["About this rating", "Forget for a moment the seemingly endless series of revelations about the Trump White House's staffing woes, the Russia investigation, and the Seth Rich conspiracy. A pressing matter, largely ignored by the mainstream media has come up: Is Donald Trump a time traveler?", "The question has been circulating on conspiracy theory web sites for several months and is backed by various pieces of \"evidence\" (such as Donald Trump's uncle John Trump's purported relationship with Nikola Tesla). Now a series of books published over century ago is receiving attention for their seemingly all-too-eerie connections to the Trump family. The books, one of which is titled Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey, have been discussed on both reddit and 4chan:", "Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey, and 1900: or, The Last President, are indeed real books by writer Ingersoll Lockwood. (We haven't been able to uncover any evidence proving that Donald Trump and his family have access to a time machine, however).", "Both of the books are archived by the Library of Congress and can be read in full on Archive.org. Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey was published in 1893 and 1900: or, The Last President came out a few years later. According to the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Lockwood penned at least one other book about the Baron Trump character, The Travels and Adventures of Little Baron Trump and His Wonderful Dog Bulgar, which was published in 1890.", "A July 2017 article in Newsweek noted several prescient-seeming connections, such as the novel's Russian setting, a character named \"Don,\" and a \"Fifth Avenue Hotel\" in New York City, where Trump Tower currently stands:", "There are some incredible connections to be made to the first family of the United States and Lockwood\u2019s novels from the turn of the 19th century. For starters, the main character\u2019s name is the same as President Donald Trump\u2019s son, albeit spelt differently. Trump\u2019s adventures begin in Russia, and are guided thanks to directions provided by \"the master of all masters,\" a man named \"Don.\"", "Before leaving for his voyage through the unknown, Trump is told of his family\u2019s motto: \"The pathway to glory is strewn with pitfalls and dangers.\"", "[...]", "But by Lockwood\u2019s third novel, The Last President, things become even more eerily linked to the present day.", "The story begins with a scene from a panicked New York City in early November, describing a \"state of uproar\" after the election of an enormously opposed outsider candidate.", "\"The entire East Side is in a state of uproar,\" police officers shouted through the streets, warning city folk to stay indoors for the night. \"Mobs of vast size are organizing under the lead of anarchists and socialists, and threaten to plunder and despoil the houses of the rich who have wronged and oppressed them for so many years.\"", "\"The Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob,\" the novel continues, citing an address in New York City where Trump Tower now stands. \"Would the troops be in time to save it?\"", "However, some of these connections were slightly exaggerated or outright misstated. For one, the main character is called Baron Trump not because his name is Baron but because he is a baron \u2014 in other words, that's his title. The book begins with a \"Biographical Notice of Wilhelm Heinrich Sebastian Von Troomp, Commonly Called Little Baron Trump\":", "As doubting Thomases seem to take particular pleasure in popping up on all occasions, Jack-in-the-Box-like, it may be well to head them off in this particular instance by proving that Baron Trump was a real baron, and not a mere baron of the mind.", "Newsweek similarly mistakes the Don Fum character's honorific for his name, calling him \"a man named 'Don.'\" In fact, \"Don\" is a Spanish honorific meaning \"Mr.,\" and the character (a \"learned Spaniard\") was introduced by Lockwood on page 2 of Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey:", "Finally, the book mentions\"The Fifth Avenue Hotel,\" meaning that it shares a street with Trump Tower. Since Fifth Avenue is, a well-known part of New York that has been the site for several high-end restaurants, shops and hotels since the late 1800s (the Waldorf\u2013Astoria was constructed on Fifth Avenue in 1893), this detail seems to be more a reflection of the time it was written, and less a prescient note of where Trump Tower would eventually be constructed.", "Although these books contain some seemingly bizarre coincidences, they are not evidence that Donald Trump has access to a time machine. Time travel conspiracy theories such as this one pick and choose material that supports their conclusions while ignoring everything else. For instance, these books also contain giant turtles, alternate dimensions, a battle with a big white crane, a dog named Bulgar, and a little smiling man frozen in time. Since these aspects have no clear connection to the Trumps, they are omitted from the conspiracy theory.", "Levy, Nicole. \u00a0 \"A History of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 DNA Info. \u00a0 1 March 2017.", "Riotta, Chris. \u00a0 \"Did an Author from the 1800s Predict the Trumps, Russia and America's Downfall?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Newsweek. \u00a0 31 July 2017.", "Lockwood, Ingersoll. \u00a0 \"1900; or, The last President.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The American News Company. \u00a0 1896.", "Lockwood, Ingersoll. \u00a0 \"Baron Trump's Marvellous Underground Journey.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Boston, Lee and Shepard. \u00a0 1893.", "Riotta, Chris. \u00a0 \"Did an Author from the 1800s Predict the Trumps, Russia and America's Downfall?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Newsweek. \u00a0 31 July 2017.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
