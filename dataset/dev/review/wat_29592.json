Michael Bennet of Colorado, who is running for president, said in a CNN town hall May 30 that public perception is consistent with that consensus.", "\"The vast majority of Americans believe that climate change is real and we need to do something about it,\" he said.", "We looked into this claim and found that Bennet, who recently rolled out a plan for 2020 to address climate change, is right that most Americans say climate change is taking place. But polls indicate that the public shows a bit less conviction when asked whether government should address the issue, though much seems to depend on how the questions are asked.", "Let\u2019s take a look.", "Bennet\u2019s climate change plan, which was released in May, includes a goal for the United States to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

A majority \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" support investments in renewable energy research and infrastructure (87%), regulating pollution (82%) and/or taxing pollution (72%). Also, nearly four in ten voters said a candidate\u2019s position on global warming will be very important when they decide who they vote for in the 2020 presidential election.", "We looked at other polls about climate change and found that responses vary on whether or not Americans believe climate change is real.", "One way to analyze the first part of Bennet\u2019s statement is to examine Americans\u2019 views on the timeline of the effects of global warming.", "A Gallup poll conducted in March found that 59% of Americans said that the effects of global warming have already begun and 66% believe it\u2019s mostly due to pollution from human activities. The percentage of people polled who believe the effects of global warming are already underway has fluctuated over the years, but it\u2019s steadily climbed from 49% in 2011 to 52% in 2012 to where we are today.", "Gallup does note differences in how Americans view the issue based on their political leanings. Among those who describe themselves as conservative, only 25% were classified as concerned believers, compared to 81% of liberals and 56% of moderates.", "So, is Bennet also on point when he says that most Americans support doing something about climate change? The results are mixed.", "A Quinnipiac University poll released in 2018 found that the majority of American voters, 69%, are \"somewhat\" or \"very\" concerned about climate change.", "But a Pew Research Center survey conducted in January found that only 44% of Americans said global climate change should be a top priority for President Donald Trump and Congress.
