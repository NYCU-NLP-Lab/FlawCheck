["The story was shared more than 20,000 times in English from this tweet: \u201cFirst Time In The History, Red Flag Unfurled Over The Holy Dome Of Jamkaran Mosque, Qom Iran. Red Flag: A Symbol Of Severe Battle To Come. #Qaseemsulaimani\u201d", "Similar claims were made in French on Twitter, and written about by\u00a0large media outlets including\u00a0the Daily Mail\u00a0and\u00a0the Times of India.", "According to all of these sources, this flag is a symbol of revenge to come from Iran after the death of Soleimani, to whom a large crowd paid a vibrant tribute in Tehran on Monday.", "A red flag was raised above the main cupula of the Jamkaran mosque in Qom, an Iranian city 120 kilometers south of Tehran.", "The video was created by the mosque's press office.\u00a0This was confirmed to AFP by the hojatoleslam Yassine Hossein Abadi, one of the mosque\u2019s administrators in charge of cultural affairs. The video is not available on the mosque\u2019s website.", "Contrary to what many of the publications assert, this red flag -- a colour symbolising the blood of martyrs -- is frequently raised in Iran. It is often unfurled above mosques or brandished at religious processions, particularly during the Islamic month of Muharram, which ended on September 29 last year.", "The same flag was a common sight in the streets of Tehran on Monday, during the tribute paid to Soleimani, without necessarily implying revenge.", "According to Hossein Abadi, the use of this flag at the Jamkaran Mosque is relatively recent. \u201cFor the past three years,\u201d it has flown over the mosque during the ten days of mourning of the Muharram month, during which Shia Muslims commemorate Hussein ibn Ali, a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad.", "It is rare for the red flag to be raised on this mosque outside the month of Muharram. \u201cDue to the martyrdom of general Qassem Soleimani and his comrades, and after hearing the supreme leader calling for a harsh revenge, we unfurled this flag so that all (Shia) believers in the world and all the freedom fighters gather around this flag to avenge Qassem Soleimani\u2019s blood unjustly shed,\u201d Abadi told AFP.", "The flag bears the Arabic phrase, \u201cYa la-Tharat al-Hussein,\u201d which can be translated in English as, \u201cO ye avengers of Hussein.\u201d", "As Muhammad\u2019s grandson, Hussein,\u00a0is one of the most sacred figures of Shia Islam, in which he is the incarnation of justice. He was killed in the year 680 at the battle of Karbala, in present-day Iraq, by caliph Yazid\u2019s troops.", "This battle and Hussein\u2019s martyrdom are the founding elements for Shia Islam, and mark a definitive schism with Sunni Islam.", "According to certain Iranian Shia traditions, \u201cYa la-Thara al-Hussein,\u201d should be a rallying cry for believers upon the return of the Hidden Imam, the last of twelve imams recognized in Imamiyyah, the largest branch of Shia Islam.", "Certain articles claim that the flag will fly until the death of Soleimani is avenged. \u201cIt\u2019s completely false,\u201d the mosque administrator said.", "Abidi said that the flag will fly \u201cfor a certain amount of time,\u201d without providing a specific date.", "The Jamkaran mosque is located in a suburb of Qom, a holy Shia city and the main theology education center in Iran.", "The mosque\u00a0acquired an official importance in the Islamic Republic of Iran following supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s rise to power in 1989.", "According to the mosque\u2019s website, Soleimani was attached to the site and often went there to pray.", "The Jamkaran mosque was significantly enlarged over the last 30 years, and now features five domes, which is practically nonexistent in Shia Islam, where mosques usually only have one.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
