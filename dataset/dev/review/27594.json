(Some of the Facebook posts here, here and here show screen recordings of the video tweeted by Fred Diaries.)", "Mbaise-born Emeka Ihedioha of Nigeria\u2019s main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) was elected governor of Imo eight months ago. But after his rival \u00a0Hope Uzodinma of the ruling All Progressives Congress challenged Ihedioha\u2019s victory, the Supreme Court decided in his favour on January 14, 2020.", "The ruling has been criticised on the basis that Uzodinma had initially finished fourth in the March 9, 2019, gubernatorial poll, before the Supreme Court ruled that he actually finished first.", "The Question is, where did the Supreme Court find the extra votes for Uzodinma? Is it from the number of Registered voters from the 388 polling units cancelled?\n\t\tThat is the zoo for you\n\n\t\tUzodimma the 4th runner became the governor\n\n\t\tTHIS IS FRAUD TOO MANY. - no Hope For Nigeria pic.twitter.com/AKogUkYv7H", "A common feature in all the posts is a watermark of the name \"GlitchCam\" in the bottom-right corner of the video.

It claims to help users \u201cdistort video in an artistic way\u201d.", "The 15-second clip shows a loud crowd approaching a junction. The crowd then quickly disperses while what sounds like gunfire is heard. Down the road, a white-coloured armoured vehicle approaches the crowd.", "Some of the comments on social media posts express shock at the speed the people ran away in the video clip.", "The GlitchCam application has five features, including a speed effect that can make videos play twice as fast or reduce speed by half.", "The claim that the video shows Mbaise residents gathering to protest the court\u2019s ruling is false: While the PDP did stage protests against the judgment in Abuja and London, the video was first posted on Twitter here on January 13 -- a day before Nigeria\u2019s highest court nullified Ihedioha\u2019s electoral victory.", "This tweet makes no mention of where the incident took place nor does it mention Ihedioha; it simply makes fun of the scene. In the comments, many people joke about how fast the crowd disperses.", "The next day, it was reposted by Fred Diaries.", "\"I saw the video on one of my friends\u2019 WhatsApp statuses, so I saved it through an app \u2018WhatsApp status saver\u2019 and posted it here (Twitter).
