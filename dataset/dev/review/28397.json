After spending some of Wednesday retweeting news that her post was trending internationally, she later deleted her account.", "Trump was endorsed by the KKK\u2019s official newspaper. And after his victory became official Wednesday morning, former KKK Imperial Wizard David Duke tweeted: \"This is one of the most exciting nights of my life. Make no mistake about it, our people have played a HUGE role in electing Trump!\"", "However, there's no proof that the Klan was on the march in North Carolina, like the viral post claimed.", "The photo appears to show a group of Trump supporters that local media also interviewed.", "And according to that news report and follow-up interviews,\u00a0none of them were wearing KKK regalia, carrying Confederate flags or doing anything else that would link them to the racist group.", "The scene on the bridge", "Although the tweet claimed\u00a0the marchers were on the bridge in Mebane Wednesday morning, they were actually there on Tuesday afternoon and night.", "Natalie Allison Janicello, a reporter for the local Burlington Times-News, was there interviewing them. She said she\u2019s sure the group in the viral post is the same group she spoke with;\u00a0she could recognize\u00a0the same flags and the neon yellow shirt of someone in the photo.", "None of them\u00a0were\u00a0wearing any KKK regalia, she said, or carrying flags associated with the Confederacy or white supremacy movements. Instead, they had Trump signs, red-white-and-blue scarves and an assortment of American, Christian and \"Don\u2019t Tread On Me\" flags.", "\"There was no one claiming or professing to be part of the KKK,\" Janicello said. \"These were just local conservatives who were out there for Trump.\"", "Janicello said they had actually come to that spot a few times a month, since February, to wave flags to passing traffic.", "Furthermore, neither the Mebane Police Department nor the Alamance County Sheriff\u2019s Office received complaints of KKK activity close to the election \u2013 either at that bridge or anywhere else in the area.\u00a0The sheriff\u2019s office said in a press release Wednesday that calls only started coming in after the photo went viral,\u00a0and that there\u2019s nothing to substantiate the rumors.", "\"Several members of law enforcement had observed these individuals over the past weeks, and never observed any paraphernalia related to the KKK nor Confederate symbols,\" the press release said. \"No suspicious activity was observed nor reported.\"", "The newspaper\u2019s photos from the bridge show that some of the marchers were affiliated with the group Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County (ACTBAC). It received some notoriety this summer when it began raising money to buy and install Confederate flags along Interstate 40, which is the busiest road in a number of North Carolina counties.", "But there were no Confederate flags or KKK regalia visible at the Trump celebration, Janicello said. She also interviewed an Alamance County Republican Party official at the bridge, but party leaders later told us there was no formal connection.", "\"I haven\u2019t even heard of what you\u2019re talking about,\" said Ben York, the Alamance County Republican Party chairman, several hours after the image had gone viral.", "The KKK in North Carolina", "Despite there being no proof behind the viral claim, Alamance County\u00a0was one of the major early hotbeds of KKK activity in North Carolina.", "In an 1870 incident known as the Kirk-Holden War, a band of Klan supporters from Alamance and Caswell counties attempted to capture the town of Pittsboro in neighboring Chatham County. They were defeated by a militia formed by Gov. William Holden, who also arrested some prominent Klan supporters. That infuriated white supremacist state lawmakers, who soon made Holden the first governor in U.S. history to be impeached and removed from office. Holden was pardoned by the N.C. Senate in 2011.", "The contemporary KKK has also found support in the central\u00a0area of the state, called the Piedmont, which includes Alamance County.", "\"In North Carolina, one of its banner states, the modern Klan thrived among mill workers and other blue-collar laborers in the Piedmont,\" according to the 2006 book Encyclopedia of North Carolina.", "Our ruling", "A viral post on social media claimed to show KKK members marching in Mebane, N.C. on Wednesday morning after Trump won the election.", "Trump has been supported by the KKK, and that area of North Carolina does have longstanding ties to KKK activity.
