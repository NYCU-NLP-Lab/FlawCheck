["About this rating", "On 13\u00a0January\u00a02016, the web site Newslo published an article titled \"Robertson: 'David Bowie Is Not Dead, He Was Kidnapped By Demons Summoned By Rock Music,'\" claiming that televangelist Pat Robertson said the following during an airing of the\u00a0700 Club after David Bowie's death:", "Recently on \u201cThe 700 Club,\u201d Pat Robertson fielded a question from a teenage viewer who wanted to know if it is a sin to listen to rock music. The televangelist said that while people shouldn\u2019t try to completely avoid mainstream music, they should be wary of listening to songs that may contain violent, satanic lyrics and beats that could summon demonic beings. \u201cIt depends on what rock you\u2019re listening to,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the stuff is just evil. They used to talk about killing your parents. There were odes to Satan. You don\u2019t want that stuff coming into your mind. In one Indian context, they were playing rock music and the person said, \u2018Why are you calling on the demons?\u2019 because that was the kind of music they used to summon demons.\u201d", "\u201cAnd it\u2019s true, just look at what happened to David Bowie,\u201d Robertson continued. \u201cI mean, here you have a person who everybody is referring to as a legendary musician, an innovator, someone who changed the course of pop music history. In reality, Bowie was a deeply tormented gay drug addict, and it showed through his music and on his face. I mean, just take a look at any picture of him and tell me that\u2019s not true. Tell me he doesn\u2019t look like he just finished having a gay orgy, complete with a ton of drugs. And now people think he is dead. I\u2019m kind of thinking, na-aah, no way. I\u2019m thinking the demons kidnapped him to entertain them in Hell, because they got tired of mainstream punk-rock, and suddenly decided they were in the mood for some \u2018Space Oddity.\u2019\u201d", "While it's true that\u00a0Robertson said that rock music songs were\u00a0\"odes to Satan\" and\u00a0music \"used to summon demons,\" the second portion of the above-excerpted quote\u00a0was fabricated, as\u00a0Newslo\u00a0itself showed.
