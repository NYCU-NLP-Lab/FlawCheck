They represented two whistleblowers.", "The lawsuit alleged that DaVita was knowingly generating unnecessary waste when administering drugs to dialysis patients and then billing Medicare for the waste. Readers may recall the lawsuit from a recent installment of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.", "The company did not admit wrongdoing, but paid $450 million in settlements to resolve the claims.", "Washington University Law professor Kathleen Clark said that referring to the settlement as a victory is accurate, and characterized the settlement sum as an impressive feat.", "Was it one of the biggest in Medicare fraud history, though?", "When we asked Evans\u2019 campaign what they meant by private lawsuit, they said they were referring to lawsuits filed under the False Claims Act, whistleblowers\u2019 main vehicle to sue on behalf of the federal government for Medicare fraud when the government does not intervene.", "Justice Department spokesperson Nicole Navas confirmed Evans\u2019 statement.", "\"DaVita recovery was one of the largest ever obtained by a relator in a matter declined by the United States,\" Navas said.", "There have been larger settlements, but only when the government has gone after fraud directly.

He said the government would have likely intervened otherwise.", "When the government doesn\u2019t intervene, clients are entitled to no less than 25 percent and no more than 30 percent of the settlement; according to Wood and Evans, they received 28 percent. The remainder, 72 percent or $324 million, went to the government.", "Wood called Evans an integral part of the case, and characterized the other two firms as having played a minor role.", "We wondered if that money went directly to taxpayers, as Evans said in the video.", "Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, agreed with Evans\u2019 wording that the money went to taxpayers, which he called a proxy for the treasury. Reducing the treasury\u2019s deficit translates to a benefit to taxpayers.", "\"The taxes that individual citizens pay is not reduced nor does the money go directly into service benefitting people,\" Ellis said. \"But a smaller deficit means it is less likely that taxes are raised or services cut.\"", "Evans said that she \"helped win one of the biggest private lawsuits against Medicare fraud in history.\" The lead counsel on the case corroborated her role in it, and the Justice Department confirmed its historic importance.", "Her claim that they recovered $324 million for taxpayers also checks out.", "We rate this statement True.", "Youtube, \"16 Homes,\" June 12, 2017", "Phone interview with Seth Clark, Stacey Evans\u2019 campaign spokesperson", "Phone interview with Kathleen Clark, Washington University law professor, July 13, 2017", "Phone interview with Lin Wood, attorney at L.
