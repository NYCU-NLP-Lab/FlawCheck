The campaign hyped the rally as a major event with an expected overflow crowd big enough to cheer on a second speech outside the arena, but organizers canceled the second address when that crowd didn\u2019t materialize.", "Reporters on site shared photos and videos of empty blue seats and a comparatively sparse crowd, while critics jeered Trump on social media and joked about TikTok users who registered for tickets with no intention of showing.", "Now, supporters of the president are defending him by flooding social media with photos that they say show a nearly sold-out arena in Tulsa.", "One Facebook post shows a packed arena from the vantage point of two people sitting in the venue\u2019s upper deck.
