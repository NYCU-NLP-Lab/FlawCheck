["About this rating", "On Aug. 31, 2019, seven people were killed and dozens more injured when they were shot from a vehicle traveling between the cities of Odessa and Midland in Texas. The gunman was himself shot and killed by police, who later identified him as 36-year-old Seth Ator.", "Almost immediately upon the heels of that identification, the usual online disinformation game-playing began, with various bad actors and misinformed social media users spreading false details about the perpetrator's putative political affiliations. The most widespread and prominent rumor about Ator held that he was a \"Democrat Socialist\" whose vehicle sported a sticker endorsing Beto O'Rourke, a former U.S. representative from Texas who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination:", "The Odessa Shooter's name is Seth Ator, a Democrat Socialist who had a Beto sticker on his truck.", "\u2014 Sue Moore (@suemo54) September 1, 2019", "This rumor quickly became a predominant narrative about the shooter on Twitter, along with claims that his social media profile had been scrubbed:", "In fact, Texas Department of Public Safety Spokesman Sgt. Oscar Villarreal stated that no such sticker was found on Ator's own vehicle, nor on the mail truck Ator hijacked after abandoning his car.", "O'Rourke's campaign manager also took to Twitter to state that the rumor was \"completely false\":", "This weekend, a right wing bot network spread the completely false rumor that the Odessa shooter had a Beto sticker on his car.

Some Facebook users posted a picture of a white truck with a \u201cBeto 2020\u201d sticker on the back window, saying it belonged to Ator.", "That image actually came from an online retailer who sells campaign decals. Its owner, Stacy Pyle, said via email that the photo originated from her Etsy store website. But she said she did not sell any version of that decal and had \u201cno clue\u201d the image was being used to spread misinformation.", "Unproven statements that the shooter was a \u201cregistered Democrat\u201d also spread quickly on social media hours after the rampage.
