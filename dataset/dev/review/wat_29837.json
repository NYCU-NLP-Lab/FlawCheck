Not sure if you are aware, but an incident has occurred in Maharagama\u2026 The night before yesterday, at around 11.30, a Sinhala youth has been hacked by a group of Muslims and the victim is currently receiving treatment at the Intensive Care Unit of the Maharagama Hospital. We have heard this from confidential sources. The youth had been hacked because he opened a shoe shop. A Muslim group opened another shoe shop in the adjoining space. The Muslims incurred losses within a few days of opening the shop. Due to jealousy regarding the business success of the Sinhala boy, they had asked the Sinhala boy to close down his shop. But the Sinhala boy had told that he will not stop this venture. The day before yesterday night at around 11.00 when he went to a shop, the group of Muslims had approached him, dragged him into the shop and hacked him. We have received information he is in the Intensive Care Unit. So we ask these dogs, these leaders who are wastes of space, why are you still asleep? This can\u2019t be given to media, reporting on this has been prohibited. None of the page admins who go in search of garbage, talk about this issue. This is the country of the Sinhalese; this is the holy country that Buddha visited thrice. This is not Allah\u2019s country. Various Muslims, good for nothing Muslims, are telling us to stop talking about our community; and that if we don't stop within a month they would teach us a lesson. Remember one thing!
