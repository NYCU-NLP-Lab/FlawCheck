["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on September 6, 2019", "Viral posts on social media make the baseless claim that the shooter in Odessa, Texas, had a sticker on his car for Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke. The Texas Department of Public Safety said there was no sticker on the car he was driving during the attack.", "We don\u2019t know what motivated Seth Ator to carry out a killing spree in Texas, fatally shooting seven and injuring another two dozen on Aug. 31. But social media users have spread unsubstantiated claims to suggest supposed political motives.", "One viral claim, with no apparent factual basis, posits that Ator was a \u201cDemocrat Socialist who had a Beto sticker on his truck\u201d \u2014 a reference to\u00a02020 Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke.", "We\u2019ve found no instances of authorities publicly mentioning Ator\u2019s political leanings at all \u2014 let alone how any such beliefs could have prompted the shooting. Also, police have said Ator was driving a \u201cgold-colored sedan,\u201d not a truck, before hijacking a U.S. Postal Service van.", "Sgt. Oscar Villarreal, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told us by phone that \u201cthere was no sticker on either vehicle\u201d used in the attack, referring to Ator\u2019s car and the Postal Service van. He said he was not aware of Ator\u2019s political preferences.", "The claim appears to have been invented and unleashed on social media.", "A Twitter account believed to have initially posted the unfounded claim on Sept. 1 appeared to be suspended but then later restored. The account identifies\u00a0the user as a 72-year-old retired woman from Arizona. We asked that user through a connected Facebook for proof of the claim but did not hear back.", "The claim appeared in posts by many accounts on Facebook and Twitter. A former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, Anthony Shaffer, whose profile identifies himself as a member of Trump\u2019s 2020 advisory board also amplified it by sharing the original claim and remarking that Ator \u201cwas a @BetoORourke supporter\u2026this supports my belief that Progressives should be prohibited from owning or having access to weapons \u2013 they clearly cannot be trusted with this responsibility.\u201d", "O\u2019Rourke is a former representative from El Paso, Texas. His campaign manager, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, took to Twitter on Sept. 3 to criticize the spread of the \u201ccompletely false rumor.\u201d", "\u201cAs a campaign, we\u2019re almost entirely powerless to stop misinformation,\u201d she wrote, calling on social media companies to better address misinformation. \u201cWe can tweet corrections, but only a fragment of the people exposed will see it.\u201d (Disclosure: FactCheck.org is a third-party fact-checking partner with Facebook.

O\u2019Rourke has called for a number of gun control measures, including an \u201cassault weapons ban\u201d and universal background checks. Ator was reportedly using an AR-15 style weapon, a semi-automatic rifle. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal would not only ban such weapons, but also institute a mandatory buyback program to get rid of those currently in use.", "John Wester \u2014 an assistant special agent in charge with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \u2014 said at a Sept. 2 press conference that\u00a0Ator had been denied a gun previously as a result of the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System.", "\u201cThe NICS system did work. He did apply to get a gun and he was denied a gun,\u201d Wester said.", "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said on Twitter that Ator \u201cdidn\u2019t go thru a background check for the gun he used in Odessa.\u201d", "Some\u00a0reports quoting law enforcement officials say that investigators are exploring whether the gun used was purchased through a private gun sale, which in most states \u2014 including Texas \u2014 would not require a federal background check if purchased in-state. But the Wall Street Journal also reported that officials were probing whether an individual who may have sold Ator the gun was illegally manufacturing and selling firearms \u2014 meaning the sale still would have been criminal.", "Christopher Combs, special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s San Antonio Division, has said Ator \u201cwas on a long spiral of going down\u201d prior to the shooting, which followed Ator\u2019s being fired from his work at Journey Oilfield Services.", "Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said Ator went to his work at on Aug. 31 and was \u201cthere for a short time and was terminated.\u201d Both Ator and the employer soon after called 911, \u201ccomplaining on each other because they had a disagreement over the firing.\u201d", "Ator left before officers arrived at Journey Oilfield, Gerke said, and called the FBI\u2019s national tip line but made \u201cno threats of any type of violence.\u201d Combs said that the call was \u201cfrankly rambling statements about some of the atrocities that he felt that he had gone through.\u201d", "Soon after, Gerke said, a state trooper attempted to pull Ator\u2019s gold-colored sedan over for traffic violation on Interstate 20 between Midland and Odessa. Ator opened fire and then carried out the drive-by shooting spree, making his way into Odessa, where he killed a Postal Service employee and hijacked her van.
