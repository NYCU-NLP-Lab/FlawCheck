She was asked repeatedly to provide security in Benghazi on several occasions including direct cables, and she says she never read the cables on security. I find that inexcusable and a dereliction of duty.", "\"Whether it has political overtones or not, it really goes to the heart of who you are as secretary of state if you do not provide security for an embassy that's begging for it, that's absolutely a dereliction of duty and she should have resigned and accepted blame for it.\"", "Did Clinton herself get repeated requests for security before armed terrorists attacked, including in \"direct cables\"?", "Cables 101", "Paul\u2019s office said Clinton\u2019s name on diplomatic cables demonstrates she was involved in security decisions \u2014 or that she should have been.", "\"It may be even more damning an indictment of Clinton if she is correct, because her disinterest in her job may have cost the lives of U.S. citizens overseas,\" said Moira Bagley, a Paul spokeswoman.", "She pointed to a claim from House Republicans, reported by the Los Angeles Times in April, that a cable signed by Clinton proposed security reductions in Benghazi before the attack.", "\"Clinton's signature is on this cable and others,\" Bagley said. \"If Secretary Clinton signed a cable to reduce security, then her signature is strong evidence that she read cables.\"", "(Bagley didn\u2019t offer evidence that Clinton \"was asked repeatedly to provide security\" including \"direct cables.\" But we\u2019ll get there in a minute.)", "First, is Clinton\u2019s \"signature\" strong evidence of her personal involvement?", "Let\u2019s talk for a second about diplomatic cables.", "Think of them as messages sent via a new-fangled email system \u2014 dubbed \"CableExpress\" \u2014 that draws on some old-school customs. How old-school?

Darrell Issa, R-Calif., argued on TV in April that Clinton had personally signed a cable about reducing U.S. security staff in Benghazi, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler, who covered the State Department for nine years, called it a \"whopper.\"", "Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., confirmed that assessment in May, saying, \"We have now seen this cable and she did not sign it. Her name is printed at the bottom just like tens of thousands of cables sent every year from the department.\"", "But as we mentioned previously, Paul\u2019s claim was about messages sent the other way, from a U.S. embassy to Washington.", "How are those addressed? To \"SECSTATE\" in \"WASHDC.\"", "While a cable addressed to \"SECSTATE\" may look like a \"direct cable\" to the secretary of state, the reality is somewhat less exciting. \"SECSTATE,\" according to another part of the Foreign Affairs Manual, is the \"location indicator\" for the entire State Department, including the Peace Corps.", "About 1.4 million cables a year are addressed that way.", "Here\u2019s how Clinton explained it to the House Foreign Affairs Committee in January: \"They are all addressed to me. They do not all come to me.
