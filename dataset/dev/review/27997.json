In an opinion piece for NBC News, columnist Robert Schlesinger wrote: \"The fact Miriam Adelson has also made the cut, however, perfectly captures the crassly transactional nature of Donald Trump and his presidency. Because despite whatever adulatory nonsense Trump conjures about Adelson (the White House press release notes her financial support of medical research and Jewish causes), the $133 million [$20 million to Trump's 2016 campaign and $113 million to GOP candidates in the 2018 midterms] elephant in the room is going to make [the] ceremony feel very crowded indeed.\"", "The other Medal of Freedom recipients honored at the ceremony comprised Utah senator Orrin G.
