["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on August 20, 2018", "Rudy Giuliani falsely claimed that when Donald Trump Jr. and other Trump campaign officials agreed to meet Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in June 2016 \u201cthey didn\u2019t know she was a representative of the Russian government.\u201d", "The president\u2019s son agreed to the meeting after he was told he would meet with a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d and was promised \u201cofficial documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] and her dealings with Russia.\u201d", "Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who is now one of President Donald Trump\u2019s private attorneys, made his remarks on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Host Chuck Todd and Giuliani discussed whether the June 9, 2016, meeting with Veselnitskaya represented evidence that the Trump campaign colluded or attempted to collude with Russia.", "Giuliani, Aug. 19: She didn\u2019t represent the Russian government, she\u2019s a private citizen. I don\u2019t even know if they knew she was Russian at the time. All they had was her name.", "Todd:\u00a0They didn\u2019t know she was Russian, I think they knew she was Russian, but ok.", "Giuliani: Well, they knew it when they met with her, not when they set up the meeting. You, you told me, you, you asked me, you know, did they show an intention to do anything with Russians? Well, all they knew is that a woman with a Russian name wanted to meet with them. They didn\u2019t know she was a representative of the Russian government and indeed, she\u2019s not a representative of the Russian government. So, this is much ado about nothing.", "It\u2019s not true that Trump Jr. \u201cdidn\u2019t know she was a representative of the Russian government.\u201d", "Let\u2019s recap exactly what the president\u2019s eldest son was told about the meeting.", "As we have written, emails later released by Trump Jr.\u00a0show that he was expecting to talk with a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d who was going to provide \u201cvery useful\u201d information on Clinton from the Russian government.", "A\u00a0June 3, 2016, email\u00a0from music publicist Rob Goldstone said that Russian pop star Emin Agalarov had asked Goldstone to contact Trump Jr. on behalf of his father,\u00a0Aras Agalarov, a Russian real estate developer who\u00a0has ties to\u00a0Donald Trump Sr., including his 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.", "\u201cThe Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,\u201d Goldstone wrote in the June 3, 2016, email. \u201cThis is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump \u2014\u00a0helped along by Aras and Emin.\u201d", "Trump Jr. responded minutes later, saying that \u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d", "Four days later, Goldstone\u00a0emailed again\u00a0to \u201cschedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.\u201d Shortly after, Trump Jr. suggested a time and place for the meeting, saying, \u201cHow about 3 at our offices? Thanks rob appreciate you helping set it up.\u201d", "On June 9, 2016,\u00a0Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, then-Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and now senior adviser, met with Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York.\u00a0Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian American lobbyist,\u00a0Ike Kaveladze, a Russian real estate company executive, and\u00a0Anatoli Samochornov, a translator and a former State Department contractor, also attended the meeting.", "There is no evidence to date that shows\u00a0Veselnitskaya provided any incriminating information at that Trump Tower meeting, and there is dispute over whether she is a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d or an attorney who works closely with Russian government officials.", "In\u00a0testimony last year\u00a0before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Veselnitskaya said, \u201cI would be honored to be an attorney of the Russian Government, but I do not work for the Government of Russia.\u201d But the Associated Press reviewed documents earlier this year that it said showed Veselnitskaya \u201cworked more closely with senior Russian government officials than she previously let on.\u201d", "Regardless, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the president\u2019s son agreed to the meeting after he was promised dirt on Clinton from a Russian government official \u2014 contrary to Giuliani\u2019s claim.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
