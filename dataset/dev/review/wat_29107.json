["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "The Democratic political playbook has a new page that is getting flipped to the most in 2010\u2014running against Wall Street. Whenever possible this year Democratic candidates are linking their Republican opponents to one of the primary bogeymen for the country\u2019s economic recession.\n\nThe Ohio Democratic Party uses this tactic in a web ad focused on former U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, the Republican candidate for Ohio attorney general, even going so far as to call him a \"lap dog\" for Wall Street. The ODP attack rolls everything bad about Wall Street into one big ball evoking big banks, Wall Street villain and convicted swindler Bernie Madoff and predatory lenders.\n\nThe video says that while in Congress, DeWine \"took $1.9 million from big banks. DeWine supported legislation that helped Bernie Madoff make millions. He protected predatory lenders while families lost their homes.\"\n\nPolitiFact Ohio decided to dig into these claims that paint DeWine as a pawn of the Wall Street elite.\n\nThe most straightforward one is that DeWine took $1.9 million from \"big banks.\"\n\nODP officials say it\u2019s easy to get $1.9 million. Just add up DeWine\u2019s career fundraising totals on Open secrets.org \u2014 the handy federal fundraising tracker from the independent Center for Responsive Politics \u2014 as well as more than $62,000 raised in the current AG\u2019s race.\n\nWhile the math checks out, you can get to the $1.9 million figure only by adding in money not only from commercial banks ($595,677) but also securities and investment firms ($726,375), miscellaneous financial institutions ($348,548) as well as finance and credit card companies ($237,750).\n\nThe \"big bank\" claim need a pretty big tent to fit all of the qualifying financial institutions in its shade.\n\nMeanwhile, the ODP claim that DeWine \"helped Madoff make millions\" can be traced to three \"yes\" votes the Republican cast in 1995 for a bill known as the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.\n\nDeWine joined 48 Republicans and 20 Democrats in the Senate. The legislation raised the burden of proof lawyers in private practice would have to show in cases of corporate fraud.\n\nThat means that DeWine\u2019s vote was \"helping Madoff make millions\" because it handcuffed private attorneys from pursuing claims as concerns surfaced \"as early as 1999\" that Madoff was operating a Ponzi scheme, the ODP argues in an e-mail.\n\nEven if that\u2019s true \u2014 and it\u2019s certainly open to debate \u2014 the timing of the concerns about Madoff\u2019s operation don\u2019t square with the timeline as presented by the Ohio Democratic Party.\n\nIn a 477-page report issued in 2009, SEC Inspector General David Kotz found that substantive complaints against Madoff were filed as far back as 1992 \u2014 three years before DeWine voted to overhaul the law.\n\nThat reports states that a total of \"three examinations and two investigations\" were conducted by SEC officials but that \"a thorough and competent investigation or examination was never performed.\"\n\nMost incredibly, SEC officials even failed to take the most basic of steps to check up on Madoff. \"At no time did the SEC ever verify Madoff\u2019s trading through an independent third-party, and in fact, never actually conducted a Ponzi scheme examination or investigation of Madoff,\" states Kotz\u2019s report.\n\nMadoff himself called it \"astonishing\" that the check wasn\u2019t done. \"They never even looked at my stock records,\" he told Kotz for his report, according to a December 2009 story in the New York Daily News. \"It would have been easy for them to see. If you\u2019re looking at a Ponzi scheme, it\u2019s the first thing you do.\"\n\nClearly, the overriding reason that Madoff went undetected for so long is because the federal officials supposed to watch over him dropped the ball again and again.\n\nIs it possible that a private attorney could have brought forward an investigation that brought Madoff to justice if the law hadn\u2019t been changed in 1995? Yes, it is possible, but it\u2019s far from a sure thing, especially considering that the old law was in place for three years after initial concerns surfaced about Madoff.\n\nBesides, the law change doesn\u2019t seem to quite equal \"helping make Madoff money,\" even if you conclude he would have been caught earlier if the old law had been in place.\n\nLastly, the ODP accuses DeWine of helping \"to protect predatory lenders while families lost their homes.\"\n\nThat charge references a pair of 2001 tabling votes that DeWine made during the debate over the Bankruptcy Reform Act, which never became law because the differences between the House and Senate versions were never reconciled.\n\nAt that time, DeWine, 48 other Republicans and 15 Democrats blocked an amendment requiring that credit card companies disclose more information to consumers and giving stiffer penalties for predatory lenders. The other amendment that DeWine tried unsuccessfully to table prevented predatory lenders who violated the Truth in Lending Act from filing for bankruptcy to dodge claims.\n\nThose votes were at a time when the Ohio Democratic Party says \"families lost their homes\" in a reference to the foreclosure crisis that has walloped the state, including a record-high 89,053 foreclosure cases in 2009.\n\nHowever, Ohio Supreme Court statistics on foreclosures show only 43,419 in 2001.\n\nSo while certainly some families were among those who lost their homes in 2001, the foreclosure numbers were about half the record-breaking foreclosure numbers that have hit the state in recent years with upwards of 80,000 a year since 2007. By then, DeWine wasn\u2019t even a senator.\n\nAdd it up, and the scorecard for the Ohio Democratic Party is far from spotless.", "We rate the Ohio Democratic Party\u2019s claims as Barely True.", "Comment on this item.", "Ohio Democratic Party web ad\n\nE-mail on Aug. 31, 2010 from Seth Bringman, Ohio Democratic Party spokesman.\n\nOpen secrets.org campaign finance database information on DeWine\n\nOhio Supreme Court foreclosure statistics found on page 53 of this PDF\n\nSEC Inspector General David Kotz\u2019s report on botched Bernie Madoff investigations\n\nWashington Post database of Congressional votes\n\nNew York Daily News article on Madoff, Oct. 31, 2009 edition", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
