["About this rating", "The standards for creating domain names on the Internet (numbers and letters only; no spaces or punctuation marks other than a hyphen) have led to some interesting combinations when operations with multi-word names eschew the use of hyphens and instead run the words of their names together.  One of our favorite examples is who represents?, a web site for looking up information about which agents, managers, and publicists represent various actors \u2014 their domain name could, at first glance, be taken as a place for web surfers to go when trying to find the perfect gift for that special hooker: whorepresents.com.", "The \"Who represents?\" site prompted recent mention of a similarly humorous domain naming gaffe in the Sydney Morning Herald's \"Column 8\":", "The web address of Who Represents reminded David Warrell, of the University of NSW, of a programming advice and discussion web site he frequently called, Experts Exchange. \"For a surprisingly long time, their address was www.expertsexchange.com.

See this rumor collected from the internet in 2003:", "Powergen are starting up in Italy for electricity. They wanted to publicise their services and launched a website. Bear in mind that this was created by Italian developers for an English company.", "But the folks at Powergen maintained that they had nothing to do with the choice of domain name and didn't even have an Italian division. The powergenitalia.com domain apparently hosts the web site of a real Italian company (Powergen Italia) which sells specialized battery products.", "Richardson, Tim. \u00a0 \"Powergen Denies Ties with Powergenitalia.\"\n \u00a0 \u00a0 The Register. \u00a0 18 June 2003.", "The Sydney Morning Herald. \u00a0 \"Column 8.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 13 May 2003.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
