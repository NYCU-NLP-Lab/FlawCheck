But does the country have that many privately owned generators?", "Africa Check contacted the show for the source of the presenter\u2019s figures. \u201cBongani said he was told this information by a friend of his who works in Nigeria, who got his information from a presentation made by solar energy solutions company, Lumos,\u201d a producer told us.", "After weeks of reaching out to Lumos, they told us they were \u201cnot familiar\u201d with the presentation.", "Without any reference data, we searched for available figures on generators owned by Nigerians.", "In 2018, Nigerians spent about N145 billion (US$477 million based on the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s official exchange rate of N306 to the dollar) to import all types of generators.", "This is according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the country\u2019s official data agency.

Some 31.8% said they owned generators.", "Multiplying this share by the country\u2019s total households would give the closest estimate of how many generators Nigerians own, Adekunle said.", "But Nigeria\u2019s population is sharply disputed. The last official count was in 2006 and showed an estimated 28 million regular households.", "The Energy Commission of Nigeria is the state agency responsible for developing the country\u2019s energy supply.", "But it hasn\u2019t researched the number of generators in Nigeria, senior agency official Okon Ekpenyong told Africa Check.", "\u201cIt would be hard to get the data and involves a lot of work. We do not have data on this claim,\u201d he said.", "\u201cBefore you can confidently say there are 100 million generators in private hands, one would need to support it with evidence.\u201d", "The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, which regulates energy supply in the country, are yet to reply to our query on whether they have this data.", "What was not in doubt was that inadequate supply from the national grid meant many Nigerians have had to resort to generators, Oluremi Akindele told Africa Check.", "He is a senior lecturer in the department of urban and regional planning at the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology.", "South Africans should make the best of a bad electricity solution, a popular radio host said during a recent bout of power outages.", "Generators were one option, 702 radio\u2019s Bongani Bingwa said, adding that Nigeria had 100 million generators in private hands.", "Electricity supply is a challenge in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, leading many to turn to generators.
