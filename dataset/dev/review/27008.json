It was one of those photos, with Casey giving a thumbs-up outside of the White House, that was used in the meme.", "Casey had posted the photos with this caption: \u201cEvropa has landed at the White House!\u201d Later that day, he posted a tweet that said: \u201cTO CLARIFY: I attended the White House during a tour, for which tickets are freely available to the public.\u201d", "We are unable to check White House visitor logs because the Trump administration doesn\u2019t make them public, and our request for comment from the administration wasn\u2019t answered. However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency: \u201cHe was one of more than twenty-five thousand people who came to the White House Fall Garden Tour, which is open to the public. Free tickets are made available to anyone who wants to attend.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Sanders, Sarah.
