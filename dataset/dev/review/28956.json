["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on August 1, 2016", "Hillary Clinton wrongly claimed that FBI Director James Comey found her public statements about not sending or receiving classified email on her private server to be \u201ctruthful.\u201d", "On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Clinton had been asked about her public statements that \u201cthere is no classified materials\u201d among the emails she sent and received using a personal email account and server while she was secretary of state. Clinton claimed Comey \u201csaid my answers were truthful.\u201d", "To the contrary, Comey\u00a0told Congress, \u201cThere was classified material emailed,\u201d when he was specifically asked about Clinton\u2019s statements.", "Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, is parsing Comey\u2019s words. The FBI director did say in a congressional hearing that \u201cwe have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI.\u201d But when asked whether Clinton had been truthful with the American public, Comey responded, \u201cThat\u2019s a question I\u2019m not qualified to answer. I can speak about what she said to the FBI.\u201d", "In that same hearing, however, Comey clearly contradicted Clinton\u2019s public statements, and that\u2019s what she was asked about on Fox News.", "Here\u2019s the exchange on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d between Clinton and host Chris Wallace, who began by playing a clip of Clinton speaking on three different occasions in 2015:", "Wallace, July 31: I want to ask about one aspect, what you told the American people.", "Video clip, Clinton:\u00a0I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified materials.", "I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time.", "I had not sent classified material nor received anything marked classified.", "(End video clip)", "Wallace: After a long investigation, FBI Director James Comey said none of those things that you told the American public were true.", "Clinton: Chris, that\u2019s not what I heard Director Comey say, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity, in my view, clarify.\u00a0Director Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I\u2019ve said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails.\u00a0I was communicating with over 300 people in my emailing. They certainly did not believe and had no reason to believe that what they were sending was classified.\u00a0Now, in retrospect, different agencies come in and say, well, it should have been, but that\u2019s not what was happening in real time.", "Wallace: But in a congressional hearing on July 7th, Director Comey directly contradicted what you had told the public.", "Video clip,\u00a0Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.: Secretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her emails either sent or received. Was that true?", "James Comey, FBI director: That\u2019s not true. \u2026", "Gowdy:\u00a0Secretary Clinton said, \u201cI did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. \u00a0There is no classified material.\u201d Was that true?", "Comey:\u00a0There was classified material emailed.", "(End video clip)", "Clinton told Wallace that \u201cthere were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails.\u201d That\u2019s true, but hardly the whole story. As we have written before, here\u2019s what we know about Clinton\u2019s emails and classified material from the FBI investigation and Comey\u2019s statements:", "As the clip of the July 7 House Oversight Committee\u00a0hearing shows, Comey was asked\u00a0by Rep. Trey Gowdy whether it was true, as Clinton said, that there was \u201cnothing marked classified\u201d in her emails. Comey responded, \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d He went on to say that \u201cthere were a small number of portion markings on, I think, three of the documents.\u201d", "In that hearing, Comey also said that those three emails weren\u2019t properly marked and could have been missed by Clinton. State Department spokesman John Kirby said in press briefings on July 6 and 7 that the department believes two of the emails were wrongly marked as confidential. Kirby said that the emails were \u201ccall sheets\u201d \u2014 information to be used when talking to foreign leaders \u2014 and a portion of those\u00a0are marked as \u201cconfidential\u201d until\u00a0a secretary of state decides whether or not to call the leaders in question. Kirby said that it appears Clinton had made the decision to place those two calls, so the \u201cconfidential\u201d markings should have been removed. (For more on those emails, see our July 7 story \u201cRevisiting Clinton and Classified Information.\u201d)", "We don\u2019t know anything about the third email that was marked classified, and there were many more emails that were classified at the time they were sent or received, even though they weren\u2019t marked, Comey has said.", "In fact, Comey said in his statement on the FBI investigation:\u00a0\u201cAlthough we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of the classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\u201d", "On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Clinton pinpointed one\u00a0statement by Comey and ignored others in wrongly claiming\u00a0the FBI director had backed up her assertions to the American public that she never sent or received classified material.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ab4e9c20-bd34-451b-af44-a993bf071ef5", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
