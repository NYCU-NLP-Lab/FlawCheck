["An article, shared over 14,000 times on social media, trumpeted an imaginary ban on Christianity in Canada\u2019s classrooms, because \u201cthe Bible does not support the Trudeau government\u2019s vision of \u2018diversity\u2019 and is therefore \u2018harmful\u2019 to LGBT and Muslim students.\u201d", "Your News Wire was alluding to a recent legal battle between the British Columbia-based Trinity Western University (TWU), an Evangelical Christian institution, and several provincial law societies over the university\u2019s proposed law school.", "In a judgement rendered on June 15, 2018, the Supreme Court of Canada sided 7-2 with the Law Society of Upper Canada and the Law Society of British Columbia in their decision not to grant an accreditation to TWU\u2019s proposed law school.", "The law societies argued that TWU should not be accredited because of a clause in the mandatory community covenant that its students must abide by. In signing, students agree to abstain from \u201csexual intimacy that violates the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman.\u201d", "This clause was deemed discriminatory by the law societies as it implied that any sexually active LGBTQ student -- married or not -- would be in breach of the covenant and potentially exposed to expulsion.", "Trinity Western appealed the decision on the grounds that preventing the school from promoting its values infringed on its religious rights. It argued TWU is a private institution whose students choose to sign the covenant based on Biblical values. However, the Supreme Court of Canada decided it was \u201cproportionate and reasonable\u201d to limit religious rights to guarantee equal access to LGBTQ students.", "Beyond questions of religious freedom and access to services, Canada did not ban Christianity from its classrooms. Whether at the primary, secondary or postsecondary level, private Christian schools are legal, and sometimes even funded by the state.", "At the primary and secondary level, over 50 Christian school boards in Canada have a separate status and are publicly funded, in addition to Christian private schools. At the postsecondary level, Christian Higher Education Canada (CHEC), an association of Christian higher learning institutions, counts 34 private institutions.", "The claim that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision stemmed from the fact that \u201cthe Bible does not support the Trudeau government\u2019s vision of \u2018diversity\u2019 and is therefore \u2018harmful\u2019 to LGBT and Muslim students\u201d is equally erroneous.", "\u201cThe Supreme Court of Canada is an independent judicial body that is above government interference in its decision-making.\u201d Cheryl Mines, director of the David Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights at the University of Toronto, told AFP.", "The Canadian prime minister does appoint members of the nine judge court, but only after an independent committee reviews candidates and makes recommendations. Since Justin Trudeau came into office in 2015, he has appointed two Supreme Court justices, which would not have been enough to tip the 7-2 verdict had another prime minister \u00a0appointed different judges.", "Additionally, the two court documents do not mention Muslims.", "The Your News Wire article foretells that \u201cChristian colleges and universities will be stripped of their accreditation if they continue to promote Biblical standards and values.\u201d", "No authority in Canada can decree a country-wide rule on education. The Constitution Act of 1867 made education a provincial matter. Furthermore, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in June 2018 only concerned TWU.", "This ruling did not ease the concerns of Michael Pawelke, vice-chair of CHEC. He told AFP, \u201cI do think there\u2019s a concern in Christian higher education circles, and in institutions of Christian higher learning that there may be other sectors of accreditation or certification that may be challenged.\u201d", "The Asper Center\u2019s Mines told AFP that challenges to already existing schools are \u201cnot likely because the decision to accredit them has already been made,\u201d but added that professional bodies may look at the TWU decision for guidance.", "The TWU law school was originally due to host its first 60-student cohort in 2015, and would have been the first private law school in Canada.", "When contacted by AFP, Earl Phillips, lawyer and would-be executive director of the TWU law school, did not rule out the possibility that the law school would open in the future.", "Phillips declined to comment on the Your News Wire interpretation of the Supreme Court ruling.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
