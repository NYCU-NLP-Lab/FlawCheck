I\u2019d rather have static. It\u2019s a transitional period, and I\u2019m super aware of that. I think it would be inappropriate to be in France with an American flag. It would feel weird to me now \u2014 it didn\u2019t feel weird in 2013.\u201d", "There were several legitimate\u00a0news stories about that interview.", "However, Facebook users have flagged a number of fake news stories that have altered Del Ray\u2019s statements and attributed them to other music artists and celebrities.", "Americantoday.us published a story on July 23 with the bogus headline \u201cKardashians Claim They Feel \u2018Unsafe\u2019 in Trump\u2019s America: \u2018Can\u2019t Even Look at an American Flag Anymore.'\u201d Another post on that website wrongly attributes the same quotes to rapper Kanye West, who met with Trump during the transition period and has said that he would have voted for Trump if he voted.", "And a July 27 headline on Americanpresidentdonaldj-trump.com falsely claims that it was singer and actress Rihanna who made those statements.", "Readers may have noticed that something was off about the stories, which are riddled with grammatical mistakes in some cases.", "For example, the story about Kim Kardashian claims that she removed the American flag from her \u201ctour videos\u201d and \u201cshows and performances,\u201d which doesn\u2019t make sense. Kardashian is a reality TV star and businesswoman, not a concert performer.", "Also, in the Kanye West version, the author didn\u2019t even bother to change all of the feminine pronouns to masculine ones. At one point, the story says of West: \u201cShe is so traumatized with our new president that she can\u2019t bear to look at our country\u2019s flag any longer.\u201d", "And the headline about Rihanna isn\u2019t supported by the body of its story, which actually says \u201cGrammy-nominated recording artist Lana Del Rey is not a real patriot.\u201d", "Some of the sites even have disclaimers confirming that their content is unreliable.", "Ushealthyadvisor.com, which also published the story about Kim Kardashian, has a disclaimer page that says: \u201cNo guarantee is given that the information provided in this Web site is correct, complete, and up-to-date.\u201d", "And the Americantoday.us terms and conditions page says: \u201cThe information and all other materials on this site are provided for general information purposes only and do not constitute professional advice.
