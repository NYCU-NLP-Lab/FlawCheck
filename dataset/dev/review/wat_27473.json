In 2012, the last year data was available for a majority of the cities, the rate was 9.8 \u2013 a 59 percent drop just as Fulton touted in the press release.", "Data from Georgia\u2019s Department of Public Health back up those figures on the mortality rate and also provide the specific numbers of deaths.", "The number of people dying annually from HIV/AIDS in Fulton County dropped from 195 to 96 in those eight years, a 51 percent decline.", "Further bolstering Fulton\u2019s claim are figures showing continued drops in deaths for the past two years.", "By 2014, 80 people in Fulton had died from HIV or AIDS, a rate of 8 percent. That\u2019s a 59 percent decline by number or a 66.8 percent decrease in rate from the peak a decade ago.", "Statewide, HIV/AIDS deaths also declined during this period by 47 percent said Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health.", "The state death rate from HIV/AIDS was 7.9 per 100,000 in 2004 and 4.2 in 2012, a 47 percent drop, she said.", "The context", "All of this is to say, Fulton is on target with its figures. Missing from the press release, though, was the context that Atlanta remains in the top 5 cities for HIV-related deaths (and top 3 for new infections).", "And, its 10 per 100,000 mortality rate is five times greater than the national average of 2.", "\"It\u2019s a big improvement but obviously some big improvements still need to be made,\" said Chrissie Juliano, director of the Big Cities Health Coalition. \"We know from other sources that challenges remain in Atlanta-Fulton County regarding HIV and AIDS.\"", "Fulton is making headway. It completed an internal audit in October that found mismanagement and bureaucratic delays cost it the nearly $9 million in federal money to fight HIV.", "It has since replaced the health department director and strengthened oversight of its grants.", "Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University\u2019s Rollins School of Public Health, cautioned against reading too much into Atlanta\u2019s ranking in comparison to national mortality rates.", "He added that it would not be \"informative\" to directly compare Atlanta, or any city, to the overall U.S. rates on HIV mortality.", "\"HIV-related deaths are much higher in cities, because people living with HIV are more concentrated in cities,\" Sullivan said. \u00a0\"The high HIV-related mortality rate reflects the high impact of HIV in Atlanta.\"", "Our ruling", "At a time when new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths are down globally, Fulton County touted a report that showed its mortality rate dropped 59 percent from a peak in 2004.", "The report, and state data, back up the dramatic decline. While Atlanta remains in the top five cities in the nation for such deaths and still struggles with executing prevention programs, it also has seen the mortality rate drop since the report.", "We rate the statement True.", "World Health Organization.
