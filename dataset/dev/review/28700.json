["We found few factual distortions on the night Joe Biden officially became the party's presidential nominee.", "By Brooks Jackson, Lori Robertson and Rem Rieder", "Posted on August 19, 2020", "It was another unconventional night for fact-checkers at the truncated Democratic National Convention that has been forced to go virtual because of the coronavirus pandemic.", "But we found a few statements to write about, including a misleading claim about the U.S. unemployment rate and auto industry bailout claims that don\u2019t tell the whole story.", "On the night the Democratic Party formally nominated former Vice President Joe Biden as the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nominee, two former U.S. presidents spoke \u2014 Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.", "Clinton, who uncharacteristically spoke for less than five minutes, made a misleading claim when he said that the U.S. is \u201cthe only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple\u201d because of President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "It\u2019s true that the unemployment rates listed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show the U.S. jobless rate nearly tripling between January and the most recent month on record. The next-largest increase was a near-doubling of the rate in Canada.", "But his comparison is meaningless \u2014 rather like comparing apples to kumquats. That\u2019s because the U.S. counts a laid-off worker as \u201cunemployed\u201d even if the layoff is expected to be temporary \u2014 while many others do not. In July, those on \u201ctemporary layoff\u201d accounted for 56% of all those counted as \u201cunemployed\u201d in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "Clinton referred specifically to one of the countries that doesn\u2019t include those temporarily laid off in their count of the jobless, saying the U.S. rate is \u201ctwo and a half times the United Kingdom\u2019s.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that the U.K. Office for National Statistics currently lists its unemployment rate as only 3.9% compared with the U.S. rate of 10.2%. But, unlike the U.S., the U.K. doesn\u2019t count those on temporary layoff as unemployed.", "U.K. Office for National Statistics, August: Workers furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme \u2026 have a reasonable expectation of returning to their jobs after a temporary period of absence. Therefore they are classified as employed.", "And that\u2019s not the only factor making Clinton\u2019s comparison misleading. Other countries \u2014 such as Germany \u2014 have met the COVID-19 crisis by subsidizing employers to keep workers on the payroll even when there is less work to do. In the U.S., the main approach has been to increase benefits paid to laid-off workers through unemployment insurance.", "The OECD Employment Outlook 2020, which was released in July, notes that the U.S. has had a far higher unemployment rate during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with other OECD countries, saying the difference in rates \u201creflects fundamental differences in countries\u2019 policy mix to cushion the economic and social effects of the crisis.\u201d", "\u201cThe United States are strongly relying on unemployment insurance benefits to secure the income of workers who lose their jobs, even in the case of a temporary crisis,\u201d the report said. \u201cMeanwhile, other OECD countries, not just in Europe, are making heavy use of job retention schemes, which allow companies to cut hours of work, or even halt work entirely, while keeping their workers attached.\u201d", "Michigan lawmakers praised Biden for his role in helping to rescue the auto industry after the Great Recession. It\u2019s worth noting that while this remains a signature accomplishment of the Obama administration, the effort began under former President George W. Bush.", "In a keynote address featuring several young Democratic politicians, Michigan state Rep. Mari Manoogian said: \u201cWhen the auto industry was going under, Joe stuck his neck out to protect it and helped save 1.5 million auto jobs.\u201d Later, during the roll call of the states, Michigan U.S. Sen. Gary Peters said, \u201cMichigan auto workers are the best in the world. But we\u2019d be nowhere without Joe Biden. And a lot of folks wanted to let Detroit go bankrupt. But Joe Biden believed in us, and together we fought to save our auto industry.\u201d", "As we\u2019ve explained before, the auto industry effort began on Dec. 19, 2008, when then-President Bush announced that his administration would provide General Motors and Chrysler with $13.4 billion in loans under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, with another $4 billion to GM to come once Congress approved releasing the second half of the TARP money. The money came with strings, most notably the requirement that the automakers come up with a long-term viability plan by March 31, 2009.", "Fast-forward to March 30, 2009, when then-President Barack Obama rejected the companies\u2019 viability plans, but then announced a\u00a0bankruptcy plan for Chrysler on April 30 and a\u00a0GM bankruptcy plan on June 1. Those plans allowed the automakers to restructure and get more federal aid.", "In the end, the Treasury Department invested about $80 billion in the industry and recouped most of it. Treasury says the rescue of the industry ended up costing the government $9.3 billion.", "As for Manoogian\u2019s claim that Biden \u201chelped save 1.5 million auto jobs,\u201d that\u2019s backed up by an estimate from the Center for Automotive Research. The group\u2019s 2013 report said the auto bailout saved 1.5 million jobs in 2010, including those at GM, Chrysler, auto suppliers and \u201cspin-off employment losses\u201d due to \u201creduced spending in the U.S. economy.\u201d", "The report credited both the Bush and Obama administrations.", "\u201cTwo consecutive executive administrations in Washington decided in late 2008 and early 2009 that the consequences of the potential losses and outcomes to the U.S. economy and people described above were worth avoiding through a federal intervention,\u201d the report said. \u201cCAR is confident that in the years ahead, this peacetime intervention in the private sector by the U.S. government will be seen as one of the most successful in U.S. economic history.\u201d", "In welcoming viewers to the second night of the convention, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said of the Democrats, \u201cUnlike the president, we\u2019ve never called COVID-19 a hoax.\u201d As we have written, it is true that Trump said the novel coronavirus was the Democrats\u2019\u00a0\u201cnew hoax.\u201d But the president has said he was talking about the Democrats\u2019 criticism of how he had handled the pandemic, not the disease itself.", "At a political rally on Feb. 28 in South Carolina, Trump said, \u201cNow the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, \u2018How\u2019s President Trump doing?\u2019 They go, \u2018Oh, not good, not good.\u2019 They have no clue.\u201d", "Then the president, who often\u00a0dismissed\u00a0special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation as a hoax, made his \u201cnew hoax\u201d remark.", "Trump, Feb. 28: One of my people came up to me and said, \u201cMr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.\u201d That didn\u2019t work out too well. They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They\u2019d been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning. They lost. It\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.", "Democrats quickly seized on the remark. Joe Biden, now the Democratic presidential nominee, described the president\u2019s comments as \u201cabsolutely bizarre.\u201d", "\u201cLook, this is a serious, serious problem,\u201d Biden\u00a0told\u00a0MSNBC on Feb. 29. \u201cIt\u2019s able to be solved, but it requires us to be absolutely level-headed and let the scientists have the lead in all of this. But for him to start talking about it being a hoax is absolutely dangerous. It\u2019s just not a decent way to act.\u201d", "In the wake of the criticism, Trump\u00a0said\u00a0at a press conference on Feb. 29 that he used the term \u201choax\u201d to refer not to the coronavirus itself but to Democrats\u2019 criticism of how his administration had responded to it.", "Asked if he regretted using that particular word, he replied: \u201cNo, no, no. \u2018Hoax\u2019 referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we\u2019ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them, not \u2014 I\u2019m not talking about what\u2019s happening here; I\u2019m talking what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s the hoax. That\u2019s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it\u2019s the impeachment hoax or the \u2018Russia, Russia, Russia\u2019 hoax. This is what I\u2019m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
