Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted a verse from the Bible that urged people to rise above the faults they see in others.", "\"Put on then, as God\u2019s chosen ones, holy and beloved, heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience,\" Rubio wrote. \"Forgiving one another if one has a grievance against another; as the Lord has forgiven you, so must you also do.\"", "By 10:45 a.m., Rubio struck a different tone.", "\"Dr. Fauci lied about masks in March,\" Rubio tweeted. \"Dr. Fauci has been distorting the level of vaccination needed for herd immunity.\"", "Dr. Fauci lied about masks in March Dr. Fauci has been distorting the level of vaccination needed for herd immunityIt isn\u2019t just himMany in elite bubbles believe the American public doesn\u2019t know \u201cwhat\u2019s good for them\u201d so they need to be tricked into \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d", "Lying involves the intent to deceive, and the claim that Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, lied about masks is familiar ground for fact-checkers. It doesn\u2019t hold up.", "We have looked at what Fauci has said at different points during the pandemic, and his guidance has changed. The question is: Why?", "Top government agencies such as the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shifted their policies on masks based on new findings about the novel coronavirus. It wasn\u2019t until April 3 that the CDC urged everyone to wear one.", "Before then, the message on masks was primarily about preserving a limited supply for health care workers, who were at especially high risk of exposure.", "Rubio\u2019s tweet specifically referred to what Fauci said in March. That month, Fauci gave two high-profile interviews. In the first one, which occurred days before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, Fauci pushed back against the idea of everyone in the U.S. needing to wear masks.", "It is worth reading\u00a0Fauci\u2019s exact words from his March 8 interview on CBS's \"60 Minutes.\":", "FAUCI: The masks are important for someone who's infected to prevent them from infecting someone else. Now, when you see people and look at the films in China and South Korea, whatever, and everybody's wearing a mask. Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.", "HOST: You're sure of this, because people are listening really closely to this.", "FAUCI: Right. Now people should not be walk\u2014 there's no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.", "And often there are unintended consequences. People keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.", "HOST: And you can get some schmutz sort of staying inside there.", "FAUCI: Of course, but when you think \"masks,\" you should think of health care providers needing them and people who are ill. The people \u2014 when you look at the films of countries, and you see 85% of the people wearing masks, that's fine. That's fine. I'm not against it.

And he said the main point was to preserve masks for those who were already ill and people providing care.", "On March 27, Fauci spoke to a San Francisco NBC affiliate. He said given the shortage of masks, the general public ranked last behind doctors and nurses, and people who are infected.", "\"When we say you don't need to wear a mask, what we're really saying is make sure you prioritize it first for the people who need the mask,\" Fauci said. \"In a perfect world, if you had all the masks you wanted, then you could get some degree of protection, but make sure you prioritize it well.\"", "March was a pivotal month for understanding the disease. On March 1, the country had seen eight deaths. On March 31, the figure stood at more than 4,300.", "When public officials talked about masks, they were talking about high-quality, hospital grade masks. In February and March, when the spread of the virus was still limited in the U.S., the mask shortage was a top concern.", "On March 2, the FDA and CDC were saying \"There is no added health benefit to the general American public to wear a respiratory protective device, such as an N95 respirator.

This is incorrect in several ways.", "Fauci did say, \"there is no reason to be walking around with a mask,\" but to call that lying takes Fauci\u2019s words out of context.
