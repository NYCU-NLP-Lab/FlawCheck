Some Quranic verses are read over the food to either pray to Allah to cure diseases or make a wish to Him. Some blow air and some don\u2019t. It\u2019s Fatiha where you take out some food and ask for Barkat (good fortune).\u201d He further added that we see a lot of people gathering outside mosques with sick children after the prayers are said. Worshippers who step out of the mosque after reading namaz are asked to blow air over these children as it is believed that it has Barkat bestowed by Allah. It may be noted that this is an archaic practice followed by very few people.", "This video explains how a person can recite Surah Al-Fatihah: \u201cYou can recite certain Ayat, Ayat Al-Kursi or Surat Al-Fatihah or whatever you can read of the Quran on the water then drink it.
