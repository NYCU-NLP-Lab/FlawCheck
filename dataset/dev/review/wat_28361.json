R. Timothy Ziemer to lead the group. Ziemer had\u00a0coordinated\u00a0the\u00a0President\u2019s Malaria Initiative\u00a0under both President George W. Bush and Obama.", "Ziemer left abruptly a little over a year later just as a new\u00a0Ebola\u00a0outbreak\u00a0was starting in Congo, and he wasn\u2019t replaced.", "Numerous\u00a0experts\u00a0and\u00a0groups\u00a0at the time had cautioned against doing away with that position, but getting rid of it didn\u2019t necessarily mean that\u00a0everyone who was part of the team was fired or that all of its functions ceased.", "Responding to\u00a0claims\u00a0at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic that the office had been dissolved, Tim Morrison, former senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense for the NSC, said that the group had been reorganized. He\u00a0wrote\u00a0in the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0on March 16 that the administration \u201ccreate[d] the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate, which was the result of consolidating three directorates into one, given the obvious overlap between arms control and nonproliferation, weapons of mass destruction terrorism, and global health and biodefense. It is this reorganization that critics have misconstrued or intentionally misrepresented.\u201d", "Morrison led that directorate for a year, he wrote, before leaving that position. Another official replaced him, he said. The administration has decreased staffing at the NSC, something Morrison said was needed after \u201cbloat\u201d under the previous administration.", "Similarly, John Bolton, who was the national security adviser at the time Ziemer left, said on\u00a0Twitter in March:\u00a0\u201cClaims that streamlining NSC structures impaired our nation\u2019s bio defense are false. Global health remained a top NSC priority, and its expert team was critical to effectively handling the 2018-19 Africa Ebola crisis.\u201d", "Also at the time,\u00a0Beth Cameron, former senior director for the NSC team under Obama,\u00a0wrote\u00a0in the\u00a0Post\u00a0that disbanding that directorate \u201cleft an unclear structure and strategy for coordinating pandemic preparedness and response.\u201d", "Months before the pandemic arose, a\u00a0report\u00a0issued in November 2019 by the\u00a0bipartisan think tank\u00a0Center for Strategic & International Studies\u00a0had recommended that the global health security and biodefense directorate be reinstated. It reasoned, \u201cHealth security is national security. Strong, coherent, senior-level leadership at the National Security Council (NSC) is essential to guarantee effective oversight of global health security and biodefense policy and spending, speed and rigor in decisionmaking, and reliable White House engagement and coordination when dangerous pandemics inevitably strike.\u201d", "The directorate hasn\u2019t been reinstated, but since parts of it have been reorganized elsewhere in the NSC, saying that it was eliminated completely goes too far.", "Pence and Harris had a disagreement on whether Trump would eliminate protections for people with preexisting health conditions. We found fault with both.", "\u201cDonald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and I said it before and it bears repeating,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThis means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with preexisting conditions.\u201d Pence replied, \u201cNo.\u201d", "Harris is correct that\u00a0the\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0supports a lawsuit\u00a0to strike down the ACA, which\u00a0prohibits\u00a0insurers from denying coverage, charging more or excluding coverage of certain conditions based on health status. But she went too far when she said there would be \u201cno more protections, if they win, for people with preexisting conditions,\u201d suggesting everyone with existing health issues would lose all protections.", "Before the ACA, those buying plans on the individual market\u00a0could face denials or higher premiums\u00a0based on their health. But only\u00a06% of the population\u00a0gets coverage on the individual market.", "Nearly half of all Americans have employer-based plans, which could not deny insurance even before the ACA \u2014 except for a limited period for new employees if they had a lapse in coverage.", "Earlier in the debate, Pence said, \u201cPresident Trump and I have a plan to improve health care and protect preexisting conditions for every American.\u201d But no plan has been released.", "The Trump administration has yet to offer a health care plan that would be implemented in place of the ACA. Trump signed\u00a0an executive order on Sept. 24 that said \u201caccess to health insurance despite underlying health conditions should be maintained\u201d even if the ACA were struck down in court. But he hasn\u2019t provided details, and,\u00a0as we have written, the executive order is meaningless without an act of Congress.", "In criticizing Trump on issues of race, Harris revisited a controversy from the first presidential debate, saying that \u201clast week, the president of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists.\u201d", "Pence claimed that was \u201cnot true.\u201d", "Harris continued: \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t have a chance. He didn\u2019t do it, and then he doubled down. And then he said, when pressed, \u2018Stand back, stand by.\u2019\u201d", "Trump didn\u2019t offer a clear condemnation in the debate; Pence then referred to other instances in which he did.", "During the\u00a0Sept. 29 debate\u00a0between Biden and Trump, moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump if he was willing \u201cto condemn white supremacists and militia groups.\u201d Trump\u2019s first response was: \u201cSure, I\u2019m willing to do that.\u201d When pressed by Biden to denounce the Proud Boys, a far-right group, Trump told the group to \u201cstand back and stand by.\u201d", "Here\u2019s the relevant portion of the\u00a0transcript\u00a0from that debate.", "Wallace:\u00a0You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out antifa and other left-wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we\u2019ve seen in Portland.", "Trump:\u00a0Sure, I\u2019m willing to do that.", "Wallace:\u00a0Are you prepared specifically to do it?", "Trump:\u00a0I would say almost everything I see is from the left-wing, not from the right-wing.", "Wallace:\u00a0But what are you saying?", "Trump:\u00a0I\u2019m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.", "Wallace:\u00a0Well, do it, sir.", "Biden:\u00a0Say it, do it, say it.", "Trump:\u00a0What do you want to call them?

Lindsey Graham\u00a0tweeted.", "In an Oct. 1\u00a0interview\u00a0with Sean Hannity, Trump said: \u201cI have said it many times. And let me be clear again. I condemn the KKK. I condemn all white supremacists. I condemn the Proud Boys. I don\u2019t know much about the Proud Boys, almost nothing, but I condemn that.\u201d", "Pence during the vice presidential debate responded to Harris in part by saying that Trump has repeatedly \u201ccondemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\u201d We\u2019ve previously\u00a0documented\u00a0a number of instances in which the president has done so.", "Pence repeated the false claim that the Obama administration left the Strategic National Stockpile \u201cempty.\u201d That\u2019s not so.", "Some personal protective equipment, such as N95 respirator masks, distributed from the stockpile to states during 2009\u2019s H1N1 influenza pandemic\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0restocked.

Net-zero means the amount of greenhouse gases emitted in the U.S. would be matched by the amount sequestered, or removed, from the atmosphere.\u00a0In theory, this allows fossil fuels to be used with carbon capture technologies or other sequestration efforts.", "Pence repeated a false talking point of Trump\u2019s, saying the president \u201csuspended all travel from China\u201d to combat the coronavirus.", "As we\u2019ve written before, the travel restrictions, which went into effect on Feb. 2, were not a total ban as they included exceptions for U.S. citizens, permanent residents and the immediate family members of both.
