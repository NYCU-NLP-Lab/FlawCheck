Those who are vaccinated will wear blue masks, they will be allowed some travel, regulated commerce, automated voting, and be required to practice social distancing.", "The flyer appeared to originate from Utah, as the listed phone number (1-800-456-7707) directs one to the Utah Department of Health\u2019s Coronavirus Information Line.", "We learned that the information on the flyer, with the exception of the helpline number, is false.", "Utah\u2019s official Twitter account for information on the coronavirus responded to the flyer writing, \u201cThere are no restrictions based on whether someone chooses to be immunized or not.\u201d The account added, \u201cThe state of Utah will never require or ask you to wear a certain color of mask to prove you\u2019ve been vaccinated.\u201d", "They directed people to their official website to get more information on COVID-19 vaccines.", "Even though U.S. President-elect Joe Biden said he wanted a nationwide mask requirement in late 2020, he actually has no legal authority to implement one. He can pass such a mandate on federal property.", "Biden later clarified that he would go to governors and \u201curge\u201d them to mandate mask-wearing in their states. If governors refuse, he would go to mayors and counties to get local masking requirements in place around the country. Presently, there is no national mandate to wear masks, though different states and regions have a range of rules including masking in public. At least 38 states have mandates requiring people to wear face coverings in public.", "Given that this flyer has been rejected by the state of Utah and the information on it is untrue, we rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
