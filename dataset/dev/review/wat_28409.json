The connection was drawn because Ron Pelosi, at the time the loan was announced, was serving as an \u201cindependent director\u201d on the board of\u00a0PCG Asset Management \u2014 a subsidiary of Pacific Corporate Group, which had\u00a0invested in SolarReserve.

Kevin Smith, SolarReserve\u2019s CEO at the time, told the news outlet that, while the plant had not yet reached its goal of generating almost 500,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually, he was confident that the target would be met.", "Either way, though, the claim that Ron Pelosi \u201creceived $737m\u201d in \u201ctaxpayer money\u201d simply runs counter to the facts.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cAbout.\u201d InsideClimate News.
