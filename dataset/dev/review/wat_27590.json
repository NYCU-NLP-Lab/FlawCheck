["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on May 11, 2016", "Hillary Clinton went too far when she claimed that Donald Trump said \u201cwe should pull out of NATO.\u201d Trump has said that he would \u201ccertainly look at\u201d pulling the United States out of the international security alliance, because it is \u201cobsolete\u201d and \u201cis costing us a fortune.\u201d But the Clinton campaign provided nothing indicating that Trump advocates pulling out now.", "Trump, who has nearly\u00a0clinched the Republican nomination for president, has been critical of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was established in 1949 by the U.S., Canada and 10 Western European nations to defend against the former Soviet Union. Trump\u2019s main criticisms of NATO, which now has 28 member nations, are that the alliance no longer serves its founding purpose and that it is too costly to the U.S., which pays about 22 percent of direct spending by NATO, the most of any nation, according to budget information. The U.S. also pays a much larger portion of the organization\u2019s indirect costs, NATO says.", "During a campaign speech in Milwaukee on March 28, Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, said that Trump \u201cwants us to pull out of NATO.\u201d That was the week after Trump, during campaign events and interviews with the editorial boards of the Washington Post and the New York Times\u00a0and\u00a0others, talked about the U.S. role in NATO.", "In an interview with CBS News\u2019 John Dickerson that aired May 8, Clinton again claimed that Trump, whom she referred to as a \u201cloose cannon,\u201d wants out of NATO.", "Clinton, May 8: Being a loose cannon is saying we should pull out of NATO, the strongest military alliance in the history of the world and something that we really need to modernize, but not abandon.", "While Trump has gone so far as saying that, as president, he would consider pulling the U.S. out of NATO if it is not restructured, we\u2019ve found no instance of him saying he wants to do so at this point. And the Clinton campaign hasn\u2019t been able to point to an example of Trump saying that either.", "In fact, it was during the interview with the Post, which initially brought attention to Trump\u2019s feelings about NATO, that Trump said that he doesn\u2019t want the U.S. to leave the alliance.", "Charles Lane, Washington Post, March 21:\u00a0So, I\u2019d like to hear you say very specifically, you know, with respect to NATO, what is your ask of these other countries?\u00a0Right, you\u2019ve painted it in very broad terms, but do you have a percent of GDP that they should be spending on defense?\u00a0Tell me more, because it sounds like you want to just pull the U.S. out.", "Trump: No, I don\u2019t want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We\u2019re not a rich country anymore. We\u2019re borrowing, we\u2019re borrowing all of this money. We\u2019re borrowing money from China, which is sort of an amazing situation. But it was a much different thing. NATO is costing us a fortune and yes, we\u2019re protecting Europe with NATO but we\u2019re spending a lot of money. Number one, I think the distribution of costs has to be changed. I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved.", "Later on March 21, during a CNN town hall event with Wolf Blitzer, Trump said the U.S. should \u201creconsider\u201d its role in NATO, especially with concern to how much it\u00a0spends compared with other nations.", "Blitzer: Do you think the United States needs to rethink U.S. involvement in NATO?", "Trump: Yes, because it\u2019s costing us too much money. And frankly they have to put up more money. They\u2019re going to have to put some up also. We\u2019re paying disproportionately. It\u2019s too much. And frankly it\u2019s a different world than it was when we originally conceived of the idea. And everybody got together.", "But we\u2019re taking care of, as an example, the Ukraine. I mean, the countries over there don\u2019t seem to be so interested. We\u2019re the ones taking the brunt of it. So I think we have to reconsider keep NATO, but maybe we have to pay a lot less toward the NATO itself.", "Blitzer: When we say keep NATO, NATO has been around since right after World War II in 1949. It\u2019s been a cornerstone of U.S. national security around the world. NATO allies hear you say that, they\u2019re not going to be happy.", "Trump: Well, they may not be happy but, you know, they have to help us also. It has to be \u2014 we are paying disproportionately. And very importantly if you use Ukraine as an example and that\u2019s a great example, the country surrounding Ukraine, I mean, they don\u2019t seem to care as much about it as we do. So there has to be at least a change in philosophy and there are also has to be a change in the cut out, the money, the spread because it\u2019s too much.", "Blitzer: So you\u2019re really suggesting the United States should decrease its role in NATO?", "Trump: Not decrease its role but certainly decrease the kind of spending. We are spending a tremendous amount in NATO and other people proportionately less. No good.", "Then, on March 25, in an interview with the New York\u00a0Times editorial board, Trump again said that NATO needed to be \u201cchanged\u201d to deal with costs and other issues, such as terrorism.", "Trump, March 25:\u00a0I\u2019ll tell you the problems I have with NATO. Number one, we pay far too much. We are spending \u2014 you know, in fact, they\u2019re even making it so the percentages are greater. NATO is unfair, economically, to us, to the United States. Because it really helps them more so than the United States, and we pay a disproportionate share. Now, I\u2019m a person that \u2014 you notice I talk about economics quite a bit, in these military situations, because it is about economics, because we don\u2019t have money anymore because we\u2019ve been taking care of so many people in so many different forms that we don\u2019t have money \u2014 and countries, and countries. So NATO is something that at the time was excellent. Today, it has to be changed. It has to be changed to include terror. It has to be changed from the standpoint of cost because the United States bears far too much of the cost of NATO.", "It was on March 23, during an interview with\u00a0Bloomberg Politics\u2019 Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, that Trump, when asked, said he would \u201ccertainly look at\u201d getting rid of NATO because it \u201cmay be obsolete\u201d (16:12 in the video).", "Halperin, March 23: Should America be the leader of NATO or not necessarily?", "Trump: I think NATO may be obsolete. NATO was set up a long time ago \u2014 many, many years ago when things were different. Things are different now. We were a rich nation then. We had nothing but money. We had nothing but power. And you know, far more than we have today, in a true sense. And I think NATO \u2014 you have to really examine NATO. And it doesn\u2019t really help us, it\u2019s helping other countries. And I don\u2019t think those other countries appreciate what we\u2019re doing.", "Heilemann: So, just to be clear, you made two slightly different arguments there and I just want to clarify. One of them is that you might want to see the U.S. pay less money into NATO because \u2026", "Trump: That one definitely. That one definitely.", "Heilemann: But it\u2019s possible that NATO is obsolete and should be gotten rid of?", "Trump: It\u2019s possible. It\u2019s possible. I would certainly look at it. And I\u2019d want more help from other people. The one thing definitely \u2014 we\u2019re paying too much. As to whether or not it\u2019s obsolete, I\u2019ll make that determination.", "Then, at a campaign rally in Milwaukee on April 4, Trump said that he wasn\u2019t saying that\u00a0NATO should disband during his interview with CNN\u2019s Blitzer. Instead, he said he meant that if countries \u201ccan\u2019t pay their bills \u2026 they\u2019ve got to go.\u201d", "Trump, April 4: And Wolf Blitzer asked me a question on television. He said, let me just ask you about NATO. And he asked me about it. Now, I haven\u2019t been asked about NATO a lot, but I understand NATO and I understand common sense and I\u2019m, like, a smart person, like many of the people in this room, hopefully all of the people in this room.", "But he asked me about NATO. I said it\u2019s obsolete. This is my first thing. And you know what? I\u2019m the first one. Guys that study NATO and good people, but they study NATO and they say, I don\u2019t believe it, what he just said, I never thought of that. They study it because they\u2019re so into it that they don\u2019t realize.", "Because it was really put there \u2014 you had the Soviet Union and now you have Russia, which is different, but Russia is very powerful, so we can sort of say that\u2019s a balance, so we\u2019ll leave it. But it doesn\u2019t really cover terrorism like it\u2019s supposed to. It doesn\u2019t have the right countries. I mean, many of the countries in there aren\u2019t, you know, that you associate with terrorism.", "And so I said, number one, it\u2019s obsolete. I said, number two, to the best of my knowledge, the United States pays far too much proportionately, and why are we always paying the bills to protect other people?", "And the press, which is so totally dishonest, the press goes headlines the next day \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want NATO, wants to disband.\u201d That\u2019s not what I said. I said you\u2019ve got to pay your bills. And you know what? If they can\u2019t pay their bills, honestly there should be \u2014 they\u2019ve got to go. Because we can\u2019t do this.", "And most recently, in his April 27 foreign policy speech, Trump said that \u201cthe\u00a0U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves\u201d if they are unwilling to pay more.", "Trump, April 27:\u00a0They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only four\u00a0of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia. The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice.", "So, Trump has clearly outlined changes he would like to see made to NATO. And he has said that, under a Trump administration, the U.S. might no longer be a part of the alliance if it isn\u2019t restructured and other nations don\u2019t start to pick up more of the costs. But even that isn\u2019t the same thing as saying that \u201cwe should pull out of NATO,\u201d as Clinton claims Trump said.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9ba92dca-f398-4447-97b1-4f93fb93e712", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
