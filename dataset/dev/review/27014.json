["About this rating", "In June 2017, images purporting to be photographs of President Donald Trump in various potentially embarrassing or incriminating scenarios (including one of him in a diaper with various pieces of what appears to be bondage gear behind him) were stealthily dropped and then circulated on social media, along with claims that the images had been leaked by Russian agents:", "This is not a true photograph, but a composite; whoever created it used a photograph of Trump's head, then digitally manipulated an image of someone else in diapers. Although we have not been able to locate the source of the body photograph, the image of Trump's face was taken from a 1991 picture of Donald and Ivana Trump:", "It is also easy to tell that the image was manipulated, as Trump's face does not quite match the body, and the shadows do not match the lighting in the rest of the picture.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
