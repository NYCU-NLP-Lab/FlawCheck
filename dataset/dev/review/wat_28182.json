Rand Paul (R-KY) supporting it.", "If the House of Representatives passes the same measure \u2014 and they plan to do so later this week \u2014 it will go into effect, and make sure that Obamacare repeal cannot be filibustered by Senate Democrats.", "Shortly after this budget was approved, a viral message started circulating on Facebook which claimed that the Senate had voted to immediately repeal several individual provisions afforded by the ACA:", "In Case You Missed It The Senate voted 51 to 48:", "1. To end coverage for preexisting conditions, veterans benefits, and aid to rural hospitals.\n2. To remove discrimination protection for women in healthcare.\n3.

The Senate GOP voted this week that they would not require an eventual ACA replacement to protect against discrimination for pre-existing conditions, which was the standard before the ACA.", "It means that you (a young adult under the age of 26) or your adult children (over 18) may find yourselves without the protection of insurance, as the Senate GOP voted last night that an eventual ACA replacement will not be required to allow young people to remain on their parents' insurance up to the age of 26.", "It means that if you have a high-risk pregnancy, or life-threatening illness such as cancer, you may not be able to afford all the care you need, because you may hit lifetime or annual caps.

The Senate GOP voted last night that an eventual ACA replacement program would not be required to prohibit lifetime insurance caps.", "It means that if you are a struggling parent who is uninsured or under-insured, you will no longer be able to count on at least your kids getting the routine medical and dental care they need under the Children's Health Insurance Plan (CHIP).

For instance, President Trump said that he wanted the replacement for the ACA to continue coverage for pre-existing conditions.
