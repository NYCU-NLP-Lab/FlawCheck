["About this rating", "On 30 June 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to re-establish the National Space Council, which has been defunct since it was absorbed by the National Science and Technology Council in 1993. \u00a0Standing by his side was astronaut Buzz Aldrin, 87, who was the second person to walk on the moon (after Neil Armstrong) as part of the Apollo 11 mission. Trump's exchange with Aldrin quickly went viral:", "\u201cWe know what this is, space. That\u2019s all it has to say: space. There\u2019s a lot of room out there, right?\u201d Trump asked Aldrin as he prepared to sign the order.", "Aldrin replied with a quote from the astronaut character Buzz Lightyear from the movie \u201cToy Story.\u201d", "\u201cInfinity and beyond!\u201d Aldrin said.", "\u201cThis is infinity here,\u201d Trump responded as Aldrin looked on, appearing increasingly confused by his comments. \u201cIt could be infinity. We don\u2019t really don\u2019t know. But it could be. It has to be something \u2013 but it could be infinity, right?\u201d", "The next day, a web site purporting to be the online arm of a publication called The Rochdale Herald published an article appearing to report that Aldrin said his biggest life achievement was restraining himself from punching President Trump:", "Buzz Aldrin has suprised many today by saying that his greatest achievement is not punching Donald Trump. Mr Aldrin attended an event where the President gave a rambling word salad of a speech.", "Mr Aldrin looked visibly pained as he explained to the Herald, \u201cAt first I thought it was a joke or alzheimers awareness thing. As he went on I realised it wasn\u2019t Alec Baldwin but the actual President. How is that possible? I\u2019ve met Nixon, Johnson and Obama and never experienced anything like that. Hell, even Bush used to be able to get words into the right order.\u201d", "Aldrin, who famously punched a moon landing conspiracy theorist went on to say, \u201cHow the hell do you inspire kids with that? Who can honestly say being President is something to aspire to?", "The follow-up story is a work of fiction. The Rochdale Herald says on its page that it publishes satire \"from the world's worst local newspaper\", and the web site's \"About\" page contains more information:", "The Rochdale Herald is a satirical, spoof, parody commentary on current affairs, and stuff that annoys and amuses us. We make it up and it\u2019s not intended, in any way whatsoever, to be considered factual.", "If you read a story on The Rochdale Herald, please take a deep breath before going off the deep end as we probably made it up, apart from the horoscopes, they\u2019re all completely legit (no they aren\u2019t, we make those up too). We don\u2019t spend much time checking facts or corroborating sources because, and we can\u2019t stress this enough, we\u2019re not actually journalists and are making most of it up. This is an entertainment site that may occasionally confuse some fact with fiction and vice-versa but ultimately we\u2019re writing about the news to make you laugh. We also might talk about sex and swear a bit from time to time so if you\u2019re under 18 please don\u2019t read it.", "Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental, seriously.", "Although Aldrin never said that he had restrained himself from punching the President, the astronaut did display some curious facial expressions during the speech:", "The story is not completely plucked from thin air. In 2002, Aldrin made headlines when he punched a conspiracy theorist who was following him on the street to claim that the moon landing had been faked all along:", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
