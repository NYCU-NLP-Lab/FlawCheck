They then tested another 178 people and found them all positive, as well. I was so incredulous over those numbers, I even checked the website of the Oklahoma State Department of Health to confirm those numbers before we went on air. Indeed, that is what is on the official website. We weren\u2019t wrong. That\u2019s what they report. The problem is, there is a lag in the way that Oklahoma reports its data. With fewer, but almost entirely positive tests being reported on the weekends, and then larger numbers, including negative tests bulk-reported later in the week. So, those numbers I cited on Monday did not provide a clear or complete picture because they were not the final numbers for Oklahoma\u2019s weekend testing. I have a cardinal rule that I violated there, that if a statistic sounds too wild to be true, it probably is. I\u2019m going to remind myself of that in the future.\"", "Oklahoma City TV reporter Dillon Richards had already knocked down the original article, tweeting: \"Not only are these dates incorrect (this is referring to Sunday and Monday) ...
