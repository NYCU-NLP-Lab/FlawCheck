The story copies an earlier fake story by YourNewsWire, a website that publishes fake news. We sent messages to both websites and didn\u2019t get a reply.", "We found no evidence that an NFL lawyer named Dan Goodes even exists, or that he was found dead in his BMW in Manhattan.", "NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told PolitiFact that the NFL has no attorney named Dan Goodes. He called the story \"ridiculous,\" \"bogus\" and \"fake.\"", "The story said that Goodes had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis to promote the 2018 Super Bowl featuring the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots when he went off script and claimed that the NFL rigged the game to earn maximum revenue for league.", "\"According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system,\" the article said.", "The article included a mock screenshot of a Jan. 28 New York Times article about the alleged shooting of the lawyer founded slumped over the wheel of his BMW.

The Facebook page Satire Daily, which clearly identifies itself as satire, published a video seemingly documenting that the NFL had openly admitted to rigging games. Snopes debunked the claim in January.", "The video focused on a referee who congratulated the team\u2019s quarterback Tom Brady after the Patriots beat the Jaguars.", "That actually happened. Referee Clete Blakeman did Brady a congratulatory pat on the chest, which fueled some conspiracy theories.", "NFL spokesman McCarthy told PolitiFact, \"It's not uncommon for an official to congratulate a player after a game.\"", "Another situation that fueled conspiracy theories stemmed from an actual NFL ad on social media in January before the NFC Championship Game.", "The ad featured photos of the Patriots and Vikings quarterbacks and said, \"When you donate to United Way, you could score 2 club-level seats to watch the Patriots vs. the Vikings battle it out for the coveted Super Bowl title!\"", "The NFL apologized for the ads.", "\"It was a regrettable mistake,\" an unnamed NFL spokesman told media. \"The ads were mocked up using all the (possible) combinations, but weren\u2019t supposed to go until Monday when the matchup is known.
