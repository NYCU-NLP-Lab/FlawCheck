Marco Rubio, R-Florida, claimed one feature seen in the photo above makes the top rifle illegal in New York. (Courtesy: Rubio's Twitter account)", "Sen. Marco Rubio\u00a0took aim at one provision of a gun law\u00a0passed in New York state that he suggests can be easily circumvented.", "The Florida Republican posted a photo of two semi-automatic rifles. Both rifles almost look the same. But one has a pistol grip attached, so it is not legal in New York state, Rubio said.", "\"Under N.Y.

Andrew Cuomo, who said earlier in the day that Rubio \"should be ashamed of\" himself for not supporting stricter gun control legislation. During a CNN town hall the night before, Rubio signaled support for raising the age to buy a rifle or shotgun to 21 and for tighter background checks for gun purchases.", "Cuomo supports tougher gun-control measures, like universal background checks and a ban on military-style accessories.", "New York state already has a ban on some of those accessories.

The law, spearheaded by Cuomo, was passed a few weeks after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.", "The law banned so-called assault weapons\u00a0and created a legal definition for them in New York state. The law defined them broadly as semi-automatic firearms with one or more of the features also banned by the law. There are 10 of those features for rifles.", "The weapon used by Adam Lanza, the shooter at Sandy Hook, is banned under state law, for example. Lanza used a semi-automatic rifle with a pistol grip and a flash suppressor \u2014 two of the features banned under the SAFE Act.", "But the rifle without a pistol grip pictured in Rubio\u2019s tweet would also be subject to other gun regulations in New York state. First, anyone who wanted to buy the rifle in New York state would have to go through a background check, regardless of who they buy it from.", "State law would also prohibit any gun owner from attaching a magazine to the rifle that holds more than 10 rounds. Only seven other states have laws that ban large capacity magazines. Florida, where a shooter killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School this month, is not one of them.", "Our ruling", "Rubio said with a photo on Twitter that \"1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal & banned\" in New York state.", "That\u2019s true.\u00a0The pistol grip shown is one of the banned features for rifles under New York state's SAFE Act.\u00a0The rifle would also be subject to other New York state regulations.", "We rate Rubio\u2019s claim True.", "Tweet from Sen.
