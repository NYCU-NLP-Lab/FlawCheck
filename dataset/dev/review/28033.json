["By Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on July 27, 2017", "President Donald Trump\u2019s latest campaign-style rally was in Youngstown, Ohio, where the president made some false and misleading claims about military spending, immigrants and job creation:", "Trump, who has been in office for a little more than six months, has already started to run for reelection. He has started fundraising, running TV ads\u00a0and holding rallies. On July 25, the president spoke in Youngstown, Ohio \u2014 in a swing state that was a key to his 2016 victory.", "In Ohio, the president boasted of his accomplishments to date, but he stretched or distorted the facts in some cases \u2014 including on military spending.", "Trump, July 25:\u00a0We\u2019ve achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve.", "It\u2019s true that Trump secured some additional funding for the current fiscal year, and he has proposed a modest increase for next fiscal year. But he has not \u201cachieved a historic increase.\u201d", "In an analysis\u00a0released earlier this month of the president\u2019s budget, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u00a0said the president\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal year 2018 would increase defense spending by 5 percent.", "\u201cFor defense discretionary programs in 2018, the President proposes appropriations of $668 billion, which would be $34 billion (or 5 percent) more than the amount provided in 2017,\u201d CBO said.", "The $668 billion includes $603 billion in base defense spending and $65 billion for overseas contingency operations, or OCO, which fund ongoing military operations in the Middle East. CBO said base defense spending would rise 9 percent, but OCO spending would decline by 22 percent under Trump\u2019s budget.", "In March, the White House first disclosed that it would propose $603 billion in base defense spending \u2014 which the president called \u201ca historic increase in defense spending.\u201d We wrote at that time that the 9 percent increase in base defense spending was not historic; in fact, there were double-digit percentage increases under Presidents George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. The White House did not disclose in March how much it planned to spend on overseas contingency operations, so we did not know at the time how much it would propose in total defense spending.", "We now know that the total increase in discretionary defense funding is a more modest 5 percent, based on the CBO analysis.", "Even with that increase, Trump\u2019s proposed $668 billion defense budget would be less than the amounts spent in 2012 ($670.5 billion), 2011 ($699.4 billion) and 2010 ($688.9 billion) under President Barack Obama, according to the CBO.", "Now, Trump did secure more defense funding in a bill that he signed in May. That bill \u2014 the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017 \u2014 provided funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2017, including an\u00a0additional $21 billion for the military.", "But even with the increased funding, the fiscal 2017 defense spending was below the funding levels of earlier this decade, and spending would remain below those levels under Trump\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal 2018. So the president hasn\u2019t \u201cachieved a historic increase in defense spending\u201d this fiscal year, and his proposed budget will not in the next fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, either.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Trump said that \u201csince my election we\u2019ve added much more than 1 million jobs,\u201d taking credit for jobs created under his predecessor.", "Between November and June, the nation added 1.2 million jobs,\u00a0according to the most recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But, of course, Obama was president until Jan. 20, when Trump took the oath of office. Since January, the country has added 863,000 jobs.", "During the same time period last year, the country added 955,000 jobs. So while the economy continues to grow, the rate of job growth was higher in 2016.", "Trump\u00a0has\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0tried\u00a0to boost his job numbers by including jobs created under Obama.", "As we\u2019ve noted before, the job-creation trend didn\u2019t begin with Trump\u2019s election in November or inauguration in January.\u00a0There have now been 81 straight months of job growth, dating back to October 2010.", "Under Obama, the country added more than 250,000 new jobs a month in 20 of his 96 months in office. It\u2019s very early in the Trump presidency, but his monthly job numbers haven\u2019t hit that milestone so far.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "On the topic of immigration, Trump said, \u201cWe also believe that those seeking to immigrate into our country should be able to support themselves financially, and should not be able to use welfare for themselves or their household for a period of at least five years.\u201d", "He later added, \u201cWe don\u2019t want people that come into our country and immediately go on welfare and stay there for the rest of their lives.\u201d", "However, most immigrants cannot \u201cimmediately go on welfare\u201d after coming to the United States. In fact, federal law already bars new immigrants, with some exceptions, from receiving welfare for five years, as\u00a0we noted\u00a0when Trump proposed legislation to that effect in June.", "The\u00a0Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, signed into law in 1996 by then-President Bill Clinton, states that immigrants are \u201cnot eligible for any Federal means-tested public benefit for a period of 5 years beginning on the date of the alien\u2019s entry into the United States.\u201d That includes benefits like food stamps, Medicaid and Social Security.", "There are some exceptions in the law for those admitted as refugees and asylees, as well as those with a military connection. States can choose to make children and pregnant women who are legal permanent residents eligible for food stamps and Medicaid within their first five years in the country.", "It\u2019s possible that Trump will toughen the restrictions, or eliminate some of those exceptions. For example, Trump\u2019s\u00a0proposed FY 2018 budget\u00a0notes that refugees are exempt from the five-year waiting period, and stresses the need to control the cost of benefits paid to immigrant-headed households. But the budget offered no details on how that would be accomplished beyond reducing the number of refugees, curbing illegal immigration and increasing merit-based legal immigration.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
