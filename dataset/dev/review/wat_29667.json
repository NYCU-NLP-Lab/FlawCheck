["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on February 5, 2021", "Social media pages are spreading a false claim that President Joe Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline because of a campaign donation from Warren Buffett. Buffett did not donate to Biden\u2019s campaign.", "A viral meme falsely claims that billionaire investor Warren Buffett caused construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline to be \u201ccancelled.\u201d", "He didn\u2019t.", "President Joe Biden revoked the permit for the controversial addition to an oil pipeline from Canada as part of an executive order addressing environmental issues that he signed on his first day in office. Biden had promised\u00a0during the campaign to nix the project.", "The meme, however, claims: \u201cThe Keystone pipeline. Cancelled by Biden on first day. Warren Buffet owns the railroad that is now transporting all that oil. Warren Buffet donated 58 million to Biden campaign. Warren Buffet would lose billions in transport fees if the pipeline is completed. See how politics works? It is not an environmental issue, it is a money issue\u2026\u201d", "Beyond spelling Buffett\u2019s name wrong, the meme gets some of the key information wrong, too.", "Most importantly, Buffett didn\u2019t donate any money to the Biden campaign, according to records from the Federal Election Commission. However, he did donate $248,500 in 2019 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which spent $330 million in support of Democratic House incumbents and candidates during the 2020 election.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that while he didn\u2019t contribute to Biden\u2019s campaign, Buffett has donated to previous Democratic presidential campaigns. He donated to both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.", "The claim that Buffett gave $58 million to any candidate isn\u2019t possible, though. Candidate campaigns are limited to accepting $2,800 per election\u00a0from any one individual. All donations made by employees of Buffett\u2019s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 2020 cycle totaled\u00a0just $5.2 million\u00a0and that was roughly split between Democrats and Republicans alike. That figure includes donations from Buffett.", "As for the claim about Buffett\u2019s concern for the pipeline \u2014 it\u2019s true that Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0owns BNSF Railway, which carries crude oil and has an interest in transporting Canada\u2019s supply. But\u00a0Buffett has publicly supported the Keystone XL Pipeline project. As early as 2012, he said\u00a0on Fox Business, \u201cI\u2019m not an expert, but it generally sounds like it makes sense to me. \u2026 There are an awful lot of pipelines running through the United States. They have been a huge plus for the country.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
