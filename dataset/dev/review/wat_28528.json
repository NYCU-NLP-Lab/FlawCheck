["By Robert Farley", "Posted on September 23, 2020", "In recent rallies, President Donald Trump has repeatedly conflated winning a Nobel Peace Prize with being nominated for one, and has wrongly faulted the media for ignoring his nomination after making former President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination in 2009 \u201cthe biggest story I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d", "The media attention for Obama came after he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump has been nominated, but that\u2019s not the \u201cbig thing\u201d he makes it out to be. There are 318 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize for 2020 \u2014 211 are individuals and 107 organizations.", "Any one of thousands of people can nominate someone for the prestigious award. And two people have come forward saying they nominated Trump.", "But on its website, the Nobel committee warns not to attach too much importance to a nomination.", "\u201cAny person or organization can be nominated by anyone eligible to nominate,\u201d the committee states. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has no input into submissions, though it decides who actually wins the prize. \u201cTo simply be nominated is therefore not an endorsement or extended honour to imply affiliation with the Nobel Peace Prize or its related institutions,\u201d the committee states.", "Nonetheless, Trump has touted the nomination repeatedly at campaign rallies, on Twitter and in TV ads.", "On Sept. 9, Christian Tybring-Gjedde, a far-right Norwegian politician, announced on Fox News that he had nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize.", "\u201cFor his merit, I think he has done more trying to create peace between nations than most other Peace Prize nominees,\u201d Tybring-Gjedde said.", "In his nominating letter, Tybring-Gjedde cited Trump\u2019s role in establishing relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. He also cited Trump\u2019s \u201ckey role in facilitating contact between conflicting parties and \u2026 creating new dynamics in other protracted conflicts, such as the Kashmir border dispute between India and Pakistan, and the conflict between North and South Korea, as well as dealing with the nuclear capabilities of North Korea.\u201d", "Two days later, Magnus Jacobsson, a member of Sweden\u2019s Parliament for the Christian Democrats, announced via Twitter that he, too, had nominated Trump for the award, along with the governments of Kosovo and Serbia \u201cfor their joint work for peace and economic development.\u201d", "Nominations for a Nobel Peace Prize can be made by any one of perhaps hundreds of thousands of eligible people, including, according to the Nobel website, \u201cuniversity rectors or chancellors, professors of political and social science, history, philosophy, law and theology; leaders of peace research institutes and institutes of foreign affairs; members of national assemblies, governments, and international courts of law; previous Nobel Peace Prize Laureates; board members of organizations and institutions that have received the Nobel Peace Prize; present and past members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee; and former advisers of the Norwegian Nobel Institute.\u201d", "The Nobel committee does not provide a list of the nominees. In fact, the names of nominees, and who nominated them, are not released by the Nobel committee for 50 years, and only leak out when people make them public, as Tybring-Gjedde and Jacobsson did.", "The Nobel committee does, however, release the number of nominations. This year, there are 318 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 211 individuals and 107 organizations. That\u2019s the fourth highest number of candidates in the award\u2019s history. The five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee narrows the list of nominees to a small group and then picks a winner.", "According to the Nobel Prize website, simply being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize is \u201cnot an endorsement or extended honour to imply affiliation with the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d", "Indeed, some of history\u2019s most vilified figures have been nominated for the prize. Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was nominated twice: in 1945 for his effort to end World War II and again in 1948 by a professor from the Czech Republic. And fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was nominated in 1935 by two law professors, one from Germany and the other from France. (Adolf Hitler was nominated in 1939 \u2014 the nomination was later withdrawn \u2014 by \u201can anti-fascist member of the Swedish parliament who never intended his submission to be taken seriously,\u201d according to Nobel archives.)", "This is not the first time Trump has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. Tybring-Gjedde, who nominated Trump this month, and another far-right politician, Per-Willy Amundsen, said in June 2018 they had nominated Trump for the honor following Trump\u2019s nuclear weapons summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.", "In February 2019, Trump claimed in a White House press conference that Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe wrote him a letter in which he said he had nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize, also related to his negotiations with North Korea. Abe declined to confirm that, though the Asahi Shimbun newspaper \u201ccited an unnamed government source as saying the nomination came in response to an \u2018unofficial\u2019 U.S. request,\u201d according to the Washington Post. Other than publicly disclosing the letter, though, Trump did not otherwise publicize the nomination, and he did not win the prize that year.", "But Trump has insisted he will win a Nobel Peace Prize, or at least that he should.", "\u201cI think I\u2019ll get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things,\u201d Trump said during a press conference on Sept. 23, 2019. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things, if they gave it out fairly, which they don\u2019t.\u201d", "Now, with an election just weeks away, Trump has been aggressively hyping this year\u2019s nomination.", "On social media, Trump retweeted about a dozen messages announcing the nomination or congratulating him for it. And a recent TV ad from the Trump campaign that highlights Trump\u2019s involvement in an accord to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain boasts, \u201cPresident Trump, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d Trump has also brought up the nomination in at least a half dozen recent campaign rallies.", "\u201cCan you believe it, in one week they nominated me, not for one, but for two Nobel prizes,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Sept. 19. \u201cBut you know, you have a president, you love your president, and your president gets honored, because I\u2019m not being honored, you\u2019re being honored with the Nobel Peace Prize, for Israel, what we did with Israel.\u201d", "(He wasn\u2019t nominated for two Nobel prizes; he was nominated by two people for the same prize. And, of course, he was not honored \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 with the prize.)", "Trump went on relate a story about how he went home to watch the network news with his wife in hopes of hearing about his nomination.", "\u201cThis is going to be big,\u201d Trump said he told First Lady Melania Trump. \u201cThis is going to be big tonight. We just got honored, this is big. Nobel Peace, can you imagine?\u201d", "But to his embarrassment, he said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t covered. I got the Nobel Peace Prize nomination, a Peace Prize, Nobel nomination. And they didn\u2019t cover it.\u201d", "We should note that while the nomination was not covered in a national network news broadcast, it has been reported in many national print outlets, and has been widely cited on Fox News.", "Trump told the same network news story two nights later at a rally in Ohio.", "\u201cI\u2019m the only man that got nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and I didn\u2019t get any press,\u201d Trump said at a rally on Sept. 21 in Ohio. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t. For two of them. Last week, I\u2019m not bragging about it, I\u2019m just saying, I\u2019m the president of the United States because of Kosovo-Serbia, they\u2019ve been killing each other for years, I worked out a deal for them. I got nominated. And then Israel with Bahrain and UAE, and many more to come. I mean, they all want to do it. We\u2019ll have peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. No blood. We\u2019re going to have peace in the Middle East. So I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d", "Both nights, Trump made a point of saying that while the network news ignored his nomination, the same was not true when Obama was nominated in 2009.", "\u201cAnd when Barack Obama, Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, now when Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, he didn\u2019t know why he was nominated,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was like right at the very beginning [of his presidency]. He didn\u2019t do anything. He did nothing and he got nominated. It was the biggest story I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d", "Trump is wrong about media coverage of Obama\u2019s nomination.", "We searched the Nexis news database and could find only two stories that mentioned Obama\u2019s nomination.", "An Associated Press story on Feb. 27, 2009, about the nominations for the award started, \u201cPresident Barack Obama and his French counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy are believed to be among a record 205 nominations for the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d The fourth sentence of the story put the nominations in context: \u201c\u2018It is very easy to be nominated for the peace prize, but that is in no way an endorsement by the committee,\u2019 said Geir Lundestad, the Norwegian awards committee\u2019s nonvoting secretary.\u201d", "An Associated Press story on Oct. 7, 2009, also mentioned the possibility of Obama\u2019s nomination. The story led with speculation about Chinese dissidents being the leading contenders to win the award. Five paragraphs in, the article noted, \u201cU.S. President Barack Obama is thought to have been nominated but it\u2019s unclear on what grounds. Nobel watchers say he could be a contender for next year\u2019s prize, following his lofty call for global nuclear disarmament last month at the United Nations, which came after the nomination deadline for the 2009 prize.\u201d", "In fact, Obama did wind up winning the award that year. Upon learning the news, Obama said he was \u201cboth surprised and deeply humbled by the decision of the Nobel Committee.\u201d", "\u201cLet me be clear: I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments, but rather as an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations,\u201d Obama said on Oct. 9, 2009. \u201cTo be honest, I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who\u2019ve been honored by this prize \u2014 men and women who\u2019ve inspired me and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace.\u201d", "The honor was covered widely in the press, and some detractors noted that Obama was in office less than two weeks when the deadline passed for nominations. Count Trump among the longtime detractors.", "In September 2015, a former director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute expressed some regret about awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Obama.", "In a memoir, Lundestad, the non-voting director until 2014, wrote that, \u201cIn retrospect, we could say that the argument of giving Obama a helping hand was only partially correct,\u201d and made it difficult for Obama to live up to expectations. \u201cMany of Obama\u2019s supporters believed it was a mistake,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs such, it did not achieve what the committee had hoped for.\u201d", "Whether one believes Obama deserved the award or not, though, the fact is he won it. And the media attention he got came almost entirely after he won it, not when he was nominated. We also don\u2019t mean to diminish Trump\u2019s accomplishments in the Middle East or with Kosovo and Serbia, but it is premature for Trump to say he is \u201cbeing honored\u201d with the award.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
