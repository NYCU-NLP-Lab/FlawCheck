Ambassador Stevens died in the attack, becoming the first U.S. ambassador to be killed in the line of duty since 1979.", "Shortly afterwards, the Lebanese news site Tayyar.org reproduced an Agence France Presse (AFP) account of the attack and included a paragraph stating that Ambassador Stevens had been raped and killed by gunmen and his body has been dragged through the streets:", "Sources said that \"the U.S. ambassador to Libya was raped sexually before killing by gunmen who stormed the embassy building in Benghazi last night to protest against the film is offensive to the Prophet Muhammad,\" The sources told AFP that the \"Ambassador was killed and his body displayed in a manner similar to what happened when Gaddafi was killed.\"", "An image was also circulated which was purportedly taken from a television news report and is said to show Ambassador Stevens in the hands of his killers:", "Claims circulated online that picked up on this account and presented it as fact:", "The American Ambassador in Libya was sexually raped before being killed, the American press has not said anything yet.", "Very disturbing and explicits pictures that have not been shown in the US.", "The American Ambassador in Libya was sexually raped before being killed, the American press has not said anything yet.", "The news has jumped in some Lebanese ultra left blogs. The perpetrators of the massacre at the American Embassy in Libya savagely tortured the American Ambassador, Chris Stevens, violated sexually, before killing him. They then had a festive dance of death, swinging the corpse from one side to another.", "Written by a cousin of Ambassador Stevens, a US Navy Chaplain, Senior Pastor Ret'd", "Here is my story. A week out the Embassy in Tripoli began\nreceiving multiple tips about an Al Queda cell in the area planning an\nattack on 9/11 in response to the killing of Bin Laden. For the next\nseveral days, the state dept and WH were asked for a security force and\nwere denied at least six times. Ambassador Stevens and his team were given\nthe all clear that the Consulate in Benghazi was safe and there was no\nneed for a security force other than his 3 personal guards (one being my\ncousin) and a few Libyans who were not armed. Then the attack and murders\noccurred.", "Immediately the WH claimed it was a protest gone bad over a you\ntube video. Obama made a quick speech in the Rose Garden on Sept.12 before\ncatching a plane to Vegas to campaign.

He said \"No act of terror will shake the resolve of America.\nLater that day and over the next 2 days, the liberal media began saying\nAmbassador Stevens and the other 3 men died of smoke inhalation. This was\nnot the case.", "Out of respect for my cousin, I'm not going to be specific about\nhis murder. However Ambassador Stevens was brutally murdered. His genitals\nwere cut off, he was sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned.\nHe was drug thru the streets and left for dead. This is eyewitness\ntestimony of a local Dr. who found the Ambassador in a ditch and tried to\nsave his life. He had no idea who he was. The other 3 men, including my\ncousin, met similar fates. And deaths due to smoke inhalation is a 100%\nfabricated LIE. The next week I drove my aunt and Uncle and 2 others to DC\nto receive his body. We met with Hillary, Panetta, and Susan Rice. ALL of\nwhom apologized and said it was a protest gone bad over a video and exited\nthe area. Next, Obama entered with the same story and didn't apologize and\nwasn't sympathetic. My aunt cried to this man and all he did was hand her\nflowers and walk away. I tried to get his attention, but didn't. I got\nupset and yelled liar to him, he kept walking. Then a secret service agent\ngrabbed my arm and led me to a room where I was held till the proceedings\nwere over.", "America, I saw firsthand how cold this man is. What kind of liar\nhe is. Most of you haven't a clue about this tyrant and yet you support\nhim. And act like every word he says is Gospel.
