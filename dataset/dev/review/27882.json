["A picture of actor Amitabh Bachchan has gone viral recently, allegedly from his recent visit to the Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai. It is being claimed that he made the offering of a chaddar (sheet) in the mosque. Social media users have been sharing this image discussing how even though Hindu temples held prayers and ceremonies for his recovery, he instead went to the Sufi shrine to offer a sheet once he got better. We would like to point out that Bachchan had informed the public about testing positive for coronavirus in a tweet on July 11, 2020. He was discharged on August 2, 2020, once his reports came back negative for the virus.", "A user shared the image on a Facebook group called \u2018Desh Ki Pukar Hindu Rashtra Shri Ram Rajatilak\u2018 with the same claim and called for a boycott of \u2018Kaun Banega Crorepati\u2019 (archived version of the post).
