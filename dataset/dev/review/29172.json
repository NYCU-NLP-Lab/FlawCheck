["Editor's note, Dec. 7, 2017:\u00a0The Missouri Democratic Party asked us to take another look at the evidence after this fact check ran in November. The party\u2019s spokeswoman provided us with examples of other units that Josh Hawley created with dedicated staffs. She argued again that the attorney general\u2019s reference to a public corruption \"team,\" rather than \"unit,\" showed Hawley had not fulfilled his promise. We have added those examples, as well as more information from Hawley\u2019s camp. After further review, our rating remains the same.", "***", "Democrats have accused Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley of breaking more than one promise.", "Now, incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill\u2019s campaign says he has broken another. McCaskill campaign manager David Kirby released a statement in response to Hawley\u2019s announcement for Senate,\u00a0addressing a vow to prosecute public corruption.", "\"He broke his promise to create a Public Corruption Unit to crack down on the pay-to-play culture of Jefferson City,\" Kirby said.", "You can see the full statement below.", "But Hawley\u2019s office says he has kept that promise. Who\u2019s telling the truth? Let\u2019s find out.", "Hawley\u2019s campaign", "During his attorney general campaign, Hawley promised to create a public corruption unit that would \"take a more aggressive role in aiding local and federal prosecutors investigating allegations of corruption.\"", "On the attorney general\u2019s website, Hawley says he\u2019s fulfilled his promise.", "The page\u00a0defines\u00a0the group as a team that \"actively investigates and prosecutes official abuses of power and other corruption to keep Missouri government honest and clean.\"", "Hawley also referred to problems with \"pay-to-play culture\" in Jefferson City on the campaign trail. Pay-to-play is usually defined as money in exchange for services.", "What Democrats say", "When we reached out to McCaskill\u2019s campaign for evidence, it pointed us to the Missouri Democratic Party.", "The party sent us language it said was from Hawley\u2019s campaign website that specifically promised to use the public corruption unit to end pay-to-play in Jefferson City.", "\"In addition to a public corruption unit, my ethics reform plan would prevent public officials from getting rich off the system, increase transparency, attack the pay-to-play politics of Jefferson City and ban lobbyist gifts to employees within the A.G.\u2019s office \u2014 a ban that should be extended to the Missouri Legislature.\"", "We couldn\u2019t verify that ourselves because that passage no longer exists on Hawley\u2019s website, but the party also pointed us to a quote from a\u00a0debate Hawley did on 93.9, the Eagle.", "\"I have a plan to clean it up. I've announced that I would create a public corruption unit in the office of the Attorney General to coordinate local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, to prosecute, investigate and prosecute these public corruption crimes that have come to characterize Jefferson City and it's time that we took these measures,\" he said on May 17, 2016.", "Team vs. Unit", "Hawley\u2019s website says he has a public corruption \"team,\" not a \"unit.\"", "Meira Bernstein, a party spokeswoman, pointed us to six other units in Hawley\u2019s office that have dedicated staff.

Hawley did not promise to create a public corruption unit \"with dedicated staff.\" He promised to create a public corruption unit to \"take a more aggressive role in aiding local and federal prosecutors investigating allegations of corruption.\" Whether he calls it a team or a unit, Hawley\u2019s office provided substantial evidence proving he has done that.", "When asked about the team versus unit argument, Hawley\u2019s deputy chief of staff Loree Anne Paradise said, \"When you look up the word \u2018team\u2019 on\u00a0Thesaurus.com, \u2018unit\u2019 is listed as a synonym.\"", "Does it matter?", "Though Hawley made some indications he would use the group to address pay-to-play in Jefferson City, it doesn\u2019t necessarily prove what Democrats are claiming.", "Why? Because a public corruption team exists.", "The group is led by Deputy Attorney General Darrell Moore. Other lawyers working on the team include First Assistant John Sauer and Deputy Attorney General Michael Martinich-Sauter.

Paradise said there are several other ongoing investigations that are not yet public.", "Hawley\u2019s office said they find these public corruption cases in three primary ways. They receive tips from government officials and law enforcement, find cases themselves by actively looking for them and receive complaints issued by the Missouri Office of Constituent Services.", "After identifying a public corruption case, Hawley\u2019s office said the investigation process requires complex analysis by a number of attorneys (depending on the case) and takes at least a couple of months.", "Democrats say the group didn\u2019t exist until the Missouri Democratic Party started asking questions.", "Bernstein said the party made a Sunshine Request on July 12 for any emails regarding a public corruption unit. The next day,\u00a0according to the Democratic Party\u2019s timeline, Hawley sent a request that a page be created on his official website.", "Paradise did not specify when the webpage was created but said the team was in play months before Democrats\u2019 accusations.", "The\u00a0news release\u00a0for the first case is dated April 5, 2017.", "The corruption team has prosecuted officials in Mississippi, Cooper and Cass counties.
