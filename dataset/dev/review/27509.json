["About this rating", "It's practically inevitable for fake or misleading photographs to circulate in the wake of a major natural disaster. So when images of the destruction from Hurricane Harvey first appeared on social media in late August 2017, many users were wary about which images they could trust.", "With that in mind, here is a look at some of the most popular (and misleading) photographs that circulated in the wake of Hurricane Harvey:", "Shark Swimming on the Highway?", "An image purportedly showing a shark swimming down the highway tends to recirculate on social media after any event involving massive flooding. We first debunked this photograph in 2011 during Hurricane Irene, when it was shared along with the claim that it was taken in Puerto Rico. It popped up again in 2015 after heavy rains in Texas, in 2016 after Hurricane Matthew hit Florida, and, of course, in August 2017 after Hurricane Harvey caused heavy flooding in Houston.", "This image, however, is actually a composite of at least two different photographs.", "Obama Serves Flood Victims in Texas?", "A 2015 photograph of President Obama ladling food onto a woman's plate was attached to a 2017 claim that it showed the former President helping with the rescue effort in Texas:", "The difference between #NotMyPresident &#MyPresident.", "The entire Obama family is in Texas right now serving meals to flood victims. Guess the trumps are too busy going on vacation or playing golf to bother. Do not be surprised when Texas goes blue Republicans. That day is coming soon traitors.", "This image is real, but it wasn't taken in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. This picture was actually taken over the Thanksgiving holiday in 2015 at a homeless shelter in Washington.", "Houston Airport Flooded?", "Although Houston's airports were flooded during Harvey, things weren't quite as bad as they appeared in this image:", "This image does not show an airport in Houston, nor does it show the impact of Hurricane Harvey. This is a digitally created mockup showing what LaGuardia Airport could look like in a future dramatically affected by climate change:", "What LaGuardia Airport could look like at high tide with 5 feet of sea level rise, an amount that could occur by 2100, according to some estimates.", "Alligator on the Loose?", "A photograph purportedly showing an alligator on the streets of Houston was shared by journalist Katie Couric, but while it was taken in Houston, the alligator's appearance is not at all related to the August 2017 floods:", "Mmmm. She's not answering. She lives in Houston but in nyc and someone sent to her...she sent to me-looks like a double punk! ? https://t.co/5RAFW8XJxt", "\u2014 Katie Couric (@katiecouric) August 27, 2017", "Harvey Loot crew?", "An image purportedly showing a store that had been looted in Houston by the #HarveyLootCrew was also circulated online:", "This image, however, is not related to Hurricane Harvey. It was taken by April O'Brien of the Huffington Post and shows a store that was looted after Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey in 2012:", "Mega Aid Pharmacy: Items were scattered throughout the store, and workers had no idea where or how to begin cleanup.", "Fleeing in a Fridge?", "A photograph showing three people using a refrigerator as a makeshift boat was also shared as if it were related to Hurricane Harvey:", "This image is real, but it is not related to Hurricane Harvey. It was taken in April 2016 after heavy rains hit the Greenspoint area of Houston:", "It was an area hit so hard that families had to escape their homes floating on air mattresses, dads carrying babies in bins, moms and babies riding in refrigerators and others too afraid to trudge through the water took help from strangers while waiting from aid from the City of Houston.", "Trump Tweet?", "In addition to fake photographs, we also saw at least one fake tweet supposedly sent by President Trump:", "Wow - Now experts are calling #Harvey a once in 500 year flood! We have an all out effort going, and going well!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2017", "I will also be going to a wonderful state, Missouri, that I won by a lot in '16. Dem C.M. is opposed to big tax cuts. Republican will win S!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2017", "I will be going to Texas as soon as that trip can be made without causing disruption. The focus must be life and safety.", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2017", "Hurricane Harvey?", "Although most of the fake Hurricane Harvey photographs we encountered focused on the flood waters, we came across one that purportedly showed the storm as it approached the shore:", "Isabella, Tara. \u00a0 \"President Trump's Response to Hurricane Harvey Devastation: 'Wow.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 VOX. 27 August 2017.", "Seward, Larry. \u00a0 \"Desperate Greenspoint Residents Flee Floodwaters.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 KHOU-TV. 19 April 2016.", "Campbell, Andy. \u00a0 \"Hurricane Sandy Looting, Fights Plague South Brooklyn.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Huffington Post. 31 October 2012.", "O'Sullivan, Donie. \u00a0 \"This Obama Photo, Doing the Rounds After Harvey, Is Actually from 2015.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN. 28 August 2017.", "Freedman, Andrew. \u00a0 \"U.S. Airports Face Increasing Threat from Rising Seas.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Climate Central. 17 June 2013.", "Leighton, Heather. \u00a0 \"Deputy Comes Across Alligator in the Street in Fort Bend County.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Houston Chronicle. 18 April 2017.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
