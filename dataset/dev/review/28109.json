While Europe is absorbing the great majority of refugees, some are headed toward the United States. The question is, how many?", "About 250,000, according to Fox News host Sean Hannity. During an interview with Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush on Oct. 19, 2015, Hannity worried that ISIS would try to infiltrate the arriving masses.", "\"You see the backlash emerging now in Europe over the refugee problem for Syria and Iraq,\" Hannity said. \"The president said he\u2019s going to bring in 250,000 refugees into this country.\"", "\"We can\u2019t take 250,000 refugees,\" Bush responded. \"I\u2019ve never heard that, and that would be impossible to imagine logistically for us to screen.\"", "In plain fact, President Barack Obama never said that, nor as far as anyone can tell has any member of his administration. In September, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Obama \"informed his team that he would like them to accept -- at least make preparations to accept -- at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next fiscal year.\"", "The 250,000 figure would dwarf the 120,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict the European community said it aims to relocate inside its members\u2019 borders.", "What gives?", "A refugee crisis", "Hannity said his figure was based on a Sept. 20 Associated Press report. The AP report said that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the United States would accept up to 85,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2016 and up to 100,000 in Fiscal Year 2017. In Fiscal Year 2015, the United States accepted nearly 70,000 refugees.", "Add those three numbers together and you get 255,000 refugees, Hannity said.", "That math is right, but none of it makes Hannity's claim accurate.", "The Associated Press report Hannity cited is discussing the total number of refugees admitted to the United States worldwide.", "But Hannity, in his remarks Oct. 19 and Oct. 20, was discussing refugees coming from Iraq and Syria, fearing they might be infiltrated by ISIS or al-Qaida. Here, again, is what Hannity said Oct. 19:", "\"You see the backlash emerging now in Europe over the refugee problem for Syria and Iraq,\" Hannity said. \"The president said he\u2019s going to bring in 250,000 refugees into this country.\"", "And Oct. 20:", "\"You see what\u2019s happening in Europe, there\u2019s a huge backlash because of Syrian refugees and Iraqi refugees and the cost \u2026 We\u2019re being told by our National Intelligence Director that ISIS and al-Qaida, not if, they will infiltrate the refugee community. This president has committed to nearly 250,000 coming to America.\"", "In reality, the commitment Hannity talks about largely has been the standard practice of the United States going back decades. The United States has been accepting on average more than 83,000 refugees a year worldwide from 1980-2008, State Department records show.", "In Fiscal Year 2013 (the last year for which we have data), the State Department said it would admit up to 70,000 refugees. It ended up admitting 69,926, records show.", "Those refugee spots are not awarded on a first-come, first-serve basis. They are allocated specifically by region. Europe has an annual limit. So does Africa. So does Near East/South Asia, the area that includes Syria and Iraq.", "In Fiscal Year 2013, for example, the United States accepted 4,205 Cuban refugees and 16,000 from countries in East Asia.", "So what\u2019s changing?", "For Fiscal Year 2016, the Obama administration has proposed raising the cap to 85,000 refugees -- an increase of 15,000 refugees over the previous year. In 2017, the cap would move to 100,000. Many, though not all, of those extra spaces would be used for Syrian refugees, the State Department says.", "\"We expect to admit some 1,600-1,800 Syrian refugees in FY 2015. In FY 2016, we project we will admit at least 10,000 Syrians,\" the State Department said in a report to Congress. The number of Iraqi refugees admitted to the United States has fluctuated over the years.
