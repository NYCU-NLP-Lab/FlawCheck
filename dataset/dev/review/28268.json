["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on May 11, 2016", "Hillary Clinton once again made the claim that using a private email account and server while secretary of state was \u201cabsolutely permitted.\u201d That\u2019s pure spin. We\u2019ve been through this before, but it bears repeating as more information becomes available:", "Clinton\u2019s email saga became public on March 2, 2015, with a report in the New York Times that\u00a0she exclusively used a private email account to conduct State Department business during her time in office, from January 2009 to February 2013. Shortly after, the Associated Press reported that Clinton\u2019s email account was hosted on a server at her home in New York.", "She said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that she thought it was more \u201cconvenient\u201d to use a single personal email account to conduct both private affairs and government business, and she regrets having made that decision. Host John Dickerson asked her what voters can take from her opting for convenience when faced with such a decision.", "Dickerson, May 8: A general election voter will know, when Hillary Clinton is the president in the office, and a convenient option arrives, maybe she will think twice about it?", "Clinton: Well, as I have said many times, there was \u2014 I was absolutely permitted, and I did it. And it turned out to be a mistake. It wasn\u2019t the best choice.", "Absolutely permitted? That\u2019s a stretch.", "The Clinton campaign makes that claim\u00a0based on a National Archives and Records Administration regulation in place since 2009 that said federal agencies may allow their employees to send and receive work-related emails \u201cusing a system not operated by the agency,\u201d but an agency\u00a0\u201cmust ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.\u201d", "But NARA also\u00a0requires\u00a0federal agencies to maintain an NARA-approved schedule for preserving work-related\u00a0records. The State Department Records Disposition Schedule says \u201cincoming and outgoing correspondence and memorandums on substantive U.S. foreign policy issues\u201d should be permanently retained \u201cat the end of the Secretary\u2019s tenure or sooner if necessary.\u201d\u00a0Clinton, who\u00a0left office Feb. 1, 2013,\u00a0did not provide the State Department with her emails until Dec. 5, 2014. She did so\u00a0after the department in October of that year requested her emails in response to congressional\u00a0requests for documents related to the Benghazi attacks\u00a0on Sept. 11, 2012.", "\u201cIn the process of responding to congressional document requests pertaining to Benghazi, State Department officials recognized that it had access to relatively few email records from former Secretary Clinton,\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby told the Washington Post. \u201cState Department officials contacted her representatives during the summer of 2014 to learn more about her email use and the status of emails in that account.\u201d", "Simply put, Clinton did not follow the NARA regulations on preserving email records.", "In addition, Clinton\u2019s decision to\u00a0conduct government business exclusively through a private email network caught the experts at NARA by surprise. It was unprecedented. Clinton has said that other\u00a0\u201csecretaries of state\u201d did the \u201csame thing,\u201d but Colin Powell \u2014 who was secretary of state from 2001 to 2005\u00a0\u2014\u00a0was the only other secretary of state to use an email account outside of the government email system and he did not set up a private server. Powell used America Online, where he once served on the board of directors.", "The day after the New York Times broke its story, NARA Chief Records Officer Paul M. Wester Jr. sent a letter to the State Department\u00a0saying he was \u201cconcerned that Federal records may have been alienated from the Department of State\u2019s official recordkeeping systems.\u201d Wester\u00a0wanted to know what the department was doing to retrieve \u201crecords created using personal email accounts.\u201d (See the first exhibit in Attachment B of NARA\u2019s response to GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley.)", "The State Department responded to that letter on April 2, 2015, by informing NARA that, among other things, it had sent a letter to \u201call employees reminding them of their responsibilities vis-a-vis records, emails, and personal accounts.\u201d In its letter to employees, the State Department said, \u201cAs a general matter, to ensure a complete record of their activities, senior officials should not use their private e-mail accounts (e.g., Gmail) for official business.\u201d", "The reminder was nothing new. In fact, as the Washington Post Fact Checker wrote,\u00a0Clinton herself in June 2011 sent a cable\u00a0\u201cunder her signature warning employees to \u2018avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts.\u2019 \u201d", "Jason R. Baron,\u00a0a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and a former director of litigation at the National Archives, expressed surprise\u00a0at Clinton\u2019s exclusive use of a private email network at a\u00a0Senate Judiciary Committee a year ago. He told the committee that \u201cany employee\u2019s decision to conduct all e-mail correspondence through a private e-mail network, using a non-.gov address, is inconsistent with long-established policies and practices under the Federal Records Act and NARA regulations governing all federal agencies.\u201d", "Baron also made the point that an employee who does not use a government email account \u201ccompromises the ability of an agency to adequately respond to FOIA requests,\u201d referring to the Freedom of Information Act. In fact, U.S.\u00a0District Judge Emmet Sullivan expressed frustration\u00a0with Clinton at a hearing last summer involving a FOIA lawsuit filed against the department over her records. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be here today if this employee had followed government policy,\u201d Sullivan said.", "Clinton can say her private email network was\u00a0permitted because there wasn\u2019t anything in federal law that expressly prohibited it. But such extensive use of private emails was unusual and clearly discouraged, and she failed to comply with the regulations for maintaining government records.", "Our file on Clinton\u2019s claims about her emails can be found here.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ecc35efc-02bd-4a4a-b63d-331f5f8423f0", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
