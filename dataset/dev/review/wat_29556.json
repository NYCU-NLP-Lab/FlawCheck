It aimed to help immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.", "A\u00a0similar bill\u00a0introduced in by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., in 2017 would have granted a path to citizenship for law-abiding immigrants who met specific criteria, such as reaching certain levels of educational attainment, military service and employment.", "That bill mostly applies to children who were brought to the United States and are already here, so it\u2019s not accurate to characterize it as an \"open borders\" policy.", "Now to McCready\u2019s alleged \"evasiveness.\" Cotten provided a link to a Charlotte Observer\u00a0editorial board column from October 2018\u00a0to support her claim. The Observer wrote that McCready \"dodged direct questions\" about how he would handle immigrants who are currently in the U.S. illegally.", "But in that column, McCready was quoted saying that immigration reform \"starts with securing the border.\" In fact, he has repeatedly said he wants to secure the border.

But sheriffs can decide independently whether they want to comply with ICE.", "A recent bill,\u00a0HB 370, would have changed that by requiring North Carolina sheriffs to honor ICE detainers, but Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u00a0vetoed the bill. If it had become law, sheriffs would have to hold inmates for up to 48 hours beyond the terms of their jail sentence if requested to do so by ICE. As PolitiFact NC has\u00a0previously reported, ICE detainers aren\u2019t valid warrants.", "In an Aug. 23\u00a0interview with WBT-FM, McCready said he thought Cooper\u2019s veto \"was the right call.\" But that doesn\u2019t mean McCready supports sanctuary cities, said his spokesman Matt Fried.", "\"No, Dan doesn\u2019t support a \u2018sanctuary city.\u2019 Violent criminals belong in jail in every city,\" Fried told PolitiFact in an email.", "An analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies isn\u2019t convinced by McCready\u2019s explanation.
