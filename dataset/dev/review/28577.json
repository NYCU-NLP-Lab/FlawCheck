He also warns against vaccinating against the disease, stating that it will infect people and eventually kill them.", "The video was also shared\u00a0in Facebook posts here, here, here, here, here, here\u00a0and here.", "The video has also circulated in Spanish,\u00a0Serbian, Polish, Dutch, Arabic, Malaysian and Indonesian.", "Petrella is a retired gynecologist, known for his opposition to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, according to Italian news media reports here and here.", "AFP found that multiple claims made in the video are false.", "At the beginning of the video, Petrella claims that Covid-19 means \u201cvaccination identification certificate with artificial intelligence\u201d and that number 19 \u201cis the year it was created\u201d. He also claims that Covid-19 is a \u201cmass extermination program\u201d and that \u201cit is not the name of the virus, it is rather the name of the international plan to control and reduce populations\u201d.", "The World Health Organization dubbed the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, a novel strain of coronavirus, \u201cCovid-19\u201d. The name combines\u00a0corona (Co), virus (vi), disease (d), and the year it emerged (2019). WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the announcement about the name of the virus on February 12, 2020. It\u00a0can be seen here.", "Different false conspiracy\u00a0theories about \u201cinternational control plans\u201d \u201cfor population reduction\u201d have circulated on social media since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Both \u201cplans\u201d are often attributed to businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates.", "A spokesperson for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told AFP that the claims about control by implanting a microchip are false.", "Petrella claims the vaccination will leave everyone \u00a0\u201cseriously ill, weakened\u201d and will eventually kill them. He also claims the virus is reactivated by \u201cthe immune ground in which it finds itself\u201d and that \u201cwhat they intend to inject inside of us is going to be the most terrible vaccines\u00a0of all\u201d.", "Dr Vanessa Bryant, immunologist at Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Australia, told AFP by email on December 2, 2020, that although there were concerns during the development of the Covid-19 vaccine that it could potentially trigger a harmful immune response called an antibody-mediated enhancement, trials have not shown that is\u00a0the case.", "\u201cThis was a theoretical concern early on in vaccine development but given the significant numbers of people who have participated in vaccine trials for COVID-19 around the world (more than 100,000 people), it hasn\u2019t proven to be an issue. Antibody mediated enhancement is extremely rare and there is no evidence of this in any models of disease or SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials,\u201d Dr Bryant said.", "\u201cThe tests are not reliable and none can accurately detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus,\u201d Petrella said.", "The gold-standard and most commonly used Covid-19 test in Australia is\u00a0the\u00a0PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test, which\u00a0is performed using a nasal swab.", "PCR tests \u201cdetect the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 to determine whether a person is currently infected. The Chinese authorities provided the complete genomic sequence of the virus in early January, which allowed many laboratories to develop PCR tests that are now used to detect cases around the world,\u201d \u00a0WHO said in June 2020.", "According to Dr Bryant, the PCR test is sensitive and accurate. \u201cPCR testing tests for small fragments of viral genetic material and is sensitive enough to detect low levels of virus prior to symptom onset and may still be detected after a person has stopped being infectious\".", "\"There are also rapid antigen tests that are becoming available across the world (not currently available in Australia), which test actively replicating virus at the time of the test. Rapid tests are not quite as sensitive as the PCR tests because they test for protein fragments of the virus, not genetic material but are still useful, particularly for worker surveillance and in populations where you need to test people frequently (ie. for frontline healthcare workers),\" Dr Bryant added.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
