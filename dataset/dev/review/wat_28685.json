["About this rating", "On 4 January 2019, the CBS television news magazine program 60 Minutes released an excerpt from an interview between freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and CNN host Anderson Cooper. In that excerpt, Ocasio-Cortez proposed that her ambitious environmental agenda known as the Green New Deal could be funded in part by higher tax rates on the super-wealthy, as reported by Politico:", "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is floating an income tax rate as high as 60 to 70 percent on the highest-earning Americans to combat carbon emissions ...", "Ocasio-Cortez pointed out that in a progressive tax rate system, not all income for a high earner is taxed at such a high rate. Rather, rates increase on each additional level of income, with dramatic increases on especially high earnings, such as $10 million.", "Anderson Cooper responded by proclaiming that such a notion was \u201cradical\u201d, a view held by many pundits as well. Others, such as Eric Levitz at New York Magazine made the  case that Ocasio-Cortez's tax proposal would not have been radical in the past, as the tax rate on high-income earners before the Reagan administration was, in fact, 70%:", "In 1980, taxing incomes above $216,000 (or $658,213 in today\u2019s dollars) at 70 percent was considered a moderate, mainstream idea, even though wage inequality was much less severe, and supply-side economics had yet to be discredited.", "The highest federal income tax bracket in  1980, which included those households earning $215,400 or more, had a marginal tax rate of 70%. A marginal tax rate of 70% does not mean that, for example, a person earning $10 million would pay $7 million to the federal government for income taxes. The tax bracket system is progressive, so not all of an earner's income is taxed at the highest level, as explained by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:", "The federal income tax system is progressive, meaning that it imposes a higher average tax rate on higher-income people than on lower-income people. It achieves this by applying higher marginal tax rates to higher levels of income. For example, starting in 2018, the first portion of any taxpayer\u2019s taxable income is taxed at a 10 percent rate, the next portion is taxed at a 12 percent rate, and so on, up to a top marginal rate of 37 percent.", "The actual percentage of one\u2019s income paid in taxes, known as a person\u2019s effective tax rate, is also reduced through various exemptions, deductions, and assorted loopholes. In 1980, the average effective tax rate for highest-income ($200,000+) earners was just above 40%. By 2015, the average effective tax rate for the highest earners ($2 million+) was 27.5%. As noted by Vox, however, comparing earlier tax schemes to today\u2019s system is not a simple proposition:", "Historically, the United States used to have many more tax brackets, and the top marginal tax rates were extremely high. Under Eisenhower, the top earners paid a 91 percent marginal rate, falling to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposed 70 percent under Kennedy and Johnson, before falling to 50 percent after Ronald Reagan\u2019s first big tax cut, and then down to 38 percent after the 1986 tax reform.", "One big part of that story is that before 1986 the tax base was considerably narrower. Rich people used to have a lot more loopholes and deductions of which they could avail themselves. The 1986 law closed a lot of those loopholes, but [it] also cut the top rate.", "But another part of the story is that there used to be more tax brackets. Right now a single person earning $550,000 a year pays the same marginal rate as a person earning 10 or 50 times as much. Under the old tax code, the top rate reserved its top rate for the super-duper rich.", "When speaking specifically about the marginal tax rate for high-income earners, it is factual to state that the top marginal tax rate was 70% in 1980, before the nation\u2019s experiment with \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d changed that system substantively.", "Choi, Matthew. \u00a0 \"Ocasio-Cortez Floats 70 Percent Tax on the Super Wealthy to Fund Green New Deal.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Politico. \u00a0 4 January 2019.", "Levitz, Eric. \u00a0 \"Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s 70 Percent Top Tax Rate Is a Moderate, Evidence-Based Policy.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Magazine. \u00a0 4 January 2019.", "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u00a0 \"Policy Basics: Marginal and Average Tax Rates.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 18 April 2018.", "Internal Revenue Service. \u00a0 \"Average and Marginal Tax Rates, 1980 Individual Income Tax Return.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 1981.", "Desilver, Drew. \u00a0 \"A Closer Look at Who Does (and Doesn\u2019t) Pay U.S. Income Tax.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Pew Research Center. \u00a0 6 October 2017.", "Yglesias, Mathew. \u00a0 \"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is Floating a 70 Percent Top Tax Rate \u2014 Here\u2019s the Research That Backs Her Up.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Vox. \u00a0 4 January 2019.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
