["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on February 13, 2019 | Updated on February 14, 2019", "Despite claims made in a viral meme, Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network has not reported that \u201cMexican drug cartels are paying Pelosi and Schumer millions to keep border open.\u201d", "The political debate over building\u00a0a wall on the United States\u2019 southern border is a frequent prop for misinformation online. We\u2019ve written about a lot of bogus claims related to it.", "A meme that recently started circulating online adds another to the list. It makes the claim that, \u201cLou Dobbs broke the story today that Mexican drug cartels are paying Pelosi and Schumer millions to keep border open. Also, El Chapo paid Hillary 15 million dollars for her 2016 campaign. Now we see *exactly* why these political terrorists won\u2019t build the wall. Where is the FBI swat teams!?\u201d", "None of that is true.", "To start with, the meme hangs its made-up claim on Lou Dobbs, a Fox Business Network host who generally doesn\u2019t report breaking news. As the description of his show on the Fox website explains, he does \u201ca breakdown of the day\u2019s top stories and how they impact the economy.\u201d", "A review of Dobbs\u2019 recent episodes shows that he hasn\u2019t covered any such claim and a spokeswoman for Fox Business Network, Emily Burnham, confirmed to FactCheck.org that the claim hasn\u2019t been reported on his show.", "While he didn\u2019t report the claim on his show, Dobbs did tweet a link to a story that made a similar claim without offering any evidence to support it.", "That story, posted on The Gateway Pundit, carried a headline that said: \u201cReason Why Democrats Don\u2019t Want Border Wall? The DNC and Clinton Foundation Both Reportedly Paid Off by Mexican Cartels.\u201d But the story didn\u2019t support that headline. It cited only three things: a 2016 story about a Texas defense attorney who had represented clients accused of drug crimes and had donated a total of $2,000 to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign committees (a $1,000 donation in 2007, when she was running for president, and a $1,000 donation in 2005, when she was running for reelection to the Senate); claims made on Twitter by a man who is suing the Democratic National Committee; and a two-year-old hoax story from a now-defunct website.", "The hoax story, which was posted on a site made to look like the New York Times (but is unrelated to it, according to domain registry information), had claimed that a report released by WikiLeaks found that the infamous drug lord known as El Chapo had given $15 million to Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. There is no such report on WikiLeaks, and, of course, campaign finance laws bar contributions from foreign nationals. All contributions made to Clinton\u2019s campaign can be seen on the Federal Election Commission\u2019s website.", "Another, earlier story posted on The Gateway Pundit also had suggested \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may be \u201cin bed with Mexican cartels. Perhaps this is why she adamantly doesn\u2019t want a wall.\u201d", "The Gateway Pundit cited Pelosi\u2019s visit to Mexico in 2016 and showed her with then-President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in a strained and baseless attempt to link her to illegal drug money. Pelosi and Republican Rep. Richard L. Hanna led an\u00a0official\u00a0bipartisan congressional delegation\u00a0to Mexico from May 1 to May 3, 2016, government records show.", "Updated, Feb. 14: We added new information we found about a tweet from Lou Dobbs that linked to a related story.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Wagner, Dennis, et al. \u201cThe Wall \u2014 A 2,000-mile search for answers.\u201d USA Today.
