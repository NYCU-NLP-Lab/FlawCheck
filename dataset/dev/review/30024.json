["About this rating", "On Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:", "The terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum \u2014 it is, after all, an inanimate object.", "For those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.", "Here's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:", "But the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.", "The status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.", "Spera said: \"I\u2019m here to tell you something, I don\u2019t know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelle\u2019s alive \u2014 well, I shouldn\u2019t say alive \u2014 Annabelle\u2019s here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\u201d", "This rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.", "The rumor started circulating shortly after the Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Annabelle Wallis, the actress who played Mia in the \"Annabelle\" movie. Wallis talked about her new film, \"The Silencing,\" as well as what it was like to work with Tom Cruise in \"The Mummy.\" Wallis also talked about \"running\" in her interview, and the Hollywood Reporter included a video of some of the \"escape\" scenes from \"The Mummy.\" As this news circulated on Chinese-language social media sites, the news about Wallis running appears to have been misconstrued as Annabelle (the doll) escaping.", "Verhoeven, Beatrice. \u00a0 \"Annabelle Doll Has Not Escaped, Owner Says: \u2018Annabelle\u2019s Alive \u2013 Well, I Shouldn\u2019t Say Alive\u2019 (Video).\"\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 The Wrap. \u00a0 14 August 2020.", "Davids, Brian. \u00a0 \"Annabelle Wallis on 'The Silencing' and Convincing Tom Cruise to Run With Her.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Hollywood Reporter. \u00a0 13 August 2020.", "Bittar, Bill. \u00a0 \"No Trespassing Signs, Fines Used to Ward Off Curious Souls in Search of Warren\u2019s Occult Museum.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Monroe Sun. \u00a0 28 October 2019.", "Atlas Obscura. \u00a0 \"The Warren's Occult Museum.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Retrieved 14 August 2020.", "Heavy. \u00a0 \"Annabelle Doll Escaped From Warren Museum Hoax Debunked.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 14 August 2020.", "Updated [17 August 2020]: Article updated with statement from Tony Spera.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
