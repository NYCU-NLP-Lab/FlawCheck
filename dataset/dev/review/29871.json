["About this rating", "On 19 February 2016, the web site\u00a0Yes I'm Right\u00a0shared\u00a0a\u00a0story about a woman who had been raped and murdered\u00a0while hitchhiking in the Middle East:", "This\u00a0Facebook post (and blatantly\u00a0clickbaiting headline) linked to an article (riddled with inconsistencies, bad information, and misspellings) about the death of\u00a0Giuseppina Pasqualino di Marineo, better known as Pippa Bacca, a performing artist who was killed during a\u00a0world peace effort known as \"Brides on Tour\":", "Woman hitchhiked through the middle east to prove muslims are peaceful. What they did next... OMG!", "We as conservatives get a bad rap when we say Muslims and Islam don\u2019t operate under peaceful ideologies. Liberals would argue they do. Well once again, the liberals are proven wrong and unfortunately, what it took was for someone to die in the worst way imaginable.", "That may be a bit morbid, but I think it\u2019s important to show bleeding heart liberals everything possible to get them to understand.", "Here\u2019s a shocking and sad story that should be shared everywhere to get the word out. An Italian woman who was hitch hiking from Italy to Israel to promote world peace was raped and murdered by Muslims in Turkey.", "While the\u00a0Yes I'm Right\u00a0story\u00a0was based on a\u00a0New York Times article published in April 2008, the web site made no attempt to inform its readers that the incident had taken place over eight years earlier and that they were republishing a years-old story with no clarification about when it occurred.", "In addition to misleading their readers about the\u00a0time frame of the incident, Yes I'm Right also\u00a0falsely claimed that the \"mainstream media\" were\u00a0\"ignoring\" the\u00a0story. While it's true that most mainstream media outlets did\u00a0not write\u00a0about Pippa Bacca in February 2016, it is because the incident, shocking and tragic as it was, was an eight-year-old story by then.", "Yes I'm Right also emphasized that Bacca was on a mission to prove that Muslims were peaceful. But in her description of the\u00a0\"Brides on Tour\" project, Bacca and her traveling partner\u00a0Silvia Moro made no mention of Muslims.\u00a0Instead, Morro\u00a0described their project in an interview as simply a way to promote peace in a general sense:", "Ultimately this long performance, this hitchhiking trip through the countries devastated by war, was aimed at spreading a message of peace and trust in the people that we met along our route.", "The Yes I'm Right article also alleged\u00a0that\u00a0Bacca's death was directly attributable to religious views in the Middle East:", "\"This is what happens with a religion that rapes and kills if you don't abide by their law and worship their god. This is absolutely disgusting.\"", "Yet\u00a0shortly after Bacca's death, officials emphasized that her murder was not\u00a0motivated by religion:", "After reports of Ms. Bacca\u2019s death circulated, Ms. Bacca\u2019s family and Italian and Turkish government officials immediately emphasized that the killing had been a cruel act by a possibly deranged person and could have happened almost anywhere.", "\u201cJust read any newspaper \u2014 people get killed for playing music too loudly, and women get raped in the subway; there are fiends everywhere,\u201d (Rosalia Pasqualino, a sister of Ms. Bacca) said. \u201cThis was not a question of Turkey or of religion.\u201d", "As the incident occurred eight years ago and Turkey is an officially secular country, it's not clear how\u00a0Yes I'm Right concluded (despite the statements from law enforcement and her own family) that Bacca had been killed over religion.", "While it is true that Pippa Bacca was\u00a0murdered\u00a0while hitchhiking in\u00a0Turkey \u00a0during a\u00a0world peace effort known as \"Brides on Tour,\" this incident occurred in 2008 (not 2016), and her death was not\u00a0tied to any religious motives.", "Povoledo, Elizabetta. \u00a0 \"Performance Artist Killed on Peace Trip Is Mourned.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Times. \u00a0 19 April 2008.", "\u00d6zcan, Emine. \u00a0 \"The Accused Admits His Guilt In Pippa Bacca Case.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Bianet. \u00a0 4 November 2008.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
