["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on June 17, 2020", "In signing an executive order on policing issues, President Donald Trump falsely claimed former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden \u201cnever even tried to fix this during their eight-year period.\u201d", "In fact, the Obama administration took several steps to address police violence and community trust issues, some of which the Trump administration has dialed back.", "In his June 16 remarks, Trump took a further swipe at Obama and Biden, his Democratic opponent in the 2020 election, adding, \u201cThe reason they didn\u2019t try is because they had no idea how to do it.\u201d The Trump administration clearly disagreed with some of the Obama administration measures. But it\u2019s simply wrong for Trump to claim the prior administration didn\u2019t do anything.", "The Biden campaign disputed the claim. Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement that Trump \u201cknows that isn\u2019t true because he has spent the past three years tearing down the very reforms the Obama-Biden Administration pursued.\u201d Bedingfield pointed to three initiatives:", "David Alan Sklansky, professor of law and faculty co-director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center, told us those are exactly the three initiatives he would cite. \u201cAll three of those were significant steps taken to address problems with American policing including but not limited to the use of force and the issue of race in policing,\u201d he said.", "Sklansky called Trump\u2019s claim \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cflat-out false.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s indisputable that the Obama administration did far more to address this issue than the Trump administration,\u201d he said, adding that the Trump administration has tried to undo the progress the previous administration had made.", "Specifically, the Trump administration limited the use of consent decrees and rolled back Obama\u2019s restrictions on the transfer of military equipment to local police departments.", "Lauren-Brooke Eisen and Spencer P. Boyer, of the Brennan Center for Justice, also cited these three measures in a June 16 post titled \u201cWhat the Federal Government Can Do to Help Fix Policing in America.\u201d They included one more Obama-era effort: the Collaborative Reform Initiative in the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, which worked with local law enforcement to evaluate their operations, and recommend and institute changes. That program, too, ended under Trump.", "On Dec. 18, 2014, Obama signed an executive order to create the Task Force on 21st Century Policing \u201cto strengthen community policing and strengthen trust among law enforcement officers and the communities they serve,\u201d a White House fact sheet said.", "The task force was formed\u00a0after\u00a0several violent police incidents involving African Americans,\u00a0including the 2014 killings of\u00a0Michael Brown\u00a0in Ferguson, Missouri,\u00a0Eric Garner\u00a0in New York and\u00a0Tamir Rice in Cleveland. It was chaired by Charles Ramsey, then the commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department and president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, and Laurie Robinson, a professor of criminology and law at George Mason University and a former Justice Department official.", "In November and December 2014, grand juries decided not to indict the officers in the Brown and Garner cases. In discussing the task force at the time, Obama said Ferguson, where weeks of protests occurred, exposed \u201ca simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color.\u201d", "The task force issued its final report in May 2015, offering recommendations on issues including building trust, community policing, officer training and officer safety. Sklansky told us the task force was \u201ca very extensive operation that culminated in a very detailed, very thoughtful report with a lot of specific recommendations, many of which had to do with police violence.\u201d", "Robinson, in a February article published in the ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, said the report \u201chad an impact.\u201d Several law enforcement groups \u201chave embraced the report,\u201d she said, and a think tank researcher said agencies across the country were using it \u201cas their playbook.\u201d", "The Brennan Center experts noted that \u201cnot nearly enough jurisdictions have heeded the advice\u201d in that report.", "But it\u2019s worth noting, as the Washington Post Fact Checker also did, that Trump\u2019s executive order reflected the task force recommendations on a few points.", "Trump\u2019s executive order called for the attorney general and secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to \u201cdevelop opportunities to train law enforcement officers with respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental health, homelessness, and addiction\u201d and \u201cto increase the capacity of social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies.\u201d The 2015 task force report recommended \u201cmultidisciplinary, community team approaches\u201d for \u201cresponding to mental health crisis situations\u201d as well as community problems involving \u201chomelessness, substance abuse, domestic violence, human trafficking, and child abuse.\u201d", "The task force said law enforcement \u201cpolicies for training on use of force should emphasize de-escalation and alternatives to arrest or summons in situations where appropriate,\u201d while Trump\u2019s executive order said the administration shall propose legislation that would include \u201ctraining and technical assistance required to adopt and implement improved use-of-force policies and procedures, including scenario-driven de-escalation techniques.\u201d", "The Obama administration\u2019s Department of Justice Civil Rights Division conducted \u201cpattern or practice\u201d investigations of police departments focused on whether there were patterns of constitutional rights violations, and then obtained court-enforced consent decrees to get some departments to implement changes.", "A Jan. 5, 2017, exit memo by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the DOJ launched 23 such investigations under Obama and \u201cis now enforcing 17 agreements with law enforcement agencies across the country, including 14 consent decrees.\u201d Those investigations focused on the Ferguson Police Department, as well as agencies in Baltimore, Chicago and other cities.", "\u201cConsent decrees were a very important initiative to try to bring systemic change to police departments,\u201d addressing all forms of policing including use of force, Sklansky said. The Obama administration \u201claunched more of these investigations than any previous administration.\u201d", "But the Trump administration significantly scaled back that effort. Eisen and Boyer write that on the day he left office, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u201csigned a memo detailing the narrow circumstances under which DOJ can enter into a consent decree. Since President Trump took office, the Justice Department has publicly announced only one pattern-or-practice investigation into a police department.\u201d", "The Nov. 7, 2018, memo said it \u201cprovides guidance on the limited circumstances in which such a consent decree may be appropriate; limits the terms for consent decrees and settlement agreements with state and local governmental entities\u201d and \u201camends the process for the approval of these mechanisms in cases in which they are permissible.\u201d", "Sessions had criticized the Baltimore consent decree, an agreement reached near the end of the Obama administration but signed by a federal judge in April 2017. Sessions said he had \u201cgrave concerns that some provisions of this decree will reduce the lawful powers of the police department and result in a less safe city.\u201d", "Obama also signed an executive order to create a working group to limit surplus military equipment and supplies that are provided for free to state and local law enforcement agencies under what\u2019s called the\u00a01033 program.", "The administration then adopted the recommendations of the working group, issued in May 2015, creating a \u201cprohibited equipment list\u201d \u2014 which included tracked armored vehicles, grenade launchers and firearms/ammunition of .50 caliber and above \u2014 and a \u201ccontrolled equipment list\u201d \u2014 including wheeled armored vehicles, riot shields and helmets, and explosives. Police departments could still obtain the equipment in the latter group, but they would have to provide justification for needing it and proper training.", "We wrote about this issue in 2017 when Sessions misleadingly cited studies to claim Obama \u201cwent too far\u201d and undermined public safety.", "On Aug. 28, 2017, Trump issued an executive order rescinding Obama\u2019s.", "In addition, the Brennan Center experts wrote about the Trump administration\u2019s curtailing of the Collaborative Reform Initiative in the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, saying the program \u201chad widespread support from police chiefs across the country\u201d and allowed the DOJ to work with the cities and avoid litigation.", "Sessions scaled back that program in September 2017, saying in a memo, \u201cThis is a course correction to ensure that resources go to agencies that require assistance rather than expensive wide-ranging investigative assessments that go beyond the scope of technical assistance and support.\u201d", "At the time, the Washington Post reported that Sessions\u2019 decision would affect \u201cabout 14 police departments nationwide that had either begun receiving public reports from the COPS office or expected to receive such reports soon.\u201d", "In September 2015, the Obama DOJ also announced $23.2 million in grants to 73 local law enforcement agencies to \u201cexpand the use of body-worn cameras and explore their impact.\u201d", "In her exit memo, Lynch also touted implicit bias training that the DOJ required of all employees and federal law enforcement agencies.", "Clearly, Trump was wrong to claim Obama and Biden \u201cnever even tried to fix\u201d issues surrounding police brutality and lack of trust between police departments and the communities they serve. Trump may not agree with some of the measures \u2014 as evidenced by his eliminating or restricting them \u2014 but they were indeed efforts aimed directly at these issues.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
