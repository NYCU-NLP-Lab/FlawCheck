["An image of what appears to be a mosque on a railway platform has been widely circulating online. Several people have claimed that a mosque stands on the platform of the Old Delhi railway station. According to the claim, the mosque hasn\u2019t been removed even as the Hanuman temple that stood on the road at Chandni Chowk was torn down last week as part of the area\u2019s redevelopment project. The Hanuman temple, declared an encroachment, was demolished under the Delhi High Court\u2019s orders.", "Twitter user Manvi Tripathi shared this image with a similar claim.
