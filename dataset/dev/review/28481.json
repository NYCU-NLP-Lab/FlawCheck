Weird huh? The damn has now KRACKed,\" the post continues.", "The same claim has since been reposted by other Facebook users and spread\u00a0to several social media platforms, including Twitter, Reddit forums and Parler.", "The viral graph highlights the alleged spike in red, which purportedly shows Biden at 225,196 votes and President Donald Trump at 99,036 votes. Next to it reads a timestamp of Nov. 4.", "USA TODAY reached out to the Hip Hop Patriot and the Facebook user for comment.", "Fact check:Georgia 'suitcase' video is missing context", "A pipe burst did take place at a ballot processing site at State Farm Arena; however, no ballots were damaged, according to election officials.
