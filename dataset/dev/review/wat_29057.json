["Pure fabrication lies behind a story flagged by Facebook users about a Georgia mosque sending Hurricane Harvey donations to Syrian refugees. A website called As American as Apple Pie posted this headline on Sept. 7: \"Georgia Mosque KEEPS Hurricane Harvey Donations, Will Send To Syrian Refugees Instead.\"", "The item cited Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton who allegedly said, \"Because Donald Trump will not let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States, we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter.\"", "There is not a whisper of truth to this piece.", "For starters, there is no Peachton, Ga.", "A website named Salatomatic lists mosques around the country. There is no Ramazala Mosque in Georgia.", "The article urges readers to \"call the Ramazala Mosque at (330) 366-6476 and give them a piece of your mind.\" The 330 area code covers Akron, Ohio. The number is the same number as the one listed on the As American as Apple Pie Facebook page.", "That Facebook page describes the website as an entertainment website launched in 2024.", "A similar version of this story on another website claimed that police arrested Alkalb. That item quoted the \"local newspaper, the Peachton Herald.\" That paper is as made up as the town of Peachton.", "A self-described\u00a0entertainment website posted a story that a Georgia mosque was diverting Hurricane Harvey donations to refugees from Syria. Neither the mosque nor the town it supposedly is in exist.", "This is pure fake news. We rate it Pants on Fire.", "As American as Apple Pie, Georgia Mosque KEEPS Hurricane Harvey Donations, Will Send To Syrian Refugees Instead, Sept. 7, 2017", "American as Applie Pie,\u00a0Facebook page, accessed Sept. 11, 2017", "Salatomatic, Georgia mosques, accessed Sept. 11, 2017", "Lastlineofdefense.org, Cops arrest Georgia imam who kept supplies for meant for hurricane victims, Sept. 7, 2017", "Lead Stories, Fake News: Georgia Mosque Did NOT Keep Hurricane Harvey Donations, Will NOT Send To Syrian Refugees Instead, Sept. 7, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
