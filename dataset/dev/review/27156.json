["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on October 19, 2017", "In a televised debate on taxes, Sen. Ted Cruz denied that he ever called Social Security a \u201cPonzi scheme.\u201d But in a 2011 interview, Cruz gave the definition of a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d and said it fits Social Security.", "\u201cThat is exactly how Social Security operates,\u201d Cruz said in 2011.", "The issue of Social Security came up during a CNN debate between Cruz and Sen. Bernie Sanders. A Vermont independent who unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, Sanders said Cruz was \u201cquoted as saying Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.\u201d Cruz denied doing so.", "Sanders, Oct. 19: Senator Cruz, I think you were quoted as saying Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.", "Cruz: I\u2019ve never said that. That\u2019s false.", "Sanders: OK, then I \u2014 you were quoted as that. If you tell me it\u2019s false, then I accept that. OK.", "Cruz: It\u2019s false.", "Later in the show, Sanders returned to the topic and said he had proof that Cruz did indeed call Social Security a Ponzi scheme, and, again, Cruz denied it.", "Sanders:\u00a0You said a little while ago that you never said that Social Security was a Ponzi scheme. Go to my Twitter page, and you will hear Ted Cruz say Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. \u2026", "Cruz:\u00a0I can\u2019t let what Bernie said go by without responding to. He\u2019s referring to an interview where I was asked about another Republican who made the comment about Ponzi scheme. It wasn\u2019t my comment. It was somebody else\u2019s.", "Sanders\u2019 staff tweeted a clip of Cruz talking about Social Security in a Sept. 9, 2011, interview with Evan Smith of the Texas Tribune. Smith asked Cruz:\u00a0\u201cYes or no. Is Social Security a Ponzi scheme?\u201d In response, Cruz jokingly asked Smith if NBC\u2019s Brian Williams had written his questions \u2014 referring to a question Rick Perry was asked during a Republican debate\u00a0co-hosted by Williams two days earlier.", "In that Sept. 7, 2011, debate, as we wrote at the time, Perry called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. That\u2019s what Cruz meant when he said that Sanders was \u201creferring to an interview where I was asked about another Republican who made the comment about Ponzi scheme. It wasn\u2019t my comment. It was somebody else\u2019s.\u201d", "Cruz is right that it was Perry\u2019s comment, but the 2011 interview shows that Cruz clearly agreed with it.", "Cruz, Sept. 9, 2011: There is a level at which words have meaning. What does the word Ponzi scheme mean? A Ponzi scheme is a system \u2014 if you and I cooked up a Ponzi scheme, we would have current people pay into it. We would take the money and we would pay it out to other recipients. That\u2019s the definition of a Ponzi scheme. In the English language, that is exactly how Social Security operates.", "Smith: So, I\u2019m going to take that as a \u201cyes.\u201d That you believe that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.", "Cruz: I think there is an effort to treat that as rhetoric, but there\u2019s no doubt that\u2019s what it is.", "The full video of the back-and-forth between Smith and Cruz shows that the Texas senator studiously avoided using the term \u201cPonzi scheme,\u201d saying that Smith was asking a \u201cloaded question.\u201d Smith tried several times to get a yes or no answer, but instead got \u2014 as we show above \u2014 Cruz\u2019s definition of a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d and his opinion that \u201cthat is exactly how Social Security operates.\u201d", "For the record, we said in 2011 that Perry\u2019s description of Social Security as a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d is a gross exaggeration.", "FactCheck.org, Sept. 8, 2011: The [Social Security] system doesn\u2019t meet the common definition of a \u201cPonzi,\u201d which is a criminal fraud, relying on deception. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, says a Ponzi is \u201can investment fraud\u00a0that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.\u201d Ponzi schemes draw their name from\u00a0Charles Ponzi, who in the 1920s promised his victims that he could provide a 50 percent return in 90 days by putting their money into a speculation scheme involving postage stamps. In reality, Ponzi simply paid early \u201cinvestors\u201d big returns with the money eagerly offered by others who came later \u2014 pocketing millions for himself \u2014 until the bubble inevitably collapsed.\u00a0Bernard Madoff\u2019s\u00a0more recent fraud \u2014 while much larger \u2014 was another example of a Ponzi scheme. Madoff and Ponzi lied to their victims about where their money was going, while Social Security\u2019s finances \u2014 while troubled \u2014 are an open book.", "We should also note that Cruz in 2011 and again this year described Social Security as an essential part of the security net for Americans. In the CNN debate with Sanders, Cruz described Social Security as a \u201cfundamental bulwark of our society\u201d and criticized \u201cpoliticians in Washington\u201d for \u201cletting it careen towards insolvency.\u201d", "In a 2017 report, the\u00a0Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds project that the Social Security trust funds will be depleted by 2034.\u00a0Once the trust funds are gone,\u00a0Social Security can still pay benefits \u2014 but not more benefits than it takes in from revenue. The trustees say tax income would be \u201csufficient to pay about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through the end of the projection period in 2091.\u201d", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
