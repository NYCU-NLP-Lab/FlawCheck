["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Republican Ed Gillespie opened his bid for the U.S. Senate this month by dropping responsibility for Obamacare on the toes of incumbent Democrat Mark Warner.", "Gillespie -- a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and former advisor to President George W. Bush -- announced his candidacy on Jan. 16. Five days later, he launched a web ad featuring 2009 video snippets of Gillespie criticizing Obamacare and Warner defending it.", "The screen turns black and these words appear: \"Obamacare passed by just one vote in the Senate. It wouldn\u2019t have passed without Mark Warner\u2019s vote.\"", "We explored whether Warner\u2019s vote was essential to passage of the health care package.", "Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said the claim is based on a vote Warner cast in 2009 to prevent a Senate filibuster on Obamacare.", "Under the Senate\u2019s cloture rules, it takes 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to end debate on most types of legislation and allow an up or down vote on the bill. On Dec. 23, 2009, the Senate voted 60-39 to halt debate on Obamacare. Warner joined all of his fellow Democrats and two independents in voting to stop a threatened Republican filibuster.", "The next day, the Senate passed Obamacare with an identical 60-39 vote. But Warner\u2019s vote wasn\u2019t as important this time because only a simple majority was required to approve the legislation.", "We should note that Warner is hardly the first Democratic senator to be attacked for his or her vote to end the filibuster. Republicans have charged each of at least four other Democrats with casting \"the deciding vote.\" In Virginia last November, then-Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli claimed Warner cast \"the tie-breaking vote\" to pass Obamacare.", "PolitiFact\u2019s standard ruling on those claims has been Mostly False. We, and our colleagues in \u00a0other states, have said it\u2019s misleading to accuse one senator of casting the pivotal ballot when the same could be said of 59 others who voted to end the filibuster.", "Our ruling", "Gillespie says \"Obamacare passed by one vote in the Senate. It wouldn\u2019t have passed without Mark Warner\u2019s vote.\"", "This is an improvement on past Republican efforts to blame Warner for casting the deciding vote to block a filibuster against Obamacare when, in fact, he was joined by 59 colleagues. It casts Warner as part of a collective weight that tipped the scales -- not the final grain of sand.", "Warner was one of 60 who voted to block the filibuster -- the bare number required under Senate rules. That allowed the Senate the following day to vote on the Obamacare bill and here\u2019s where Gillespie\u2019s statement comes up a little bit short.", "The bill, with Warner\u2019s support, passed by a 60-39 vote. But since it only required a simple majority in the 100-member Senate to approve the legislation, Warner\u2019s vote was not essential this time around. The actual Obamacare bill would have passed with or without him.", "So Gillespie\u2019s statement is largely accurate but needs a technical clarification. We rate it Mostly True.", "Ed Gillespie, \"Who was Right\" ad, Jan 21, 2014.", "Interview with Paul Logan, spokesperson for Ed Gillespie, Jan. 24, 2014.", "U.S. Senate roll call vote on whether to invoke cloture on the Affordable Care Act, Dec. 23, 2009.", "U.S. Senate roll call vote on passing the Affordable Care Act, Dec. 24, 2009.", "U.S. Senate, \"U.S. Senate roll call votes 111th Congress - 1st session (2009),\" accessed Nov. 20, 2013.", "PolitiFact, \"\u2018The deciding vote?\u2019 All 60 of them!,\" June 14, 2012.", "PolitiFact Ohio, \"Josh Mandel says Sherrod Brown cast the deciding vote for government takeover of health care,\" May 30, 2012.", "PolitiFact New Hampshire, \"Jim Rubens claims U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, was the deciding vote to pass Obamacare,\" Nov. 19. 2013.", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Was Florida\u2019s Bill Nelson \u2018the deciding vote\u2019 on health care law?\" June 14, 2012.", "PolitiFact Virginia, \"Cuccinelli says Warner cast `the tiebreaking vote\u2019 on Obamacare,\" Nov. 25, 2013.", "The Fact Checker, \"Did Mary Landrieu cast the `deciding\u2019 vote on Obamacare?\" Nov. 22, 2013.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
