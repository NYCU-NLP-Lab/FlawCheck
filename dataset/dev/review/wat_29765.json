So the promise is likely to come up again \u2026 and again.", "Here, we\u2019ll briefly revisit Walker\u2019s original promise, and see where the jobs tally currently stands.", "The promise", "In 2010, Walker first sought the governor\u2019s office on the promise that he would bring 250,000 private-sector jobs to Wisconsin by the end of his first term.", "\"(Scott Walker will) get government out of the way of employers ... who will then help Wisconsin create 250,000 jobs by 2015, and as we create those new jobs, we will be able to add 10,000 new businesses,\" his campaign said at the time.", "For the years 2011 through 2014, Wisconsin added 130,153 private-sector jobs, meaning Walker fell short of his first-term promise by about 100,000 jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.", "For this tally, we used the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which surveys nearly all state businesses, to get the most accurate picture for Walker's years in office.
