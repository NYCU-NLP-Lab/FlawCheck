["By Robert Farley", "Posted on October 25, 2019", "In his campaign rally speeches, President Donald Trump often boasts of his administration\u2019s plan to end the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. in 10 years. It\u2019s true he has proposed funding for that initiative, but he\u2019s wrong to say \u201cthe previous administration spent no money\u201d on such efforts.", "In fact, the Obama administration spent about the same per year on AIDS research and prevention as the Trump administration has. And that\u2019s only because Congress actually writes the budgets. Because while Obama routinely sought to increase funding, until this year, Trump has proposed cutting it.", "The president also has falsely stated that his plan would \u201ceradicate AIDS in America once and for all.\u201d That\u2019s not what ending the epidemic means, and not what his plan proposes.", "During a cabinet meeting in July, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar pronounced that \u201cit\u2019s going to be one of President Trump\u2019s great legacies for history \u2026 the eradication of HIV as an epidemic here in the United States.\u201d", "During speeches, Trump has made it clear that he wants credit for this historic achievement.", "At a recent rally in Dallas, for example, Trump claimed that \u201cthe previous administration spent no money on that and we\u2019re spending a lot.\u201d", "Trump, Oct. 17: We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. We\u2019re doing that. Who would have believed we could do that? We\u2019re doing that. And the previous administration spent no money on that and we\u2019re spending a lot. But think of that, who would have thought that. We\u2019re going to end within 10 years the AIDS epidemic in our country. Who would have thought we\u2019ve advanced that far?", "During his State of the Union address in 2019, Trump announced that his 2020 budget would \u201cmake the needed commitment to eliminate the H.I.V. epidemic in the United States within 10 years.\u201d That pronouncement was backed by a plan, \u201cEnding the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America,\u201d and Trump\u2019s budget proposed $291 million in spending for that initiative.", "The term \u201cepidemic\u201d is a bit subjective. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the term \u201crefers to an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area.\u201d So, ending an epidemic would mean reducing cases below a certain level. The goal in the administration\u2019s plan is to reduce the number of new HIV infections by 75% by 2025, and by 90% by 2030. If that milestone were achieved, one could argue that that would end HIV/AIDS as an \u201cepidemic.\u201d But that does not mean HIV/AIDS would be wiped out entirely.", "Trump has not always been accurate on that point, such as when he said on Feb. 11 and Oct. 3 that the country would be \u201cAIDS-free\u201d in 10 years, or when he said on July 16 that his program would lead to \u201cthe eradication of AIDS,\u201d or when he said on June 14 and June 18 that his administration would \u201ceradicate AIDS in America once and for all.\u201d", "While the Obama administration did not fund a program that used the terminology \u201cEnding the HIV Epidemic,\u201d it is highly misleading for Trump to claim that \u201cthe previous administration spent no money on that and we\u2019re spending a lot.\u201d", "The Obama administration spent more than $3 billion per year on research and prevention in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic, about the same as has been spent under Trump. In fact, the Obama administration had a 2010 initiative it called \u201cNational HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States.\u201d The updated 2015 version of that plan had more modest goals than Trump\u2019s plan \u2014 it called for reducing the number of new diagnoses of HIV by at least 25 percent by 2020. But it employed the same strategy at the heart of the Trump initiative \u2014 targeting prevention drugs and treatment in high-risk areas.", "Before comparing the Obama and Trump funding of HIV/AIDS initiatives \u2014 first a word about process. Presidents\u2019 budgets are somewhat symbolic statements of presidential priorities. Congress ultimately passes budgets, and it can accept or reject, or completely ignore, any of the funding proposals included in a president\u2019s budget proposal.", "The key domestic HIV programs contained in the federal budget are the Ryan White Program, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV prevention programs, and National Institutes of Health domestic HIV research. While actual funding for these programs \u2014 the funding approved by Congress \u2014 has remained relatively flat, Obama often sought to increase that funding.", "Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, noted that in six of Obama\u2019s eight years, he proposed funding increases for these programs; in two of his years, he requested flat funding.", "\u201cCongress ended up flat funding or decreasing funding for these programs in these [Obama] years,\u201d Kates told us via email. \u201cIf you look at the trend line of final funding, therefore, they look pretty flat over the Obama years.\u201d", "By contrast, in his first two budget plans, Trump proposed cuts to those programs overall.", "In Trump\u2019s third budget plan, the fiscal year 2020 budget unveiled in March, Trump \u201chas requested a significant increase in Ryan White and CDC, and a little for NIH, which still needs to be finalized by Congress,\u201d Kates said.", "\u201cI can say that the Obama Administration spent a good deal of money on HIV/AIDS research and care, and that President Trump\u2019s goals are laudable, but the resources needed to accomplish his Ending the HIV Epidemic are only now starting to be put in place,\u201d Kenneth Mayer, a professor at Harvard Medical School and founder, co-chair and medical research director at the Fenway Institute in Boston, told us via email. \u201cGiven that the plan has a decade time horizon, it is too early to comment on long term expenditures and effectiveness.\u201d", "In a speech on Oct. 3, Trump said progress made on combating HIV/AIDS has been \u201csomewhat of a secret\u201d and that there has been \u201ctremendous progress that we\u2019ve made over the last few years on AIDS and AIDS research.\u201d In fact, most of the research on which the initiative relies predates Trump\u2019s presidency.", "One of the key strategies to reduce new diagnoses of HIV under the Trump initiative is to target initial efforts on \u201cgeographic hotspots\u201d and to provide pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pills to protect people at the highest risk of getting HIV. PrEP is a biomedical prevention tool approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2012 that helps reduce the risk of getting HIV.", "The plan also calls for diagnosing people as early as possible and expanding treatment so that people who are HIV-positive have only very low or even undetectable amounts of virus in their blood. That allows them to stay healthy and makes them far less likely to infect others.", "Similar strategies were detailed by the Obama administration in its updated \u201cNational HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States,\u201d which it released in 2015. According to the stated vision of the plan, \u201cThe United States will become a place where new HIV infections are rare, and when they do occur, every person, regardless of age, gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, or socio-economic circumstance, will have unfettered access to high quality, life-extending care, free from stigma and discrimination.\u201d (The Obama administration also produced the first National HIV/AIDS Strategy in July 2010.)", "The 2015 updated plan from the Obama administration \u201calso had ambitious goals, but technically did not call for the end of the epidemic, which is somewhat new terminology [in the Trump initiative],\u201d Emily McCloskey, a director of the policy and legislative affairs team for NASTAD (National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors), told us via email.", "After several years of declines, however, the number of new HIV diagnoses has remained relatively flat since 2012.", "The Trump proposal includes a significant infusion of new funding. Trump proposed $291 million in funding for his initiative, over and above the existing domestic funding to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. As we noted earlier, that is a turnaround from Trump\u2019s first two budget proposals, which sought to cut about an average $200 million per year from the Ryan White and CDC HIV/AIDS budgets.", "McCloskey said she anticipates that the Trump administration will request significantly more funding in its next budget request.", "\u201cThe initiative announced by the president is an important one and the administration has requested new funds and plans to pursue proven public health interventions and efforts which can make a difference,\u201d Kates, from the Kaiser Family Foundation, told us. \u201cHowever, it is too early to say if the trajectory toward the goal has improved significantly under or because of the Trump administration. The funding requested has not yet been approved by Congress and the implementation of the new initiative is only in the planning stage.\u201d", "Kates and other experts also cautioned that other parts of Trump\u2019s policy may work against the goals of the initiative.", "\u201cThe Trump administration has cut back access to health insurance in ways that could run counter to the proposed goals of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative,\u201d Kates said, mentioning efforts to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. The number of people lacking health insurance rose by nearly 2 million from 2017 to 2018, according to figures reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.", "Also, despite mentioning in his 2019 State of the Union address his aim to defeat AIDS \u201cin America and beyond,\u201d his budget proposals have consistently called for reductions in the global health budget to combat AIDS. The Kaiser Family Foundation said Trump\u2019s 2020 budget would cut $1.35 billion from the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which seeks to control HIV around the globe.", "Greg Millett, vice president and director of public policy at the HIV research foundation amfAR, told Kaiser Health News that Trump\u2019s budget is \u201cschizophrenic.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s just so many opposites within this budget of things that are truly helpful and useful,\u201d Millett said. \u201cAnd then, they are counterbalanced by things that just erase that goodwill.\u201d", "\u201cStill,\u201d Kates said, \u201cif Congress approves the funding \u2014 which it has indicated it will do \u2014 the new effort could provide a much needed infusion of funds and serve as a catalyst to further drive down new HIV infections in the U.S.\u201d", "So, it\u2019s accurate for Trump to boast that he has proposed a significant funding increase to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. But that funding increase has yet to be approved by Congress, and experts say it\u2019s too soon to tell if the president\u2019s program will achieve its lofty goals. Trump is wrong to say that the Obama administration did not fund similar efforts. Trump\u2019s initiative seeks to build on research and prevention efforts that long predate his time in office.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
