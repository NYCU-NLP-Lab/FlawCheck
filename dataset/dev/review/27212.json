Here is an official\u00a0Philippine government website about the revolution.", "The Philippine government has sought to recover the estimated $10 billion looted by Marcos and his allies during his 20 years in power, as reported here by AFP.", "Below is a screenshot of the misleading post:", "The Tagalog and English-language text image translates to English as: \"to all anti Marcos, in the whole world no court is saying the Marcoses are thieves, you're all hearsay, wehhhh and heard they\u2019re in the guiness world book record, now you should prove which court has said the marcoses are thieves?\"", "The post\u2019s caption translates to English in part as: \"This is so simple but right on target, wherever court you bring your claim that they're thieves... you haven't proven anything that they have stolen... because the truth is it's their MONEY. Not stolen!\"", "\"All cases against IMELDA and FEM have been won in the whole world\u2026\u201d", "\u201cFEM\u201d referst to Ferdinand E. Marcos.", "\u201cIMELDA\u201d refers to his wife, Imelda Marcos.", "The same text image\u00a0was shared here on Facebook more recently on November 26, 2019.", "The claim is false; the Philippine Supreme Court ruled in 2003, 2012 and 2017 that Ferdinand Marcos and his family were guilty of large-scale fraud.", "On July 15, 2003, the court ruled that Marcos\u00a0Swiss bank account deposits amounting to more than US$658 million as of January 31, 2002 be forfeited to the Philippine government.", "The Philippine government proved the total deposits were \u201cpatently disproportionate\u201d to the Marcos\u2019 salaries as public officials, the court said.", "A portion of the court ruling reads: \u201cPetitioner Republic presented not only a schedule indicating the lawful income of the Marcos spouses during their incumbency but also evidence that they had huge deposits beyond such lawful income in Swiss banks under the names of five different foundations. We believe petitioner was able to establish the prima facie presumption that the assets and properties acquired by the Marcoses were manifestly and patently disproportionate to their aggregate salaries as public officials.\u201d", "Below is a screenshot of this section of the court ruling:", "Imelda and her children asked the court to reconsider its decision, but their motions were \u201cdenied with finality\u201d in this court ruling on November 18, 2003.", "In this court ruling on April 25, 2012, the Marcos family were ordered to pay back more than US$3 million to the state.", "On January 18, 2017, the court affirmed a Sandiganbayan judgment which forfeited to the state pieces of jewelry recovered from the Marcoses called the \"Malaca\u00f1ang Collection\".", "The Sandiganbayan is a special anti-graft court in the Philippines,", "A portion of the Supreme Court ruling states: \u201cWe reiterate what we have already stated initially in Republic v. Sandiganbayan, and subsequently in Marcos v. Republic: that \u2018whenever any public officer or employee has acquired during his incumbency an amount of property which is manifestly out of proportion to his salary as such public officer or employee and to his other lawful income and the income from legitimately acquired property, said property shall be presumed prima facie to have been unlawfully acquired.\u2019 Petitioners failed to satisfactorily show that the properties were lawfully acquired; hence, the prima facie presumption that they were unlawfully acquired prevails.\u201d", "In addition to the Supreme Court rulings, the Sandiganbayan in November 2018 found Imelda guilty of corruption and handed her a lengthy prison term, as reported here by AFP.", "The 90-year-old former First Lady can appeal the ruling and remain free on bail as long as the conviction is not final, the report said.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
