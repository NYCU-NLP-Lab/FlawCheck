["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "If New Jersey is going to see any fiscal progress, the state has to reduce spending, according to Gov. Chris Christie.", "And those steps have already yielded significant results, he claimed recently.", "\"We\u2019re spending less money today, in upcoming fiscal year 2014 than the Corzine-Buono budget spent in fiscal year 2008,\" Christie said during his monthly \"Ask the Governor\" program that aired April 22 on NJ101.5 FM.", "Christie\u2019s claim is a variation on one he made in January, also during that month\u2019s \"Ask the Governor\" program, when he tied the 2008 budget to Democratic predecessor Jon Corzine. Now he\u2019s also tying it to state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who is challenging Christie in November\u2019s gubernatorial election.", "As we determined in a February fact-check, state spending is down since 2008, but Christie ignores that spending has still increased with each new state budget since he took office on Jan. 19, 2010.", "Let\u2019s review the numbers.", "It\u2019s worth noting that Christie first made the comparison of his administration spending less than Corzine\u2019s between the fiscal 2008 and 2013 budgets, so we\u2019ll look at those two years first. The spending difference was $1.5 billion.", "For fiscal year 2008, spending was $33.6 billion, according to Treasury department reports.", "Christie\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2013 contained $32.1 billion in spending.", "So Christie is correct that spending on his watch is below what Corzine spent, but the governor\u2019s spending isn\u2019t so innocent, either.", "Christie\u2019s first budget for fiscal year 2011 was $28.4 billion. For fiscal year 2012, the governor approved a $29.6 billion budget.", "Christie\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget was $32.1 billion and his proposed fiscal year 2014 budget is $32.9 billion. So, Christie\u2019s budgets are lower than Corzine\u2019s, but they\u2019re still growing every year. We should note that the fiscal year 2014 blueprint is still subject to hearings and possible cuts. Christie has until July 1 to sign it.", "In PolitiFact New Jersey\u2019s February fact-check, Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn said the increased spending since fiscal year 2011 was due in part to Christie\u2019s policies boosting the state\u2019s economy, leading to higher tax revenues. At that time Quinn noted that two of the major areas of higher spending had been in education and pension contributions.", "There\u2019s also another reason why Christie\u2019s budgets have spent less than the ones crafted on Corzine\u2019s watch: Corzine used more money for property tax relief than Christie. Also, Christie imposed a 2-percent cap on spending that didn\u2019t exist when Corzine ran the state.", "Additionally, although Christie ties Buono in to the fiscal year 2008 budget, she did not chair the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee in 2007, the year that Corzine\u2019s spending plan was created. Buono chaired that panel in 2008 and 2009, when the fiscal years 2009 and 2010 budgets were created.", "Said David Turner, a Buono for Governor spokesman, in an e-mail: \"The Governor would rather rewrite history than own up to cutting property tax relief, slashing education aid and reducing the Earned Income Tax Credit.\"", "Our ruling", "In responding to a caller during New Jersey 101.5\u2019s \"Ask the Governor\" program last month, Christie claimed, \"We\u2019re spending less money today, in upcoming fiscal year 2014 than the Corzine-Buono budget spent in fiscal year 2008.\"", "Christie is correct that the proposed fiscal year 2014 budget of $32.9 billion is less than the level of state spending under Corzine in fiscal year 2008, at $33.6 billion. But Christie\u2019s claim leaves out some details.", "First, state spending has increased every year that Christie has been governor. Second, he ties the higher-spending budgets in part to Buono, but she did not chair the Senate budget panel that crafted the fiscal year 2008 budget.", "Overall, Christie\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
