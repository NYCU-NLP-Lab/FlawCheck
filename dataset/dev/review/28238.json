["Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee passed away at the AIIMS hospital in New Delhi on August 16. The hours leading to his demise had witnessed a rush of top political leaders to AIIMS as anxiety grew over the state of his health. Vajpayee breathed his last at 5:05 pm, and political nitpicking on social media began not long after. Amid the outpouring of grief and condolence, a photograph of PM Modi surrounded by medical personnel began circulating.", "The photograph has been shared with varying captions by pages, groups and individuals on social media, all mocking the Prime Minister for his supposed indifference and lack of empathy, on the basis of his facial expression.

While PM Modi can be seen wearing a white kurta on this occasion, it may be noted that it is a half-sleeved kurta and not a full-sleeved kurta as seen in this viral photograph.", "PM Modi left AIIMS after visiting Vajpayee at around 2:45 pm, whereas the former PM drew his last breath at 5:05 pm. Thus, there is no basis to the claim that PM Modi was seen \u2018smiling\u2019 after Vajpayee passed away. Moreover, there is nothing in the photograph or otherwise to suggest lack of compassion or grief on the part of PM Modi, but social media users readily indulged in a political slugfest. In earlier instances, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been mocked and criticised repeatedly for his facial expression on grave occasions.", "Donate Now", "Arjun Sidharth is a writer with Alt News.
