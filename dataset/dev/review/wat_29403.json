The suspect, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, is an Uzbek national whom Trump has singled out as a reason why \"chain migration\" and a visa lottery program should end.", "\"This man that came in \u2014 or whatever you want to call him \u2014 brought in, with him, other people \u2026 He was the point of contact \u2014 the primary point of contact for \u2014 and this is preliminarily \u2014 23 people that came in, or potentially came in with him. And that\u2019s not acceptable. So we want to get rid of chain migration, and we\u2019ve wanted to do that for a long time,\" Trump said Nov. 1.", "Trump offered a lower number as he discussed the terror suspect with the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 11: \"So the lottery has to end, chain migration \u2014 he brought in, they say, 22 people through the chain.

A State Department spokesperson told us that visa records are confidential under immigration law, preventing comment on the details of individual visa cases.", "Experts told us Trump\u2019s figures are improbable.", "Saipov, from Uzbekistan, entered the United States in 2010 through the diversity visa lottery program, which admits up to 50,000 people per year from countries with low levels of immigration to the United States.", "Applicants for the diversity program are able to include in their application their spouse and unmarried children under 21 years old.", "That is not what happened with Saipov, who arrived in 2010. Multiple news outlets reported that Saipov got married in the United States in 2013 to a woman who already lived here, also an Uzbek national. Their three children were all born in the United States. The family lived in Paterson, N.J.", "\"Unless Saipov had 22 unmarried, under-age-21 children at the time he came here, President Trump's statement that Saipov brought 22 people with him is clearly false,\" said Stephen H.

The grandchildren would come as derivatives of their children.\"", "But that would be far above the average rate of family sponsorship, Gelatt said.", "A 2013 study found that overall, each new immigrant sponsored an average of 3.45 family members.", "As the New York Times and Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker have noted, if Saipov were a U.S. citizen\u00a0(he's not) he could have petitioned his parents and three sisters to join him.\u00a0There's no waiting period for parents, but brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens fall under a \"fourth-preference\" immigration category. As of Nov. 1, 2017, there were 2.3 million people in that category waiting for a visa, with a waiting period of over 13 years.", "The categories of family members that can be petitioned for admission are greater for U.S. citizens, who can additionally bring in parents, siblings, and married sons and daughters and their spouses and children. U.S. citizens can also petition a fiance(e) to come on a visa, and eventually file for a green card after marriage.", "Another immigrant accused of a separate attack, Akayed Ullah, \"benefited from extended family chain migration\" when he came to the United States from Bangladesh in 2011, DHS said.
