The narrative that only the poor are capable of protests is a common tactic used to discredit any citizen movement. Recently, right-wing website OpIndia published an elaborate piece on how one of the protesters is a model and filmmaker who has pictures with luxury cars and has also travelled abroad. The man is indeed a filmmaker who\u2019s been camping at Singhu border in solidarity with farmers. In several interviews, he said that he\u2019s also taking aerial footage of the agitation.", "Donate Now", "Co-founder, Alt News Co-Founder Alt News, I can be reached via Twitter at https://twitter.com/zoo_bear", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
