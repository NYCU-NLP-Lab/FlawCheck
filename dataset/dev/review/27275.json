["By Rem Rieder", "Posted on May 27, 2020", "President Donald Trump has repeatedly sought without evidence to link MSNBC host Joe Scarborough to the death of one of his staffers in 2001, when he was a Republican congressman.", "The medical examiner found that the death was accidental, due to a heart problem that caused the aide to fall and hit her head on a desk, and no evidence has ever emerged to suggest otherwise. Nor has Trump supplied any.", "Scarborough was in Washington, D.C., nearly 800 miles away, when the body of Lori Klausutis, 28, was found July 20, 2001, in Scarborough\u2019s district office in Fort Walton Beach, Florida.", "Trump used to have a warm relationship with Scarborough and his wife, Mika Brzezinski, cohosts of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201c But the husband and wife team have become tough critics of the president, who in turn has frequently insulted the pair.", "On May 12, Trump tweeted: \u201cWhen will they open a Cold Case on the Psycho Joe Scarborough matter in Florida. Did he get away with murder? Some people think so. Why did he leave Congress so quietly and quickly? Isn\u2019t it obvious? What\u2019s happening now? A total nut job!\u201d", "Trump has returned to Twitter several times sounding similar themes.", "On May 24, the president hinted that Scarborough had had an affair with Klausutis as he directed his followers to a 2011 conspiracy theory-tinged story on the conservative website True Pundit. (No evidence has surfaced that Scarborough had a relationship with the married Klausutis.)", "Trump, May 24: A lot of interest in this story about Psycho Joe Scarborough. So a young marathon runner just happened to faint in his office, hit her head on his desk, & die? I would think there is a lot more to this story than that? An affair? What about the so-called investigator? Read story!", "Trump\u2019s tweetfest continued into this week.", "On May 27, Trump tweeted, \u201cPsycho Joe Scarborough is rattled, not only by his bad ratings but all of the things and facts that are coming out on the internet about opening a Cold Case. He knows what is happening!\u201d", "We asked the White House what evidence Trump had to support his insinuations and what he saw as unanswered questions about Klausutis\u2019 death, but we received no response. When asked about the issue on May 26, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany added no support for Trump\u2019s serious charges about Scarborough.", "The medical examiner\u2019s report on Klausutis\u2019 death shows that Associate Medical Examiner Michael Berkland had little uncertainty about what transpired. \u201cThere is no doubt that the head injury is as a result of a fall rather than a blow being delivered to the head by a moving object,\u201d he wrote.", "Berkland explained that Klausutis had \u201ca classic \u2018contrecoup\u2019 injury or bruise to the brain, meaning that her brain was bruised on the opposite side from where the external force was applied.\u201d He continued, \u201cThe contrecoup contusion results when a freely moving, mobile head strikes an\u00a0 unyielding, firm, fixed object in a fall\u201d \u2013in this case, the desk.", "This, he added, is quite different from a \u201ccoup\u201d contusion, \u201cwhich results from a moving object (example \u2013\u00a0 a ball bat) that strikes a stationary head. In the coup injury, there is bruising of the brain on the same side as the external injury. There was no coup contusion in Lori Klausutis.\u201d", "Berkland said Klausutis\u2019 fall \u201cwas most likely as a result of a sudden cardiac arrhythmia\u201d caused by an undiagnosed heart abnormality.", "Last week, Timothy Klausutis, Lori\u2019s widower, asked Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to take down the president\u2019s tweets about his wife.", "Klausutis, May 21: I\u2019m a research engineer and not a lawyer, but I\u2019ve reviewed all of Twitter\u2019s rules and terms of service. The President\u2019s tweet that suggests that Lori was murdered \u2014 without any evidence (and contrary to the official autopsy) \u2014 is a violation of Twitter\u2019s community rules and terms of service. An ordinary user like me would be banished from the platform for such a tweet but I am only asking that these tweets be removed.", "In the letter, disclosed by New York Times contributing opinion writer Kara Swisher, Klausutis wrote about the impact of the conspiracy theorists, including the president.", "Klausutis, May 21: There has been a constant barrage of falsehoods, half-truths, innuendo and conspiracy theories since the day she died. \u2026 The frequency, intensity, ugliness, and promulgation of these horrifying lies ever increases on the internet. These conspiracy theorists, including most recently the President of the United States, continue to spread their bile and misinformation on your platform disparaging the memory of my wife and our marriage.", "Twitter has not taken the tweets down. It did issue a statement expressing sympathy to the Klausutis family and said it was exploring changes in its procedures to help it deal with such situations.", "Twitter statement, May 26: We are deeply sorry about the pain these statements, and the attention they are drawing, are causing the family. We\u2019ve been working to expand existing product features and policies so we can more effectively address things like this going forward, and we hope to have those changes in place shortly.", "Twitter makes exceptions to its content standards for heads of state on the grounds that their comments are often newsworthy.", "Twitter on May 26 added fact-checking links to two Trump tweets with questionable claims about voter fraud. The social media giant has long been under pressure to do something about Trump\u2019s inaccurate posts. On May 27, Trump tweeted that social media companies \u201ctotally silence conservatives voices,\u201d adding, \u201cWe will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\u201d", "Trump was asked on May 26 if he knew about Klausutis\u2019 letter \u201cbegging\u201d Twitter to delete Trump\u2019s tweets. Trump said he did, but continued to press for an investigation of Scarborough.", "Trump, May 26: I\u2019m sure that, ultimately, they want to get to the bottom of it, and it\u2019s a very serious situation. \u2026 No, it\u2019s a very suspicious thing, and I hope somebody gets to the bottom of it. It\u2019ll be a very good thing. As you know, there\u2019s no statute of limitations.", "On May 27, Trump\u2019s tweets about Scarborough drew fire from two prominent Republicans. Sen. Mitt Romney said the president\u2019s allegations were \u201cvile, baseless,\u201d and Rep. Liz Cheney called on Trump to stop tweeting about Klausutis\u2019 death, telling reporters that Trump\u2019s tweets are causing her family \u201cgreat pain.\u201d", "This is not the first time Trump has alluded to an alleged scandal in Scarborough\u2019s past. In 2017, after NBC anchor Matt Lauer was fired for sexual misconduct, Trump tweeted: \u201cAnd will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the \u2018unsolved mystery\u2019 that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!\u201d", "PolitiFact looked into the tweet and delved into the allegations about Scarborough and Klausutis\u2019 death, recalling that they had long had traction with some conspiracy theorists and that Markos Moulitsas, who founded the liberal blog Daily Kos, was once banned from MSNBC for alluding to the unfounded allegations. PolitiFact awarded Trump\u2019s tweet its lowest rating, \u201cPants on Fire!\u201d", "It was true then and it is true now: There is no evidence to support Trump\u2019s innuendos about Scarborough.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
