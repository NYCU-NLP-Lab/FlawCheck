We wondered: Is that still the case? And do we borrow \"much of it\" from China?", "We asked American Crossroads spokesman Jonathan Collegio for evidence for the ad\u2019s claim.\n\n\"I'm going to let you take a crack at that and get back to me,\" he said.\n\nWe sent him a brief roundup of what we had found so far. We didn\u2019t hear back.\n\n How much we borrow\n\nThe federal government doesn\u2019t literally borrow money every day, but through periodic bond auctions. So we assumed the ad used an average.\n\nHere\u2019s one way to do the math on $4 billion a day.\n\nThe total federal debt on the day the ad was released, according to the Treasury Department, was $16.2 trillion. On the day Obama took office, it was $10.6 trillion. That\u2019s a gain of $5.6 trillion \u2014 about $4 billion a day.\n\nThere are a few nits to pick with this math. First, we\u2019re not currently borrowing that much. Over the last year, the average has been about $3.4 billion a day, not $4 billion.\n\nSecond, that\u2019s using a measure of the entire federal debt \u2014 including the big chunk we owe ourselves that\u2019s held by government accounts such as the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\n\"Debt held by the public\" is the the amount the federal government has actually borrowed to finance deficits. And the amount added to the public debt since Obama took office averages about $3.7 billion a day, not $4 billion.\n\nStill, this part of the claim is pretty close.\n\n \u2018Much of it from China\u2019\n\nThen there\u2019s the part about China. This is where the ad\u2019s claim gets goofy.\n\nIf we assume Eastwood\u2019s talking about what\u2019s been added to the entire federal debt since Obama took office \u2014 the amount that averages $4 billion a day \u2014 here\u2019s how much as of August China owns: 7.7 percent.\n\nIf someone told you that there were two pieces to our recent debt, one piece under 8 percent and one piece above 92 percent, then asked you which of those pieces represented \"much of it,\" what would you say? We\u2019re guessing the non-Chinese piece.\n\nStill, China is the No. 1 foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities. (About a third of our total debt is held by foreigners.)\n\nSo the main concern about U.S. public debt held by foreigners is mainly what might happen if they all stopped buying. It could drive up U.S. interest rates, said Wayne Morrison, a specialist in Asian trade and finance for the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nDoes that give China some sort of leverage? Or what if they sold off their U.S. securities all at once, sparking some kind of financial crisis?\n\n\"Many economists argue that such a move is highly unlikely,\" Morrison told PolitiFact.\n\nIf China tried a big selloff, it would drive up supply of U.S. Treasuries and drive down their value \u2014 tanking the value of China\u2019s own holdings.\n\n Our ruling\n\nEastwood, speaking in a recent American Crossroads ad, warns that, \"We borrow $4 billion every single day, much of it from China.\" That amount is the rough daily average of all U.S. debt added since Obama took office, including the type the government owes itself. It\u2019s not the current rate, which has been somewhat lower. And while China is the No. 1 foreign holder of U.S. securities, it purchased less than 10 percent of that debt. This claim is only partly accurate.
