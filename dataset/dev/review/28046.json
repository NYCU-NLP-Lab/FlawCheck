["About this rating", "On 5 May 2016, University of Pennsylvania theoretical economist Guido Menzio boarded an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Syracuse. The flight was to be a short transfer for him en route to a talk he was about to give concerning a paper he had recently co-authored.", "As Menzio sat waiting for the rest of the passengers to board the plane, he began to work through a series of differential equations -- complex-looking equations commonly used by those who mathematically model systems such as national economies. Menzio rebuffed an effort at small talk from the passenger next to him, according to the Washington Post:  \"Is Syracuse home? She asked. No, he replied curtly. He similarly deflected further questions. He appeared laser-focused \u2014 perhaps too laser-focused \u2014 on the task at hand, those strange scribblings.\"", "Following this interaction between Menzio and his seatmate, the plane remained on the tarmac for a lengthy period of time before being ordered to return to the gate, at which point the passenger next to Menzio \u2014 who had complained she felt ill \u2014 was escorted away. Shortly afterwards, Menzio was also escorted off the plane and informed by a gate agent that the woman sitting next to him had expressed concerns about his curt behavior and suspicious scribbling, suggesting he could perhaps be a terrorist:", "And then the big reveal: The woman wasn\u2019t really sick at all! Instead this quick-thinking traveler had Seen Something, and so she had Said Something.", "That Something she\u2019d seen had been her seatmate\u2019s cryptic notes, scrawled in a script she didn\u2019t recognize. Maybe it was code, or some foreign lettering, possibly the details of a plot to destroy the dozens of innocent lives aboard American Airlines Flight 3950. She may have felt it her duty to alert the authorities just to be safe. The curly-haired man was, the agent informed him politely, suspected of terrorism.", "The curly-haired man laughed.", "He laughed because those scribbles weren\u2019t Arabic, or another foreign language, or even some special secret terrorist code. They were math.", "Yes, math. A differential equation, to be exact.", "Menzio was allowed to return to the plane after American Airline agents determined he posed no threat, while the passenger who reported him was re-booked onto another flight. The incident drew serious viral attention and outrage at the time, in part due to the belief that Menzio \u201clooked\u201d Middle Eastern and was profiled by the other passenger for this reason.", "This tale continues to be spread in meme form years after the fact. And it continues to be true.", "University of Pennsylvania Economics. \u00a0 \"Guido Menzio.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 18 April 2018.", "Rampell, Catherine. \u00a0 \u201cIvy League Economist Ethnically Profiled, Interrogated for Doing Math on American Airlines Flight.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 7 May 2016.", "Danner, Chas. \u00a0 \u201cFlight Delayed, Economist Questioned After Doing Math While Looking Middle Eastern.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Magazine. \u00a0 7 May 2016.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
