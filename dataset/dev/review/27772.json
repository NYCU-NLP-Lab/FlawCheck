["By Robert Farley", "Posted on November 19, 2019", "In an early morning tweet, President Donald Trump falsely attributed a quote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The quote was actually a Fox News reporter\u2019s characterization of Pelosi\u2019s words. Trump then distorted what she actually said.", "Nancy Pelosi just stated that \u201cit is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump\u2019s fate.\u201d @FoxNews  In other words, she thinks I\u2019m going to win and doesn\u2019t want to take a chance on letting the voters decide. Like Al Green, she wants to change our voting system. Wow, she\u2019s CRAZY!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2019", "The president\u2019s tweet echoes a Republican talking point that the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry is designed to subvert the outcome of a 2020 presidential election that Democrats are convinced they cannot win.", "In his speeches, Trump frequently says of Democrats, \u201cThey know they can\u2019t win, so let\u2019s try and impeach him.\u201d Or, as he put it during a speech in Florida on Oct. 3, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why they do the impeachment crap, because they know they can\u2019t beat us fairly.\u201d", "Despite the quote marks in the tweet indicating that those were Pelosi\u2019s exact words, they are not. Rather, they are the words of Fox News Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel, who said on air about an hour before Trump sent his tweet: \u201cHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulating a memo to Democrats tonight telling them it would be dangerous to let voters decide President Trump\u2019s fate when it comes to the Ukraine investigation.\u201d (You can view the video as captured by Mediaite.)", "The memo Emanuel was referring to was one Pelosi addressed to her Democratic colleagues, and released publicly, to update them on the latest developments in the House impeachment inquiry.", "\u201cThe facts are uncontested: that the President abused his power for his own personal, political benefit, at the expense of our national security interests,\u201d Pelosi wrote.", "\u201cThe weak response to these hearings has been, \u2018Let the election decide,\u2019\u201d Pelosi added. \u201cThat dangerous position only adds to the urgency of our action, because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.\u201d", "Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, told us in a phone interview that the Fox News reporter\u2019s summary of that statement distorts Pelosi\u2019s actual words and meaning.", "Pelosi\u2019s comment spoke to \u201cthe urgency of needing to hold the president accountable for his actions,\u201d Hammill said. The facts are \u201cuncontested\u201d that Trump attempted to get a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election. Congress, he said, had \u201cno choice but to hold him accountable.\u201d", "The full quote shows Pelosi said the Republican position to \u201clet the election decide\u201d is dangerous, in part, \u201cbecause the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.\u201d", "In a White House-released memo of a July 25 phone call that Trump placed to the recently elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Several witnesses in the impeachment inquiry have said the request was accompanied by a pressure campaign that included the withholding of U.S. security aid, and the dangling of a White House visit for Zelensky.", "In her \u201cDear Colleague\u201d memo, Pelosi made no reference to wanting to \u201cchange our voting system,\u201d as Trump put it. Rather, Pelosi has argued that it is Congress\u2019 responsibility to determine whether the president committed an impeachable offense.", "In a press conference on Oct. 17, Pelosi made clear that she views the impeachment and the election as separate events.", "\u201cI keep saying to people impeachment is about the truth and the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Pelosi said. She then went on to list several differences she has with the president on policy issues, but added, \u201cthat\u2019s about the election.\u201d", "\u201cThat [policy difference] has nothing to do with what is happening in terms of our honoring our oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution and the facts that might support,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where this path will take us, but could take us down a further path, but the two are completely separate.\u201d", "A reporter then asked Pelosi at what point she might decide to just let the voters decide whether Trump committed an impeachable offense.", "\u201cNo, no,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe voters are not going to decide whether we honor our oath of office. They already decided that in the last election.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
