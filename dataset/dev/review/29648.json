["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on October 16, 2020", "A Trump campaign ad uses an out-of-context video clip to claim Joe Biden confirmed he will come for the guns of Americans if he\u2019s elected president. In the unedited video, Biden was talking about his opposition to so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d \u2014 not all firearms.", "\u201cJoe Biden openly admitted his plan to violate our Second Amendment rights,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says about the Democratic presidential nominee. The ad then shows CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper saying to Biden: \u201cTo gun owners out there who say, well, a Biden administration means they\u2019re going to come for my guns.\u201d After that, Biden is shown saying, \u201cBingo. You\u2019re right.\u201d", "But his full response was: \u201cBingo. You\u2019re right, if you have an assault weapon. The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period.\u201d", "Biden actually argued that banning Americans from purchasing assault weapons wouldn\u2019t be a violation of their constitutional rights, and he said he wouldn\u2019t confiscate firearms that had already been purchased legally.", "The Trump campaign said the anti-Biden commercial is part of an \u201ceight figure ad buy\u201d that \u201cwill run on network cable across the country\u201d in \u201cbattleground states.\u201d", "Cooper and Biden had been discussing mass shootings when the CNN anchor started to list gun restrictions that Biden supports, such as expanding background checks on gun purchases to cover private sales by unlicensed individuals. When he got to banning assault weapons, which generally refers to AR- or AK-style rifles, Cooper told Biden studies show the 1994 assault weapons ban that Biden supported as a senator wasn\u2019t proven to have reduced crime. The ban, which expired in 2004, prohibited the manufacture, transfer, or possession of certain semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition devices, though it included exceptions such as a grandfather clause for weapons already legally owned before the ban took effect.", "\u201cThere was a reduction of crime, but they can\u2019t point at the assault weapons ban\u201d as the reason, Cooper said. Biden conceded that might be true, but questioned whether assault weapons should continue to be sold anyway.", "\u201cDoes anybody think it made any sense that someone\u2019s able to walk into a gun store, buy an assault weapon that has multiple rounds or buy an assault weapon that has a hundred rounds?\u201d Biden asked. \u201cEven though it may not \u2014 you can\u2019t point to the fact that it, in fact, had stopped it before. Do you want more of them on the street?\u201d", "Cooper followed up by asking Biden what he would say to gun owners who believe he would take away their guns, and Biden initially said individuals with certain weapons had reason to worry. Here\u2019s the exchange:", "Cooper, Aug. 6, 2019: So, to gun owners out there who say, \u201cWell, a Biden administration means they\u2019re going to come for my guns\u201d \u2014", "Biden: Bingo. You\u2019re right, if you have an assault weapon. The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period.", "Look, the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t say you can\u2019t restrict the kinds of weapons people can own. You can\u2019t buy a bazooka. You can\u2019t have a flamethrower.", "The shortened clip featured in the Trump campaign ad leaves viewers with the impression Biden was talking about all guns. He wasn\u2019t.", "Later in the interview, when Cooper asked if individuals would be allowed to keep the weapons they already own, Biden said they would.", "\u201cRight now, there\u2019s no legal way that I\u2019m aware of that you could deny them the right if they\u2019ve \u2026 legally purchased them,\u201d Biden said.", "He said he would try to institute a voluntary national buy-back program to have gun owners turn their assault weapons in to get them off the streets. \u201cThat\u2019s not walking into their homes, knocking on their doors, going through their gun cabinets, et cetera,\u201d he explained.", "Biden\u2019s platform on gun control says he would ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines for ammunition. It says he would give those currently in possession of either a choice: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act.", "One last note: When the Trump campaign ad says, \u201cBiden and [Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala] Harris would enact unconstitutional gun control measures, making it harder than ever to defend yourself,\u201d a citation for an Aug. 18 op-ed in the Chicago Sun-Times is shown on screen.", "To be clear, that commentary piece argued that a ban on large-capacity magazines \u2014 not an assault weapons ban \u2014 would be unconstitutional.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0Swing State Watch\u00a0is an occasional series about false and misleading political messages in key states that will help decide the 2020 presidential election.", "Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
