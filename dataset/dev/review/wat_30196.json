["By Eugene Kiely and Lori Robertson", "Posted on March 27, 2020", "Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, misleadingly claimed that 19 states \u2014 \u201calmost 40% of the country\u201d \u2014 \u201chave less than 200 cases\u201d of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. In fact, 17 states with 7.2% of the U.S. population have fewer than 200 confirmed cases each.", "Birx made her remarks at a task force press briefing at the White House on March 26 on a day when the United States passed China and became the country with the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the world. As of March 26, the U.S. had more than 83,000 confirmed cases and more than 1,200 deaths, according to data collected by John Hopkins University.", "At the same briefing, President Donald Trump spoke about wanting to soon open \u201clarge sections of our country that aren\u2019t so seriously affected.\u201d The president has said he would \u201clove to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,\u201d as he put it during a Fox News virtual town hall\u00a0on March 24.", "Public health officials have warned that going back to business in a couple of weeks would worsen the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis disease will not respect state borders and city borders, and will move around this country just like it\u2019s moved around the world,\u201d Tom Inglesby, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security,\u00a0told\u00a0the New York Times.", "Birx \u2014 formerly the U.S. global AIDS coordinator \u2014 lent support to Trump\u2019s basic message that large sections of the U.S. aren\u2019t seriously affected. But she was actually speaking about a small section of the country in terms of population.", "Birx, March 26: So just as a summary of where it looks domestically \u2014 I won\u2019t talk so much about the global issues this time: We do have 19 out of our 50 states, to be reminded, that had early cases but have persistently low level of cases and, at this point, have less than 200 cases. So that\u2019s almost 40% of the country with extraordinarily low numbers.", "It\u2019s true that 19 states divided by 50 states is 38%, or \u201calmost 40%.\u201d That\u2019s \u201cbasic math,\u201d as a White House official told us. But it\u2019s also misleading.", "First, using the data collected by John Hopkins University, we found that only 17 states \u2014 not 19 \u2014 had fewer than 200 cases as of March 26, when Birx made her remarks.", "Second, those 17 states have a combined population of 23,719,483, or just 7.2% of the total U.S. population of 328,239,523, according to 2019 population estimates by the Census Bureau. (See the pie chart below.)", "Five of the 17 states have fewer than 1 million people each. South Dakota, population 884,659, had the fewest COVID-19 confirmed cases with 46 cases, according to John Hopkins University.", "California alone has more residents than the 17 states combined. The Golden State has a population of 39.5 million people. It also has 3,899 confirmed cases as of March 26.", "The 17 states have 1,872, or 2.2%, of the total cases nationwide.", "We would caution that these are only the confirmed cases, based on the testing the states have done. Some tests may still be pending, and some states have conducted more testing than others.", "But while Birx boasts about \u201calmost 40% of the country with extraordinarily low numbers,\u201d the fact is that only 7.2% of the population lives in those states.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
