'Later on, we heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven,' she said.", "'After that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine.'", "A popular version of the rumor remained in circulation on Facebook as of 9 February 2017, along with an unrelated image that was previously used to accompany claims that ISIS was placing children into cages and burning them alive:", "The horrifying and frequently repeated story appeared to originate with a single source, Alice Assaf and the organization \"Roads of Success.\" \"Roads of Success\" has a web page devoted to Assaf[f], but it comprises\u00a0only links to media coverage about a video of Assaf's making the claims, not any independent documentation of her claims.", "Each of the linked news items references a 14 September 2016 YouTube video in which Assaf repeated secondhand accounts of the rumor that ISIS operatives were placing children into dough kneading machines and asserted that her son George was murdered by the same militants for reasons related to his religion and his use of an English name:", "We were unable to locate any other reports from persons who claimed to have knowledge of the claimed atrocity, which resembled an earlier questionable tale that\u00a0ISIS had murdered a young man and fed his remains to his unwitting mother.", "Mansfield, Katie. \u00a0 \"Barbaric ISIS Mangle 250 Children In Industrial Dough Kneader And Cooks Rest Alive In Oven.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Express. \u00a0 26 October 2016.", "O'Neill, Kara. \u00a0 \"ISIS Monsters Used Bread Maker To Knead 250 Kids To Death And Bake Christians In Giant Ovens.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Mirror. \u00a0 26 October 2016.", "Schram, Jamie. \u00a0 \"ISIS Kills 250 Kids In Dough Kneader, Burns Adults Alive.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Post. \u00a0 26 October 2016.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
