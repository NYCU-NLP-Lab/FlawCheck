["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on December 2, 2016", "The chairman of the Senate environment committee falsely claimed that a new report \u201cconfirms\u201d that \u201chydraulic fracturing\u00a0has\u00a0not impacted drinking water\u201d in Wyoming. The report said a lack of water quality data predating oil and gas exploration prevented it from reaching \u201cfirm conclusions.\u201d", "Sen. James Inhofe, who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, made his remarks in a statement issued Nov. 10 \u2014 the day that the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality issued a\u00a0report\u00a0on water-supply wells in Pavillion, a small town southeast of Yellowstone National Park.", "The industry-funded state\u00a0report\u00a0specifically looked at the \u201clikelihood of impacts from oil and gas operations\u201d on 14\u00a0water-supply wells used\u00a0by residents living near\u00a0Pavillion. Since the 1990s, residents in the area have \u201ccomplained of physical ailments and said their drinking water was black and tasted of chemicals,\u201d ProPublica reported.", "Inhofe, Nov. 10:\u00a0The Wyoming DEQ\u2019s thorough investigation over the past several years has come to a close and confirms what we\u2019ve known all along: hydraulic fracturing has not impacted drinking water resources.", "But that\u2019s not what the report said.", "The \u201cfact sheet\u201d for\u00a0the Wyoming\u00a0report\u00a0said it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d that hydraulic fracturing had \u201cany impacts\u201d on these water-supply wells, but \u201c[l]imited baseline water quality data, predating development of the Pavillion Gas Field hinders reaching firm conclusions on causes and effects of reported water quality changes.\u201d", "In the next sections, we\u2019ll examine why it\u2019s difficult to isolate fracking from other potential causes of water contamination, and why the Wyoming report didn\u2019t\u00a0reach \u201cfirm conclusions.\u201d\u00a0We\u2019ll also review the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s research to date on fracking practices that take place across the country, and Inhofe\u2019s unsupported claim that it is \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that fracking does not impact drinking water.", "Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique often used to\u00a0retrieve natural gas and oil often from shale, a rock layer deep below the earth\u2019s surface. The process\u00a0entails\u00a0injecting\u00a0water, sand and chemicals at high pressure, releasing oil and gas that would otherwise be difficult to recover.", "About half of U.S. crude oil production\u00a0and two-thirds of natural gas production\u00a0now involve fracking \u2014 a significant share of production that has steadily increased over the last 15 years, according to the Energy Information Administration.", "With this boom have come concerns about the impact of oil and gas drilling on water quality, as we wrote\u00a0in March 2015 when we checked another false fracking claim made by Inhofe.", "Much of the debate surrounding whether fracking has led to groundwater contamination in Wyoming and elsewhere stems from a lack of water\u00a0quality data predating fracking and oil and gas production in general.", "Without this information, researchers are less equipped\u00a0to assess the relative impact of\u00a0three possible sources on water quality: naturally occurring phenomena, conventional oil and gas\u00a0recovery\u00a0methods, and unconventional methods, including fracking.", "Since 1960, for example, both conventional and unconventional methods have been used to extract fuel\u00a0from the Pavillion gas field. If water quality data had been collected before the drilling started, and since then, scientists could have compared that data with trends in\u00a0the use of specific practices over the years.", "Conventional methods typically\u00a0include drilling vertically to recover more easily accessible fuel from relatively shallow, permeable rock. Fracking and horizontal drilling, often used in unison, fall under unconventional methods.", "As its\u00a0name suggests, horizontal drilling often\u00a0involves drilling deeper to less porous shale rock\u00a0and then drilling horizontally. (See the adjacent image.) This enables a\u00a0single well to\u00a0cross\u00a0through a greater portion of a\u00a0fuel\u00a0reservoir and, as a result, recover\u00a0more\u00a0fuel.", "But fracking\u00a0doesn\u2019t necessarily have to occur deep below the earth\u2019s surface or in horizontal wells. In fact, fracking was used in some relatively shallow Pavillion field wells, which means the activities took place\u00a0closer to the aquifer\u00a0tapped by residents\u2019 water-supply wells. All of the 169 wells in the field are also vertically-drilled wells, according to the EPA.", "Both conventional and unconventional fuel recovery methods have the potential to negatively\u00a0impact groundwater resources, as do naturally occurring processes, such as bacteria proliferation or the natural movement\u00a0of\u00a0methane underground.", "So how could the boom in oil and gas production from fracking lead to\u00a0water contamination?", "Among other mechanisms, methane, the main component of natural gas, could\u00a0leach into aquifers\u00a0through improperly constructed\u00a0drilling wells or through cracks underground produced during the fracturing process. However,\u00a0methane can naturally\u00a0migrate into aquifers without the help of fracking, blurring the line between\u00a0natural and anthropogenic, or human-caused, sources.", "Salty fracking fluids, which can contain toxic chemicals, also could leach into the aquifer after they\u2019re disposed of improperly or spilled. Lastly, fracking can influence the underground ecosystem\u2019s biology, further blurring the line\u00a0between\u00a0natural and anthropogenic causes.", "For example, bacteria are known to interact with the fracking process. In fact, a\u00a0species of bacteria \u2014 the so-called \u201cFrackibacter\u201d \u2014 has\u00a0specifically evolved to live in the subterranean\u00a0environment shaped\u00a0by fracking.", "Generally, bacteria have \u201cboth positive and negative impacts on energy recovery,\u201d the Ohio State University researchers who discovered the new bacteria wrote in their paper published in Nature Microbiology in September.", "For one, some bacteria play\u00a0an important part in producing natural gas in the first place. But during the recovery of the fuel, bacteria can \u201csour\u201d the fuel by producing sulfide, a toxic chemical that smells like rotten eggs. Bacteria can also contribute \u201cto corrosion [of the drilling well] and the risk of environmental contamination,\u201d the researchers wrote.", "To kill these bacteria, \u201cbiocides like formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are thrown down the [wells]\u00a0in an attempt to preserve a usable [fuel] product,\u201d reported Wired. These chemicals could\u00a0then leach into aquifers in the routes described above. After wells are abandoned, these bacteria can also \u201ccome back with a vengeance, generating acidic byproducts that can corrode pipes and release heavy metals,\u201d Wired wrote.", "There are ways to distinguish natural from anthropogenic causes, such as using\u00a0isotopic analysis, which\u00a0aims to\u00a0distinguish the\u00a0signatures of different sources of compounds, but the technique isn\u2019t always sensitive enough to detect the difference.\u00a0Overall, given the lack of baseline data, it\u2019s often difficult to \u201cconfirm\u201d that fracking in particular has played a role in water contamination.", "The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality announced that it would undertake the water-quality study\u00a0in June 2013 \u2014 about 18 months after the EPA\u00a0released a draft report\u00a0that found chemicals associated with fracking in the groundwater near\u00a0Pavillion.", "The EPA decided to turn the investigation over to the state after its report was criticized by state officials, Congress and industry representatives, according to a Dec. 6, 2015, report\u00a0by the Casper Star-Tribune.\u00a0The Wyoming newspaper obtained about 56,000 EPA documents in a Freedom of Information Act request that the paper said revealed \u201can EPA worried it could not defend its Pavillion study against an onslaught of criticism.\u201d", "In announcing the state would \u201cfurther investigate\u201d the water quality in Pavillion, the EPA said it \u201cstands behind its work and data,\u201d but \u201cdoes not plan to finalize or seek peer review of its draft Pavillion groundwater report released in December, 2011.\u201d", "The Wyoming state study was headed\u00a0by a private company,\u00a0Acton Mickelson Environmental Inc., and\u00a0was\u00a0funded by Encana, the company that owns Encana Oil and Gas (USA) Inc., which operates the Pavillion gas field.", "We emailed\u00a0Kevin Frederick, water quality administrator at\u00a0the\u00a0Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, to ask what role state scientists played in the report. He told us they \u201cobserved sample collection, evaluated sample results, and participated in development of the draft and final reports\u201d while working with\u00a0Acton Mickelson Environmental Inc.", "As we previously noted, the fact sheet for the Wyoming\u00a0report\u00a0concluded it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d that fracking had \u201cany impacts\u201d on these water-supply wells. However, it added, \u201cLimited baseline water quality data, predating development of the Pavillion Gas Field hinders reaching firm conclusions on causes and effects of reported water quality changes.\u201d", "Instead, the state report\u00a0said bacteria \u201cmay be a cause of taste and odor issues\u201d with the well water.", "But in its comments on a draft of the\u00a0report, the EPA argued\u00a0that the state didn\u2019t support many of its\u00a0conclusions with enough data. The\u00a0EPA said \u201cdata limitations and uncertainties \u2026 suggest a need for additional investigation to provide support for many of the Report\u2019s conclusions.\u201d", "For example, the Wyoming state report found, \u201cExceedances of drinking water standards or comparison values\u201d found in the water-supply wells are \u201cgenerally limited to naturally occurring dissolved salts, metals, and radionuclides.\u201d", "In its comments on\u00a0the draft report, the EPA wrote that \u201cthere is limited supporting evidence demonstrating that all of these constituents were present historically in the area, and that they were present at similar concentrations to those detected,\u201d i.e., that they were naturally occurring.", "High levels of sodium and sulfate are \u201ccharacteristic\u201d for the region, the EPA added. But \u201cthere is limited or no historic data in the references cited in the Report to document naturally occurring levels of many other inorganic constituents such as arsenic, thallium, lithium and uranium, and the limited data suggest that the values seen in water wells are not consistent with background concentrations,\u201d the EPA\u00a0said.", "In its response to the EPA\u2019s comments, Wyoming officials said\u00a0that their report \u201cstates that those constituents that exceed drinking water standards \u2026 are naturally occurring dissolved salts, metals and radionuclides, not that the exceedances are naturally occurring,\u201d a point that was not clarified in the state\u2019s final report.", "\u201cDue to the absence of baseline water quality data from the study wells, there is insufficient evidence to determine if the reported exceedances do, or do not represent natural aquifer concentrations,\u201d the state added in its response to the EPA.", "The EPA also commented on the state\u2019s conclusion that bacteria may be to blame for residents\u2019 complaints about the poor taste and odor of the drinking water.\u00a0The EPA agreed that the report showed a \u201ccorrelation\u201d between \u201cdissolved organic compounds,\u201d such as methane, in the water and the \u201cproliferation of bacteria.\u201d But it argued that this correlation doesn\u2019t \u201cestablish \u2026 the source.\u201d", "In other words, fracking and related practices could be indirectly to blame for water quality issues.", "In its final version, the Wyoming report did state that\u00a0gas in the water could be from anthropogenic and/or natural sources.", "The state report also concluded that it\u2019s unlikely that fracking fluids have interacted with \u201cshallow groundwater supplying the study wells,\u201d in part, because of the depth at which the fracking occurs underground. The water-supply wells reach\u00a030 feet to 675 feet below\u00a0the surface, while the \u201cshallowest\u201d fracking occurs \u201cgenerally deeper than 1,500 ft,\u201d the state said.", "But the EPA in its comments on\u00a0the draft report countered that the fracking of\u00a0some of the drilling wells \u201coccurred at a substantially shallower depth.\u201d", "Also, Dominic DiGiulio and Robert Jackson, earth and environmental scientists at Stanford University, published a paper\u00a0in March in the journal Environmental Science and Technology that\u00a0linked shallow fracking to toxic chemicals\u00a0in aquifers in Pavillion.", "For example, \u201cAcid stimulation and hydraulic fracturing occurred as shallowly as\u201d 699 feet and 1,056 feet below the surface, respectively, \u201cat depths comparable to deepest domestic groundwater use in the area,\u201d the authors wrote. Like\u00a0hydraulic fracturing, acid stimulation\u00a0(e.g. hydrofluoric acid and hydrochloric acid) is used to improve oil and gas recovery.", "In an interview with WyoFile, a local Wyoming news outlet, DiGiulio, who was an EPA scientist for over 25 years and co-authored the agency\u2019s 2011 draft report on Pavillion, said his 2016 study\u00a0with Jackson stops \u201cshort of saying that there\u2019s strong evidence tying\u201d fracking to\u00a0impacts on\u00a0the water\u00a0wells. But their paper had found that fracking has impacted the groundwater, which is water that may be used in the future.", "In other words, DiGiulio and Jackson looked at groundwater\u00a0generally, while the state looked at specific wells \u2014 an important distinction.", "In an email DiGiulio and Jackson told us the state needs to install monitoring wells, solely used for research purposes, in the area to delineate the extent of groundwater contamination and to \u201cbetter address risk posed to domestic water wells.\u201d", "The EPA did install two monitoring wells in the Pavillion field and used data collected from them in its 2011 report.\u00a0However, the state didn\u2019t use this data for its report because some expressed \u201cconcerns\u201d about the\u00a0construction and sampling of the two\u00a0wells during the public comment period for the EPA report.", "DiGiulio and Jackson also told us that about 20 additional water wells, out of 121 wells total, should be tested due to their proximity to unlined pits, where fracking fluids and other toxic byproducts of oil and gas exploration were disposed.", "DiGiulio and Jackson told us that \u201cthere can be a lag period of decades before contaminants\u201d in groundwater reach a water well. \u201cThese contaminants present a long-term unaddressed risk to domestic water wells\u201d if the contaminants continue to move upwards toward water wells, they added.", "Regardless of the criticisms of\u00a0both\u00a0state and federal investigations,\u00a0even if the conclusions made in the Wyoming report are taken at face value, they still don\u2019t \u201cconfirm\u201d that \u201chydraulic fracturing\u00a0has\u00a0not impacted drinking water resources\u201d near\u00a0Pavillion, as Inhofe claimed.", "Inhofe draws national implications from the Pavillion study, claiming it adds to growing body of scientific research that proves fracking does not contaminate groundwater.", "\u201cUltimately, the facts have prevailed and the record is abundantly clear, with even the EPA affirming\u00a0that \u2018hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts to drinking water resources\u2019\u00a0in its landmark water study,\u201d Inhofe said in his Nov. 10 statement.", "It is not, however, \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that fracking does not impact drinking water and there is evidence to suggest otherwise.", "Inhofe is referring to a June 2015 draft\u00a0report in which the EPA said it \u201cdid not find evidence\u201d that hydraulic fracturing has \u201cled to widespread, systemic impacts to drinking water resources in the United States.\u201d But the EPA\u2019s draft report has been challenged by its own advisory board and a final report has yet to be issued.", "The EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board\u00a0wrote\u00a0a letter dated Aug. 11 to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, stating that the EPA failed to \u201cquantitatively\u201d support its\u00a0conclusion that fracking has \u201cnot led to widespread, systemic impacts to drinking water resources.\u201d The board also said the EPA didn\u2019t \u201cclearly describe\u201d whether the conclusion pertained to groundwater and/or surface water nor what exactly it\u00a0meant by the terms\u00a0\u201csystemic\u201d and \u201cwidespread.\u201d", "If the EPA wanted to retain its\u00a0conclusion in its final report, the agency should address these issues, the advisory board said.", "On Nov. 21, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said the agency\u00a0is \u201ctrying to wrap [the final report] up soon,\u201d but she didn\u2019t specify a date. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to listen to the direction of the science advisory board,\u201d but the \u201cchallenge for us is to characterize what we know\u201d without over-generalizing limited data, she added.", "Inhofe has cited the draft EPA report in the past to support his position that fracking has no impact on drinking water. He claimed last year that the EPA draft report \u201cconfirms\u201d that fracking is \u201csafe.\u201d\u00a0 As we said at the time, the EPA reported specific cases of water contamination related to fracking and made no determination of safety.", "Similarly, Inhofe draws sweeping conclusions from the\u00a0Wyoming state study that are not supported by the research.", "As we already explained, the state report\u00a0did not reach \u201cfirm conclusions on causes and effects of reported water quality changes\u201d in specific wells, while the DiGiulio and Jackson study of Pavillion did find evidence that linked shallow fracking to toxic chemicals\u00a0in the area\u2019s groundwater.", "Researchers know that shallow fracking and poor well integrity, which occurred in Pavillion, can raise the likelihood of water\u00a0contamination. So how common are these practices?", "An estimated 16 percent of fracked wells in the country are\u00a0less than a mile deep (i.e. shallow), according to a separate\u00a0survey\u00a0published by Jackson, DiGiulio and others in\u00a0Environmental Science and Technology\u00a0in July 2015. Most of those shallow wells are\u00a0located in Texas and California.", "But the researchers believe that their estimate is low. They predominately looked at wells drilled in the U.S. between 2010 and 2013. At the beginning of 2012, only a few states \u2014 Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, and Texas \u2014 mandated\u00a0companies to report well data to FracFocus, the database\u00a0the researchers used to conduct their analysis. For other states, reporting is voluntary.", "The researchers also looked at state regulations governing fracking well construction and groundwater protection and found that\u00a0they varied widely.", "For example, some states, such as New Mexico and Utah, do not have to have minimum surface casing depths. Surface casings are pipes within the wells that aim to prevent water contamination. If they don\u2019t extend beyond the groundwater level, there\u2019s a higher chance of contamination.", "In Wyoming, however, surface casings must reach deeper than \u201call known usable groundwater,\u201d the researchers explained. And in Texas, drilling wells that have\u00a0\u201cless than 1,000 feet of vertical separation\u201d from groundwater require additional testing for integrity.", "DiGiulio and Jackson\u00a0conclude their paper by suggesting that\u00a0operators should provide more information about their wells in the form of a \u201cmandatory state or federal registry,\u201d which\u00a0\u201cwould allow people to track the locations, depths, and volumes of chemicals used around them.\u201d", "In addition, the researchers argue that state or federal governments should require \u201cfull chemical disclosure \u2014 without trade secret exemptions \u2014 for all chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing above 3000 ft.\u201d While most states do require disclosure of some chemicals, oil and gas operators don\u2019t have to report them all because of trade secrets laws, which\u00a0also protect Coca-Cola\u2019s recipe, for example.", "While Inhofe says it is \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that fracking has no impact on drinking water resources, the fact is that researchers do not have the data to make such a sweeping and firm conclusion \u2013 specifically in Pavillion and more generally in the U.S. at large.", "Editor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3bc30cf3-3cd8-4a5f-a183-403cf631166a", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
