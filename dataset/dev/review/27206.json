["About this rating", "On 16 January 2017, Politicops.com, a fake news web site associated with\u00a0the \"hybrid news/satire platform\"\u00a0Newslo, posted a report stating that Rep. Chris Collins (R-New York), a member of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team, had compared\u00a0Rep. John Lewis (D-Georgia), a hero of the civil rights movement who has suggested that Trump's presidency may not be legitimate, to \"a spoiled chimp that got too many bananas and rights\":", "Collins continued, \u201cBottom line, for better or worse, John Lewis is a man who\u2019s had a mediocre career in politics thanks to his alleged heroism in the 1960s. Well, let me tell you one thing \u2013 there have been a lot of people over the course of this country\u2019s history that have suffered worse things than beatings by police officers. We\u2019ve had people who were tortured, mutilated, shot, slaughtered, decapitated \u2013 you name it and someone in this country has probably suffered it. And yet none of them are mentioned today, and none of them have had political careers built on the foundation of their alleged suffering. And that\u2019s exactly my point \u2013 John Lewis is a man who\u2019s been granted too many rights by white people out of fear of retribution. He didn\u2019t become a politician because he could contribute something; he was granted that status to shut him up.\u201d", "\u201cAnd now, when things are finally coming out into the open, he\u2019s having a hard time accepting that his entire so-called career is a failure and that he and those like him lost to a superior politician,\u201d he continued. \u201cTo make matters worse \u2013 they lost to Donald Trump, who\u2019s not even a career politician to begin with. Ultimately, he can be as upset as he wants, but he\u2019s acting like nothing more than a child \u2013 no, scratch that \u2013 than a chimp that\u2019s lost one of his bananas and is now throwing a tantrum because of it. But, it\u2019s not his fault, let\u2019s clarify that; the problem is that chimps belong in a zoo and not the House of Representatives. At the end of the day, he shouldn\u2019t be upset \u2013 I guess Donald Trump is just too good at snatching bananas off of unsuspecting chimps,\u201d Collins concluded.", "None of these blatantly racist remarks were actually uttered by Collins, however. The majority\u00a0of the Politicops article is a \"satirical\" (i.e., fabricated) spoof of statements\u00a0Collins did make during a television interview\u00a0in which he characterized Lewis as a \"spoiled child\" who was only \"pouting\" because Trump won the election:", "\u201cMy opinion is, what John Lewis is doing, he\u2019s pouting,\u201d Collins said during the morning broadcast. \u201cHe lost. It\u2019s like a spoiled child and we\u2019ve seen it with the others. They can\u2019t get over the fact that they lost. And what do spoiled little kids do? You know, they run around and throw a tantrum.", "\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey are pouting. And frankly, it\u2019s somewhat enjoyable to watch because it shows you again how upset they are, when they were so smug when they left Congress knowing that Hillary Clinton was going to win.", "\u201cWe should all actually just kind of grin a little bit and understand that this is how hard this election hit them when Hillary lost,\u201d he added.", "Per the\u00a0standard operating procedure of Newslo and related sites,\u00a0only the first paragraph of the Politicops article\u00a0(not quoted above) contains any factual information.", "McCarthy, Robert J.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Watch: Chris Collins Compares John Lewis to 'Spoiled Child.'\"\r\nThe Buffalo News.\u00a0\u00a0 16 January 2017.", "Stevan, Alex.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Chris Collins Says John Lewis Is 'Like a Spoiled Chimp that Got Too Many Bananas and Rights.\"\r\nPoliticops.\u00a0\u00a0 16 January 2017.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
