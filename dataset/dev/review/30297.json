["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on February 12, 2019", "A meme making a bogus claim about the U.S. giving gold to Afghanistan is circulating online.", "More than two years after leaving office, former President Barack Obama is still a popular subject of misinformation online.", "One meme circulating on Facebook makes the bogus claim that, \u201cTrump\u2019s audit of Obama has found a transfer of gold to Afghanistan finally the traitor is being exposed!\u201d", "It has been shared more than a thousand times from one page that posted in February and has amassed a trail of comments like this one: \u201cTraitor, liar and not a U.S. Citizen. Hang this thief on town square.\u201d", "But the meme is made up. It was created by a Facebook page belonging to a network of self-described sites known as\u00a0America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. The Facebook page that originally shared the meme in December writes on its \u201cAbout\u201d page: \u201cNothing on this page is real. It is a collection of the satirical whimsies of liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives. You have been warned.\u201d", "However, the meme isn\u2019t labeled as satire, so once it is shared online there\u2019s no way to know it was made up.", "The picture used in the meme, showing pallets full of gold bars, is from the Bank of England, which opened an exhibition in 2015 called \u201cDiscover Gold\u201d that shared some of the contents of its vault to visitors at the Bank of England Museum. It has nothing to do with the U.S. or Afghanistan.", "Also, there is no \u201cTrump audit of Obama\u201d and there have been no reports of the U.S. transferring gold to Afghanistan. That claim, though, is reminiscent of\u00a0Trump\u2019s criticism\u00a0during the 2016 campaign of\u00a0a $400 million\u00a0payment that the Obama administration made as part of\u00a0a legal settlement\u00a0to reimburse Iran\u00a0for the purchase of U.S. military equipment in the late 1970s that it never received.", "The claim that the U.S. transferred gold to Afghanistan, however, is unfounded.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "America Loves Donald Trump.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
