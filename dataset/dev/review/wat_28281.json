["About this rating", "In October 2019, a picture from 2016 of U.S. President Donald Trump eating a taco bowl with the caption \u201cI love Hispanics\u201d re-entered online discourse, this time as evidence that \u201cthen-candidate Trump was abusing Sudafed.\u201d The photo \u2014 which appears to show three boxes of the name brand nasal decongestant Sudafed in a drawer in the background \u2014 is authentic. But claims of his drug abuse stem from a factually challenged Twitter thread.", "On Oct. 5, 2019, Twitter user JRehling published a thread that highlighted the Sudafed, identified it as a UK formulation, and then made these points as evidence of a nefarious drug-abuse problem:", "These talking points, in turn, were repeated uncritically by several media outlets, most notably Inquisitr, which also suggested the Sudafed was an example of a broader pattern of stimulant abuse by the president. This argument, we show below, is flawed on numerous accounts.", "\u201cSudafed is sometimes used for a high that includes increased alertness.\u201d", "Sudafed is a brand name for a series of nasal decongestant and cold medication products. Sudafed products generally come with one of two drugs as their active decongestant ingredient: either phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is the more powerful of the two chemicals, and it is this chemical that people sometimes abuse for a high or stockpile to make methamphetamine. As such, its use is regulated in the United States.", "Taking at face value the reasonable-appearing claim proffered in that thread that the drugs in the drawer are the product \u201cSudafed Mucus Relief Day & Night\u201d would suggest that the drug abuse claim is fatally flawed. This formulation contains phenylephrine, which would mean that the drug Trump is allegedly abusing for a high is not capable of delivering such a high in the first place.", "\u201cThe desk drawer full of Sudafed ... indicate that the legal limits of purchase are being circumvented.\u201d", "As previously discussed, the Sudafed product at issue here does not contain a chemical with any legal limits on purchase. In the U.S., pseudoephedrine is regulated more tightly than other over-the-counter drugs thanks to the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005. That law imposes monthly limits on retail or online purchases of\u00a0 pseudoephedrine-containing products and requires the collection of some personal details when purchasing them. Phenylephrine is not regulated under this law, and as such there is no \u201clegal limit\u201d for Trump to be circumventing by purchasing or stockpiling the drug.", "\u201cThe boxes include a type that is only sold in the United Kingdom, with a different box and distinctive ingredients not found in the U.S.\u201d", "Sudafed Mucus Relief contains three ingredients, all of which are commonly found in the United States: paracetamol, phenylephrine, and caffeine. Paracetamol is what Tylenol (acetaminophen), a common drug in the United States, goes by in Europe. Caffeine is ubiquitous in the United States, and often used as an ingredient to enhance the pain-relieving impact in headache drugs like Excedrin. Phenylephrine, as discussed earlier, is the most common over-the-counter decongestant in America.", "While the specific formulation of acetaminophen, caffeine, and phenylephrine does not appear to exist as an over-the-counter product in the United States, it would be ridiculous to suggest than any of these three ingredients are \u201cnot found in the U.S.,\u201d or to suggest that any of them are used for a high.", "Because the central facts used to make the argument that Trump is abusing Sudafed based on this photograph are rooted in fatally flawed logic and incorrect statements of fact, we rank the claim as \"False.\"", "Vankin, Jonathan. \u00a0 \u201cDonald Trump Reportedly Hides Boxes Of Sudafed In Desk, \u2018Apprentice\u2019 Staffer Says He Ate Drug \u2018Like Candy\u2019.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Inquisitr. &nbsp 6 October 2019.", "Sudafed.com. \u00a0 \u201cProducts\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 21 November 2019.", "U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \u00a0 \u201cLegal Requirements for the Sale and Purchase of Drug Products Containing Pseudoephedrine, Ephedrine, and Phenylpropanolamine.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 21 November 2019.", "U.S. Department of Justice. \u00a0 \u201cGeneral Information Regarding The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 May 2006.", "Amazon.com. \u00a0 \u201cSudafed Mucus Relief Day & Night Capsules, 16-Count.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 21 November 2019.", "Prescott, L.F. \u00a0 \u201cParacetamol: Past, Present, and Future.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 American Journal of Therapeutics. &nbsp March 2000.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
