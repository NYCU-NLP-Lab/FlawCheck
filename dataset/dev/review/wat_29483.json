["About this rating", "In July 2016, a gold miner in the Klondike goldfields of the Canadian Yukon who was thawing frozen ground and mud to locate placer deposits came upon a much furrier, historically valuable discovery. Locked in the permafrost were the perfectly preserved remains of a wolf pup that had died an estimated 57,000 years ago. And in December 2020, researchers at Des Moines University characterized the world\u2019s \u201cmost complete\u201d wolf mummy in the scientific journal, Current Biology.", "Now named Zh\u00f9r, which means \u201cwolf\u201d in the local language of the Tr'ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch people, the pup is believed to be a Pleistocene gray wolf who died at the age of about seven weeks. Zh\u00f9r was so well preserved at the time of her death that her skin, fur, and the papillae on her lips are all still visible.", "\"She's the most complete wolf mummy that's ever been found. She's basically 100% intact -- all that's missing are her eyes,\" said study author Julie Meachen, an associate professor of anatomy at Des Moines University in a news release. \"And the fact that she's so complete allowed us to do so many lines of inquiry on her to basically reconstruct her life.\"", "Zh\u00f9r measured just 14 inches long and weighed under 1.5 pounds. Morphometric, isotopic, and genetic analyses of the pup provided details of her appearance and evolutionary relationship to wolves \u2014 all of which contributed to understanding how the young canine died.", "\"It's rare to find these mummies in the Yukon. The animal has to die in a permafrost location, where the ground is frozen all the time, and they have to get buried very quickly, like any other fossilization process,\" said Meachen. \"If it lays out on the frozen tundra too long it'll decompose or get eaten.\"", "But how did Zh\u00f9r die? To find out, Meachen and her team first needed to determine how the pup lived.", "Current Biology", "As a mammal ages, its bones fuse together, helping researchers to determine an animal\u2019s age. Radiographs of the canine\u2019s skeleton showed that the epiphyses and epiphyseal plates (also known as the \u201cgrowth plates\u201d) located at the end of long bones had partially fused. By comparing it to the growth rate of a domestic dog, the researchers were able to determine that Zh\u00f9r was just under two months when she died. Based on the birthing cycle of modern wolves, it\u2019s likely that her den collapsed in July or early August.", "In order to determine when Zh\u00f9r died, researchers turned to radiocarbon dating, a method that analyzes the level of three carbon isotopes in an organic item \u2014 like a wolf mummy \u2014 and compares it to the amount of carbon in the atmosphere through geological history. In short, a mummy\u2019s level of carbon isotopes will by and large match carbon in the atmosphere at the time of death. An analysis of Zh\u00f9r\u2019s DNA from hair follicles and oxygen isotopes from tooth enamel suggests that she lived and died between 56,000 and 57,000 years ago.", "Her DNA suggests that Zh\u00f9r likely descended from ancient gray wolves in Russia, Siberia, and Alaska. This evolutionary group, or clade, also includes individuals from Eurasia and North America, a finding that provides further evidence to suggest that the continents were connected during the Pleistocene epoch by way of a giant swath of ice known as the Bering Land Bridge. But because Zh\u00f9r\u2019s DNA does not prove she is a direct ancestor of gray wolves in Canada today, it is thought that wolves in the area experienced at least one wave of regional extinction before being replaced by another subgroup.", "Understanding Zh\u00f9r\u2019s relationship to modern-day wolves helps to paint a bigger picture of her time on Earth. Using that information, the researchers analyzed her diet and determined it was heavily influenced by how closely she lived to the water. Her diet largely consisted of aquatic resources, particularly salmon. This particular area of the Klondike River where she was found is a spawning ground for king salmon and a feeding area for wolves of today.", "Because the pup had a mouth full of teeth and was otherwise healthy at the time of her death, in addition to her high level of preservation, the scientists concluded that she likely died instantly when her den collapsed. But the discovery also presented as many questions as it did insights. Why was Zh\u00f9r the only wolf found in the den? What happened to her parents or siblings? Could it have been that she was an only pup, or was she the only one present when the den collapsed?", "Answers to these questions may never be found, but viewing Zh\u00f9r has been made possible by the Tr'ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch'in people, who placed the pup on display in December 2020 at the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Center in Whitehorse, the capital city of Yukon.", "Government of Yukon", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
