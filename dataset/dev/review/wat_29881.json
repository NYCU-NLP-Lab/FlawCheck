["About this rating", "In June 2019, the internet seemed absolutely obsessed with movie star Keanu Reeves. The actor was riding the wave of praise following the third installment in the John Wick saga, had a surprise cameo in the romantic comedy Always Be My Maybe, and made a meme-worthy appearance at the 2019 Electronic Entertainment Expo.", "Amidst this fervor, an old quote ostensibly uttered by Reeves started to recirculate on social media:", "None of us are getting out of here alive, so please stop treating yourself like an after thought. Eat the delicious food. Walk in the sunshine. Jump in the ocean. Say the truth that you\u2019re carrying in your heart like hidden treasure. Be silly. Be kind. Be weird. There\u2019s no time for anything else.\u201d", "This is not a genuine quote from Reeves.

Do not treat yourself like an after thought.", "Edited to add: Friends, you're going to be seeing my name on a lot of these posts from now on, mostly because people have wanted to know who says all this stuff (and also because sometimes other people feel free to \"borrow\" or claim my words, and that's just not cool). Well, it's me. Sweatpants & Coffee is really a lot of my own inner dialogue flung out upon the Internetz in an attempt to connect with like-minded souls. Such as you fine people. So. There it is. This is me, talking to myself and to you, awkwardly, honestly, goofily, and with no small amount of anxiety. Love you, #WeirdoTribe. XOXO, Nanea", "For more good stuff, go to sweatpantsandcoffee.com", "Hoffman's words can also be found in the concluding paragraph of a longer piece of text that was also falsely attributed to Reeves.
