["About this rating", "As the well-being of immigrant children in U.S. detention remained a focal point of controversy surrounding the Trump administration in early summer 2019, so did attempts to deflect blame to Trump's predecessor amid accusations of neglect and mistreatment.", "During the previous summer, the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy of separating immigrant parents from their children was so widely rejected by both political parties that even First Lady Melania Trump took the unusual step of repudiating it. In response to the backlash, U.S. President Donald Trump (falsely) pinned the blame for the child-separation policy on his predecessor, Barack Obama.", "One year later, amid an ongoing national crisis of conscience over immigrant children incarcerated in detention facilities at the U.S.-Mexico border, President Trump again attempted to pin the blame on his predecessor. During a contentious interview with Spanish-language network Telemundo, Trump wrongly stated that he had reunited families after they were separated by the Obama administration. (In fact, thousands of children were taken from their parents under the Trump administration's 2018 zero-tolerance policy.)", "But then Trump also attempted to deflect outrage over photographs of immigrant children being kept in \"cages\" by asserting, \"Obama built the cages. I didn't build them. Obama built them\":", "That portion of Trump's commentary was true. Pictures of children behind chain-link fencing were captured at a site in McAllen, Texas, that had been converted from a warehouse to an immigrant-detention facility in 2014. Social media users who defended Trump's immigration policies also shared a 2014 photograph of Obama's Homeland Security Secretary, Jeh Johnson, touring a facility in Nogales, Arizona, in 2014, in which the fencing could be seen surrounding migrants there as well. That picture was taken during a spike in the number of unaccompanied children fleeing violence in Central American countries.\nJohnson addressed the issue during a June 2019 interview with the non-partisan think tank The Aspen Institute:\nVery clearly, chain link, barriers, partitions, fences, cages, whatever you want to call them, were not invented on January 20, 2017, OK.
