["About this rating", "In December 2016, a video went viral, purportedly showing a man punching a kangaroo in order to save a dog:", "While the footage\u00a0depicts a real incident,\u00a0it initially seemed\u00a0to leave viewers with more questions than answers. We do know this: the man featured in the video is Greig Tonkins, a zookeeper at Australia's\u00a0Taronga Western Plains Zoo, who was on a pig hunting trip with a group of friends in June 2016 when a kangaroo grabbed his hunting dog, Max.", "Matthew Amor, who organized the trip in support of a friend who was battling an incurable disease, detailed the events that led to his friend punching a kangaroo to News.com.au:", "Mr Amor said it was totally out of character for his friend, Mr Tonkins, to hit the marsupial, describing him as a \u201cplacid bloke\u201d.", "\u201cMy mate has a good government job, so he\u2019s gone pretty quiet on this,\u201d Mr Amor laughed.", "\u201cWe were driving along, the dogs are loose. They are trained to smell pig\u2019s blood, and picked up a scent.", "\u201cThe dogs went past 20 kangaroos, which they are trained not to touch.", "\u201cAnyway, this big buck got a hold of my friend\u2019s dog. It just grabbed him.\u201d", "Shortly after the video went viral, many people called on Taronga's Western Plains zoo to fire Tonkins for punching\u00a0the kangaroo. However, the zoo released a statement on\u00a06 December 2016, saying that the incident did\u00a0not put Tonkins' position in jeopardy:", "Best practice animal welfare and the protection of Australian wildlife are of the utmost importance to Taronga. Taronga strongly opposes the striking of animals and does not support the practice of using dogs to hunt, as this can result in negative welfare for both species. We support the Guidelines outlined by the Department of Environment and Heritage in the event of confrontation with a kangaroo.", "Mr Tonkins is an experienced Zoo keeper and during his six years at Taronga Western Plains Zoo has always followed Taronga\u2019s best practice approach to animal care and welfare. We confirm that there is no suggestion of Mr Tonkins\u2019 employment at Taronga Western Plains Zoo ending as a result of this event.", "However, the highest standards of animal welfare and care are a core value of Taronga and one that we expect our staff to uphold in all their interactions with wildlife and we continue to work with Mr Tonkins on his conduct in regards to this incident.", "Kangaroos are often portrayed as cuddly and gentle marsupials and are generally docile, but can be quite vicious and even\u00a0dangerous\u00a0(kicking with their muscular back legs, using\u00a0feet topped by razor-sharp nails as weapons) when they feel threatened\u00a0(often by dogs).", "In this case, though, all parties\u00a0\u2014 dog, man, and kangaroo\u00a0\u2014 emerged from the confrontation relatively unscathed.", "Khal. \u00a0 \"The Incredibly Sad Story Behind That Viral Video of a Man Punching a Kangaroo.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Complex. \u00a0 5 December 2016.", "Brown, Vanessa. \u00a0 \"Viral Kangaroo Video is More Than Meets the Eye.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 News.com.au. \u00a0 6 December 2016.", "Taronga Western Plains Zoo. \u00a0 \"Taronga Statement.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 6 December 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
