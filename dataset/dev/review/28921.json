["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 22, 2020", "Facebook posts credit President Donald Trump with accomplishing a list of things that haven\u2019t happened \u2014 claiming, for example, that he \u201ccancelled\u201d a proposed House bill on contact tracing and \u201cexpelled WHO.\u201d", "Popular text posts circulating on Facebook, in some cases with explicit references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, are falsely claiming that President Donald Trump has accomplished things that haven\u2019t actually happened.", "\u201cIn just a couple of days, Donald Trump did what many of us expected and knew would happen,\u201d the posts claim, proceeding to a list of six purported actions by the president.", "But most of the claims are false, misleading or unsupported. Others require a bit more context. We\u2019ll break them down here.", "First of all, there\u2019s no evidence that H.R. 6666 \u2014 the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act \u2014 is a \u201cbasis\u201d for a purported \u201ctracking project\u201d by Bill Gates. The bill outlines a $100 billion fund to be managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in order to fund contact tracing efforts across the country, as we\u2019ve previously explained.", "Secondly, the president doesn\u2019t have the power to \u201ccancel\u201d a bill. Instead, he could veto a piece of legislation if it were to come to his desk.", "But the bill in question is far from that step: H.R. 6666 is currently before a House committee. It would need to advance to the House floor and be passed by that chamber, as well as by the Republican-led Senate, before it would go to Trump.", "ID2020 is the name of a nonprofit organization with a mission to widen access to digital forms of identification \u2014 and to ensure people have control over their \u201cdigital IDs.\u201d For example, it has partnered with iRespond and the International Rescue Committee on a program to \u201coffer a digital identity platform\u201d to refugees at a camp in Thailand that would allow them \u201cto not only access improved healthcare services but also securely store educational and professional credentials.\u201d", "The organization was founded by several partners \u2014 including Microsoft, of which Gates is co-founder, and by Gavi, a Gates-backed organization that seeks to provide access to vaccines in impoverished countries.", "In recent months, ID2020 has been the subject of conspiracy theories.", "We\u2019ve previously written about a false claim that Gates has proposed tracking people with microchips. Some have evidently linked such baseless claims also to ID2020. As Snopes reports, those claims misrepresent ID2020\u2019s projects.", "The notion that a Gates project was \u201ccancelled\u201d may be a reference to an at-home testing initiative for the novel coronavirus, backed by Gates, that was taking place in the Seattle area. The Food and Drug Administration recently ordered the project to temporarily halt its effort until additional approvals were granted; but it hasn\u2019t been permanently canceled.", "That project \u2014 the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network \u2014 wrote on its website on May 14 that \u201cSCAN\u2019s test is authorized by the Washington State Department of Health. However, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) recently clarified its guidance for home-based, self-collected samples to test for COVID-19.\u201d", "\u201cWe have been notified that a separate federal emergency use authorization (EUA) is required to return results for self-collected tests,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThe FDA has not raised any concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of SCAN\u2019s test, but we have been asked to pause testing until we receive that additional authorization.\u201d", "There\u2019s no evidence Trump has taken any recent action to mandate, or bar the mandate of, vaccines. Right now, there are some vaccine mandates under state laws, as we\u2019ll explain.", "This claim might be a reference to a statement Trump made on May 15 while discussing \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d \u2014 a federal initiative to quickly find a vaccine and treatments for COVID-19.", "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a full vaccine for everyone that wants to get it,\u201d Trump said\u00a0while answering a reporter\u2019s question. \u201cNot everybody is going to want to get it.\u201d", "Trump has in the past, and recently, expressed reticence toward the flu shot \u2014 which the CDC credits with saving thousands of lives each year. But he has also recently signaled support for vaccines; in particular, he\u2019s supported the rapid development of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.", "The objective of Operation Warp Speed \u201cis to finish developing and then to manufacture and distribute a proven coronavirus vaccine as fast as possible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAgain, we\u2019d love to see if we could do it prior to the end of the year.\u201d", "He also said the federal government would \u201cinvest in manufacturing all of the top vaccine candidates before they\u2019re approved,\u201d which would \u201celiminate any unnecessary delay and enable us to begin providing Americans with a proven vaccine the day our scientists say, \u2018We\u2019re ready. We got it.'\u201d", "Currently, state laws mandate certain vaccination requirements for students, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Conference on State Legislatures.", "\u201cState laws establish vaccination requirements for school children. These laws often apply not only to children attending public schools but also to those attending private schools and day care facilities,\u201d the CDC says. \u201cAll states provide medical exemptions, and some state laws also offer exemptions for religious and/or philosophical reasons. State laws also establish mechanisms for enforcement of school vaccination requirements and exemptions.\u201d", "According to the Congressional Research Service, in addition to states wielding the power to mandate vaccines in order to protect their populations, there are some powers that could permit the federal government to mandate vaccination to prevent the spread of communicable diseases into the U.S. or between states.", "\u201cIt is possible for either state or federal government to mandate vaccination,\u201d said Nicole Huberfeld, a Boston University professor of health law, ethics and human rights, but \u201cusually vaccination is a state law matter.\u201d", "\u201cStates require children to be vaccinated to enter public schools, with physician proof of vaccination being required (or proof of medical condition exemption, alternatively),\u201d Huberfeld said in an email. \u201cSome states allow more than medical exemptions, they have gone so far as to allow religious and even \u2018moral\u2019 objections to vaccine \u2026 Neither religious nor moral exemptions are constitutionally required.\u201d", "But, she added, \u201cbecause the Constitution protects the individual right to refuse medical treatment, it would take a very serious event to create a situation where absolute mandatory vaccination would be the law of a state (or the nation). Trump certainly has not mandated vaccination, though he has touted it as a way out of the pandemic.\u201d", "The World Health Organization is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, though there are regional offices, including one in Washington, D.C.", "This claim appears to be a misrepresentation of recent actions against the WHO taken by Trump.", "In April, Trump \u2014 who has accused the WHO of mismanaging the COVID-19 outbreak \u2014 announced that he would suspend U.S. payments to the organization.", "And on May 18, Trump sent a letter to the organization and demanded that it commit to \u201cmajor substantive improvements\u201d in the next 30 days. If it didn\u2019t, Trump said in the letter, \u201cI will make my temporary freeze of United States funding permanent and reconsider our membership in the organization.\u201d", "The White House did create a tool for Americans to file claims of what they believe to be censorship on social media platforms \u2014 in 2019. The tool was announced in May 2019 and instructed users that it was for \u201cinformation gathering only.\u201d", "The web page now says it \u201cisn\u2019t accepting new responses.\u201d Trump has continued to talk about the issue, though.", "\u201cThe Radical Left is in total command & control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on May 16. \u201cThe Administration is working to remedy this illegal situation. Stay tuned, and send names & events.\u201d", "This is likely a reference to a recent move by the Trump administration to further cut off supplies to Huawei, a Chinese tech giant rolling out 5G networks. The U.S. has accused the company of conspiring to steal trade secrets and said its technology could be used for Chinese espionage. Huawei has denied this.", "On May 15, the Trump administration announced measures designed to prevent foreign companies that use U.S. software and technology from providing chips to the company.", "Those sanctions could delay the rollout of the company\u2019s 5G technology, its chief technology officer told Yahoo Finance.", "Still, some experts told the Wall Street Journal that loopholes remain that may allow supplies to flow to the company in more indirect ways.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
