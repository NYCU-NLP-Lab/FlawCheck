Such a ban would contravene the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion.", "The 1952 law largely\u00a0codified the country\u2019s immigration policies. It implemented changes \u2014 officially ending the exclusion of Asian immigrants, for example \u2014 and upheld other aspects such as the national-origins quota system established in 1924.", "President Harry Truman, saying that the national-origins quota system was \u201cbased upon assumptions at variance with our American ideals,\u201d\u00a0vetoed\u00a0the bill \u2014 which Congress was able to override. Those quotas were ultimately\u00a0repealed\u00a0a decade later and subsequent immigration legislation also\u00a0overhauled parts of the law.", "We debunked a story earlier this year that falsely claimed that the Supreme Court had upheld a 1952 law barring Muslims from serving in government. That story, first published on a self-proclaimed satirical website, didn\u2019t mention the McCarran-Walter Act by name.", "The claims about the non-existent restriction circulate as the first two Muslim women prepare to enter Congress.", "Democrats Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib were elected\u00a0to the House this month to represent districts in Minnesota and Michigan, respectively.
