["By Sydney Schaedel", "Posted on August 18, 2017", "Q: Did the man who drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, meet with former President Obama in the White House?", "A: No. A satirical website confuses the driver with the organizer of the rally, who is rumored to have been a past Obama supporter.", "I read that the driver of the car that killed the female in Virginia was tied in with Obama and that he also was a Democrat as his politics, not a Republican and not a Trump fan. Is this true?", "An Aug. 15 story on ourlandofthefree.com, headlined \u201cWhite Supremacist Who Killed Protester Is A Democrat And Visited Obama In Oval Office,\u201d gets the facts wrong \u2014 intentionally. It is a satirical website.", "\u201cConservative author Dinesh D\u2019Souza uncovered something that blows the Left\u2019s whole narrative to bits,\u201d the story starts. \u201cWhile they have been throwing around claims that the white supremacist who ran over a protester who was blocking the road is a Republican, D\u2019Souza discovered he [is] actually an Obama-supporting Democrat.\u201d", "That\u2019s not the case.", "D\u2019Souza\u2019s tweet, which is embedded in the story, was about Jason Kessler, whom D\u2019Souza called the \u201cwhite supremacist organizer\u201d of the Aug. 12 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The rally\u00a0resulted in deadly violence. D\u2019Souza shared a link to a Southern Poverty Law Center profile of Kessler that suggested the white nationalist blogger was once a Democrat.", "\u201cRumors abound on white nationalist forums that Kessler\u2019s ideological pedigree before 2016 was less than pure and seem to point to involvement in the Occupy movement and past support for President Obama,\u201d the SPLC profile says.", "The ourlandofthefree.com story includes that excerpt from the SPLC. The profile, however, goes on to say: \u201cRegardless of Kessler\u2019s past politics, the rightward shift in his views was first put on display in November, 2016 when his tirade against Wes Bellamy began.\u201d Bellamy is the only black city councilman in Charlottesville, and Kessler unsuccessfully attempted\u00a0to have him removed\u00a0from office.", "Regardless, Kessler is not \u201cthe white supremacist who ran over a protester,\u201d as the satirical website\u2019s story says.", "Twenty-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Maumee, Ohio, was charged with second degree murder after police said he drove his Dodge Challenger into a group of people counterprotesting the rally. Heather Heyer of Charlottesville was killed in the crash, and 19 others were injured.", "The ourlandofthefree.com story makes no mention of Fields, who is a registered Republican, according to BuzzFeed News, which cited Lucas County, Ohio, voter registration records as its source. (We also found Fields listed as a registered Republican on another website that compiles public voter registration data.)", "The bogus story also claims that Kessler \u201cvisited the Oval Office in 2016,\u201d and includes an obviously altered photo. The doctored image shows\u00a0Fields\u2019 face, not Kessler\u2019s, sloppily added atop Will Ferrell\u2019s body in a photo of the actor with President Barack Obama.", "Facebook users flagged the ourlandofthefree.com story as potentially fake news, and some of our readers asked us about it.
