Some articles contrasted Sanders with rival Democratic contender Hillary Clinton (although the latter also traveled on commercial flights at the outset of her presidential campaign):", "A stream of images are posted under the hashtag #SandersOnAPlane \u2014 including one showing the Brooklyn native sneaking in some computer time while sitting between two passengers ... It's an unmistakable contrast with Clinton, who has taken heat this election cycle for taking trips on Gulfstream jets and for banking millions on the speaking circuit.", "On 31 December 2015, ABC News inquired about the senator's increased use of chartered air travel, and his campaign maintained that the increasing demands of primary season made it impossible for the senator to consistently travel commercial:", "His campaign spokesman Michael Briggs [said]: \"Bernie is running for president of the United States and his campaign requires him to travel to many communities in Iowa and New Hampshire and other places as efficiently as possible to meet voters and to answer their questions.\"", "\"While he has used commercial airlines on almost all occasions, there are circumstances when using charter airplanes is the best way for him to get around the country and communicate with as many people as possible.\"", "Around the end of December 2015 sightings of \"Sanders on a Plane\" dropped abruptly, possibly due to logistical\u00a0reasons: On 30 January 2016, media outlets confirmed\u00a0Sanders had been afforded Secret Service protection.  Indeed, shortly after Sanders' new Secret Service detail was announced, a Vermont-based newspaper reported that his campaign had chartered a plane to travel to New Hampshire:", "Yes, almost beating Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucus helped, but a more tangible sign was that the campaign had chartered a jet to make the trip from Des Moines to Manchester, New Hampshire for immediate deployment for the Granite State's primary on Feb. 9. Sanders famously travels coach on commercial airlines. Sightings of him stuffing his luggage into the overhead bins is a minor Internet meme.", "However, traveling by charter flight wasn't entirely new to Sanders' campaign, even if it became more frequent after Sanders was assigned a protective detail.

However, a May 2015 article about Hillary Clinton's campaign travels highlighted how difficult it is for candidates to move about via commercial flights while under Secret Service protection:", "Hillary Clinton has traded private jets for seats on commercial airlines as she embarks on her second, humbler presidential run.

Thanks to strict security concerns, Clinton is insulated from the public from the moment she arrives at one airport to the time she leaves the second one.

During that time, Sanders was placed under the protection of the Secret Service, which although it didn't preclude commercial air travel, likely added to the campaign's travel considerations (which already involved closely-spaced races in multiple states and the need for timely arrival at rallies and events).
