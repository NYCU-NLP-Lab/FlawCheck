["About this rating", "On 12 September 2016 the Rightists web site published an article reporting that Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine had threatened to ban the Catholic Church from the United States if they did not change their stance on gay marriage:", "Democratic U.S. vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine announced Saturday that he believes the Catholic Church will change its position on same-sex marriage. The Virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue, the Catholic Church is also likely to follow suit. Speaking at the 20th Annual Human Rights Campaign\u2019s National Dinner in Washington, the Roman Catholic senator reportedly said, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who, in the first chapter of Genesis, surveyed the entire world, including mankind, and said, \u2018It is very good.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cSo, what I\u2019m saying here,\u201d he argued, \u201cis that, while I respect the Catholic Church as I\u2019m sure millions of Americans do, you know, at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the Christian faith, and we\u2019re talking about an institution that\u2019s supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it. So, when that happens, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with condemning LGBT rights, we\u2019ll state an ultimatum. The United States of America, more precisely, the future President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton, will state an ultimatum. And that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on same-sex marriage or pack its bags and get out of America. And yes \u2014 the President of the country can do that.\u201d", "The Rightists is basically a fake news outlet that bills itself as a \"hybrid\" web site, publishing articles that are a combination of fact and fiction.

I think we're supposed to celebrate it, not challenge it,\" Kaine said.", "Contrary to the story published by The Rightists, Tim Kaine did not say that the church would (or should) be banned from the United States if they didn't change their stance on gay marriage. In fact, the First Amendment would preclude such an action, even if a President should be rash enough to consider it.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
