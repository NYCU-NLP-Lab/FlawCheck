So we were surprised to learn that Perry recently turned the tables.", "\"Today is day 164 of liberal trial lawyer Bill White refusing to debate,\" according to an Aug. 18 press release from the Perry campaign. \"He also continues to refuse to release his taxes from his years in public service.\"", "The White campaign fired back on its Twitter account devoted to lambasting the governor: \"Perry claimed today that it's Bill White who refuses to debate. What's next, Perry says editorial boards refuse to meet with him?\"", "On Aug. 12, the Austin American-Statesman reported that Perry won't meet with newspaper editorial boards, where political candidates answer questions from editorial writers and editors in an effort to win the newspaper's endorsement. White is meeting with editorial boards, including those at smaller papers like the Killeen Daily Herald.", "Is Perry's plaint that White is debate-averse justified?", "Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White's campaign, told us that White \"has accepted five televised debates,\" pointing to a July 21 press release calling on the governor to join him in those debates.", "Perry has said he wouldn't debate White until the Democrat makes public his tax returns for the six years he served as Houston's mayor, the two years he was deputy energy secretary in the Clinton administration and from when he led the Texas Democratic Party.

The issue is one and the same.\"", "Still, we couldn't find any instances of White flat-out refusing to debate Perry.", "If every debate sponsor statewide required the candidates to release their tax returns and White refused, Perry's logic would be more reasonable. But this is a precondition that only Perry has set, and, as we recently reported, a term to debate he hasn't made in the past.
