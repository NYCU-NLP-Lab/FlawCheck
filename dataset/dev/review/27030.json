As soon as you have clicked share to Facebook it gives these hackers instant access to your own personal details and puts your family and friends personal details at risk.", "PLEASE SHARE TO MAKE YOUR FRIENDS AWARE", "As is typical of such alerts, certain features of actual Facebook apps that access personal information in users' profiles have been misconstrued as illegal and the security threat they pose is exaggerated.", "A number of apps of this kind are constantly promoted on Facebook. This example poses the question, \"What would you look like as a bald person?\":", "Clicking on the link opens an external web page that instructs the user to log in with Facebook to see the results:", "This disclaimer appears in fine print at the bottom of the page:", "This app uses data and contents only if they are publicly available or with the consent of the users.

If they choose to continue, users are then presented with a selection of photos from their Facebook page and invited to choose one for the demonstration. The app displays the chosen photo side-by-side with an altered version depicting the subject without hair, and invites the user to like the app.", "It is all relatively harmless, but Facebook users should take seriously all notifications to the effect that they by using the app they are granting the company that provided it access to some of their personal data.", "We also advise reading the Terms of Service and Privacy notifications provided by such apps (usually via links somewhere on the associated web page) for a detailed description of what you're agreeing to.
