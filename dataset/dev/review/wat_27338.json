If anything, he shortchanged both presidents.", "There is no dispute whatsoever about airstrikes in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. Bush launched wars in the first two countries and drone strikes in Pakistan have been in the news for a long time, with or without official acknowledgment. Airstrikes in those places continued under Obama.", "Somalia falls largely in the same category as Pakistan. The New York Times, BBC News and other news organizations reported airstrikes as early as 2007 against people linked to the al-Qaida network.", "The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit news service based at City University London, maintains a running list of U.S. military actions in a number of countries, including Somalia and Yemen. The bureau annotates each incident with links to press reports. By its tally, American drone strikes against suspected terrorists in Somalia occurred under both Bush and Obama.", "The same pattern holds in Yemen. BBC News and Time magazine reported a CIA-directed drone attack in Yemen in 2002. This would increase Bush\u2019s total to five countries, rather than the four Lizza cited. Lizza said he left Yemen off of Bush\u2019s list because it was a \"one-off strike, rather than a more sustained bombing campaign. Probably deserves an asterisk.\"", "The air attacks on Libya that helped topple Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 under Obama are well documented. In March 2011, the United States and British warships fired over 100 cruise missiles to destroy Libyan air defenses.

The final, maximum number would be Bush 6: Obama 8.", "PunditFact cannot confirm the authenticity of these reports.", "This framework says little about the nature of each president\u2019s air campaigns. According to Air Force data, the number of munitions dropped in Afghanistan and Iraq declined about 35 percent between 2007 under Bush and 2009 under Obama (adjusted for missing data in 2009). However in Afghanistan, the number of sorties with at least one weapon release and the number of munitions used rose in 2010 and 2011 before falling in 2012, according to Air Force data. The number of weapon releases fell greatly in 2013.", "The country tally also tells us nothing about the general military strategy under each president.

Depending on your view of Bush\u2019s reported drone strike into Yemen, he may have slightly undercounted Bush\u2019s tally.
