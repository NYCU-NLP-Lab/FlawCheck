Lindsay Harrington, R-Punta Gorda, sponsored the bill because of concerns from the National Rifle Association, according to a July 2004 St. Petersburg Times (now Tampa Bay Times) article. The story said Harrington was troubled when he heard that law enforcement agencies were collecting data on gun transactions at pawn shops, saying \"I don't think we, in America, want that type of thing.\"", "The law echoes this concern.

Spokesmen for law enforcement agencies in Tampa Bay told the Times they had many questions about the broad ban on any \"list, record or registry,\" and said they may need to hire additional workers to go through various paper and electronic records for deletion. The law required agencies to delete electronic data of pawnshop sales within 60 days, which could also make searches for gun information more onerous.", "\"It's a mess,\" Sherman Smith, the St. Petersburg Police Department's legal adviser, told the Times. \"This has really got me flummoxed.\"", "There are exceptions to the gun records ban.
