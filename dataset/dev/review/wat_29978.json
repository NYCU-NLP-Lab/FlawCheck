In fact, since you are asking more about it, it is a masterful work on the part of President Obama to bring the P-5, Russia, China, into the fold. They have never voted with us at the U.N. on any sanctions on Iran in the past. So from a diplomatic standpoint to get us to this place was masterful.\"", "Some readers asked us to check whether Russia and China have never endorsed sanctions against Iran.", "When we initially contacted Pelosi's office for their evidence, we quickly heard back from her spokesman, Drew Hammill, who said, \"The leader misspoke.\"", "Russia and China often aren't aligned with the United States' interests, but they have, in fact, joined the United States in\u00a0endorsing\u00a0sanctions against Iran at least eight times before the 2015 nuclear deal.", "We confirmed eight Security Council resolutions\u00a0threatening, imposing or continiung sanctions against Iran in which Russia and China approved\u00a0sanctions.\u00a0The votes date back to July 2006.
