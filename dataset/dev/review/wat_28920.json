According to the statement of Manoj Baba given to the police, that night he was trying to climb/hang on to a branch in an inebriated state where he had fallen down and got injured. He had passed out at the same place and was only woken up by the villagers the next morning. The villagers including one Rambabu [Nishad] took him to the hospital the next morning while on their way back from the hospital, they got involved in a scuffle with the villagers. This all happened after their vehicle nearly rammed into some kids playing in the area following which the villagers got angry over Rambabu, who was intoxicated and driving the car. Rambabu was beaten up by the crowd and later he (Rambabu) took him (Manoj Baba) to the police to file a complaint. Rambabu wrote an application and had asked him to sign it, which he did. But later, he refused to go for a medical check-up regarding the case as he denied that he was ever attacked at the monastery in the first place.
