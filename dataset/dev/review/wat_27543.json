["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Assemblyman David DiPietro pictured on Nov. 6, 2018, in Erie County Republican headquarters. (Harry Scull Jr./Buffalo News)", "Assemblymember David DiPietro is a leading proponent of the push to divide New York state into three parts and create an autonomous government in each one. The idea to split New York because of competing interests in the upstate and downstate regions is an old one. One of DiPietro\u2019s reasons for wanting to carve up the state caught our attention. It has to do with welfare benefits.", "The Republican from East Aurora said that an autonomous upstate region could be less generous with welfare benefits. Talking to reporters outside a Divide New York caucus meeting in Lackawanna, DiPietro said that while the average state offers 12 to 14 welfare benefits, New York offers about 35 different benefits, every one that the federal government allows.", "\"Do we need to give every single welfare benefit that the federal government has in their control, when the average is that there are 35 different types of benefits?\" DiPietro said, according to WBFO. \"The average in the country is about 12 to 14. Why are we giving every one? We're one of the only states that does that.\"", "New York has a reputation for providing a safety net that is more generous than other states, but is it as generous as DiPietro claims?", "We approached DiPietro to learn his source of this claim. Over a week and a half, we called his office twice, emailed him four times and tried to reach him on his cellphone. He did not return our messages.", "Since we don\u2019t know where his information comes from, we reached out to experts to find out if they had heard this claim before. Experts across ideological lines agree New York has a generous safety net, but no one we spoke with could trace the source of DiPietro\u2019s claim.", "The Fiscal Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, referred us to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services list of 41\u00a0federal programs that use poverty guidelines to determine whether a person is eligible or not. But a review of that list did not offer any support for DiPietro's claim. Some programs such as the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid\u00a0can be more generous in different states, but New York does not offer\u00a0more programs relative to other states.", "Of the 41 federal programs:", "There are different ways to define and count \"welfare\" programs. A 2013 report from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, counted 126 separate federal anti-poverty programs, either means-tested assistance or those with an explicit purpose in fighting poverty. In 2012\u00a0congressional testimony,\u00a0the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said it counted 79 federal means-tested welfare programs.", "Regardless of how think tanks count the programs, there\u2019s no doubt New York is generous compared with other states. In Cato\u2019s analysis, New York ranked seventh among states for the total value of welfare benefits. It also found that New York ranks third most-generous in the value of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, the primary cash benefit for the poor.", "But TANF, which is distributed through block grant\u00a0to all states, has\u00a0not changed since 1996. States have flexibility in how they use the funds\u00a0and can use it for programs other than cash assistance, such as child welfare or preschool. The annual funding level of $16.5 billion was set in 1996 and has not changed. Inflation has reduced the program's real value by 40 percent since then, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.", "Angela Rachidi, a research fellow in poverty studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank that favors free enterprise, said DiPietro\u2019s claim is possibly true. But she\u2019s not sure where he got his numbers from. It is true the federal government authorizes programs and gives states flexibility in how to deliver them, said Rachidi, who worked in human resources administration in New York City\u2019s Department of Social Services. \"The general perception is true that New York is a very generous state,\" she said.", "Some experts suggested DiPietro might be talking about Medicaid. Without a response from DiPietro, we can\u2019t be sure.", "Medicaid, the health care program for people who have low incomes or disabilities, is designed differently in every state. There are 15 mandatory benefits, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, as well as optional benefits\u00a0that vary by state, such as hospice, eyeglasses\u00a0and podiatry services. States can decide how generous each benefit will be, like\u00a0whether to require\u00a0a co-pay or set a limit on services.", "The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes health policy, surveyed all 50 states in 2018 about the Medicaid benefits they offer. The foundation asked about 47 different benefits, 14\u00a0of which are mandatory. Of the remaining 33 benefits, New York offers all of them. New York also offers services that were not part of KFF's survey, such as fertility services and\u00a0lactation services. To see how New York compared with other states, we looked at the 33\u00a0optional benefits included in the survey. We found that, on average,\u00a0the 44 states that participated in the survey offered 26\u00a0optional benefits. Alabama and Virginia had the fewest, with 15 optional benefits. New Jersey and Minnesota offered 32.", "New York\u00a0did not respond to the KFF survey, but we researched Medicaid benefit information from the state Department of Health and the state's official Medicaid plan.", "New York\u2019s Medicaid spending has always been high, if not the highest, among other states. In 2015, per capita spending on Medicaid was highest in New York, and 76 percent above the national average, according to an analysis from the Empire Center, a conservative think tank.", "No one disputes New York has a generous safety net. But DiPietro makes it sound like most states don't offer even half of the optional welfare programs or services that New York does. A basic tenet of PolitiFact is that the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. DiPietro didn't respond to requests for information to support his claim. We wanted to know the source of his claim, but he declined to talk to us.", "This is an important issue to New Yorkers, and also one that can be prone to exaggeration by those with strong feelings on welfare. So we checked with experts who study welfare and Medicaid benefits. They could not locate the source of his specific claim.", "In our research, we found a\u00a0nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation study that compared Medicaid benefits across the country. It\u00a0found 44 states offered an average of 26 optional benefits. That's considerably more than the \"12 to 14\" optional welfare benefits that DiPietro claims the average state provides. What's more, the two states that offered the fewest optional benefits - 15 - still offered more than what DiPietro claimed to be the average number among other states.", "Our analysis of\u00a0Temporary Assistance to Needy Families also\u00a0did not support his claim.", "We rate his claim False.", "WBFO, \"Regionalized government will cut taxes & costs, increase autonomy, says Divide NY caucus,\" October 30, 2019.
