The numbers on production and pricing show that Saudi production rose, then fell, and then rose again.

We have no public documents to confirm that Reagan asked the Saudis to use oil as an economic weapon against the USSR.", "On the other hand, we have an extensive public record that Saudi Arabia was fighting with its OPEC partners and had warned them for years that it would raise production to make them pay a price for cheating on their quotas. We also see that Saudi Arabia charted its own course in setting oil prices and the consensus view among oil experts is OPEC, not Reagan, shaped their production decisions.", "Finally, we have Bush calling on the Saudis to help send prices back up.
