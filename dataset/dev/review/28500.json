The \"clouds\" in this image, however, would be more accurately described as fog.", "This photograph was taken by Carsten Witte as part of his \"Desert Tombstones\" project. The Phoblographer published an article about these photographs of \"monolithic architecture\" in 2017, writing:", "Dubai is home to some of the world\u2019s most iconic skyscrapers in modern times, making it a prime playground for architectural photography. While the possibilities and ideas for portraying these buildings are endless, Hamburg-based photographer Carsten Witte presented an interesting perspective with his straightforward architectural photography in the city.", "In a set he interestingly calls Desert Tombstones, Carsten emphasizes the stateliness of Dubai\u2019s skyscapers, both in their size and their ultra modern design. Each building he photographed stands tall as a symbol of the city\u2019s stunning architecture, rivaled only by a few in the world. Each also has their own distinct features, shapes, and patterns that are interesting to explore and capture as urban geometry studies.", "This, of course, is not the only photograph of these skyscrapers poking above the fog.

Accounts vary, but between two to six times per year, sometime between September and November, the lights of the city disappear in a mist so thick you can't see the ground in front of you.", "The fog appears during the shift from scorching summer to moderately cooler winter. As the cool air of the nights meets the hot humid days, fog forms in the early hours, blanketing the city in a thick haze.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
