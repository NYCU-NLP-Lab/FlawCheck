But that\u2019s not the case, and such claims feed into a bigger, unfounded conspiracy pushed by QAnon that he and other powerful people are part of a global child sex-trafficking ring.", "One of the photos shows a child who appears to be bound and gagged with tape. Obama is not in this picture.", "Another shows a grid of smaller shots of Obama and the actor George Clooney on a boat with a child. The words, \"exposing herself\" and an arrow have been scribbled in red on top of one of the images..", "The third shows Obama with his arms wrapped around a young child who is smiling while seated on his lap.", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Though the angle of the photo only shows the two men and a girl, other photos from that day reveal there were many people aboard, including Michelle Obama, Amal Clooney, the president\u2019s daughter, Malia, and other guests. Several media outlets covered the boat ride and nothing nefarious was reported.", "The third image was taken in 2015 by Pete Souza, the White House photographer during the Obama administration.

But claims connecting him to sexual misconduct with children are completely baseless.
