["By Robert Farley", "Posted on December 16, 2019", "President Donald Trump wrongly claimed the Commission on Presidential Debates was \u201cforced to publicly apologize for modulating\u201d his microphone in the first 2016 general election debate. The bipartisan commission did not apologize for any willful tampering, but acknowledged \u201cthere were issues regarding Donald Trump\u2019s audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s wariness about the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonprofit entity that sponsors the events, goes back to the first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton in September 2016, when Trump raised issues about what he said was a \u201cdefective mic\u201d and suggested it may have been deliberate trickery. He also labeled the debate \u201crigged\u201d because the \u201chead guy used to work for Bill Clinton.\u201d As we wrote then, the commission was co-chaired by a former Clinton aide and a former Republican National Committee chairman.", "The CPD currently has three co-chairs: Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who was chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1983 to 1989; Dorothy Ridings, formerly a newspaper journalist, president of the League of Women Voters and president and chief executive officer of the charitable Council on Foundations; and Kenneth Wollack, a former president of the National Democratic Institute who once served on the national staff of Democrat George McGovern\u2019s presidential campaign in 1972.", "The New York Times reported on Dec. 12 that Trump and his advisers were discussing the possibility of opting out of the general election debates in 2020 due to Trump\u2019s concerns about the commission.", "Trump responded to that news report in a series of tweets on Dec. 16.", "I look very much forward to debating whoever the lucky person is who stumbles across the finish line in the little watched Do Nothing Democrat Debates. My record is so good on the Economy and all else, including debating, that perhaps I would consider more than 3 debates\u2026..", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2019", "\u2026.to me, and there are many options, including doing them directly & avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased Commission. I will make a decision at an appropriate time but in the meantime, the Commission on Presidential Debates is NOT authorized to speak for me (or R\u2019s)!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2019", "In the spin room after the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2016, at Hofstra University, Trump complained that \u201cthey gave me a defective mic\u201d and questioned whether that was done \u201con purpose.\u201d", "Four days after the debate, the CPD released a terse statement saying there was a technical glitch with Trump\u2019s microphone that affected his volume in the debate room, but did not affect the audio for the 84 million people who watched the debate on television.", "Commission on Presidential Debates, Sept. 30, 2016: Regarding the first debate, there were issues regarding Donald Trump\u2019s audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall.", "We reached out to the commission seeking clarification about what, specifically, the technical issue was and why it affected Trump\u2019s microphone and not Clinton\u2019s. We\u2019ll update this story if we get a response.", "According to the New York Times, Trump said after the debate that \u201cthe changing volume had distracted him and alleged again that someone had created the problem deliberately.\u201d", "\u201dThey had somebody modulating the microphone, so when I was speaking, the mike would go up and down,\u201d Trump said. \u201dI spent 50 percent of my thought process working the mike.\u201d", "The Times noted that there was \u201cno evidence of sabotage.\u201d", "We note that CPD did not \u201capologize\u201d as Trump said, nor did it admit to \u201cmodulating\u201d his microphone, which suggests intentional meddling. But the CPD did acknowledge there had been a technological malfunction that affected Trump\u2019s audio in the debate room.", "In a CNN op-ed in February pushing back against criticism that it shuts out third-party candidates from debates, the two CPD co-chairs at the time stated: \u201cThe CPD is run by an independent board made up of independents, Republicans and Democrats. It receives no party or government funding, and no major party official serves in any capacity with the CPD.\u201d", "The CPD, which has sponsored all of the presidential debates since 1988, released a statement on Dec. 16 saying, \u201cOur record is one of fairness, balance and non-partisanship.\u201d The commission has issued a schedule of three general election debates, starting with one on Sept. 29, 2020, at the University of Notre Dame, as well as a vice presidential debate on Oct. 7.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
