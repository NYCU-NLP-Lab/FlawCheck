She said she was glad that Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, was trying to warn Americans \"that what happened in 2016 is sadly underway again.\"", "Reid then said: \"Yeah, to say nothing of putting bounties on American troops.\"", "\"It\u2019s unbelievable, Joy,\" Clinton replied. \"I mean, he is still yet to say anything, as the president of the United States, about bounties on American troops.\"", "The \"bounties\" story is about reports that Russia offered Taliban-linked militants bounties to kill American troops in Afghanistan.", "PolitiFact decided to fact-check whether Clinton was right that Trump hasn\u2019t said anything on the matter.
