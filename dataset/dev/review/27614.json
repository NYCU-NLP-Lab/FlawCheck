["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on January 23, 2018", "Q: Did Sen. Chuck Schumer take $500,000 in donations from immigrant advocacy groups before the government shutdown?", "A: No. That rumor originated on a satirical website.", "Did Chuck Schumer receive donations from illegal immigrant support groups prior to Senate budget vote?", "Did [House Speaker Paul] Ryan or Schumer take $500,000 from the Koch brothers to pass the tax bill or shut down the government?", "Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer has a history of supporting immigration legislation. For example, he voted to block a bill in 2016 that would have increased penalties for people who illegally re-enter the country and he was a member of the so-called \u201cgang of eight\u201d that developed a comprehensive immigration bill\u00a0in 2013.", "But, there is no evidence that he received $500,000 in campaign contributions from immigration advocacy groups shortly before the partial government shutdown, which lasted for three days\u00a0and was due in part to Democratic efforts to force protections for DACA recipients.", "DACA, which stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is an Obama-era policy that offered protection from deportation and work authorization to immigrants who were brought here as children without legal permission. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has decided to wind down the program. That left the fate of 689,800 active DACA recipients up to Congress, which has yet to act.", "A website that describes itself as satirical and has a disclaimer that says, \u201cEverything on this website is fiction,\u201d posted a story claiming that Schumer had raised $500,000 just before the partial shutdown from \u201cthree groups that regularly push for complete amnesty for all illegals.\u201d", "The story says: \u201cAn explosive report by The Gateway Pundit reveals that there may be a reason for his support beyond Schumer\u2019s purported love of Mexican criminals above our veterans and poor children. In fact, there\u00a0is a reason. $500,000 of them in fact.\u201d", "There is no such report on the Gateway Pundit.", "The made-up story, which was picked up and posted by websites that don\u2019t have a disclaimer, was flagged by Facebook users as potentially false and prompted several readers to ask us if it\u2019s true. It\u2019s not.", "None of the three groups listed in the bogus story \u2014 \u201cImmigration for Everyone, the Council for Alien Rights, and the Southern Border Defense Fund\u201d \u2014 appear to exist and the \u201ctransparency\u201d website that supposedly showed the campaign contributions links to a pornographic image.", "Schumer\u2019s office confirmed that he has received no such contributions.", "The same day that this made-up story came out, HuffPost reported that House Speaker Paul Ryan had received nearly $500,000 in campaign contributions from the wealthy conservative donor Charles Koch and his wife after the tax bill passed.", "Readers also asked us about those contributions, which are indeed real.", "Charles and Elizabeth Koch each gave $247,700 to Ryan\u2019s political action committee, Team Ryan, for a total of $495,400 on Nov. 29. That was just a couple of weeks after the House passed its version of the tax bill.", "That amount isn\u2019t unusual, though. Koch \u2014 who is the chairman and CEO of Koch Industries, which owns companies in a variety of industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and biofuels \u2014 and his wife gave almost the exact same amount to Team Ryan in 2016. In March of that year, they each gave $244,200 \u2014 a total of $488,400.", "There is no evidence that the Kochs\u2019 donations were related to the passage of the tax bill.", "Mark Shtrakhman contributed to this story.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Sources", "U.S. Senate. \u201cS. 2193, a bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to increase penalties for individuals who illegally reenter the United States after being removed and for other purposes.\u201d As introduced 21 Oct 2015.", "Nakamura, David and O\u2019Keefe, Ed. \u201cTimeline: The rise and fall of immigration reform.\u201d The Washington Post. 26 Jun 2014.", "U.S. Senate. \u201cS. 744, Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.\u201d As passed the Senate 27 Jun 2013.", "Prokop, Andrew. \u201c7 questions about the government shutdown you were too embarrassed to ask.\u201d Vox. 22 Jan 2018.", "Robertson, Lori. \u201cThe Facts on DACA.\u201d FactCheck.org. 22 Jan 2018.", "Sessions, Jeff. \u201cAttorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks on DACA.\u201d Department of Justice. 5 Sep 2017.", "\u201cUPDATE: Charles Schumer Received $500k Donation From Pro-Illegal Alien Group Just Before Vote.\u201d thelastlineofdefense.online. 20 Jan 2018.", "Papenfuss, Mary. \u201cPaul Ryan Collected $500,000 In Koch Contributions Days After House Passed Tax Law.\u201d 20 Jan 2018.", "Itemized receipts \u2014 Team Ryan.
