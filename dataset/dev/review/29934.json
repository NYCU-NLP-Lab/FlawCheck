["Republican Leah Vukmir's U.S. Senate campaign produced this image depicting Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, mastermind of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Vukmir later made a claim related to the pair that we're fact checking.", "Does U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin have so much more concern for a 9/11 terrorist, compared to the president\u2019s nominee to run the CIA, that she would vote against the nominee?", "It\u2019s an attack that appears to question the Wisconsin Democrat\u2019s patriotism.", "And if it\u2019s correct, where is the evidence?", "The claim was made by Leah Vukmir, who is vying with fellow Republican Kevin Nicholson for the chance to run against Baldwin in November 2018.", "As stated, Vukmir\u2019s claim draws a conclusion based on what is publicly known about Baldwin\u2019s stance toward Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the Sept 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.", "Let\u2019s examine if the evidence matches the rhetoric.", "Like us on Facebook.

And she\u2018s more worried about those individuals than to support a very strong woman with a track record to be the head of the CIA.", "No evidence", "When Vukmir did the interview, it was expected that Baldwin would ultimately oppose Haspel. But Baldwin had not yet said whether she would vote for or against the nominee, who needs Senate confirmation to become CIA director. (Three days after the interview, Baldwin announced she'll vote against the nomination.)", "In any case, Baldwin\u2019s support or opposition to Haspel is not what we\u2019re fact checking here.", "When we asked Vukmir\u2019s campaign staff for evidence to support Vukmir\u2019s claim that Baldwin is \"more worried\" about Mohammed than supporting Haspel, it was lacking.", "Latest fact checks on the Senate candidates:", "Baldwin: 97 percent of gun owners support universal background checks.

Mohammed had been captured in 2003 and tortured by the CIA. But it is not known whether Haspel was involved, directly or indirectly, in his torture, according to the article.", "Haspel has since declared that the agency should not have undertaken its interrogation program in which al Qaeda detainees were tortured after the Sept. 11 attacks, and is likely to be confirmed by the Senate, according to another Times news article.", "The article did not even mention Baldwin -- much less provide any evidence that Baldwin had any concern for Mohammed.", "About Baldwin", "For her part, when asked the day after Vukmir\u2019s interview about Haspel and Vukmir\u2019s \"Terrorist Team\" attack, Baldwin said on MSNBC she was on a \"third iteration\" of attempts to meet with Haspel.", "Two other points are worth noting:", "Baldwin did not call for Mohammed\u2019s testimony to be allowed by the Senate Intelligence Committee.
