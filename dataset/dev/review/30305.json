["About this rating", "White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that it was natural for some World War II veterans to feel \"embittered\" about the Prime Minister of Japan's planned visit to Pearl Harbor, but that he believed a trait of the \"Greatest Generation\" included the ability to place patriotism over personal feelings.", "Earnest neither said nor insinuated WWII veterans should \"get over it\" regarding the attack on Pearl Harbor.", "After the Obama Administration's 5 December 2016 daily press briefing, reports insinuated that White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that World War II veterans offended by Japan's Prime Minister visiting the memorial site ought to \"get over it\":", "White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during a press conference Monday it was natural for World War II veterans to be \u201cembittered\u201d about Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s visit to Pearl Harbor, but they should get over it for the sake of America.", "The phrase \"get over it\" appeared in multiple articles about Earnest's 5 December 2016 remarks regarding Pearl Harbor:", "WH press secretary says WWII veterans should get over their \u2018bitterness\u2019 about Pearl Harbor attack", "White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that it\u2019s natural for World War II veterans to feel \u201cpersonally embittered\u201d by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s impending visit to Pearl Harbor, but they should get over it.", "As is standard, a full transcript of the 5 December 2016 White House Press briefing was available online. During the event, reporters discussed a news story about Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's planned visit to the memorial in Hawaii on 26 and 27 December 2016, making him the first leader of Japan to visit the site of the attack:", "The joint trip comes after Obama went to Hiroshima with Abe in May, making him the first sitting American president to visit the city where the United States dropped the first of two atomic bombs in 1945 to force Japan\u2019s surrender.", "Abe said Monday that he will visit Hawaii on Dec. 26 and 27 to \u201cpay tribute\u201d to military personnel from both sides of the Pacific who died during the war. About 2,000 Americans were killed in the Pearl Harbor attack.", "\u201cThis visit is to comfort the souls of the victims. We\u2019d like to send messages about the importance of reconciliation\u201d between the two countries, Abe told reporters in Tokyo.", "During the briefing a reporter said that Japan had no plans to apologize for the attack, then asking:", "Josh, when the Prime Minister from Japan comes to the Pearl Harbor Memorial -- one of the reasons this hasn\u2019t happened for so long is the Japanese don\u2019t feel that they have anything to apologize for generally. They feel that the attack grew out of the oil embargo and all this. So how are veterans\u2019 groups going to react with Abe showing up and just sort of bowing but no apology? Is there not going to be an apology? And how do you think that\u2019s going to play in the United States? Because from the United States\u2019 point of view, of course, the Pearl Harbor attack was completely unjustified and a total surprise, and an act of total violence and war that was, from our perspective -- there is no justification for it whatsoever.", "So, I mean, this was obviously a problem when the President went to Hiroshima -- there were people in Japan who believed the United States shouldn\u2019t have dropped the atomic weapon; we don\u2019t feel that way. So how is this going to play out?", "Earnest responded:", "Well, listen, I don\u2019t want to prejudge at this point what Prime Minister Abe may choose to say when he visits Pearl Harbor. I think that most Americans would warmly receive the sentiment that he expressed in his statement earlier today. He indicated that he will visit Pearl Harbor, together with President Obama, to \u201cmourn the souls of the victims.\u201d He continued saying, \u201cI would like to express my resolve toward the future that the tragedy of wars should never be repeated again. At the same time, I\u2019m hoping to make it an opportunity to send out a message about the value of reconciliation between Japan and the United States.\u201d", "So again, I think the kind of sentiment that\u2019s being expressed by the Prime Minister of Japan is one that would be warmly received by most Americans. But, obviously, the benefits of a visit like this is it displays the kind of opportunity that lies for America\u2019s future, that lies ahead.", "Not long ago, within the lifetime of many Americans, the United States and Japan were at war. And hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of our citizens were killed in that war. And 70 years later, the United States and Japan actually have formed an alliance that has benefitted both our countries and our national security and our economy. And I think this visit further underscores the benefits of pursuing peace and reconciliation.", "The reporter followed up with a second question:", "But you don\u2019t think people are going to sort of see the guy coming from a country that caused the deaths to occur saying simply, well, we\u2019ll mourn the deaths but I\u2019m not going to say that I even feel bad about causing the deaths?", "It was Earnest's second response which generated the \"get over it\" claims:", "Listen, I can\u2019t speak for every single American and how they will respond to or react to this particular situation. If I were a World War II veteran who was drafted by the United States military to go and fight for our country overseas in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, I might feel quite embittered. And I think it would be a perfectly natural and understandable human reaction to not be particularly satisfied with the words of the Japanese Prime Minister.", "But I think the thing that we know about the Greatest Generation of Americans is they\u2019re anything -- well, let me say it this way. This Greatest Generation of Americans, I think we take a risk if we underestimate their patriotism and their capacity to set aside their own personal interests and prioritize the ambition and opportunity of the American people.", "And so, yes, there may be some who feel personally embittered. But I\u2019m confident that many will set aside their own personal bitterness, not because they\u2019re personally satisfied by the words of the Prime Minister, but because they recognize how important this moment is for the United States. And that\u2019s certainly why they qualify to be described as the greatest generation.", "Josh Earnest did use the phrases \"embittered\" and \"bitterness\" in his response, but he did not say or suggest WWII veterans ought to \"get over\" Pearl Harbor (or anything else). Earnest did say that the \"Greatest Generation\" ought to never be underestimated in terms of their patriotism and love for the United States. \u00a0Multiple web sites used the \"get over it\" phrasing metaphorically, but rumors rapidly appeared claiming Earnest literally made those comments.", "Fifield, Anna. \u00a0 \"Japanese Prime Minister Plans Landmark Visit To Pearl Harbor.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Washington Post. \u00a0 5 December 2016.", "The White House Office Of The Press Secretary. \u00a0 \"Press Briefing By Press Secretary Josh Earnest, 12/5/16.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 publication date \u00a0 5 December 2016.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
