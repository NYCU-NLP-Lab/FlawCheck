["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "The cast members of the \"Jersey Shore\" may live by three words -- gym, tan, laundry -- but Chris Christie has just one to describe their show: bad.\n\nThe New Jersey governor in a recent radio interview slammed the MTV show, repeating one of his favorite criticisms of its cast. The roommates in the Seaside Heights beach house aren\u2019t from New Jersey.\n\n\"Here's the deal, let's remember something for the people who are listening in your audience, these 'Jersey Shore' folks, they're from New York,\" Christie said Wednesday on 77 WABC\u2019s \u2018The Joe Crummey Show\u2019. \"They parachute these New Yorkers into Seaside Heights, New Jersey, and they try to make the whole country think this is New Jersey. It's not. It's bad for New Jersey. It's bad ... because it's a mischaracterization of who the people are here in New Jersey and so I've said all along that I think \u2018Jersey Shore\u2019 is bad.\"\n\nChristie last month vetoed a $420,000 tax credit -- dubbed the \"Snooki subsidy\" -- for the MTV show, saying the program \"does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the State and its citizens.\"\n\nThere are eight fist-pumping housemates who are the target of Christie\u2019s scorn.\n\nOf them, two are New Jersey natives, PolitiFact New Jersey found.\n\nSamantha Giancola, or Sammi, and Deena Nicole Cortese were born and raised in New Jersey. Giancola hails from Hazlet and attended William Paterson University, where she was a midfielder on the women\u2019s soccer team.\n\nCortese is from New Egypt and attended Brookdale Community College in Lincroft. She joined the cast in season three, replacing Staten Island, N.Y.-native Angelina Pivarnick.\n\nFive of the six other cast members are New York natives.\n\nMike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino was born in Staten Island but grew up in Manalapan. His publicist said Sorrentino still lives in New Jersey, but he also conducts business in Miami. Jenni \"JWoww\" Farley also grew up in New York, but now lives within Jersey\u2019s borders, according to an MTV spokesperson.\n\nVinny Guadagnino, Ronnie Magro and Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi are from New York. Rhode Island-native Paul DelVecchio is the only cast member from outside the tri-state area.\n\nAn MTV spokesperson declined to comment on Christie\u2019s remarks. But Polizzi spoke with The Star-Ledger in August.\n\n\"It\u2019s the 'Jersey Shore.' We\u2019re not trying to represent Jersey,\" she said then. \"Even if you\u2019re from Africa, you\u2019re gonna come here.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe governor said the cast members of the \"Jersey Shore\" are from New York and misrepresent \"who the people are here in New Jersey.\"\n\nSammi and Deena are true Jersey girls -- born and raised. \"The Situation\" was born in New York, but grew up and still lives in New Jersey. We think he deserves some Jersey cred.\n\nFour New Yorkers -- one of whom, \"JWoww,\" \u00a0has since moved to New Jersey -- and a Rhode Island-native round out the rest of the crew. \u00a0\n\nWe rate Christie\u2019s statement Half True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "77W ABC Radio, The Joe Crummey Show, Oct. 19, 2011\n\nMTV, \"Jersey Shore\" Cast, accessed Oct. 19, 2011\n\nThe Star-Ledger, Gov.
