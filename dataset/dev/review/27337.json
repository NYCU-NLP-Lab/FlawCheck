What he proposes in lieu of reparations \u2014 job creation, investment in cities, and free higher education \u2014 is well within the Overton window, and his platform on race echoes Democratic orthodoxy.\"", "Meet the Press host Chuck Todd followed up with Sanders about Coates\u2019 column Jan. 24, asking, \"Why aren't you for reparations because of slavery for African-Americans when you're calling for economic justice on so many other levels? Why do you stop short on that issue?\"", "\"Well, for the same reason that Barack Obama has and the same reason, I believe, that Hillary Clinton has,\" Sanders responded. \"And that is, it is absolutely wrong and unacceptable that we have so much poverty in this country and it is even worse in the African-American community.\"", "Todd chided Sanders for not answering the question, but Sanders again deflected that it was for the same reasons as Obama and Clinton.", "Is it true that his position against reparations is the same as Clinton and Obama\u2019s views?", "Sanders is right that Obama\u2019s opposition echoes his own.

Second of all, I think it would be very divisive. The real issue is when we look at the poverty rate among the African-American community, when we look at the high unemployment rate within the African-American community, we have a lot of work to do.", "\"So I think what we should be talking about is making massive investments in rebuilding our cities, in creating millions of decent paying jobs, in making public colleges and universities tuition-free, basically targeting our federal resources to the areas where it is needed the most, and where it is needed the most is in impoverished communities, often African-American and Latino.\"", "On Meet the Press, Sanders pretty much dropped the pragmatism argument (though he pushed back on the notion that his economic proposals are politically impossible) and focused instead on the second part of his rationale about improving economic conditions and schools for minorities.", "So how does this mirror, if at all, the approach by Obama and Clinton?", "Obama\u2019s opposition", "In 2007 and 2008, then-presidential candidate Obama voiced his opposition to reparations, arguing that the best way to amend for the past is to focus on the present and future.", "\"I think the reparations we need right here in South Carolina is investment, for example, in our schools,\" Obama said in a July 2007 CNN debate.", "Obama couched his opposition somewhat differently in a 2007 NAACP presidential questionnaire. He said that \"nothing, including reparations, can fully compensate\" for the stain of slavery before arguing that reparations could lead to negligence on other matters of racial injustices:", "\"I fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say 'we\u2019ve paid our debt'\u00a0and to avoid the much harder work of enforcing our anti-discrimination laws in employment and housing; the much harder work of making sure that our schools are not separate and unequal; the much harder work of providing job training programs and rehabilitating young men coming out of prison every year; and the much harder work of lifting 37 million Americans of all races out of poverty.", "\"These challenges will not go away with reparations. So while I applaud and agree with the underlying sentiment of recognizing the continued legacy of slavery, I would prefer to focus on the issues that will directly address these problems \u2013 and building a consensus to do just that.\"", "Obama explains he will not pursue reparations because the action could be used as an excuse not to work on other lingering problems for minorities.

And I am absolutely committed to that. There are some good ideas out there. There\u2019s an idea in the Congressional Black Caucus about really targeting federal dollars to communities that have had either disinvestment or no investment, and have had years of being below the poverty level. That\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019d like us to focus on and really help lift people up.\"", "In October 2015, she provided a similar response when asked by the hosts of the BuzzFeed podcast \"Another Round\":", "\"I\u2019ll tell you what, I think we need to make many more investments in everything from pre-school education to affordable housing, that\u2019s my form of trying to give people the chance to be empowered, to make the most out of their God-given potential.\"", "As Fusion pointed out, this was largely Clinton\u2019s answer in 2000 as well.
