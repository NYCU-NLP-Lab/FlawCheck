Rick Scott gives the opening remarks during Rick Scott's Economic Growth Summit in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., on June 2, 2015. (AP Photo)", "Gov. Rick Scott says that Florida has invested big bucks in the environment.", "As he boasted about the state\u2019s record during his economic summit for GOP presidential contenders in Orlando June 2, Scott reeled off a bunch of statistics about Florida\u2019s budget and economy including this one: \"If you care about the environment, we've got record funding.\"", "Scott\u2019s record on the environment has been scrutinized since he first ran for office in 2010. Since that time, news reports detailed how state officials under his watch have been banned from using terms such as \"climate change,\" \u00a0environmental fines have nosedived, and Scott has boasted about reducing the number of days to get an environmental permit.", "But despite that record, does Florida now have \"record funding\" for the environment? No, it doesn\u2019t.", "Everglades and springs funding", "Scott\u2019s spokesman pointed us to his proposals to increase funding for springs restoration and for preserving the Everglades.", "During his re-election campaign in 2014, Scott promised to propose a $500 million plan over 10 years to restore springs. The 2013 budget included $10 million for springs, and the 2014 the budget included $30 million. In his budget proposal for 2015-16, Scott recommended $50 million.", "As for the Everglades, the state reached an agreement in 2012 with the federal government to end a dispute that predates Scott. Over 13 years, the state will spend $880 million on Everglades cleanup, or about $32 million a year.", "In 2014 the Legislature increased Everglades restoration funding to $169 million, more than double the previous year\u2019s total. The Legislature also earmarked $90 million for raising 2.6 miles of the Tamiami Trail to let the Everglades flow more freely beneath it. That brought the total amount during that session to $259 million.", "\"The one place where he did step up was on the Everglades,\" said Frank Jackalone, Sierra Club\u2019s Senior Organizing Manager in Florida. \"It was the environmental highlight of his term as governor.\"", "But where Scott has fallen short on the Everglades is acquiring U.S. Sugar land south of Lake Okeechobee, Jackalone said. A deal in the works for the state to buy about 46,000 acres fell apart earlier this year.", "Department of Environmental Protection", "While Everglades and springs restoration are important parts of environmental funding, they don\u2019t provide a complete picture.", "If we look back a decade at funding for the Department of Environmental Protection, the high point was $2.9 billion in 2006-07 under then Gov. Jeb Bush. DEP is tasked with protecting air, water and land. Under Scott, DEP\u2019s budget peaked at $1.8 billion in 2011-12.", "In 2006-07, the state used an extra $310 million (on top of Florida Forever\u2019s usual $300 million land-buying program) to purchase Babcock Ranch, 73,000 acres of cypress domes and pine forests in Charlotte and Lee counties.", "DEP\u2019s budget was also in the $2 billion range part of the time under the next governor, Charlie Crist. But once the recession kicked in, DEP\u2019s budget decreased.", "This year, the total budget is $1.56 billion, and for next year Scott proposed a budget of about $1.53 billion -- $29 million less than the current year. (You can see the year-by-year DEP funding and caveats including that it combines state and federal dollars.)", "What Scott omits", "There have been several other cuts related to the environment under Scott:", "\"Record funding\" for the environment has become a talking point for Scott. But after we rated a similar claim False in 2014, he tweaked his message to talk specifically about \"record funding\" for springs. On the national stage surrounded by presidential contenders in May, he went back to talking about record funding generically for the environment.", "But environmentalists say he doesn\u2019t hold a record for overall environmental funding.", "\"He cut back services to DEP, he cut back funding to various water management districts in state, he hasn\u2019t done what needs to be done to acquire sugar land south of Okeechobee to finish Everglades restoration,\" Jackalone said. Also, \"he cut back on environmental enforcement.\"", "Our ruling", "Scott said, \"If you care about the environment, we've got record funding.\"", "Scott's team points to investments the state has made to restore the Everglades and springs during Scott\u2019s tenure -- and he has championed both.", "While those are high-profile projects, he claimed that Florida has \"record funding\" for the environment overall, and that\u2019s not the case. The budget for the state Department of Environmental Protection and for Florida Forever were not a record under Scott -- two major pots of money that relate to the environment.", "Scott repeated a previously debunked claim in a national forum; his statement has long been proved incorrect.
