He is Amir Ayad, a Coptic Christian who, according to reports, was beaten by Islamic hardliners in 2013 in the Egyptian capital city of Cairo. Ayad was featured in several news stories about the incident, a riot in which members of the Muslim Brotherhood and their opponents clashed on 22 March 2013 near the Brotherhood's headquarters in Cairo.", "A reporter from Mideast Christian News (MCN), an agency that covers the Copts and other Christian minority communities in the Middle East, took the photograph of Ayad as he was recovering in a hospital. The MCN report and photograph was subsequently used by Fox News for their story on the incident.

A reporter for the Brotherhood's party newspaper, Mustafa el-Khatib, told the AP he was seized and carried by his arms and legs into the mosque and beaten.", "\"You sheep, we'll show you,\" his tormentors shouted, using a term many protesters use against Islamists they see as blindly following their leaders, el-Khatib told the AP.

These sites have American-sounding domain names such as WorldPoliticus.com, TrumpVision365.com, USConservativeToday.com, DonaldTrumpNews.co, and USADailyPolitics.com. They almost all publish aggressively pro-Trump content aimed at conservatives and Trump supporters in the US.", "The young Macedonians who run these sites say they don't care about Donald Trump.

The fraction-of-a-penny-per-click of US display advertising \u2014 a declining market for American publishers \u2014 goes a long way in Veles. Several teens and young men who run these sites told BuzzFeed News that they learned the best way to generate traffic is to get their politics stories to spread on Facebook \u2014 and the best way to generate shares on Facebook is to publish sensationalist and often false content that caters to Trump supporters.", "Despite the fact the story is completely fake, it was shared by numerous Facebook users, often with vengeful, misspelled comments like, \"He is a pig monster America should cut off his winnie\" and \"No, I do not support this . They should have beheaded him, then sent him back to where he can from.\"", "Ironically, before it was employed by RedInfo.com, Ayad's story and image in the hospital bed had been circulated in 2013 by numerous far-right and anti-Muslim blogs like BareNakedIslam.com and GatewayPundit.com to drum up anti-Muslim sentiment against his attackers.", "Fox News.\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0\"Egyptian Mosque Turned Into House of Torture for Christians After Muslim Brotherhood Protest.\" \u00a0\u00a0 26 March 2013.", "Mideast Christian News.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Amir Ayad: I Was Arrested in an Ambush Set Up By the Brotherhood and Tortured in a Mosque in Moqattam.\" \u00a0\u00a0 23 March 2013.", "Silverman, Craig, and Alexander, Lawrence. \u00a0 \"How Teens in the Balkans Are Duping Trump Supporters With Fake News.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0BuzzFeed News.\u00a0 \u00a03 November 2016.", "Subramanian, Samantha. \u00a0 \"Inside the\u00a0Macedonian\u00a0Fake-News\u00a0Complex.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Wired. \u00a0 15 February 2017.", "Michael, Maggie, and El Deeb, Sarah. \u00a0 \"Since Fierce Clash, Egypt's Crisis Takes New Turn.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The Associated Press.\u00a0 \u00a03 April 2013.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
