["\u201cThis incredible photo marks the end of Matador Torero Alvaro Munera\u2019s career,\u201d reads the caption of a photo shared tens of thousands of times in several languages.", "The image depicts a man sitting down, head lowered, one hand on his temple, as though he were realizing something. Facing him a couple feet away is a bull looking at the torero, a few banderillas, or bullfighting spikes, sticking out of its back.", "The caption also attributes a quote to Munera, in reference to scene captured in the photo. \u201cAnd suddenly I looked at the bull. He had this innocence that all animals have in their eyes, and he looked at me with this pleading.\u201d", "The post was shared tens of thousands of times in English, French, Spanish, Italian, and more over the past decade.", "Munera, also known as El Pilarico, was a famous Colombian matador who was injured by a bull in the arena in 1984, after which he began to promote anti-bullfighting campaigns.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not me and that\u2019s not what happened to me,\u201d Munera told AFP in Spanish.", "\u201cI left the world of bullfighting due to an accident that left me in a wheelchair.\u201d", "Part of the quotation presented in the posts also exists, but it is out of context. The part of it that describes the bull\u2019s eyes was published in Spanish newspaper El Pais, on July 30, 1995, well after Munera retired.", "It appeared in an excerpt named \u201cThe inhuman race,\u201d from the book La Casa Sosegada by Spanish writer Antonio Gala, available on page 23 of this document. This translation reads \u201cAll of a sudden, the bull, his eyes innocent and imploring, stared at me.\u201d", "The photo is real, but the reality is far from what the caption suggests. The bullfighter in the photo is performing a desplante, a common move in bullfighting in which the matador asserts his dominance over the bull by deliberately placing himself in a dangerous position. The emotion of the scene is defiance, not contrition.", "Three sources told AFP that the man in the photo is Francisco Javier Sanchez Vara, a famous Spanish bullfighter.", "Upon seeing the photo, Vara\u2019s former manager, Cesar Sanchez de Castro, told AFP, \u201cYes, it\u2019s Javi (a nickname for Javier).\u201d", "Veronica Dominguez, a Spanish photographer specialized in corrida (herself the daughter of famous matador Paco Dominguez), also confirmed to AFP that it was \u201cSanchez Vara, without a doubt.\u201d She based her assessment on experience she said allows photographers in the taurine arts recognize the silhouettes, hair, and gestures of matadors without having to see faces.", "Munera told AFP, \u201cI understand the person in the photo is a bullfighter whose last name is Sanchez Vara.\u201d", "Several media who debunked the photo in the past have also suggested this.", "The presentation of this photo is deceitful. As Munera confirmed, he is not the man in the image. He now sits on Medellin\u2019s municipal council, while Sanchez Vara, presumably the man in the photo, continues his career as a matador.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
