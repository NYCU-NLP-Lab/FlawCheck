Dan Forest, a Republican who\u2019s running against Cooper, says kids should be allowed to go to school. Currently, students in kindergarten through 12th grade are only allowed to attend in-person classes in some counties \u2014 and only at a reduced capacity.", "In an interview posted Sept. 2, Forest said Cooper\u2019s restrictions on in-person learning aren\u2019t necessary.", "\"There\u2019s no evidence anywhere in the world that our kids should not be in schools. There\u2019s no evidence of that anywhere.

Forest spokesman Andrew Dunn pointed to a recent editorial from the Wall Street Journal.", "Citing analysis from The Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a think tank, the Journal wrote:", "\"Fatality rate comparisons between Covid-19 and the flu are inapt because they affect populations differently.

The Journal mentioned deaths, and Forest has repeatedly said \"ill effects.\" By doing this, Forest downplays the risk to children.", "The flu appears to be more of a serious threat to children than the novel coronavirus, as PolitiFact reported in August and September. But the CDC hasn\u2019t said how much higher the risk is for the flu.", "And the CDC\u2019s website distinguishes between healthy children and those with pre-existing conditions.", "For healthy children, the risk of complications \"is higher for flu compared to COVID-19,\" the CDC said. Meanwhile, kids with underlying medical conditions \"are at increased risk for both flu and COVID-19.\"", "The term \"ill effects\" is squishy and vague. Let\u2019s look at how many children have been hospitalized by the two illnesses. (PolitiFact Wisconsin reported these figures in its Sept. 8 fact-check of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson.)", "During the 2018-19 flu season, the hospitalization rate among children 5 to 17 was 39.2 children per 100,000 children.", "For COVID-19 patients in that age group, the CDC says the hospitalization rate is 6 per 100,000 children.

Schroeder said he hesitates to put a number on the likelihood of children suffering from the flu more than COVID-19.", "\"The notion that kids aren\u2019t getting really sick is by and large true. But the disparities between influenza and COVID-19 have narrowed considerably,\" he said.", "Schroeder noted that, generally speaking, between 100 and 200 children die each year from the flu in the U.S. (And those deaths occurred at times when the nation isn\u2019t limiting travel or practicing social distancing.)", "Meanwhile, with the novel coronavirus in the U.S. for less than a year, the number of pediatric deaths is still rising.", "As of Sept. 10, the CDC estimated that 62 children, from infants up to age 14, have died from COVID-19. In the CDC\u2019s 15-24 age bracket, coronavirus has killed another 315 people. Researchers think school cancellations this spring prevented up to even more deaths.", "The American Academy of Pediatrics estimated that COVID-19 had killed 90 people under age 20 by mid August.", "\"They\u2019re really oversimplifying the issues at hand,\" Schroeder said of Forest\u2019s quote.
