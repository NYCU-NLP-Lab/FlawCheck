["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Perhaps the loudest voice in opposition to a Tommy Thompson candidacy for the U.S. Senate has been the conservative Club for Growth. The national anti-tax group has repeatedly accused him of spending too much as Wisconsin\u2019s governor and later supporting President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform.\n\nThompson, a Republican who has said he will run in 2012 for the seat being vacated by Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl, was asked about the criticism on the ABC News \"TopLine\" program on Sept. 12, 2011.\n\nThompson called the national Club for Growth\u2019s accusations -- made in statements, in an online ad and in a national TV ad -- false. Then he mentioned Club for Growth Wisconsin, saying:\n\n\"It\u2019s nice to point out that the state Club for Growth, the people in the state of Wisconsin, have endorsed me and support me and say that the national Club for Growth is just plain wrong in their assertions and accusations.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve already rated Half True the national Club for Growth\u2019s claim that Thompson, who left the governor\u2019s office in 2001 to serve as President George W. Bush\u2019s health and human services secretary, supported what Republicans dubbed \"Obamacare.\"\n\nWhat struck us about the ABC interview was Thompson\u2019s claim that Club for Growth Wisconsin had endorsed him.\n\nThat\u2019s because a statement issued two weeks before Thompson\u2019s interview by Club for Growth Wisconsin, which was founded in 2004, said the state group \"shares the same economic agenda\" as the national group, but is \"a completely independent and separate organization.\"\n\nThe statement also said that under its charter, Club for Growth Wisconsin \"takes no position\" on federal candidates: \"We do NOT get involved in federal elections.\"\n\n(Conversely, the national Club for Growth says it endorses only federal candidates.)\n\nWe asked Darrin Schmitz, a spokesman for Thompson\u2019s campaign, about Thompson\u2019s claim of being endorsed by Club for Growth Wisconsin.\n\nSchmitz said Thompson was referring to an endorsement from Terry and Mary Kohler, who Schmitz said are founding members of Club for Growth Wisconsin. He argued Thompson clarified his remark when he said \"the people\" endorsed him because that was a reference to the Kohlers as founding members of the state group.\n\nHmmm.\n\nThompson said \"the people of Wisconsin,\" not people associated with Club for Growth Wisconsin. He didn\u2019t announce the Kohlers\u2019 endorsement until three days after the ABC interview. And an endorsement by individual members of a group -- however influential -- is not the same as an endorsement by the group itself.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Club for Growth Wisconsin doesn\u2019t even endorse in federal races.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nIn trying to fend off criticism from the national Club for Growth, Thompson told a national TV audience he has been endorsed by Club for Growth Wisconsin in his U.S. Senate bid.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been. And, under the group\u2019s charter, couldn\u2019t be.\n\nWe rate Thompson\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.", "ABC-TV, Tommy Thompson interview, Sept. 12, 2011\n\nClub for Growth Wisconsin, \"Neumann vs Thompson\" statement, Aug. 31, 2011\n\nClub for Growth Wisconsin, statement about national Club for Growth statement about Thompson, May 18, 2011\n\nWisPolitics.com, Thompson for Senate campaign news release on Terry and Mary Kohler endorsement, Sept. 15, 2011\n\nEmail interview, Club for Growth Wisconsin spokesman R.J.
