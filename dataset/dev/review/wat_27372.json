The girl and her mother were inside the restroom separated by stalls around 1:15 p.m.", "Police say 33-year-old Reese Hartstirn walked in and targeted the girl, choking her and trying to lock her in a stall.

In both incidents, a male assailant entered a women's restroom without permission, and engaged in activities already prohibited under law.\u00a0\u00a0Similar incidents\u00a0took place\u00a0at least twice\u00a0in 2011, again in 2012, and\u00a0three\u00a0more\u00a0times in 2013. In those\u00a0cases, all\u00a0incidents remained newsworthy because filming people in bathrooms without their knowledge or consent is\u00a0illegal.
