["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on September 17, 2018 | Updated on September 17, 2018", "Q: Did WikiLeaks release an email showing that Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign bribed prominent Republicans to oppose Donald Trump during the 2016 election?", "A: No. That email was fabricated by a self-described satirical website. It was later amplified by Sean Hannity and published by other websites.", "Two years ago, a self-proclaimed satirical website made up a politically charged email and claimed that it had been released by WikiLeaks. That fictitious email is still circulating online, and it\u2019s being presented as though it is real.", "It originated on Dec. 7, 2016, on a website called\u00a0America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which describes its content as satire aimed at provoking conservatives. Six days later, the phony email was copied and included in a story on a prominent partisan site, the Conservative Daily Post. Two days after that, conservative commentator Sean Hannity read the made-up email\u00a0on his radio show, saying if true it \u201ccould shake up the political world.\u201d", "Since then, the invented email has been copied by popular, but unreliable, websites like Yournewswire.com and the now-defunct\u00a0Freedom Daily.", "And it\u2019s still making headlines on dubious websites, such as the Columbus Post. The story on that site has been shared on 29 different Facebook pages since it was posted on Sept. 2.", "The claims made in the stories that cite the phony email have morphed over the years, but the text of the email has stayed the same.", "When America\u2019s Last Line of Defense originally posted the story, it had a headline that said: \u201cWikileaks Latest: Podesta Emails Show 3 PROMINENT Republicans On Clinton Payroll.\u201d", "But that claim has changed as the story has circulated online. For example, the headline on the Columbus Post says: \u201cWikileaks Huge Exposure: These Are The Six Republicans That Hillary Had Bribed To \u2018Destroy Trump\u2019!\u201d", "The email was supposedly sent from John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, to longtime Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, and it references the initials of Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, and John Kasich \u2014 all of whom sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.", "America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, Dec. 7, 2016: According to the email: \u201cJB, CF, and JK PACS will be noticeably silent for the rest of the campaign. Each will receive a significant allowance from advertising budget. HRC is in the loop and has talked to all three personally. Eyes only.\u201d", "The story claims that the email is \u201cdocument number 1078645\u201d on the WikiLeaks website. But that document number corresponds to a real 2009 email that was included in a release of files from an intelligence company called Stratfor. It has nothing to do with the 2016 presidential election.", "A search of Podesta\u2019s hacked emails, which WikiLeaks posted on Oct. 7, 2016, turns up no results for the bogus email.", "Also, the original story claimed that the email was sent in July 2016, but by that time all three of those GOP presidential contenders had dropped out of the race. Fiorina dropped out on Feb. 10, 2016, Bush withdrew on Feb. 20, 2016, and Kasich dropped out on May 4, 2016.", "Updated, Sept. 17: Yournewswire.com retracted its story, which it acknowledged was false. \u201cThe email was fabricated by a self-described satirical website,\u201d it said in a note to readers.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cWikileaks Latest: Podesta Emails Show 3 PROMINENT Republicans On Clinton Payroll.\u201d Thelastlineofdefense.org. 7 Dec 2016.", "Cole, Michael. \u201c6 Republicans May Have Taken Payments From Clinton Team To Damage Trump (New Wiki Leak).\u201d Conservative Daily Post. 13 Dec 2016.", "Conservative Citizen. \u201cJulian Assange on The Sean Hannity Radio Show (12/15/2016).\u201d Youtube.com. 25 May 2018.", "\u201cWikileaks Huge Exposure: These Are The Six Republicans That Hillary Had Bribed To \u2018Destroy Trump\u2019!\u201d Columbuspost.site. 2 Sep 2018.", "WikiLeaks.
