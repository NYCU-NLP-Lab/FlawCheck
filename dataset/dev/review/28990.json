["Unemployment rates have been closely watched as the U.S. economy slowly recovers from pandemic-induced job losses.", "One viral social media post claims that some states have the highest unemployment rates because they\u2019re run by Democratic governors.", "The post lists Hawaii, Nevada, California, Colorado and New York as the states with the highest unemployment rates, ranging from 9.3% to 8.2%.", "The states with the lowest unemployment rates are Nebraska, South\u00a0Dakota, Iowa, Vermont and Utah, ranging from 3% to 3.6%, according to the post. The post notes that these states all have Republican governors.", "The post has been shared 1,700 times. USA TODAY has reached out to the user for comment.", "More:Fact check: Richard and Mildred Loving were convicted of interracial marriage in 1959", "The post correctly notes the political affiliation of governors for those 10 states.\u00a0And the figures listed are accurate numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0for December.", "But economists say the post lacks context.", "\u201cThe numbers are correct, but they have nothing to do with Democratic vs. Republican governors,\u201d Sang-Hyop Lee, an economics professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, told USA TODAY via email.", "Comparing jobless rates during the pandemic can be misleading, Lee said. Hawaii\u2019s unemployment rate was one of the lowest in the U.S., at 2.7% in December 2019. Nevada had an unemployment rate of 3.7%, and\u00a0Colorado\u00a0had an unemployment rate of 2.5%, according to the BLS.", "More:Fact check: Old claim linking politicians' sons to Ukraine is partly false", "In comparison, Nebraska\u2019s unemployment rate was at 3% in December 2019. South Dakota\u2019s unemployment rate stood at 3.4% \u2014 higher than Hawaii's but lower than Nevada's.", "State economies also vary, making it difficult to draw comparisons.", "Hawaii, for example, has a robust tourist economy that has suffered because fewer people are traveling during the pandemic. Visitor arrivals to the islands in July 2020 dropped by nearly 98% compared with the same month in 2019, the Associated Press reported.", "\u201cDue to its heavy economic reliance on tourism, Hawaii's unemployment rocketed in 2020,\u201d Lee said.", "Other states, like Nebraska, rely less on tourism and have not been similarly impacted by reduced travel, said Christopher Mann, an economics professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.", "\u201cNot as many people are coming to visit, for example, in Nebraska than in New York,\u201d Mann said.", "More:Fact check: Wyoming House bill would charge drivers for each mile traveled on its roads", "The claim that several states with Democratic governors have higher unemployment rates than states with Republican governors is MISSING CONTEXT, based on our research. Jobless rates have been significantly impacted by the pandemic, related to the economy of each state, rather than the politics of leadership.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
