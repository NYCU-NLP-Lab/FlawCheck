Jennifer Beck says.\n\nAbout 18 months after Gov. Chris Christie terminated the Access to the Region\u2019s Core project \u2014 better known as the ARC project \u2014 the proposal returned to the headlines last week with the release of an report on the project\u2019s history.\n\nIn an April 11 interview on NJToday, Beck (R-Monmouth) pointed out how federal officials estimated the cost of the project, which would have linked Secaucus to a new rail station deep under West 34th Street in Manhattan, could climb to between $10 billion and $13 billion.\n\n\"The project was originally estimated to be $8.7 billion, and New Jersey alone was on the hook for all overruns,\" she said.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey discovered Beck is right. Based on a federal rule for such projects, New Jersey would have been responsible for cost increases beyond the $8.7 billion budget, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation said.\n\nBeck said it didn\u2019t seem equitable that New York officials wouldn\u2019t contribute anything.\n\n\"It didn\u2019t make sense,\" Beck told us. \"It really is a regional project.\"\n\nLet\u2019s review some of the history behind the ARC project.\n\nWith NJ Transit as the lead agency, New Jersey was to contribute $2.7 billion toward the $8.7 billion project cost. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was to contribute $3 billion, with the remaining $3 billion coming from a federal transit program.\n\nBut in their latest estimate before the project was canceled, federal officials said the cost could increase to between about $9.8 billion and roughly $12.4 billion.\n\nAfter Christie first announced plans to cancel the project, federal officials presented a few options to fund the remaining costs, including federal loans and a public-private partnership to secure additional funding.\n\nBut on Oct. 27, 2010, Christie went ahead with terminating what was the largest planned public works project in the nation, citing potential cost increases and the state\u2019s fiscal climate.\n\nDue to the project\u2019s cancellation, there was no final agreement on the responsibility for cost growth, according to a recent investigative report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.\n\nStill, New Jersey would have been responsible for cost increases beyond the $8.7 billion, DOT spokesman Justin Nisly told us. Nisly said in an e-mail that \"it is important to note that we were actively working with NJ Transit to mitigate any potential costs when they decided to walk away from the project.\"\n\nAccording to Nisly, the basis for that responsibility is a 2006 federal rule that includes the following phrase: \"Once the project is approved into final design, any increase in project costs will be borne by the sponsoring agency and its non-section 5309 New Starts funding partners.\"\n\nThat rule goes on to say that \"any cost increase later in project development is the sole responsibility of the project sponsor.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn an April 11 interview on NJToday, Beck claimed that beyond the $8.7 billion budget for the ARC project, \"New Jersey alone was on the hook for all overruns.\"\n\nBased on a federal rule governing such projects, the senator\u2019s claim is accurate. As a DOT spokesman confirmed, New Jersey would have been responsible for cost increases beyond the $8.7 billion budget.\n\nWe rate the statement True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "NJToday, Interview with state Sen.
