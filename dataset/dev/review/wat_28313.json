Eggers wrote a story, which begins: \"Republican Troy Balderson clings to a narrow margin in last night\u2019s special election for Ohio\u2019s 12th Congressional district, underscoring the impact voter fraud can have in key elections around the country,\" Eggers wrote.", "Eggers raised the prospect that people were impersonating dead voters, claiming that \"72 voters over the age of 116 who \u2018live\u2019 in Balderson\u2019s district cast ballots in the 2016 election.\"", "The Breitbart article links to a list of voter IDs of Ohioans whose birthdates are listed in 1901 or earlier. Eggers sent us the same information when we reached out to him.", "\"Take into account the fact that there were 170 voters in the state of Ohio that were listed as older than 116,\" American Journal Review wrote. \"These names still sat in Ohio\u2019s 12th Congressional district\u2019s rolls when the data was collected by GAI in August of 2017.", "\"This is equivalent to 10 percent of the margin that Balderson is currently leading by, without provisional ballots. More than 72 percent of Ohio voters over 116 years old who are \"living\" in the district Balderson is running in voted in the 2016 election\u2026\"", "Considering the fact that the world\u2019s oldest living person is 115 years old, and that the vote counts of the Democratic and Republican candidates were separated by roughly 1,700 votes the day after the election, we wanted to look into the allegation of the American Journal Review article that there were \"major signs\" of voter fraud.", "(At the time of this story\u2019s publication, it appears that Republican Troy Balderson leads Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor by 1,564 votes, but some absentee and provisional ballots still need to be counted. The results will be sent to the Ohio Secretary of State on Aug. 24. Balderson and O\u2019Connor will face off again in November.)", "Indeed, there are 170 voters in the district listed with birthdays from 1901 or earlier. But the story builds a misleading impression by tying that fact to \"voter fraud,\" where there is no evidence that dead people or people over 116 years old voted in the race.", "The story overlooks a plausible explanation for turn-of-the-century birthdays of 170 registered voters: Ohio didn\u2019t require citizens to provide their dates of birth when registering to vote until 1974.", "The list of Ohio voters shows 170 voter IDs and corresponding dates of birth, all of which are listed as being in 1901 or earlier.", "But if you look closely, you\u2019ll notice that almost all of the voters\u2019 dates of birth are listed as one of three dates: Jan. 1, 1800, Jan. 1, 1900, or Jan. 1, 1901.", "The office of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted responded to several misleading stories about the special election in a press release. \"State law has not always required Ohioans to provide their date of birth when registering to vote,\" they wrote. \"Prior to June 1974, when House Bill 662 was passed requiring date of birth to register to vote, county boards of election used placeholder dates. This is why some registrations have dates like 1900 or 1800 listed.\"", "Husted doubled down in a tweet: \"No one 116 or older is voting in Ohio elections. Voters who registered when DOB wasn't required have a placeholder date as their DOB. Often the year 1900 was used.\"", "Enough misinformation: Time for the facts.

While there are 170 voters listed as over 116 years old, that is almost definitely not their real birthdays.", "That\u2019s because those voters likely registered to vote in Ohio before 1974, when they weren\u2019t required to provide their date of birth. Because the voting record lacked these voters\u2019 dates of birth, placeholder dates from 1800 and 1900 were used, the state\u2019s Republican secretary of state said.", "The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
