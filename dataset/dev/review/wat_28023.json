So we can see where she might be less than impressed with City Hall\u2019s response to the EPA. But is it accurate to characterize what\u2019s happened in Portland as \"inaction\"?\n\nLet\u2019s recap: In 1993, scores of people in Wisconsin died from a cryptosporidium outbreak from their drinking water. In response, the federal government began drafting new regulations, releasing the rule in 2006. The rule required the city of Portland to cover its open-air water reservoirs and to treat its drinking water.\n\nThe city filed a lawsuit in federal court. The court dismissed the challenge in 2007.\n\nIn addition, the City Council passed a resolution promising to seek alternatives to the rule. They met with or contacted EPA officials seeking outs for the city. Commissioner Randy Leonard, who oversees the bureau, said he talked to Oregon\u2019s federal delegation, only to be told that there was slim hope of legislative relief.\n\nSo Portland wasn\u2019t storming the gates in Washington, D.C., but that didn\u2019t sound like \"inaction\" to us. We turned to Brady.\n\nShe said that she didn\u2019t mean inaction as in no action. She meant inaction as in not enough action to shield Portland\u2019s \"elegant\" drinking water.\n\n\"Our ratepayers are going to have to pick up the bill for a $400 million project that we probably could have worked more aggressively to find alternatives for,\" Brady said, referring to the amount of money needed to replace five open-air drinking water reservoirs at Mount Tabor and Washington parks with covered storage. (The other $100 million is to build a UV treatment plant.)\n\nBrady wants Portland to be like Rochester, N.Y., which spent a mere $9 million on compact treatment plants allowing the city to preserve two open reservoirs. New York City won a reprieve on a $1.6 billion cover until 2028. Portland\u2019s Water Bureau says our system is too old and too different to compare with other cities. That\u2019s beside the point for Brady. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"Portland could have taken the same aggressive stance that New York did, which was to provide a significant case as to why this was unduly burdensome,\" she said. \"They made the case that Portland could have made had we been proactive about it.\"\n\nThis summer, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., complained about the rule\u2019s one-size-fits-all nature and asked the agency to review. Surprisingly, EPA agreed. Leonard requested the Oregon\u2019s delegation\u2019s help in finding out how an EPA reconsideration could affect Portland. (Apparently we were Portland polite; they were New York loud.)\n\nWe asked state Sen. Jackie Dingfelder, D-Ore., for her take on the issue. She represents the east Portland neighborhoods that have been the most vocal about leaving the water alone. Has the city been on the inactive side of the equation? \"It\u2019s not as black and white. I think there was a feeling initially that we\u2019ve done everything we can, and now\" after Schumer\u2019s intervention, she said, \"I think the city is pushing really hard.\"\n\nPortland has spent about $1.2 million on the legal challenge, and nearly $1.4 million to date to get a variance on the treatment portion. In December 2009, the EPA denied the city\u2019s request for a variance for the reservoirs.\n\nWe understand that Brady is running for office, and that she made a politically charged statement in a campaign speech. Had Brady said City Hall had done a lousy job fighting the federal government, we would not have troubled ourselves. Had she said that City Hall had been ineffective on this issue, we would have stayed away.\n\nBut she called it \"City Hall inaction\" and to the average person, that is not accurate. The city sued. City officials met with and sought answers of federal bureaucrats, and they sought help from the congressional delegation.
