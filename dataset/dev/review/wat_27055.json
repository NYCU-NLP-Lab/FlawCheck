["By Rem Rieder", "Posted on April 16, 2020", "President Donald Trump is making false and exaggerated claims about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Feb. 24 trip to San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown. Pelosi urged people to shop and eat there at a time when tourism was suffering because of the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year.", "The president has raised Pelosi\u2019s visit several times in recent days to counter criticism that he was slow to react to the coronavirus. He repeatedly mentions that he issued travel restrictions on China, which he did on Jan. 31. Meanwhile, he points out, the House speaker was urging people to go to Chinatown.", "Trump is mischaracterizing and exaggerating what she said during her visit. And while Trump did issue the travel restrictions, as we have reported, he also downplayed the danger of the virus in a series of remarks and tweets from Jan. 22 to March 10.", "The California Democrat\u2019s visit to Chinatown came three weeks before six Bay Area counties implemented shelter-in-place restrictions. On the same day as Pelosi\u2019s visit, Trump tweeted, \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d", "Here\u2019s Trump\u2019s April 16 tweet accusing Pelosi of deleting a video from her Twitter account:", "Crazy Nancy Pelosi deleted this from her Twitter account. She wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA. Based on her statement, she is responsible for many deaths. She\u2019s an incompetent, third-rate politician! pic.twitter.com/uWNI7DCG3o", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2020", "We could find no record that the video was ever posted on Pelosi\u2019s Twitter account.", "We checked Politwoops, a project of ProPublica that preserves tweets deleted by politicians, and there\u2019s no record Pelosi deleted a tweet of the video, nor a record of her deleting a tweet about the Chinatown visit. The Internet Archives\u2019 Wayback Machine captured an image of Pelosi\u2019s Twitter page on Feb. 27, and that, too, shows no tweet of the video. Pelosi still has a tweet about her Chinatown visit on her Twitter feed.", "Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill tweeted that Pelosi\u2019s office hadn\u2019t posted it. \u201cFact check: We never posted this video. It\u2019s obviously local TV coverage of the Speaker visiting Chinatown in San Francisco\u2026.\u201d", "Pelosi explained at the time that she was making her Chinatown visit \u201cto say to everyone: we should come to Chinatown.\u201d", "Pelosi, Feb. 24: Precautions have been taken by our city. We know that there is concern surrounding tourism, traveling all throughout the world, but we think it\u2019s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come. It\u2019s lovely here. The food is delicious, the shops are prospering, the parade was great. Walking tours continue. Please come and visit and enjoy Chinatown.", "So, Pelosi mentioned the Chinese New Year parade. But she did not say, \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s all have the big parade \u2014 Chinatown parade,'\u201d as Trump maintained during the April 13 coronavirus briefing. In fact, the parade occurred on Feb. 8.", "And, while she encouraged people to \u201cvisit and enjoy Chinatown\u201d and called it \u201cvery safe,\u201d Trump went too far in saying at his April 15 briefing that Pelosi \u201cwas trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown, because she thought it would be great.\u201d Pelosi didn\u2019t mention parties during her visit.", "As for the coronavirus, Pelosi didn\u2019t deny its existence \u2014 contrary to Trump\u2019s remarks \u2014 while visiting Chinatown. She struck a middle ground. \u201cPrevention, prevention, prevention. We want people to be concerned and vigilant,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t want them to be afraid.\u201d", "During her excursion, Pelosi was asked if it was irrational for people to stay away from Asian-American-owned businesses in San Francisco and elsewhere.", "\u201cWell, that\u2019s one of the reasons we are here today,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense, but it\u2019s not just Asian-owned now. You see in Italy where the shows \u2013 the fashion shows and all of that were done without an audience because people \u2013 they just didn\u2019t \u2013 because people were not coming. So, again, this fear is \u2013 I think \u2013 unwarranted in light of the precautions that are being taken here in the United States.\u201d", "But in response to a question, Pelosi rejected the notion that racism was the reason people were avoiding Asian businesses.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, I do think that because it started in China, there\u2019s a concern that are the \u2013 is the Chinese government doing what it needed to do early enough, and now as we go forward. But that should not be carried over to Chinatown and San Francisco.\u201d", "Asked whether she felt the federal government was doing enough to control the virus, Pelosi said, \u201cI have confidence in Dr. [Anthony] Fauci at the National Institutes of Health, who has even further confidence in what we\u2019re doing.\u201d", "Trump and Pelosi have long had a frosty relationship, one that wasn\u2019t warmed up by the impeachment battle. And the president has bristled at her criticism that he was slow to react to the threat of the novel coronavirus. On March 29, on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d she said, \u201chis denial at the beginning was deadly. His delaying of getting equipment to where \u2014 it continues \u2014 his delay in getting equipment to where it\u2019s needed is deadly.\u201d", "Trump returned fire the following day in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d assailing Pelosi as a \u201csick puppy.\u201d", "To sum up: Pelosi did visit Chinatown in late February in an effort to encourage people to go there to eat and shop. But she did not support parades or parties, try to show the coronavirus didn\u2019t exist or delete a tweet of her visit, as Trump claimed.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
