["The pictures, posted by a Facebook page named \u201cGhana in Africa\u201d, have\u00a0been shared more than 6,700 times (we\u2019ve archived the post here). The post claims that the boy \u201cwas placed behind the walls alive, buried alive behind the walls, used as a foundation for a church building\u201d.", "The pictures were also shared on Twitter\u00a0by more than 350 people alongside the same caption.", "But Google reverse image searches led to articles by the Daily Mail and Metro UK from 2016 which told a different story.", "Contrary to the claim that the boy was found after being buried alive in the foundations of a church, the British newspapers reported that the boy was miraculously rescued after three days in the tiny gap between a house and a wall. There was no mention of a church in the articles.", "The newspapers named the child as Aduragbemi Saka, believed to be\u00a012 years old at the time. We ran multiple online queries including the name, which led us to a Channels TV video, taken at the location of the incident and published a few days before the British articles.", "According to the video, the boy became trapped after falling into the gap behind the wall on Akinfemisoye Street in the Oduduwa Area of New Town, Ondo State, Nigeria. A resident says she believes the boy fell into the gap after running away from his grandmother. There is no suggestion in the video that the child was deliberately buried alive.", "The only reference to a church in the video comes towards the end of the news report, when it mentions that the boy had been taken to a church in the neighbourhood for spiritual deliverance.", "Channels TV\u2019s full report on the incident cited the prophetess of the church as saying she believed the boy ran away from his grandmother after the ceremony, which is when he fell in the gap between the two buildings.", "Aduragbemi was rescued by police and residents, and according to the Channels TV report he and his grandmother left their home after the rescue. We\u2019ve been unable to find any further information on the boy\u2019s whereabouts, but we can certainly say that posts about him being buried alive behind the walls of a church are misleading.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
