One of the only photos she smiled in during Trump's presidency was taken at Barbara Bush's funeral alongside the Obamas and Clintons.", "However, contrary to the headline (which strongly implied a divorce was in the offing), the article's text offered no reference at all to any \"shocking\" announcement -- or any other kind of announcement -- recently made by First Lady Melania Trump to her husband, President Donald Trump.", "The article simply reproduced bits of information and gossip about the Stormy Daniels controversy and Melania Trump's supposed reluctance to be seen with her husband at public events without any underlying coherent story. The headline's reference to a non-existent \"shocking announcement\" was just more political clickbait intended to lure readers, from a site with a long history of engaging in such deception.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
