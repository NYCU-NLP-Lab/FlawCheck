["About this rating", "On 17\u00a0February\u00a02017, the Newslo web site\u00a0published an article\u00a0reporting that televangelist Pat Robertson had said \"staring\" at First Lady Melania Trump was an activity sufficient to \"cure gays\":", "When Christian Conservative leader Pat Robertson discussed the RNC convention in his TV show \u201cThe 700 Club\u201d last July, he managed once again to turn the topic to controversy surrounding Melania Trump\u2019s speech. Robertson had agreed with many people when he said, \u201cTrump\u2019s speechwriter should be fired for doing \u2014 or borrowing a few lines from Mrs. Obama.\u201d But then the televangelist got creepy when he started discussing Mrs. Trump\u2019s appearance, when he said, \u201cWe mentioned the language in that speech, although she was absolutely gorgeous and I think that\u2019s why they wanted to put her on. She had a beautiful dress and she\u2019s a lovely lady. Trump knows when he\u2019s got a winner.\u201d", "Lately, he\u2019s been at it again. On the most recent episode of his show, the televangelist argued that the sole reason the mainstream media is targeting President Donald Trump is, once again, his wife. Robertson opined that the beauty of First Lady Melania Trump is so incredible that \u201cjust by staring at her for a period of time, one can rid themselves of the plague of homosexualism.\u201d \u201cYou know how there used to be this urban myth that men can prolong their natural lives just by staring at naked female breasts for 10 minutes a day? Well, this is sort of something similar to that, with one crucial difference: it\u2019s not an urban myth,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cShe\u2019s an actual gay whisperer, that one.\u201d", "Newslo\u00a0(along with sister sites\u00a0Religionlo, Politicops, and Politicalo)\u00a0typically combine a tiny grain of truth with a balance of lies, as was the case in the above-quoted material. Newslo's trio of\u00a0fake news sites include a button\u00a0allowing\u00a0readers to\u00a0\u201cshow facts\u201d or \u201chide facts,\" but since by default all their content displays in \u201chide facts\u201d mode, most visitors are not aware of\u00a0the fictional embellishments they add:", "In this case, Pat Robertson's remarks about Mrs. Trump's being a \"lovely lady\" were genuinely something he said on CBN\u00a0on 16 July 2016, but the balance of the Newslo article was fabricated, and Robertson never referred to Mrs. Trump as an \"actual gay whisperer.\" Robertson is a frequent target of\u00a0Newslo and its brethren, where segments from the\u00a0700 Club are regularly embellished to create share-worthy fabrications.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
