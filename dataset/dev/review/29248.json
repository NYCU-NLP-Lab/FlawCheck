Portland, Oregon, in particular, was marred by violence, rioting, and more allegations of police brutality.", "Trump reacted to the situation in many cities by blaming \"anarchists\" for the violence, saying they assaulted police officers with items ranging from bricks and rocks, to frozen bottles of water, and even cans or bags of soup.", "Snopes readers asked if the president had indeed said something as \u201cweird\u201d as that.

And you have people coming over with bags of soup \u2014 big bags of soup. And they lay it on the ground, and the anarchists take it and they start throwing it at our cops, at our police.
