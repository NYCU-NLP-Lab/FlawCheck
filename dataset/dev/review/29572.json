According to Twitter Developer, Twitter\u2019s computers scour sites on the Internet every week or so to check for updates to these designated images. When those computers recognize a change from a site\u2019s owner, Twitter updates the image on all the tweets linking to that site \u2014 including past ones.", "The protest image appeared on obama.org, without a photo credit, on May 31 with an Obama Foundation press release about organizations that are working to end systemic racism and police brutality in the United States.
