(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "We\u2019ve checked a similar claim before. In late January, an article posted to Facebook claimed that Trump had signed a bill \"to clean millions of tons of garbage from the world\u2019s oceans.\"", "The story was referring to the Save Our Seas Act of 2018, which Trump signed on Oct. 11. He then said that more than 8 million tons of garbage is dumped into oceans every year and that the law \"will help address this problem.\"", "But Jordana Merran, communications manager for Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit that supported the Save Our Seas Act and celebrated its passage, said it\u2019s not accurate to summarize the legislation as a bill to \"clean millions of tons of garbage from the world\u2019s oceans.\"", "Rather, the law Trump signed reauthorizes \"the longstanding amount of $10 million annually\" for NOAA\u2019s Marine Debris Program, she said.", "\"The program does support, among other efforts, Ocean Conservancy\u2019s International Coastal Cleanup, in which volunteers collect millions of pounds of garbage off beaches and waterways annually across the globe. However, many entities provide financial support for the ICC.\"", "The legislation, which was sponsored by U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and cosponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, had bipartisan support. It doesn\u2019t direct the country to clean millions of tons of garbage from marine environments.", "The bill reauthorizes and amends the Marine Debris Act \"to promote international action to reduce marine debris, and for other purposes,\" according to the law. But it\u2019s not specific about how much debris, or how it should be cleaned up.", "Did Trump sign another bill earlier in March?", "\"No,\" said Madeline Black, a communications assistant for Ocean Conservancy. \"This likely is the same claim as in February being shared belatedly.\"", "When we reviewed the original claim about this legislation, we rated it Half True. That\u2019s because Trump signed a bill that reauthorized a program aimed in part at removing marine water debris.", "This more recent Facebook post makes a similar claim but it goes on step further, wrongly stating that Trump signed the legislation this month.", "We rate this one as False.", "Facebook post, March 21, 2019", "Facebook post, Jan. 30, 2019", "PolitiFact, \"Donald Trump signed a bill aimed in part at removing marine debris,\" Feb. 11, 2019", "Email interview with Madeline Black, communications assistant, Ocean Conservancy, March 26, 2019", "The White House, Remarks by President Trump at signing of S. 3508, the \"Save Our Seas Act of 2018,\" Oct. 11, 2018", "S.3508 - Save Our Seas Act of 2018", "Ocean Conservancy blog, \"Save Our Seas Act signed into law,\" Oct. 11, 2018", "The Associated Press, \"Trump signs Save Our Seas Act into law,\" Oct. 13, 2018", "Email interview with Jordana Merran, communications manager, Ocean Conservancy, Feb. 7, 2019", "NOAA Marine Debris Program, accessed Feb. 6, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
