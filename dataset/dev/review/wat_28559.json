["One post shared more than 3,300 times on Facebook, archived here, alleges that a popular Ghanaian preacher known as Prophet Nigel Gaisie said: \u201cI Can Raise Kobe Bryant If 10% Of His Net Worth Is Given Me [sic]\". The post links to an article, which claimed the preacher told his congregation that he was able to resurrect Bryant and his teenage\u00a0daughter, who died in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020.", "AFP analysed the source codes of websites that posted the story and found the earliest version\u00a0was\u00a0published by\u00a0News Bulleting on January 27, 2020 -- less than 24 hours after the news of Bryant\u2019s death rippled across the world.", "The website\u2019s disclaimer states: \"News Bulleting is a satire news and humor website. All references, names and marks or institutions in this website are used as contextual elements, like in any novel or science-fiction story.\"", "Shortly after it was first published on News Bulleting, the story began circulating as real news on\u00a0news platforms across the continent.
