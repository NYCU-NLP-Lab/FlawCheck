["By Robert Farley", "Posted on December 14, 2018", "President Donald Trump declared via Twitter that he is keeping perhaps his most famous campaign promise, claiming that \u201cMEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!\u201d through a recent trade agreement negotiated with Mexico.", "Economic and trade experts we interviewed said that\u2019s not possible.", "The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement was signed by the leaders of all three countries on Nov. 30, but it still must be ratified by all three governments. It represents an arguably slightly better deal for the U.S. than its predecessor, the\u00a0North American Free Trade Agreement, experts told us, but not enough to translate to federal revenues that would pay for the border wall, and shouldn\u2019t be construed as Mexican payments, anyway.", "Building a wall along the southwest border, and having Mexico pay for it, was perhaps the signature plank in Trump\u2019s campaign platform.", "\u201cI will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall,\u201d Trump said when he announced his campaign for presidency on June 16, 2015.", "In virtually every campaign speech,\u00a0Trump vowed to build a wall and insisted Mexico would pay for it. Trump floated the idea\u00a0even before formally announcing his candidacy.", "Over time, Trump changed details about the number of miles the wall would stretch, its height, the type of wall it would be and its ultimate cost. And Trump also has been vague about how exactly Mexico would pay.\u00a0Often, Trump has simply said that Mexico has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade, and that the U.S. runs a trade deficit with Mexico.", "For their part, Mexican leaders have been adamant that Mexico will not pay for the wall.", "The Trump campaign did issue a position paper outlining some of the ways Mexico might be made to pay for the wall, including increased fees on border-crossing cards, NAFTA worker visas and at ports of entry to the U.S.", "Trump campaign position paper, 2015: Mexico must pay for the wall and, until they do, the United States will, among other things: impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages; increase fees on all temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats (and if necessary cancel them); increase fees on all border crossing cards \u2013 of which we issue about 1 million to Mexican nationals each year (a major source of visa overstays); increase fees on all NAFTA worker visas from Mexico (another major source of overstays); and increase fees at ports of entry to the United States from Mexico [Tariffs and foreign aid cuts are also options].", "None of that came to pass, however. Instead, the president has asked Congress to fund a border wall, while\u00a0promising that the U.S. will be \u201creimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico.\u201d", "In a meeting with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on Dec. 11, Trump threatened a shutdown of the federal government if Democrats did not agree to include $5 billion in the next budget to build \u201ca tremendous chunk of wall.\u201d Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, later said\u00a0the president\u2019s demand shows that the wall will \u201cnot [be] paid for by Mexico anymore.\u201d", "In a tweet on Dec. 13, Trump insisted \u201cMEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!\u201d and that it is going to do so through the USMCA.", "I often stated, \u201cOne way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.\u201d This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 13, 2018", "Schumer and Pelosi say that while Democrats are willing to pay for border security, they will not support $5 billion in additional funding for the president\u2019s wall.", "\u201cThe president repeatedly promised that Mexico would pay for his unnecessary and ineffective border wall,\u201d Schumer said from the Senate floor on Dec. 13. \u201c\u2026 On Tuesday he said he would be \u2018proud\u2019 to shut down the government unless U.S. taxpayers pay for it. And now just this morning, the president tweeted that Mexico will pay for the wall through savings from the new NAFTA. Well, Mr. President, if you say Mexico is going to pay for the wall through NAFTA, which it certainly won\u2019t, then I guess we don\u2019t have to [pay for it]. Let\u2019s fund the government.\u201d", "To be clear, there is nothing in the USMCA spelling out that Mexico will pay for any border wall. The president\u2019s argument is more nuanced than that.", "As he told the Wall Street Journal in January, Mexico could pay for the wall \u201cindirectly\u201d if the U.S. makes a \u201cgood deal\u201d renegotiating NAFTA. \u201cSay I\u2019m going to take a small percentage of that money and it\u2019s going to go toward the wall,\u201d Trump said. \u201cGuess what? Mexico\u2019s paying.\u201d", "Economists and trade experts we interviewed called the president\u2019s logic misguided.", "Although the president has given conflicting statements about the cost of a wall, the White House released an immigration plan in January that sought $25 billion for the wall. A cost estimate sent by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to lawmakers that month sought $18 billion over 10 years for the first phase of border wall construction. (On Dec. 7, Trump estimated the cost of the wall at $15 billion to $20 billion).", "Can increased tax revenue from the USMCA pay for the wall?", "Assuming the cost is closer to $25 billion, economists told us there\u2019s not enough new benefits to the U.S. in the new trade agreement to pay for the wall.", "\u201cEven if we accept conceptually the argument that government revenue attributable to the revised trade agreement constitutes \u2018Mexico paying for the wall,\u2019 there are no plausible assumptions of USMCA\u2019s impact that would see government revenue increase by $25 billion,\u201d said Geoffrey Gertz, a fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution and a research associate at the Global Economic Governance Programme at the University of Oxford.", "\u201cUltimately USMCA is very similar to NAFTA, and so we shouldn\u2019t expect any substantial economic shifts from the new agreement,\u201d Gertz told us via email. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to argue that that NAFTA was \u2018anti-USA\u2019 and \u2018very costly\u2019 but that USMCA will save us lots of money, because there\u2019s not a huge difference between the two agreements.\u201d", "One of the concessions won by U.S. negotiators is a requirement that \u201c40-45 percent of auto content be made by workers earning at least $16 per hour.\u201d The idea is to level the playing field for higher-wage American manufacturers. The USMCA also takes some steps to reduce barriers to U.S. export of dairy products to Canada.", "But Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, told us none of the concessions won by U.S. negotiators amounts to enough to offset the cost of a border wall.", "\u201cUSMCA is definitely positive for the U.S. economy but a fairly minor update to NAFTA,\u201d said Smetters, who was an economist at the Congressional Budget Office in the 1990s. \u201cThe real value comes from renewing the essential elements of NAFTA itself.\u201d", "\u201cUSMCA provides some specific trade openings that benefit all three countries along with some IP [intellectual properties] updates. (The value of the IP update is hard to assess until we understand the enforcement commitment.),\u201d Smetters said. \u201cRelative to NAFTA, the Mexican government would not nearly lose enough tariff revenue that could be constituted as paying for the wall, at least the wall as previously envisioned by the Administration; nor would the U.S. government revenue increase enough based on a dynamic score. In fact, the additional revenue to U.S. relative to NAFTA would, optimistically, not cover annual maintenance and improvements of the wall much less the original build.\u201d", "Alan V. Deardorff, the John W. Sweetland professor of international economics and professor of public policy\u00a0at the University of Michigan, said he is not convinced that the USMCA will result in extra revenue to the U.S. government.", "\u201cIn economic terms, the new deal is not in fact better than the old one, but it may (only may) benefit US workers to a small extent,\u201d Deardorff told us in an email. \u201cU.S. firms (except for a handful of dairy farmers who gain a little) will do worse, not better, since it increases their costs.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see any way that it actually brings in money to our government.\u00a0 It is likely to hurt Mexico, as presumably intended, but not in a way that benefits us. So no, the statement [from Trump] does not make sense.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s claim seems to assume any gains from USMCA are \u201cextractions from Mexico,\u201d Gertz added. \u201cThis assumes a zero-sum view of trade, where one country\u2019s gains are another\u2019s losses \u2013 which cuts against the typical economists\u2019 arguments that free trade is positive sum, that both sides to the agreement benefit.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
