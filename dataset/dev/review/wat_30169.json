Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul, both Democrats.", "In December 2018, during the lame-duck session, a set of GOP-backed bills aimed at curtailing some powers of the new administration passed and were signed by outgoing Gov. Scott Walker.", "Senate Bills 883, 884 and 886 affected many powers, including the governor\u2019s ability to make changes to health care and public benefits programs.", "State Rep. Jim Ott, R-Mequon, is emphatic that at least one thing was not done.", "In an email to constituents sent out in December, Ott headlined one bullet point: \"Early voting was not eliminated.\"", "The item noted that in past elections, large cities, including Milwaukee, Madison and Green Bay, offered early voting for up to six weeks before Election Day -- \u00a0far longer than many smaller municipalities.", "It then claims SB 884 levels the playing field, since \"municipalities are now required to have two or more polling locations opened 24-hours a day, two weeks before any election.\"", "Is Ott right, that the playing field is now leveled?", "In a word, no.", "SB 884 and the election hours", "According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, individual villages, towns and cities are responsible for setting the dates and hours of in-person absentee voting for their municipalities.", "They still have this discretion, though the GOP action cut back the duration of early voting.", "Under the changes, if early voting is offered, it could not begin sooner than 14 days, or two weeks, before an election.", "Voters can cast their ballot no later than the Sunday prior to Election Day, so that provides 13 days of potential early voting, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.", "The hours of voting would still be decided by local governments. So, counter to what Ott\u2019s email claimed, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean polling places will be operating 24 hours a day -- or even that a given municipality will offer early voting at all.", "Indeed, there could still be wide discrepancies within that window, so the playing field is not leveled at all.", "When asked about the claim, Ginger Mueller from Ott\u2019s office said the wrong word was inadvertently used.", "\"That should have read \u2018\u2026municipalities are allowed to have\u2026.\u2019\" she wrote in an email. \"Thank you for bringing it our attention.\"\n\nOne Wisconsin Institute v.
