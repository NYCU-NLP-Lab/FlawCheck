["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on January 24, 2020", "Posts circulating amid the Senate impeachment trial misleadingly accuse nine Republican senators of having \u201cjoined Democrats on impeachment.\u201d The claim originated in October as a list of senators who had not yet co-sponsored an impeachment-related resolution \u2014 but six of them did sign on to that measure.", "Even though the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump is still in the opening arguments stage, popular social media posts shared on Facebook in recent days are dubiously calling out nine Republican senators over the case.", "The Facebook posts misleadingly claim that the nine senators have \u201cjoined Democrats on impeachment,\u201d even though there has been little action taken by the senators thus far.", "Those named in the posts include Sens. Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Cory Gardner, Lamar Alexander, Mike Enzi, Johnny Isakson (who retired in December), Dan Sullivan and Rob Portman.", "The specific list of the nine senators does not appear to be based on new developments, but instead lifted from reports in October about an impeachment-related resolution in the Senate (which would explain why the now-retired Isakson is included). That resolution, introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham, expressed criticism of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry process and demanded that the lower chamber hold a floor vote to officially initiate a formal investigation.", "On Oct. 24, the day the legislation was introduced, The Hill reported that the same group of nine Republican senators had not signed on as co-sponsors.", "The Hill, Oct. 24, 2019: The GOP senators not cosponsoring the resolution as of Thursday afternoon, according to a list from Graham\u2019s office, are: Sens.\u00a0Mitt Romney\u00a0(R-Utah),\u00a0Susan Collins\u00a0(R-Maine),\u00a0Lisa Murkowski\u00a0(R-Alaska),\u00a0Cory Gardner\u00a0(R-Colo.),\u00a0Lamar Alexander\u00a0(R-Tenn.),\u00a0Mike Enzi\u00a0(R-Wyo.),\u00a0Johnny Isakson\u00a0(R-Ga.),\u00a0Dan Sullivan\u00a0(R-Alaska) and\u00a0Rob Portman (R-Ohio).", "Some people spread the list of the senators online at the time \u2014 a Twitter account called \u201cRed Nation Rising,\u201d for example, named each of the senators and called them \u201ctreasonous RINOs in Senate\u201d that \u201csupport Democrat witch hunt.\u201d", "It may be a leap to claim that the senators \u201csupport Democrat witch hunt\u201d simply because they didn\u2019t co-sponsor one non-binding resolution, but the argument is further deflated by the fact that most of the senators named actually did co-sponsor the resolution in question.", "By Oct. 25, the day after the measure was introduced and the initial report in The Hill, Gardner, Alexander, Enzi, Sullivan, Isakson and Portman all signaled they would co-sponsor. Only three of the nine senators \u2014 Collins, Murkowski and Romney \u2014 did not co-sponsor the resolution, which never advanced to a vote. Days later, on Oct. 31, the House voted, largely along party lines, to pass a resolution formalizing the impeachment inquiry.", "On Twitter, some users recently have also revived the full list, claiming that the \u201c9 Senate Republicans did not back the resolution against the \u2026 impeachment inquiry.\u201d", "The Facebook posts further ignore the facts by simply offering the names and the assertion that they \u201cjoined Democrats on impeachment.\u201d Circulating in the current news cycle, the posts misleadingly suggest that the senators have somehow sided with Democrats in an impeachment trial which, of course, is still unfolding.", "The rules of the trial as it proceeds hinge on a simple majority vote. Republicans control the Senate 53-47, so the party\u2019s grip on how the trial is shaped could be lost if just four senators vote with Democrats. So far that hasn\u2019t happened.", "Collins did vote with Democrats on one unsuccessful amendment proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, which would have allowed additional time to file responses to motions, but Republicans have otherwise voted in unison. They unanimously tabled, for example, an amendment proposed by Democrats to allow for the subpoena of witnesses and documents. A few Republicans \u2014 including Collins, Murkowski and Romney \u2014 have suggested they\u2019re open to potentially hearing from witnesses later in the trial.", "Statements made by the senators targeted in the Facebook posts also don\u2019t support the notion that they\u2019ve \u201cjoined Democrats on impeachment.\u201d", "Sullivan recently called the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings \u201cpartisan, rushed and unfair.\u201d Enzi\u2019s spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News that the senator\u00a0\u201cwill continue to listen to all the evidence on the Articles of Impeachment during the trial. Once all the evidence is presented, he will make a final decision.\u201d", "Romney has said the allegations are \u201cextremely serious\u201d and require \u201cthat the Senate put political biases aside, and make good faith efforts to listen to arguments from both sides and thoroughly review facts and evidence.\u201d", "Even if some Republicans do cast votes with Democrats at points during the trial, it would take two-thirds of the senators present \u2014 or 67 of the 100 senators \u2014 to actually convict Trump.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "Carney, Jordain. \u201cSenate GOP introduces resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry.\u201d The Hill. 24 Oct 2019.", "U.S. Senate. \u201cS. Res. 378, A resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the House of Representatives should, consistent with long-standing practice and precedent, prior to proceeding any further with its impeachment investigation into President Donald J. Trump, vote to open a formal impeachment inquiry and provide President Trump with fundamental constitutional protections.\u201d (as introduced 24 Oct 2019)", "U.S. Senate. S.
