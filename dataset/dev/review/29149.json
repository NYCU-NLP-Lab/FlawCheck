The farmer can now sell his crop anywhere in the country. Now, the farmer will get good prices, he can sell anywhere outside the mandi. Mr. Dilip, it would be the biggest revolutionary step in the field of agriculture in the last 70 years.\u201d Patra\u2019s tweet racked up thousands of likes and retweets at the time of writing.

Around the 5:55 mark he says, \u201cThe central government claims that they are trying to double the farmer\u2019s income.\u201d", "Arvind Kejriwal \u2013 \u201cHow? The central government and the Bharatiya Janata Party fielded big leaders. All their senior ministers and chief ministers came to convince the public that this Bill was for the farmers\u2019 benefit. I have heard all these speeches. What do they say in these speeches? They say that this bill will not take away your land, but this is not a benefit. The land is theirs anyway. Your MSP will not be taken away. That\u2019s not a benefit either, it was already available. Your mandi will not be taken away. And this was also already there in the first place. So, what happened? Not a single leader is able to list the benefits. When you prod them further, they say that the farmer can now sell his crop anywhere in the country. This is the only benefit they mention, right? Now, the farmer will get good prices, he can sell anywhere outside the mandi. I want to ask the Centre directly with all due respect. Today, the MSP for one quintal of wheat is Rs 1,800 in the mandis of Punjab and Haryana. There is no mandi in Bihar, and farmers there are selling wheat for Rs. 800. This farmer that\u2019s selling for Rs 800, can you tell him where he should go to get more than Rs 1,800 for his wheat outside of the mandi?\u201d", "Furthermore, at the 9:48 mark, Arvind Kejriwal responds to another question, saying, \u201cThese three farm bills should be repealed. And a law guaranteeing MSP should be introduced. According to the MS Swaminathan Commission, MSP should be calculated by adding the cost after 50% profit to 50% of this value. If such a law is introduced, Mr. Dilip, it would be the biggest revolutionary step in the field of agriculture in the last 70 years.\u201d", "Thus, an 18-second clip was edited by compiling several cropped clips from a recent Arvind Kejriwal interview to show that the CM was speaking in support of the farm laws.
