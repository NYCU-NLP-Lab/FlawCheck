And this fiscal year we will pass that,\" Cuccinelli said. \"People who come after the president and this administration, say, \u2018Oh you know, you don't like immigrants.\u2019 Well, we are letting more people become citizens than has happened in years.\"", "Perino said she didn\u2019t think people realize that. \"No, they don\u2019t,\" Cuccinelli responded.", "Is it true that more immigrants are becoming U.S. citizens than has happened in years? In total numbers, yes. But the approval rate isn\u2019t the highest it\u2019s been in recent years. And the number Cuccinelli mentioned is inflated.", "Generally, before becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, immigrants must pay a fee, pass a civics test and a background check, have lawful permanent residence for at least five years, and meet other criteria.

That\u2019s a less than 1% increase in absolute numbers of naturalizations from 2016 to 2018.", "The report USCIS sent PolitiFact had not just total numbers of people who became U.S. citizens, but also the approval rates.", "In both fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the approval rate was 89%.
