["If you want to make a point about immigration, there\u2019s probably a statistic for you.", "Immigration numbers are often more complicated than they appear, and the mire induces partisan fights among those who consider President Barack Obama a record-setting \"deporter-in-chief\" and others who say he\u2019s doing a lousy job securing the border and handling the influx of migrant children.", "An enduring claim about Obama\u2019s deportation numbers from Fox Business Network\u2019s Lou Dobbs epitomizes this issue.", "\"They manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration,\" Dobbs said July 1, 2014. \"The Homeland Security secretary had to admit before Congress that was not the case -- that, in fact, they were manipulating the numbers.\"", "Dobbs is not only accusing the government of fudging the numbers to make Obama look tougher, he\u2019s saying a Cabinet-level adviser admitted as much.", "We found some debate about the deportation numbers, but Dobbs goes too far in calling it a deliberate scheme. We\u2019ll walk you through it.", "Crash course: Immigration lingo", "Defining deportations is not as easy as it sounds.", "In federal government lingo, official judicial or administrative orders to leave the country are called \"removals,\" and they can happen right at the border or anywhere else on American soil. A removal is what most people would consider a deportation.", "But for people caught illegally crossing the border and simply turned around, there\u2019s another term: \"return.\"", "Unlike removals, a return does not bar someone from legally entering the country someday, though that is hard for most because they do not have a family or employment connection necessary to get in line for citizenship, said David Martin, a University of Virginia School of Law professor. Martin also\u00a0worked as Immigration and Naturalization Service general counsel in the Clinton administration and as DHS deputy general counsel from 2009-10 under Obama.", "The Border Patrol primarily handles voluntary returns to Mexico, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, equipped with immigration judges and detention center beds, generally handles removals.", "Over the past several administrations, the Department of Homeland Security has shifted its immigration focus to undocumented immigrants who commit crimes or are caught at the border. The idea is to get them out, and keep them out. The shift picked up in the George W. Bush administration and intensified under Obama\u2019s watch.", "Whereas many immigrants previously caught at the border simply were bused back to Mexico, they now are returned with official deportation orders, prosecuted, or moved to different parts of the border so they cannot reconnect with their smuggler, Martin said.", "In short, these people previously would have been classified as a \"return,\" but the policy has been to put them through removal proceedings. As such, they are classified as a \"removal.\"", "Counting removals", "Dobbs said the government is twisting its statistics to make it look like it\u2019s deporting more people than Bush. He didn\u2019t return our request for comment, but it\u2019s likely he\u2019s focusing on the policy shift we just described to formally remove people trying to cross the border.", "What he\u2019s getting at: Obama is boosting his \"removal\" statistics by including people who used to be on the \"return\" list.", "To check the numbers, we turned to two different sources, though each has its problems.", "The first comes from Immigration and Customs Enforcement data.", "The following chart from the Bipartisan Policy Center reflects the trend of more total removals, according to ICE data.

Vaughan\u2019s Center for Immigration Studies billed it as \"a truth finally admitted\" that ICE is taking credit for arrests made by Border Patrol agents to beef up its deportation numbers.", "But is the change in tactics a manipulation of data? Experts we talked to said\u00a0no.", "\"Under these previous administrations, they would have been voluntarily returned, not formally removed,\" Brown said. \"Now they are formally removed.\"", "\"Transferring of people from Border Patrol to ICE is not trying to trick the numbers,\" said Alex Nowrasteh, a Cato Institute immigration policy analyst. \"It\u2019s a result of punishing illegal immigrants more heavily than they did before.\"", "Our ruling", "Dobbs said the federal government\u00a0\"manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration.\"", "Deportations or \"removals\" under Obama are tracking higher than during the Bush years using the most literal deportation statistics, as well as those solely from ICE.
