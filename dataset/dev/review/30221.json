Student loan interest, medical expenses, property taxes and charitable donations are still deductible.", "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in 2017 is making some changes to the way tax liability will be calculated this year, but nothing as drastic as one viral meme is claiming.", "The meme, which has been shared 18,000 times on Facebook, starts out this way: \u201cHERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU WON\u2019T BE ABLE TO DEDUCT ON TAXES THIS YEAR.\u201d Then it lists: \u201cStudent loan interest, medical expenses, property taxes, and any home office expenses not paid by my company. Also, the threshold for charitable donations has increased so you can forget recouping the donations to Wounded Warriors, Habitat for Humanity, and PBS.\u201d It ends by claiming that, \u201cIf you own a private plane or jet you can deduct the maintenance of the aircraft.\u201d", "A lot of that is wrong and some of it is misleading.", "Let\u2019s start with the claim that certain deductions have been eliminated. Four out of the five that are listed in the meme haven\u2019t been eliminated and the one has been.\u00a0Here\u2019s how the new tax law treats these deductions:", "As for deducting the cost of private plane maintenance, Christopher Younger, a business aviation lawyer at GKG Law, said that deduction was already available to some taxpayers.\u00a0What\u2019s new is that used planes, not just new ones, are eligible for deductions. But, as always, the deductions are not available for recreational planes, only those that are used for business.", "The larger issue that isn\u2019t mentioned in the meme, though, is that most people don\u2019t itemize their taxes, anyway. Most people take the standard deduction, which reduces the total amount of income that\u2019s eligible to be taxed. The number of people who do that is expected to go up this year since the new law has nearly doubled the standard deduction through the year 2025.", "For single filers, it is now $12,000 instead of $6,350 and for a married couple filing jointly, it is $24,000 instead of $12,700. However, the new law eliminated the personal exemption, which used to provide $4,050 for each taxpayer and dependent claimed on a tax return. (See \u201cA Guide to the Tax Changes\u201d for more information.)", "Of the 150 million taxpayers in the country, the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that 46.5 million chose to itemize their deduction for the 2017 tax year, but only 18 million will choose to do so with the law\u2019s higher standard deduction in effect for the 2018 tax year.", "Updated, March 1: We added more detailed information about the previous threshold for deducting medical and dental expenses.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "U.S. House. \u201cH.R.1 \u2013 An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018.\u201d As passed 22 Dec 2017.", "Internal Revenue Service.
