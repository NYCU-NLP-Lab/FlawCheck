The measure reversed a 20-year-old law that blocked people without legal status from applying for a license. A large coalition of immigrant advocacy organizations argued that in the state that epitomizes American car culture, that ban made it difficult for people to get to work, drive their kids to school and run simple errands. The result, the advocates argued, was thousands of people on the road without licenses and without any way to make sure they knew how to drive.", "Under AB 60, all that would be needed to get a license was proof of residency and the ability to pass a driver\u2019s test, both written and on-the-road.", "California Gov.
