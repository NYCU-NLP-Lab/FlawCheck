["\u201cThe Earth is spinning faster and the day has 16 hours,\u201d is the crux of a popular theory shared on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and on blogs in Spanish, English, and Portuguese.", "In more detail, some blog posts\u00a0assert,\u00a0\u201cFor thousands of years the Schumann Resonance or pulse of Earth has been 7.83 cycles per second. However, since around the year 1980 the earth\u2019s heartbeat began to speed up.\u201d", "The false theory adds that the earth will stop rotating when this pulse reaches 13 cycles per second, at which point \u201cit is believed that it will remain still for around 3 days and then start spinning in the other direction.\u201d", "According to NASA,\u00a0Schumann resonance\u00a0is\u00a0unrelated to\u00a0Earth\u2019s rotation. This phenomenon occurs when the electromagnetic waves from Earth\u2019s thunderstorms circle the planet\u2019s surface until some of them combine,\u00a0creating a repeating atmospheric heartbeat.", "This resonance, which was predicted in 1952 and measured in the early 1960s, can be used to analyze Earth\u2019s weather.", "Ana Maria Soler, a doctor in geophysics and professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, explained to AFP that according to atomic clocks, an\u00a0instrument used to measure time with extreme precision, one full rotation on Earth lasts 23\u00a0hours, 54 minutes and four seconds.", "\u201cWhat we are noticing, and this is a normal process in Earth\u2019s formation, is that it (Earth) is slowing down. This means that days are getting longer, not shorter,\u201d Soler told AFP in Spanish.", "The expert in the physics of the structure of the Earth assured that there is no connection between Schumann resonance\u00a0and the Earth\u2019s rotation. She said the theory described in the false social media posts\u00a0\u201cmixes concepts that have nothing to do with each other.\u201d", "Soler added that scientists believe that in the early stages of Earth's existence, days only lasted six hours, a point\u00a0corroborated by NASA.", "\u201cWe can use very precise atomic clocks to measure exactly how much the rotation speed is diminishing. In 100 hundred years, one day will last two milliseconds more than today,\u201d or 1/500 of a second, NASA told AFP.", "If some people feel that days are getting shorter, this may be due more to the way humans perceive time as they age than to Earth\u2019s rotation, according to a 2019 study published in the European review by Adrian Bejan, a professor in mechanical engineering.", "Bejan explains that clock time and \u201cmind time\u201d as perceived by a human brain are not the same.", "\u201c\u2018Mind time\u2019 is a sequence of images that are fed by stimuli from sensory organs. The rate at which changes in mental images are perceived decreases with age, because of several physical features that change with age,\u201d the study explains, citing body changes or neurological pathway\u00a0degradation as examples.", "In Psychology Today, a publication that aims to make science accessible, University of Washington psychology doctor Jim Stone describes a few theories to explain changes in time perception.", "The first\u00a0is based on an 1877 hypothesis from French philosopher Paul Janet. He theorized that time seems to accelerate as we age because the apparent length of an interval becomes a smaller share of our overall lives as time goes on. \u201cWhen you are five, one year is 20 percent of your life. When you are fifty, it is a meagre 2 percent.\u201d", "Another theory holds that we retain memories for longer when we are young because every experience is new.", "A third explanation was published in 2016 in the neuropsychiatry archives of the Sao Jos\u00e9 de Rio Preto faculty of medicine in Brazil. It asserts that the time we take to accomplish a task and the diminution of dopamine production as we age define our perception of speed.", "In short, the concept described as\u00a0Schumann resonance\u00a0is\u00a0not causing the Earth to rotate faster. On the contrary, the planet is imperceptibly slowing down. One day does not last 16 hours as the internet theory claims, but 23 hours, 54 minutes and four seconds. Perception of shorter days is psychological and can depend on several factors.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
