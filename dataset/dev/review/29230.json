The post has been shared more than 1,000 times.", "Part of the post\u2019s traditional Chinese caption translates to English as: \u201cKind reminder, Google has secretly installed on all of its\u00a0smart phones a\u00a0notification system that alerts users when they come into contact with\u00a0COVID-19 patients, remember to turn it off./ P.S. Fact-checked./ It was secretly installed on my smart phone as well.\u201d", "The caption adds that the system will \"track everywhere you go\" and will automatically turn on once users update their phones.", "In the comment section, the Facebook user that posted the screenshot published another screenshot of the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System in Japanese on an Android phone. The user said the second screenshot proved that the claims were fact-checked.", "Other Facebook users appeared to be misled by the claim, posting comments such as: \u201cThat is true, but mine should be turned off the whole time\u201d, \u201cDoes that only apply to\u00a0Hong Kong or the rest of the world as well (confirmed, applies to the whole\u00a0world)\u201d and \u201cCan\u2019t we delete this?\u201d", "Similar claims were also shared in traditional Chinese and English. For example here, here, here and here on Facebook; here, here, here and here on Twitter; here and here on Telegram; here, here and here on Instagram.", "The claim, however, is misleading.", "In an effort to help governments curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, Apple and Google announced the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System application programming interface (API) on April 10, 2020.", "Both companies explained that the system is optional and that the technology uses Bluetooth to pair with official contact tracing apps that users must download and activate.", "The interface allows \u201cmore individuals to participate, if they choose to opt in, as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities,\u201d Apple said in this\u00a0press release.", "Apple also confirmed to AFP that the partnered apps are prohibited from seeking permission to access location data and must require the users to consent to the use of Exposure Notifications API.", "Google also explicitly states here that Exposure Notification \u201cdoes not collect or use the location from your device. It uses Bluetooth, which can be used to detect if two devices are near each other \u2014 without revealing where the devices are.\u201d", "Google adds that \u201cneither Google, Apple, nor other users can see your identity\u201d and that the \u201ctechnology only works if you decide to opt-in.\u201d", "The company also confirmed to AFP that the interface can be turned off at any time, as noted here on Google Play.", "Meng Wei, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, also refuted the misleading claims about the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System.", "\u201cThe public should not panic about this feature. There is no evidence that this mechanism has been, is being, or will be abused to compromise a user\u2019s privacy.,\u201d he told AFP by email on August 21, 2020.", "Meng added that the technology is designed to only support official government contact tracing apps. \u201cUnauthorized apps shall not be able to use such a technology according to the documents,\u201d he explained.", "Charles Mok, an industry veteran and the Hong Kong Legislative Councillor representing the Information Technology Functional Constituency, also commented on the misleading post on Facebook here on August 19, 2020.", "Part of Mok\u2019s traditional Chinese post translates in English as: \u201cThe above information is inaccurate unless you have downloaded another app to authorize/opt-in, your phone will not have a COVID sensor, it will only have an API.
