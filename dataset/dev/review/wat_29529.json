["The article was posted on December 3 on the Opera News website -- we\u2019ve archived it here.", "\"Male birth control testing has been halted in India after 30 test subjects\u2019 testicles exploded during sexual intercourse. The testing of the male birth control involved 139 men under the age of 41 who were living with their wives and had at least two children each\u2026 Eight months later 30 of the test subjects were rushed to the ER with bust testicles,\" the article claims.", "According to data from Crowdtangle, a social media analysis site, the article has received more than 28,000 interactions on Facebook, including shares, likes and comments.", "Opera News cited \u201cn pas\u201d as its source -- a reference to a South African website\u00a0(attention, site includes a graphic image)\u00a0which had run the same text. However, the website\u2019s Afrikaans-language tagline is \u201cnuusparodie waarvan jy hou\u201d, which translates as \u201cnews parody you like\u201d.", "The site\u2019s Facebook page contains a disclaimer in its header image warning that its content is satirical.", "So it\u2019s clear that the \u2018exploding testicles\u2019 story should not be taken seriously.", "However, some of the details from the article appear to have been taken from news reports about a real-life clinical trial for RISUG, a contraceptive injection for men which has been tested in India.", "On December 6, the BBC published an article about the research under the headline: \u201cWill the world's \u2018first male birth control shot\u2019 work?\u201d. Like the satirical article, it talked about a trial in India involving 139 married men, under the age of 41, with at least two children. The trial involved the men being injected with the contraceptive, in the tube carrying sperm from the testicles to the penis.", "The clinical trial for the injection was conducted from 2000 to 2002, and the results were published last July. The laboratory report talks about some side effects, including temporary swelling of the testicles. But there is no mention of exploding testicles.", "Radhey Shyam Sharma, the trial\u2019s chief coordinator, told AFP that the claim was \u201cfake\u201d.", "\u201cThe issue of testicle rupture is a wrong statement and does not have any base,\u201d he said in an email.", "\u201cAs indicated in our published article, mild scrotal enlargement, on account of diffuse scrotal tissue oedema (swelling), was noticed within first-week post-injection in a majority of individuals, which disappeared within a one-month period without medication. Slight scrotal pain of a low grade was also noticed, which disappeared within one month. However, testicular rupture was not at all noticed and reported from any participating centres.\u201d", "According to the published results of the trial, the contraception worked on all but six of the participants. In these six cases, the drug could not be injected properly because of leakage from the syringe, or punctures in the tubes which carry sperm to the penis. In two of the cases, the men\u2019s wives became pregnant.", "What\u2019s the future of male contraception?", "For decades, men have only had two contraceptive options: wearing a condom, or undergoing sterilising surgery, better known as a vasectomy. The burden has historically been on women to prevent unwanted pregnancies through a variety of birth control methods, including pills, implants and injections.", "Male birth control methods in the form of pills and a contraceptive gel are still in the testing phase. While the RISUG injection is ready after years of trials, the effectiveness of a second part of the treatment, which would make it reversible, has not yet been tested on humans. However, Sharma told the BBC earlier this month that the team hopes the initial injection will be \u201ccleared for production in the very near future\u201d.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
