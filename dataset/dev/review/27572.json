Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016", "Not long after Trump's tweet was published, screenshots began circulating that appeared to depict the tweet as marked sent \"via iPhone.\" \u00a0 Most users didn't see the tweet in that form, as Twitter removed most client markers in 2012, which meant that\u00a0reproducing the claim was somewhat complicated. Most social media screen captures of the tweet in question also ignored one of Trump's tweets just before the \"boycott\" call:", "I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016", "In that tweet, Trump openly admitted to being a current iPhone user, indicating that he possessed both Android and Apple devices. \u00a0That made the\u00a0\"via iPhone\" claim was less damning, unless users expected Trump to leap off the campaign trail and head to the first cell phone shop to switch out his devices.", "Given the fact that most desktop and client Twitter users weren't privy to immediate information regarding a tweet's device of origin, many spread versions of the photograph without question. \u00a0On one popular tweet mocking Trump, users disagreed on the veracity of the image:", "@panzer Looking directly at twitter's api... the tweet came from an android device.
