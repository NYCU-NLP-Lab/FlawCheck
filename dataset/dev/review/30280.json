["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Sen. Loretta Weinberg isn\u2019t shy about attacking Gov. Chris Christie, but when it comes to him not making pension payments, she could show a little patience.\n\nThe Bergen County Democrat took aim in a recent column on bluejersey.com at the Republican governor\u2019s record of making no payments to the state\u2019s pension funds.\n\n\"He has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system, and then states that the system is broke,\" Weinberg wrote in a Nov. 21 column on the left-leaning blog.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey determined that Weinberg\u2019s claim is technically correct, but still somewhat misleading.\n\nThe Christie administration has not yet made a pension contribution, but a payment of nearly $500 million is scheduled to be made before the current fiscal year ends in June 2012. That amount represents a fraction of the nearly $3.4 billion needed to fully fund the state\u2019s fiscal year contribution.\n\nEven though one is scheduled, Weinberg argued in a phone interview that Christie has not made any pension payments.\n\n\"Whether he\u2019ll do it in the future, we\u2019ll see,\" said Weinberg, before referring to her statement. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s misleading....It\u2019s a statement of fact.\"\n\nLet\u2019s review Christie\u2019s track record with the pension system.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2011 budget -- Christie\u2019s first spending plan -- the governor did not make any pension contributions, even though a payment of about $3 billion was required to fully fund the state\u2019s share in that fiscal year.\n\nBut in March 2010, Christie signed a law passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, requiring the state to make one-seventh of the full contribution. That policy kicks off with fiscal year 2012, which began in July of this year.\n\nThe state\u2019s payment is slated to increase by at least an additional one-seventh in each succeeding fiscal year until the full amount is paid in the seventh fiscal year and afterwards.\n\nChristie approved a fiscal year 2012 budget that includes that one-seventh payment for a combined contribution of about $484 million to six pension funds. The full contribution would be nearly $3.4 billion.\n\nIn fact, Weinberg also agreed to make a pension payment by way of voting for the fiscal year 2012 budget.\n\nThe actual payment will be made at some point during the next seven months in order to use cash on hand, according to Andrew Pratt, a Treasury Department spokesman. Making the pension payment now would likely mean borrowing money, Pratt said.\n\nHistorically, pension payments are made in the final few weeks of a fiscal year, Pratt told us. Toward the end of a fiscal year, more tax revenue is coming in and most other expenses have been paid, he said.\n\n\"It\u2019s a fiscally prudent thing to do,\" Pratt said. \"It\u2019s always better to pay in cash.\"", "State officials also approved pension and health benefit reform last summer, requiring greater employee contributions toward the benefits. The Christie administration has said the reform would save $120 billion in pension costs over the next 30 years.", "Our ruling\n\nIn an online column, Weinberg claimed Christie \"has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system.\"\n\nIt\u2019s technically true that Christie has not yet made a pension contribution, but the governor has agreed to make a combined payment of about $484 million to six pension funds during fiscal year 2012.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "BlueJersey.com, A Tale of Two New Jerseys!, Nov. 21, 2011\n\nNew Jersey Department of the Treasury, Fiscal Year 2011-2012: Citizens\u2019 Guide to the Budget, October 2011\n\nThe Star-Ledger, Christie's overhaul may not save N.J. pension system, Oct. 23, 2011\n\nNew Jersey Department of the Treasury, Division of Pensions and Benefits: Financial Statements and Schedules, June 30, 2011\n\nNew Jersey Office of Legislative Services, Analysis of the Fiscal Year 2011-2012 Budget: Interdepartmental Accounts, May 2011\n\nNew Jersey Office of Legislative Services, Appropriations Act FY 2012 Summary Totals, July 20, 2011\n\nSenate bill S-2, signed into law by Gov.
