I hop in and rip open the first one, nothing, second one nothing. The third was mostly the same but I notice a brown grocery bag and I look inside. Its full of condoms, fuzzy handcuffs, toy cleaner, vibrators, and all sorts of stuff. So i think to myself that cant be it, in my mind I was looking for a tote bag or backpack. I hope out of the dumpster empty handed and go back to the front desk.\u201d", "Alt News ran the second image on Google\u2019s reverse image search and found that this image was uploaded by pscully, a user on Imgur, on February 2018.
