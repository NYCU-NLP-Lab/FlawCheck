Jeb Bush, another Republican bidding for president.", "Sen. Cruz, appearing in Houston Oct. 26, 2015, to accept endorsements from statewide elected Republicans including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, celebrated how much he\u2019s raised in Texas and in general.", "He made us wonder with mention of the Texas-born Bush, who\u2019s trying to become the third member of his family to win the White House.", "Cruz said: \"And we finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field\u2026 $13.8 million in the bank, $3.5 million more than the Jeb Bush campaign.\" Cruz added that if he\u2019d predicted such an outcome relative to Bush six months before, reporters would have laughed aloud. Early in 2015, Bush drew headlines for raising money at a vigorous clip.", "No giggling here. But was Cruz right about his campaign having the biggest pile of cash on hand and exceeding Bush\u2019s balance by $3.5 million?", "Campaign vs. campaign, you bet your cacti.", "But throw in money raised by PACs and Super PACs devoted to individual candidates and it could be there\u2019s far more money stowed away to boost Bush. Then again, PAC fundraising updates won\u2019t be filed until 2016.", "Campaign vs. campaign", "To our inquiry, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed us a list indicating that Cruz\u2019s campaign ended the year\u2019s third quarter, June through September 2015, with more cash on hand than any other Republican aspirant.", "Separately, we fetched a Federal Election Commission summary, dated Oct. 19, 2015, stating that through September 2015, Cruz\u2019s campaign had nearly $13.8 million cash on hand. And Cruz\u2019s balance, according to the document, exceeded the cash on hand of any of 15 other listed current or former Republican presidential candidates. At No. 2, retired surgeon Ben Carson had nearly $11.3 million cash on hand, according to the summary, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with nearly $11 million and Bush with nearly $10.3 million.", "To be precise, per Cruz\u2019s claim in Houston, Bush\u2019s cash on hand of $10,271,129 was a little more than $3.5 million less than Cruz\u2019s $13,778,904.", "We\u2019re not saying here that Cruz outraised everyone. According to another FEC summary, also dated Oct. 19, 2015, Carson raised some $31 million through September 2015, outpacing Cruz\u2019s nearly $27 million and Bush\u2019s nearly $25 million.", "Businessman Donald Trump, who has led many Republican voter polls, reported a scant $254,773 cash on hand through the third quarter. But Trump, who's wealthy, also has declared plans to self-fund his candidacy. Maybe how much cash he has on hand isn\u2019t significant. Also, Politico noted Oct. 15, 2015, Trump fielded about $3.7 million in donations in the third quarter.", "Notably too, Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders each ended the quarter having raised more money and also having more cash on hand than any Republican. Clinton, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state, had nearly $33 million on hand, according to the FEC, and Sanders, a Vermont senator, had $27.1 million.", "PACs and Super PACs", "There\u2019s another wrinkle if you consider how much money PACs and Super PACs devoted to candidates may have in cash on hand.", "According to a chart built by the New York Times, last updated Oct. 16, 2015, Bush-backing PACs and Super PACs had $98.2 million cash on hand through June 2015. In contrast, Cruz PACs and Super PACs had $37.5 million cash on hand. We don\u2019t see a path to more recent balances; a footnote to the Times chart says most of these groups aren\u2019t required to file an updated report until Jan. 31, 2016.", "Separately, the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending, posted a chart in October 2015 showing Bush PACs and Super PACs fielding far more money than any other hopeful, again with information limited to what such groups had reported through June 2015:", "SOURCE: Web post, \"Behind the Candidates: Campaign Committees and Outside Groups,\" Center for Responsive Politics, last updated Oct. 27, 2015 (accessed the same day)", "The chart is preceded by explanatory text: \"The modern presidential campaign isn't a single organization. Yes, there's always an official campaign committee. But for every White House candidate, there is usually at least one super PAC or other outside organization devoted to getting him or her elected. These groups can solicit unlimited donations and later use them to pummel rivals \u2013 or, as seems to be the case this cycle, take on some of the duties traditionally handled by a campaign, such as organizing town hall meetings or doing voter outreach.\"", "The explanation continues: \"Outside groups aren't allowed to coordinate with official campaign committees, but they're often run by friends and former staffers \u2013 even family members \u2013 of the candidate they're helping. Overall, as of the middle of 2015, single-candidate super PACs in the presidential race had raised more money than the candidates themselves. But that wasn't true among Democrats, whose potential nominees raised more than the super PACs supporting them.\"", "Frazier of Cruz\u2019s camp agreed by email it could be that money accumulated to promote Bush\u2019s candidacy still runs ahead of funds raised for Cruz\u2019s cause. Regardless, she reminded, Cruz limited his Houston claim to funds raised by campaigns alone.", "Our ruling", "Cruz said his campaign \"finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field\u2026 $13.8 million in the bank, three and a half million dollars more than the Jeb Bush campaign.\"", "This is all so, though Bush still might remain ahead (perhaps way ahead) in money accumulated on behalf of a Republican. We won\u2019t know how much total cash has been stashed to help each candidate until PACs report again in 2016.", "We rate this claim Mostly True.", "MOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.", "Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "Emails, Catherine Frazier, national press secretary, Ted Cruz presidential campaign, Oct. 26, 2015", "\"Presidential Pre-Nomination Campaign Disbursements September 30, 2015,\" \"Presidential Pre-Nomination Campaign Receipts Through September 30, 2015,\" Federal Election Commission, Oct. 19, 2015", "News story, \"Trump not exactly self-funding his campaign,\" Politico, Oct. 15, 2015", "News graphic, \"Which Presidential Candidates Are Winning the Money Race,\" New York Times, last updated Oct. 16, 2015 (accessed Oct. 26, 2015)", "Web post, \"Behind the Candidates: Campaign Committees and Outside Groups,\" Center for Responsive Politics, last updated Oct. 27, 2015 (accessed the same day)", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
