Gov. Gavin Newsom is among the state\u2019s biggest gun control backers.", "He led the campaign to place Proposition 63, known as the Safety For All Initiative, on the state\u2019s November ballot. It would require instant background checks for ammunition purchases; strengthen checks for gun purchases and ban the possession of large, detachable military-style magazines; and require the immediate surrender of firearms for people convicted of serious and violent crimes.", "The Safety For All campaign made a recent statement about the prevalence of gun dealers in California. It\u2019s a colorful claim like Obama\u2019s, but has a bit more hard data to back it up.", "\"There are at least twice as many licensed firearm dealers in California as there are McDonald\u2019s,\" the campaign\u2019s spokesman said in recent email.", "PolitiFact Georgia rated a similar claim in 2013 as Mostly True.

A Cal State Northridge study cited the same figure.", "A McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman could not immediately confirm that figure. The company\u2019s website, however, puts its nationwide restaurant total at more than 14,000.", "Assuming 1,165 is correct for California, there would need to be at least 2,330 licensed gun dealers in the state to make the campaign\u2019s statement correct.", "Photo by Mike Mozart / Flickr", "Gun dealers", "To be licensed in California, gun dealers must obtain both state and federal permits; be 21 or older; pay a $200 application fee; have a valid address; and undergo criminal and credit background checks.", "They don\u2019t necessarily need a commercial storefront.", "Pinpointing the number of licensed gun dealers in the state is not simple.", "The Safety For All campaign referred us to data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.", "The ATF keeps a monthly log on its website of how many dealers and pawnbrokers are licensed to sell guns in each state.", "This month\u2019s tally shows 2,315 dealers and pawnbrokers licensed to sell guns in California.

About 5 percent or less of federal license holders, in all firearms categories, never go on to obtain an equivalent state firearms license required by the California Department of Justice, Root said.", "But taking 5 percent away from the 2,900, would still leave far more than twice as many McDonald\u2019s.", "Our rating", "Lt.
