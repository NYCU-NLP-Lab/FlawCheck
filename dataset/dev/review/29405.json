["The president -- who has repeatedly said without evidence that the 2020 election was plagued by fraud -- urged Republican Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.", "Secretary of State Raffensperger -- Georgia\u2019s top elections official, who is responsible for certifying results -- and his office\u2019s lawyer repeatedly pushed back against Trump\u2019s allegations during the January 2 phone call.", "And Gabriel Sterling, Georgia\u2019s voting system implementation manager, subsequently\u00a0held a press conference at which he also debunked claims by Trump.", "\u201cI personally found it to be something that was not normal, out of place\u2026 Nobody I know who would be president would do something like that to a secretary of state,\u201d Sterling said of the call.", "Below, AFP Fact Check breaks down the key claims made by Trump.", "\u201cThis is a faulty election result,\u201d the US president said during the call, a recording and transcript of which were released by The Washington Post.", "But the ballots\u00a0in Georgia were counted on three separate occasions,\u00a0each confirming\u00a0Biden\u2019s win. The results were certified by Raffensperger, while Governor Brian Kemp, also a Republican, certified the southern state\u2019s 16 electors for the Electoral College vote.", "The Georgia result was significant to the overall outcome of the November 3 general election, helping push Biden to a decisive 306 to 232 victory over Trump.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen nothing in our investigations of any of these data claims that shows there are nearly enough ballots to change the outcome,\u201d Sterling said of claims by Trump\u2019s team.", "Attorney Cleta Mitchell acknowledged on the call that Georgia officials have information that Trump\u2019s team does not, saying: \u201cYou have data and records that we don\u2019t have access to.\u201d", "During the call, Trump said that \u201cclose to 5,000\u201d dead people voted in the election.", "Raffensperger said the actual number was two. \u201cSo that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he told the president.", "\u201cThey are shredding, shredding ballots and removing equipment. They\u2019re changing the equipment on the Dominion machines and, you know, that\u2019s not legal,\u201d Trump said.", "Ryan Germany, the general counsel for Raffensperger\u2019s office, rejected both claims.", "\u201cThe only investigation that we have into that -- they have not been shredding any ballots. There was an issue in Cobb County where they were doing normal office shredding, getting rid of old stuff, and we investigated that. But this stuff from, you know, from you know past elections,\u201d he said.", "And Sterling said: \u201cThere is no shredding of ballots going on. That's not real. It's not happening. There\u2019s shredding of envelopes that were the non-used ones or there's also shredding of the secrecy envelopes that came through.\u201d", "The secrecy envelopes -- which shield the ballots -- are \u201cjust basically trash,\u201d while the ballots themselves are being kept as required by law, he said.", "Germany said that neither machines nor parts from Dominion Voting Systems -- a company that Trump and his supporters have\u00a0repeatedly targeted with unfounded vote fraud claims -- were removed.", "Sterling agreed. \u201cNo one is changing parts or pieces out of Dominion voting machines.... I don't even know what that means. It's not a real thing. That's not happening,\u201d he said.", "Trump said a \u201cwhole gang took the stuff from under the table\u201d during the counting process, and that ballots were also scanned multiple times.", "The first claim apparently refers to alleged wrongdoing shown in a video of containers of ballots being brought out and counted -- an assertion that has been previously fact-checked by AFP and found to have no merit.", "Frances Watson, the chief investigator in the office of Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, testified on December 5 that \u201cour investigation and review of the entire security footage revealed that there were no mystery ballots that were brought in from an unknown location and hidden under tables as had been reported by some.\u201d", "Fulton County, where the vote count took place, and Sterling have also said that the clip does not show wrongdoing.", "On the second claim, Raffensperger said: \u201cWe did an audit of that, and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times.\u201d", "Ballots being scanned multiple times would have shown up in the hand recount of votes, which Sterling said did not reveal problems with machine scanning.", "\u201cIf somebody took a stack of ballots and scanned them multiple times, you would have a lot of votes with no corresponding ballots. So let's go over the numbers one more time. Statewide... for the sheer number of ballots, they were off by .1053 percent,\u201d he said.", "\u201cFor the margin, they were off by .0099 percent, which shows that the machines scanned properly, our counties did a great job of following these batches and doing the hand count properly, appropriately, with scrutiny, and with observers.\u201d", "\u201cYou had out-of-state voters. They voted in Georgia, but they were from out of state,\u201d Trump said.", "Germany said the claim was inaccurate.", "\u201cEvery one we\u2019ve been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately,\u201d he said.", "\u201cThey moved back in years ago.
