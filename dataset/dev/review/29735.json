["\u201cSmoking Gun! Joe Biden\u2019s Dept. of Energy Blocked Texas from Increasing Power Ahead of Killer Storm\u201d reads the headline of the article published February 20, 2021 on Infowars.com, a site run by far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.", "The article, shared more than 8,600 times according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, continues: \u201cAn Emergency Order from the Biden administration\u2019s Department of Energy shows Texas energy grid operator ERCOT was instructed to stay within green energy standards by purchasing energy from outside the state at a higher cost, throttling power output throughout the state ahead of a catastrophic polar vortex.\u201d ERCOT is the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state\u2019s power grid operator.", "Jones was banned from Facebook and permanently suspended from Twitter in 2018 for violating the company\u2019s abusive behavior policy. He is best known for disputing the veracity of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the Sandy Hook school massacre in 2012, which he has described as an elaborate hoax involving \u201ccrisis actors\u201d, implicating the administration of then-US president Barack Obama.", "A similar article with the same byline was published here, and the claim was also shared on Facebook here.", "The frigid air mass that paralyzed parts of the southern and central United States claimed more than 70 lives, left millions temporarily without power and froze water lines.", "Officials fielded complaints over shockingly large power bills caused by tiered pricing from energy suppliers during the unusual cold weather crisis, which Houston's mayor said was ultimately preventable. Four ERCOT board members announced their resignation on February 23.", "ERCOT communications manager Leslie Sopko said of the Infowars article\u2019s claims: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation floating around.\u201d", "Rather than forcing strict compliance with \u201cgreen energy standards,\u201d as the Infowars article says, the Department of Energy approved extra use and acknowledged the possible environmental impact of the emergency allowances.", "\u201cBecause the additional generation may result in a conflict with environmental standards and requirements, I am authorizing only the necessary additional generation,\u201d Acting Secretary of Energy David Huizenga wrote in his order.", "\u201cWe worked with the DOE to put the order in place,\u201d Sopko told AFP in an email, sharing a link to the February 14 notice which advised that some units could \u201coperate up to their maximum generation output in certain limited circumstances, notwithstanding federal air quality or other permit limitations.\u201d", "She explained that the purpose of the order was to ask power suppliers which kind of exemption they needed, given the weather emergency.", "The first exemption option ensures that generators are able to \u201cexceed any permitted limit\u201d of emissions or waste during Energy Emergency Alerts (EEA) levels 2 or 3, Sopko said.", "ERCOT defines the range of EEA alerts here. Levels 2 and 3 are the most severe.", "\u201cThe second allowance provides this same protection, but also enables a generator that would otherwise be required to go offline to instead remain online at its minimum operating level so that it is available for dispatch during an EEA Level 2 or 3.\u201d", "The order itself confirms that DOE granted ERCOT\u2019s request and found \u201cthat an electric reliability emergency exists within the State of Texas that requires intervention in order to preserve the reliability of the bulk electric power system.\u201d", "A Department of Energy spokesman told AFP via email that the ERCOT request was granted later that same day, February 14. The order and request are also available on the DOE website here.", "The Infowars article also claims that Biden\u2019s administration \u201cbasically ordered ERCOT to throttle its energy output... while knowing full well Texans could freeze to death in their homes with zero electricity as temperatures plunged into the single digits.\u201d", "President Joe Biden issued a major-disaster declaration on February 20 for much of Texas, providing badly needed assistance. This could help users pay their exorbitant electric bills, said Michael McCaul, a Republican congressman from the state.", "The claim that the DOE decreed energy be sold to ERCOT at a steep price is also untrue. The article reads: \u201cMoreover, the order instructed an \u2018incremental amount of restricted capacity\u2019 to be sold to ERCOT at \u2018a price no lower than $1,500/MWh,\u2019 an increase of over 6,000 percent over February 2020 prices of $18.20.\u201d", "The DOE spokesman explained that the department is not a market regulator and does not set energy prices.", "Other disinformation shared during the 2021 winter storm includes a fake tweet from Senator Ted Cruz about climate change, that renewable energy failed in Germany and was to blame for US power shortages, and that a pastor had refused to provide shelter from the cold.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
