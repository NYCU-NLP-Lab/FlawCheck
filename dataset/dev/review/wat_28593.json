["By Robert Farley, Eugene Kiely and Lori Robertson", "Posted on April 3, 2018", "President Donald Trump fired off a flurry of immigration-related tweets beginning on Easter morning, but his messages included muddled and inaccurate claims.", "Not long after sending\u00a0Easter greetings to his Twitter followers, the president blamed \u201cridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release\u201d for preventing border patrol agents from doing their job at the Mexico border.", "Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. \u201cCaravans\u201d coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2018", "Contrary to his tweet, there is no \u201cliberal (Democrat)\u201d law for \u201cCatch & Release\u201d of people caught illegally crossing the border. Rather, it is mostly a policy, and one the Trump administration claimed last year to have reversed.", "Despite changing the policy, however, the administration says its ability to entirely end the so-called catch-and-release practice is hampered by \u201cloopholes\u201d regarding the detention of unaccompanied minors, families and asylum-seekers. But it would be a stretch to place the blame for those \u201cloopholes\u201d on Democrats.", "Catch-and-release refers to the practice of allowing some immigrants caught in the U.S. without proper documentation to be released back into the U.S., pending an immigration court hearing, rather detaining or immediately deporting them.", "The policy emerged years ago as the country faced a backlog of court cases involving people who illegally crossed the border and a shortage of space to hold them at immigration detention centers.", "While Mexicans and Canadians caught at the border are quickly returned, George W. Bush issued a policy\u00a0in 2006 that required people from all countries caught trying to cross the border illegally to be detained until they could be returned. \u201cThe Administration has effectively ended the policy of \u2018catch and release\u2019,\u201d the Bush administration said at the time.", "The policy change cut the number of \u201caliens\u201d released from 113,000 in FY2005 to \u201cnearly zero\u201d by mid-FY2007 and increased the demand for detention space, according to an April 2009 report\u00a0by the Department of Homeland Security.", "That policy remained under President Barack Obama, said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, but a flood of unaccompanied minors, families with children and asylum-seekers created new issues.", "Two court cases, in particular, affect detention decisions related to unaccompanied children and their families. Under a court-approved settlement in 1997 called the Flores Settlement Agreement, DHS could detain unaccompanied children for only 20 days before releasing them to foster families, shelters or sponsors, pending resolution of their immigration cases. That agreement was signed during the Clinton administration in 1997. In 2015, a federal judge ruled that families with children should also be released as quickly as possible.", "The Trump administration also says border patrol agents are hampered by a\u00a02008 law \u2014 the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act\u00a0\u2014 which limits how long DHS can detain children from countries other than Mexico and Canada.", "That law was designed to prevent human trafficking and reduce the risk of abduction and exploitation. The legislation was introduced by Democratic Rep. Howard Berman, but it was cosponsored by a bipartisan group of three Republicans and three Democrats. It passed both the House and the Senate by unanimous consent, and was signed into law by Bush, a Republican president.", "So, while it is true that the administration is hampered in its efforts to detain certain immigrants, the president\u2019s tweet inaccurately blames\u00a0\u201cridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release.\u201d", "\u201cThe administration does not entirely have a free hand in how it handles an influx of new arrivals, especially if some of them are children,\u201d Jessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that describes itself as an advocate of low immigration, told us via email. \u201cBecause of a recent order from a federal judge, in effect, all children must be released. And, the number of new illegal arrivals has outstripped the number of available funded space to house them when they demand immigration hearings. Under the law, ICE cannot exceed the level of detention beds that Congress has funded \u2013 that would be spending public money that it doesn\u2019t have. The Trump administration asked for more money than Congress decided to appropriate, so I think it is fair to hold Congress responsible for the shortage of detention funding that would help address the illegal influx.\u201d", "Shortly after taking office, Trump issued an executive order directing the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to \u201c[terminate] the practice commonly known as \u2018catch and release,\u2019 whereby aliens are routinely released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law.\u201d Two months after implementing the policy change\u00a0on Feb. 20, 2017, then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly declared in\u00a0El Paso\u00a0and\u00a0San Diego\u00a0that \u201cwe have ended dangerous \u2018catch and release\u2019 enforcement policies.\u201d", "DHS statistics indicate\u00a0that under Trump there has been a sharp rise in the number of individuals detained after being apprehended at the border, even as border apprehensions declined.", "But a Reuters investigation published on June 6, 2017, found that despite Kelly\u2019s proclamation, \u201cimmigration attorneys, government statistics and even some officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u201d suggest \u201cthere has been no clear change to the catch-and-release policy.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s in large part because there are legal constraints on who can be detained and for how long, due to a shortage of beds and a court ruling limiting the stay of women and children in custody to 21 days,\u201d the Reuters story states.", "Sessions acknowledged as much before the Senate Judiciary Committee\u00a0in October, when he was asked by Sen. Ted Cruz why \u201cthe policies of catch and release of the Obama administration are still continuing in the current administration.\u201d", "\u201cEssentially, it\u2019s not the policy,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the reality that there are so many people claiming and being entitled to hearings that we don\u2019t have the ability to provide those hearings, and they are being released into the community and they\u2019re not coming back for their hearings. It\u2019s still unacceptable.\u201d", "Sessions said that DHS had a backlog of 600,000 immigration court cases, up from 300,000 in 2011, and that a growing number of people apprehended \u201cclaim they should not be deported because they have a fear of being sent back home.\u201d And, he said, those people, under current law, are entitled to hearings.", "Sessions argued that \u201cloopholes\u201d in the law allowing release of some unaccompanied minors, families and asylum-seekers are \u201ctoo big.\u201d", "In a background briefing for reporters on April 2, senior administration officials said the White House is working with the Department of Homeland Security on a legislative package \u201cto close these loopholes.\u201d One senior administration official argued that Democrats have opposed their legislative efforts, but that\u2019s different from what the president said when he claimed that \u201cridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release\u201d are preventing border patrol agents from doing their job.", "On Twitter and in remarks to reporters, the president also criticized Mexico on Easter for failing to help the U.S. stop illegal immigration. In doing so, however, he distorted the facts when he claimed that \u201cbig flows of people\u201d are illegally entering the U.S. from Mexico \u201cto take advantage of DACA,\u201d\u00a0a program started in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama via executive action.", "These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want in on the act!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2018", "Trump\u00a0repeated his claim about the DACA program being a magnet for people illegally entering the U.S. from Mexico when he briefly spoke to reporters prior to Easter mass at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.", "Trump, April 1: Mexico has got to help us at the border. And a lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of DACA,\u00a0and we\u2019re going to have to really see.", "They had a great chance. The Democrats blew it. They had a great, great chance but we\u2019ll have to take a look, because Mexico has got to help us at the border. They flow right through Mexico. They send them into the United States. It can\u2019t happen that way anymore.", "Trump\u2019s claim that \u201ca lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of DACA\u201d ignores the fact that people now illegally crossing into the U.S. are not eligible for DACA \u2014 either as it was originally implemented in 2012 by Obama or currently under Trump.", "As we wrote in \u201cThe Facts on DACA,\u201d the Obama-era program defers deportation proceedings for two years for qualified individuals who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. The program also gives those who are approved work authorization, and the approvals can be renewed.", "Under the Obama administration, DACA applicants had to be physically present in the U.S. on June 15, 2012 and living continuously here since June 15, 2007, in order to qualify, among other requirements. That\u2019s still the case for the limited number of people who are still eligible for the program under the Trump administration, which has sought to end it.", "The\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0announced\u00a0on Sept. 5, 2017, that it would \u201cwind-down\u201d the program by only processing renewals that expire by\u00a0March 5 and not accepting any new applications. Trump\u00a0called on Congress to come up with a permanent legislative solution.", "At this point, the program does not accept new applications \u2014 except \u201cfrom individuals who previously received DACA and whose DACA expired before Sept.\u00a05, 2016, or whose most recent DACA grant was previously terminated,\u201d as explained by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Also, those already in the program, or whose DACA authorization expired on or after Sept. 5, 2016, can apply to renew their DACA status.", "Those exceptions were granted by the Trump administration pending the outcome of\u00a0a legal challenge to the president\u2019s 2017 decision\u00a0to rescind the program.", "That means that no one currently crossing the border illegally would have been eligible for DACA as it existed under Obama.\u00a0And such immigrants still aren\u2019t eligible for the program under Trump.", "At the April 2 background briefing for reporters, a senior administration official said the possibility of DACA legislation encourages illegal immigration. That\u2019s an opinion, but the fact is that those currently crossing the border illegally are not eligible for DACA \u2014 so they cannot \u201ctake advantage of DACA,\u201d as Trump claimed.", "In an Easter morning tweet, Trump\u00a0also warned that illegal immigration was \u201cgetting more dangerous,\u201d citing \u201ccaravans\u201d of people coming to the Southwest border.\u00a0On April 2, he repeated the warning and demanded that Mexico \u201cmust stop them\u201d and \u201cnot allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws.\u201d", "Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large \u201cCaravans\u201d of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws\u2026..", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2018", "He again mentioned the caravans on April 3.", "The president is referring to the annual caravan organized by the activist group Pueblo Sin Fronteras (People Without Borders), which says it provides humanitarian assistance to migrants and refugees, and works for their rights.", "We spoke with\u00a0Irineo Mujica Arzate, the director of Pueblo Sin Fronteras in Mexico, who told us this year\u2019s caravan includes about 1,150 people, with about 80 percent of them from Honduras. That\u2019s by far the largest caravan in the approximately 10 years the group has been organizing such events and \u201ca big shock,\u201d he said.", "The recent election in Honduras may be a factor. In January, Honduras\u00a0President Juan Orlando Hernandez was sworn in for a second term after a disputed election, which led to protests in which 30 people were killed, according to Reuters. Both Mexico and the United States supported Hernandez.", "Last year\u2019s caravan included about 300 people, with about 60 to 80 of those actually reaching the U.S. border at Tijuana, Arzate said.", "He expects that many in the caravan now won\u2019t reach the border this year either, and he says many want to stay and work in Mexico. \u201cMexico is not just a place to pass through anymore,\u201d he said, noting that there are \u201ca lot of intentions\u201d among those in the caravan.", "Others will get to the border, realize how difficult it is to enter the United States, and either go back to their home countries or stay in Mexico, he said. Some may try to seek asylum in the U.S. In fact, CNN reported that another member of Pueblo Sin Fronteras said the migrants would do that.", "Pueblo Sin Fronteras doesn\u2019t want to \u201cstorm people into the country,\u201d Arzate told us, but instead make migrants aware of their options, try to reform the systems in Mexico and the U.S., and try to find \u201csensible ways\u201d for them to \u201clive without fear.\u201d", "The Associated Press reported on April 3 from Mexico that the caravan has spent the past several days in\u00a0the town of Matias Romero in the state of Oaxaca. That\u2019s more than 2,000 miles from Tijuana and more than 800 miles from Brownsville, Texas. \u201cAfter days of walking along roadsides and train tracks, the organizers now plan to try to get buses to take participants to the final event, an immigrants\u2019 rights conference in the central state of Puebla later this week,\u201d the AP reported, writing that the caravan is more of a symbolic event meant to draw attention to migrants\u2019 issues.", "The Mexican government said in an April 2 press release that it had deported about 400 of the caravan participants to their home countries, and that it would offer refugee status in qualified cases. It called the caravan a \u201cpublic demonstration\u201d and said it had been keeping the U.S. government informed about the issue, as it had in previous years.", "As for the asylum process in the United States, those crossing the border without proper documentation can apply for asylum if a U.S. official finds they have a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of prosecution or torture if they return to their home countries, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. (If an asylum officer doesn\u2019t find there\u2019s a credible fear, the immigrant can request a review by an immigration judge. If the judge agrees with the officer, the immigrant can then be removed from the U.S.) Those with credible fear are still placed in expedited removal proceedings, according to USCIS.", "Asylum cases have high denial rights, and getting a hearing can take years.\u00a0In fiscal year 2017, 61.8 percent of the asylum decisions were denials, according to data compiled by TRAC, a research center at Syracuse University. And the denial rates for Honduras, 78.1 percent, and Mexico, 88 percent, were even higher.", "Fox News aired a segment Sunday morning on the caravan before the president tweeted about the issue, and Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council\u00a0union, said those seeking asylum would be able to stay in the United States while their cases slowly worked their way through the system. While waiting, asylum applicants can be detained or granted \u201chumanitarian parole\u201d if they meet certain standards. (The ACLU has filed a class-action lawsuit\u00a0against the Trump administration over detainment policies, arguing that five Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices \u201chave almost entirely stopped granting parole since early 2017.\u201d)", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
