While it is possible that Bundy would start a new\u00a0Twitter account to take advantage of the media attention, the rancher has\u00a0had a Facebook account for more than a year and frequently\u00a0uses the social network to provide updates from Oregon.", "Second, the @Ammon_Bundy Twitter account uses a screenshot from one of Bundy's videos as its profile pic. If the account were real, it's likely that Bundy would have used an actual photo.", "Finally,\u00a0MSNBC reporter Tony Dokoupil, who has been reporting from the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge since shortly after Bundy's men took over the building, confirmed that the account was fake:", "While it's possible that someone associated with the Bundy is operating the @Ammon_Bundy Twitter account, it's more likely that the account is being operated by a remote sympathizer.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
