The next day there had appeared to be a small blister that had been poped. Today it looks like this. I found out that it is a chemical burn. So I am thinking how on earth did this happen to my 1 year old daughter, and it turns out shes not the first baby its happened to. Pampers crusiers diapers have a chemical in them that when mixed with urine or stool can give the baby a chemical burn. These dipears have not had a recall on them, I urge everyone to tell there friends and family to not use pampers with DRY MAX anymore!", "[Collected via e-mail, May 2010]", "I recently heard that the New Pampers Dry Max diaper has been causing severe diaper rash and chemical burns on the infant using this product.

As part of its technical evaluation, staff from each agency considered certain characteristics of the diaper, including the materials used, the construction of the diaper, and heat and moisture retention issues.In addition, CPSC staff reviewed clinical and toxicological data found in published, peer-reviewed medical literature. CPSC also critically reviewed data submitted by Procter & Gamble (P&G) and the results of a human cumulative irritation patch study conducted by P&G in May 2010. Further, chemistry, toxicology and pediatric medicine information provided by Health Canada was reviewed by CPSC.", "Health Canada declared likewise, stating that their safety review \"has not identified any cause for concern.\"", "Health Canada and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) have reviewed consumer incident reports and other information involving Pampers Dry Max diapers.
