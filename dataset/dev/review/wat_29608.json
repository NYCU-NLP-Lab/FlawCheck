The protest\u2019s organizers, NYC Stands with Standing Rock and Decolonize This Place, also called for Columbus Day to be renamed Indigenous People\u2019s Day.", "\u201cA stark embodiment of the white supremacy that Roosevelt himself espoused and promoted,\u201d pontificated the group of protesters in a statement. \u201cThe statue is seen as an affront to all who pass it on entering the museum, but especially to African and Native Americans.\u201d", "The article's use of the words \"after\" and \"now\" drew an undeniable parallel between the \"Unite the Right\" protest of 12 August 2017 and the events described. It reported that protesters \"purportedly planned the event three weeks in advance in order to make the bizarre show of leftist rage as special as possible,\" referencing an undated Monday. It linked to a Guardian piece which also stated that a protest occurred on \"Monday\":", "More than 200 people cheered outside the museum as activists covered the statue of Roosevelt on horseback flanked by an African American and Native American on either side and demanded it be ultimately removed.", "Activists from the groups NYC Stands with Standing Rock and Decolonize This Place organized the protest to draw attention to the museum\u2019s encouragement of racist tropes, and implored New York City to rename Columbus Day to Indigenous People\u2019s Day.", "However, nowhere in the Daily Wire piece was any indication that the source material was dated 11 October 2016, making its implication that such protests were a part of or after 12 August 2017 clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia extremely misleading.", "Right above the Guardian item's dateline is a note indicating that the piece was nearly a year old as of August 2017:", "Although it is possible Daily Wire overlooked the Guardian article's date, it added an image taken from Twitter dated 10 October 2016:", "The scene outside of @AMNH today as #DecolonizeThisPlace's anti-#ColumbusDay tour covered the Teddy Roosevelt statue.

Their museum takeover was a symbolic protest against the gentrification and displacement unfolding just outside the marble walls, in poor communities of color of the surrounding city that are excluded from such elite cultural spheres.", "The action was incubated in Artists Space in Soho, a freewheeling downtown studio that cultivates innovative contemporary art projects. During their three-month \u201ctakeover\u201d at Artists Space, Decolonize is hosting meetings, performances and film screenings, along with art builds, in which activists gather to create protest signs, paint banners, and construct other DIY productions focused on gentrification, global labor activism, Palestinian resistance, and movements for indigenous rights around the world.", "October 2016 news articles reported that the indigenous rights group protested for removal of the statue, modification of exhibits in the American Museum of Natural History, and the return of items they believed were culturally significant artifacts:", "Four hundred indigenous rights activists occupied the American Museum of Natural History Monday afternoon in protest of Columbus Day and museum exhibitions they consider to be demeaning to indigenous peoples.", "The protest, which featured a rally on the museum steps, a \"de-colonization\" tour, and the draping of a large parachute over an equestrian statue of Theodore Roosevelt, was organized by the artist activist group Decolonize This Place in collaboration with a number of community groups, including NYC Stands with Standing Rock.", "Activists made three major demands of the museum: Remove the Roosevelt Statue, modify exhibits related to indigenous peoples and return various indigenous artifacts to the descendants of those to whom they belonged.
