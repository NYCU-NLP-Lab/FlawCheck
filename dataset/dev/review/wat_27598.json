["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on November 16, 2017", "A TV ad by a coalition of liberal groups leaves the false impression that 47 million \u201cmiddle-class\u201d households would be \u201cstuck with the tab\u201d for Republican tax cuts that benefit the wealthy. The 47 million figure refers to all households \u2014 not just the \u201cmiddle class.\u201d", "In fact, an estimated 24.7 million middle-income households would see a tax cut by 2027, while 11.4 million would see a tax hike, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, which the ad cites as its source.", "In all, 109.3 million households would see a tax cut \u2014 a point not made in the ad \u2014 and about 47.5 million would see a tax hike by 2027, the TPC analysis shows.", "The TV ad, which is running in Washington, D.C., is part of an anti-tax cut campaign launched by Not One Penny, a project of a coalition of liberal groups called Tax March.\u00a0The House Republicans introduced their bill \u2014 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 on Nov. 2. The Senate Republicans\u00a0unveiled\u00a0their version on Nov. 9.", "The expected tab: $1.49 trillion in lost federal tax revenue over 10 years,\u00a0according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.", "The ad starts with a young man in a checkered shirt and baseball cap pulling up a chair at the bar and ordering a beer. He is soon joined by a group of nattily attired men (wearing suits and flashing cufflinks) and women (wearing dresses and pearls).", "The announcer in the ad\u00a0says the GOP tax cut provides \u201ca huge tax cut to millionaires, billionaires and wealthy corporations.\u201d On the screen, the ad says, \u201cRichest Americans Get an Average Tax Cut of $278,000,\u201d citing the Tax Policy Center\u2019s analysis of the House tax bill. That\u2019s true.", "The House bill\u00a0would\u00a0cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent; abolish the\u00a0alternative minimum tax; abolish the estate tax in 2025; and collapse the seven income tax brackets, ranging from\u00a010 percent to 39.6 percent, to four (12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent).\u00a0The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center\u2019s\u00a0analysis\u00a0of the bill shows that the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers \u2014 those with annual income of more than $5 million \u2014 would see an average tax cut of $278,370 in 2027.", "\u201cWhile President Trump has promised to cut taxes primarily for those with middle incomes, the House version focuses a large share of its benefits on the highest-income taxpayers,\u201d\u00a0Howard Gleckman,\u00a0a senior fellow with TPC, writes.", "But the ad exaggerates the impact of the bill on the \u201cmiddle class.\u201d", "After saying the bill would provide \u201ca huge tax cut\u201d to the wealthy, the announcer says \u201cand the middle class gets stuck with the tab.\u201d As the announcer speaks, the actor portraying the wealthy man slides the bar tab over to the \u201cmiddle class\u201d man, while viewers see this on the screen: \u201c47 million households get a tax increase.\u201d That\u2019s misleading.", "The ad leaves the false impression that all 47 million are in the \u201cmiddle class.\u201d That\u2019s actually the number of all tax units, or households, that would see a tax hike, not just those in the \u201cmiddle class,\u201d according to the Tax Policy Center\u2019s income distribution table for 2027. The center projects that 25.5 percent of 186.5 million households would see a tax increase in 2027 \u2014 which is roughly 47.5 million people.", "The Tax Policy Center separates taxpayers into five groups, or quintiles, to determine the effects of the tax plan on different income groups. Its data\u00a0show that 24.7 million in the middle-income group \u2014 those with \u201cexpanded cash income\u201d of between $54,701 to $93,200 \u2014 would see a tax cut and 11.4 million would see a tax increase. (Expanded cash income is\u00a0pretax income that also includes employee and employer contributions to health insurance and tax-preferred retirement accounts, retirement account income, non-taxable Social Security or pension income, employer share of payroll taxes, and food stamps, as defined by the TPC.)", "As we have written before, most people view themselves as \u201cmiddle class.\u201d\u00a0In a\u00a0June 2017 Gallup survey, 44 percent said they were \u201cmiddle class,\u201d 28 percent chose \u201cworking class\u201d and 18 percent said \u201cupper-middle class.\u201d", "If we expand the definition of \u201cmiddle class\u201d to include everyone except those in the top 20 percent \u2013 that is, 80 percent of all tax units with expanded cash income of less than $154,901 in 2027 \u2014 then nearly 38 million would see a tax increase. That\u2019s closer to the 47 million figure cited in the ad. But that ignores the 93.2 million people in those income groups who would get a tax cut, according to our calculations.", "The fact is, as we\u2019ve said before, there will be winners and losers in whatever Congress finally approves \u2014 even among the wealthiest taxpayers, who currently pay the largest share of all federal taxes.\u00a0Earlier this year, the TPC estimated that the top 20 percent of taxpayers pay two-thirds of all federal taxes and, within that group, the top 1 percent pays nearly a quarter.", "As we\u2019ve already noted, the ad correctly states that the Tax Policy Center found that households with annual income of more than $5 million would see an average tax cut of about $278,000 in 2027. But that\u2019s the average. TPC estimates that 30.8 percent of these millionaires and billionaires will pay an average of $298,020 more in taxes.", "So the \u201cmiddle class\u201d won\u2019t get \u201cstuck\u201d with the entire \u201ctab\u201d and, in fact, most of them will see a tax cut.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
