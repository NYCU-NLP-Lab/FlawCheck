["Following an unconventional campaign season disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic,\u00a0President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris won the election after capturing enough states to receive\u00a0more than the necessary number of electoral votes.", "Since Biden and Harris were projected as the winners on Nov. 7, Trump and his campaign have filed \u2014 and lost \u2014 dozens of lawsuits in various states and amplified debunked conspiracy theories about mass voter fraud.", "Meanwhile, members of the Republican Party, including some Trump administration officials, perhaps most notably Attorney General William\u00a0Barr, have disputed claims about widespread voter fraud.", "The bipartisan acknowledgment\u00a0of Biden's win from elected officials in local, state and federal\u00a0governments has\u00a0not stopped the spread of false claims about the election on social media, however.", "Truth and Action, a Facebook group which identifies itself as a news and media organization, posted a photo with\u00a0crowds at Trump, Obama and Biden events, along with vote totals for each man, implying that the crowd sizes indicate Biden doesn't actually have that many supporters.", "Truth and Action has not responded to a request from USA TODAY\u00a0for comment.", "More:Fact check: What's true and what's false about the 2020 election", "The Biden campaign eschewed events with large crowds due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed the lives of 274,000\u00a0Americans and infected 14 million\u00a0others. USA TODAY fact-checked this as both Biden and Trump campaigned.", "Drawing a stark contrast to the Trump campaign \u2014 which has encouraged large rally crowds and subsequently\u00a0seen various COVID-19 outbreaks in some of those places\u2014\u00a0Biden incorporated coronavirus\u00a0guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention central into his campaign by wearing\u00a0masks, social distancing\u00a0and avoiding crowds.", "The Facebook post, which has been widely shared, includes several images of events: two for Trump, with the caption \"TRUMP: 74 million votes\"; two for Obama, with \"OBAMA: 69 million votes,\" and four photos along with \"BIDEN: 80 million votes.\"", "The post's\u00a0Trump\u00a0photos are from an October campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona, which had\u00a0about 2,000\u00a0attendees.", "The top photo of an Obama event is an October 2008 rally in St. Louis\u00a0with 100,000\u00a0attendees, and the bottom photo is from his 2008\u00a0Democratic National Convention acceptance speech\u00a0with an estimated 84,000 attendees.", "The four photos of Biden events all show the influence of the\u00a0coronavirus, with\u00a0circles on the ground ensuring that the limited number of masked\u00a0attendees were socially distanced.", "The top left image in the Biden collage is a Reuters photo from a June 30 campaign event in Wilmington, Delaware, according to AFP.", "The second Biden photo is of\u00a0an event where he met with a small group of socially distanced supporters on\u00a0Labor Day in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.", "The third photo shows a meeting between Biden and a handful of socially distanced small business owners at Carlette's Hideaway in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.", "The last photo of a Biden event is of a press conference, held at the\u00a0Mountain Top Inn and Resort in Warm Springs, Georgia, during the final stretch before Election Day.", "The 2020 election saw record voter turnout and, campaign rally crowds aside, Biden is the first presidential candidate in history to receive 80 million votes.", "The previous record was held by Obama, who received over 70 million votes in the 2008 election. In this year's election, Trump also surpassed Obama's record, receiving\u00a073 million votes.", "The claim is rated as MISSING CONTEXT. The 2020 election\u00a0was an unusual\u00a0campaign season, primarily because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Trump campaign disregarded many COVID-19 precautions\u00a0and\u00a0hosted large crowds,\u00a0while Biden made following coronavirus guidelines\u00a0central to his efforts. Biden's lack of crowds does not translate to a lack of support from voters, but rather a consistent\u00a0adherence to pandemic safety guidelines.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
