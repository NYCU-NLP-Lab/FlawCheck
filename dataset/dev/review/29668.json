We rated that statement\n\nBarely True\n\n.", "The McCain campaign's evidence for its charges are Obama's votes on budget resolutions. A kind of blueprint for the federal budget, a budget resolution sets targets for committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. Obama joined Democrats on what were largely party-line votes expressing the desire to roll back the Bush tax cuts in order to fund popular programs. The resolution envisions tax cuts rescinded on people making about $42,000 and higher.", "But voting for a budget resolution is quite different from voting for a tax increase. Budget resolutions are nonbinding, don't have the force of law and don't include precise details on taxes or spending. They're different from legislation that raises or lowers tax rates.", "In the case of the McCain ad, we're more concerned with the voiceover that says, \"The perks are amazing, like a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year.\" That seems designed to make the average viewer think that Obama wants to raise taxes on people making that amount, which isn't true. Obama wants to increase taxes by rolling back the Bush tax cuts on people making more than $200,000 if single or $250,000 if married filing jointly.", "What the ad implies is a major distortion that seems intent on confusing people about what Obama's policies are. When McCain's ads talked about tax-related votes, we found the statement\n\nBarely True\n\n. In another instance, he made claims about Democrats raising taxes by $500-million through a budget resolution, a claim we found\n\nFalse\n\n.", "But the new Web ad pushes the envelope too far when the narrator says \"a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year.\" It's a gross distortion of Obama's proposals to say they would raise taxes on \"everyone\" who earns that much, and we rate McCain's claim False.", "U.S. Senate,\n\nVote on budget resolution\n\n, March 14, 2008", "U.S. Senate,\n\nVote on budget resolution\n\n, June 4, 2008", "The Tax Policy Center,\n\nAn Updated Analysis of the 2008 Presidential Candidates' Tax Plans\n\n, July 23, 2008", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
