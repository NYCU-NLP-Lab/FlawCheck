["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on September 17, 2019", "President Donald Trump last year signed a bill \u2014 the Right to Try Act \u2014 that provided another avenue for terminally ill patients to gain access to unapproved medications still in development. But there\u2019s no evidence that the new law is saving \u201ca lot of people,\u201d as the president claims.", "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for collecting data on patients treated with so-called investigational medicines under the Right to Try Act, told us that it has no information on the number of people who have used the law to gain access to the medications. A group that advocated for the new law has publicly identified two people who have used the law.", "The president made his remarks at a White House meeting on another health issue, e-cigarettes.", "Trump, Sept. 11: [W]e\u2019ve done more than any administration probably in the history of the country. You just look at one point after another point, whether it\u2019s regulation cuts, whether it\u2019s tax cuts. You look at Right to Try \u2026 where people are able to use some of the incredible innovations that we\u2019ve developed with the greatest labs and the greatest doctors in the world. And they can use them, instead of being forced to move to \u2014 and leave \u2014 to other countries that don\u2019t have a clue, compared to us. And now they have Right to Try.", "And, by the way, a lot of people are being saved. A lot of great things are happening with Right to Try.", "He brought it up again two days later in a speech to House Republicans at their annual conference retreat, which was held this year in Baltimore. It was the third time this month that the president touted the success of the program.\u00a0In Baltimore, the president congratulated the Republicans for passing the bill, which he signed more than a year ago on May 30, 2018.", "Trump, Sept. 13: And you have to see the success. People used to go to Asia. They\u2019d go to Europe. They\u2019d go all over the world looking, if they had money. Most people didn\u2019t have the money, so they\u2019d go home and they\u2019d die. Now they have the Right to Try.", "First, to be clear, the FDA for years has approved applications from patients seeking access to investigational drugs through the agency\u2019s \u201cexpanded access\u201d program, which oversees the use of such medicines for patients who are not able to participate in clinical trials.", "The FDA\u2019s \u201chistory of facilitating access to investigational therapies reaches back to the 1970s; however, regulations did not specifically describe a pathway for access to unapproved drugs until 1987,\u201d FDA officials write in a May 2017 paper on the history of the program. \u201cFDA later published revised regulations in 2009, further clarifying the expanded access process.\u201d", "As we have written before, then-FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb\u00a0told Congress in October 2017 that the FDA had approved 99 percent of the more than 1,000 annual applications it has received in recent years for \u201cexpanded access to treat patients with investigational drugs and biologics.\u201d", "The new law provides a new path to investigational medicines. It circumvents the FDA and gives terminally ill patients access to unapproved drugs more quickly than through the FDA\u2019s expanded access program. But we can\u2019t find any evidence that \u201ca lot of people are being saved\u201d as a result of it.", "The Right to Try Act requires drug manufacturers to submit an annual summary report of any use of investigational medicines. The summary must include information on \u201cthe number of doses supplied, the number of patients treated, the uses for which the drug was made available, and any known serious adverse events,\u201d according to the law.", "The law also requires the FDA to post that information on its website. But no information is available.", "So far, the FDA has only published a public notice saying that the agency intends to propose a deadline for drug manufacturers to submit annual reports. But it hasn\u2019t proposed a deadline for those reports yet.", "\u201cThe FDA does not currently have information on the number of patients who have accessed drugs, or the drugs that have been sought for use, under Right to Try,\u201d FDA spokeswoman Sandy Walsh told us in an email.", "The Goldwater Institute \u2013 a proponent of the law \u2013 has disclosed examples of two people being helped by the new law in the first year. The institute told us that it expects later this month to announce more patients who were helped.", "One of the two people helped by the law so far is Matt Bellina, an ALS patient who advocated for the law and attended the bill-signing ceremony. Bellina, whose name appears in the bill\u2019s title, used the new law to gain access to NurOwn \u2014 an experimental drug that is being developed by an Israeli-based company called BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics.", "But that company announced a year ago that it will not provide access to any other patients, citing costs. The new law doesn\u2019t require insurance companies to pay for such treatments.", "\u201cAs we were unable to identify a practical funding solution, we unfortunately are not in a position to initiate access to NurOwn under RTT at this time,\u201d Chaim Lebovits, president and CEO of BrainStorm, said in a June 26, 2018, statement.", "Lebovits told Reuters at that time that BrainStorm would provide NurOwn under the new law only to Bellina, and that Lebovitz would personally pay for it.", "Other companies have decided not to make their investigational medicines available under the new law, either, because it does not require FDA oversight.", "At least two major pharmaceutical companies \u2013 Pfizer and Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company \u2013 have said that they will make their investigational drugs available only through a process that involves FDA oversight, referring to the FDA\u2019s existing expanded access program, according to Alison Bateman-House, co-chair of the NYU School of Medicine Working Group on Compassionate Use and Pre-Approval Access. Bateman-House has advised both Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson on investigational medicines.", "When the Right to Try Act was being considered by Congress, Pfizer issued a position statement that said, \u201cPfizer supports policies that protect the integrity of clinical trials and FDA oversight to maintain the best interests of patients, with an emphasis on safety. \u2026 Pfizer\u2019s overarching policy principle with respect to Federal Right to Try Legislation is to protect the FDA oversight of expanded access, safety, and the integrity of clinical trials.\u201d", "Pfizer\u2019s statement noted that in 2017, before Right to Try was enacted, the company \u201creceived 4,818 requests for preapproval access to 24 investigative medicines from 59 countries; approximately 98 percent of requests were granted.\u201d", "Janssen issued a similar policy statement on investigational medicines prior to the adoption of the new federal law that stressed its support for FDA oversight.", "Janssen\u2019s policy, in the form of a question and answer, including this: \u201cDoes Janssen accept Right to Try requests? We are committed to helping patients with serious illnesses and their families request access to our investigational medicines. We support these requests through our established review and evaluation processes, which includes independent review by the FDA to assure full consideration of available safety data of which the FDA may be uniquely aware.\u201d", "In an email, Bateman-House told us: \u201cMy educated guess is that the number of patients utilizing Right to Try is a mere trickle, if that.\u201d", "We don\u2019t know that that is the case, either. All we can say for sure is that two people so far have accessed investigational drugs using the new system, according to a group that supports the new law.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
