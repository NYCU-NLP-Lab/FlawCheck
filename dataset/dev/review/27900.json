["By Eugene Kiely and Lori Robertson", "Posted on June 13, 2019", "In his much publicized visit to Iowa, President Donald Trump made a few false and misleading statements about agricultural exports:", "The president visited Iowa on June 11, the same day former Vice President Joe Biden campaigned in the state. Trump, who won Iowa by\u00a09.4 percentage points in 2016, touted his record on farming issues and took aim at the policies of former President Barack Obama and Biden,\u00a0the current frontrunner\u00a0in the Democratic presidential field.", "In his remarks, the president touted a recent agreement with Japan on U.S. beef exports.", "Trump, June 11:\u00a0And all around the world, my administration is knocking down barriers to products made, grown, and raised in the USA \u2014 not only on the farm, but all over. Just recently reached an agreement to eliminate restrictions and expand exports of American beef \u2014 you saw that \u2014 to Japan by up to $200 million a year. You saw that. There\u2019s somebody selling beef over there. They haven\u2019t bought our beef since the year 2000.", "He\u2019s right that Japan agreed \u201cto eliminate restrictions and expand exports of American beef,\u201d but he\u2019s wrong that Japan hasn\u2019t imported U.S. beef since 2000.", "In a press release last month, the Department of Agriculture announced that Japan has agreed to give full access to U.S. beef products \u2014 the final step in a years-long process to fully restore access to the lucrative Japanese market.", "Japan was one of at least 100 countries that closed their markets to U.S. beef in late 2003 because of a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, according to a 2013\u00a0report by the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office. The ban had a devastating impact on U.S. beef exports.", "\u201cIn 2003, U.S. producers exported $3.86 billion (1.3 million metric tons) of beef and beef products. The following year, as a result of the widespread import ban, U.S. exports fell by 79 percent, to $808 million,\u201d the USTR report said.", "After two years, Japan eased its restrictions, and the U.S. started to sell some beef and beef products in Japan again. Access was further expanded in 2013.", "\u201cIn December 2005, Japan restored partial access for U.S. beef muscle cuts and offal items from cattle 20 months of age and younger,\u201d the USDA said in its release. \u201cIn February 2013, Japan extended access to include beef and beef products from cattle less than 30 months of age.\u201d", "According to USDA, U.S. beef exports to Japan totaled $1.4 billion in 2013, $1.6 billion in 2014, $1.3 billion in 2015, $1.5 billion in 2016, and $1.9 billion in 2017. The value of U.S. beef exports to Japan topped $2 billion in 2018, according to USDA data compiled by the U.S. Meat Export Federation. (See chart below.)", "The export federation website contains 10 years of USDA data, from 2009 to 2018, and shows Canada was the top market for U.S. beef in 2012. But Japan has been the best customer for U.S. beef since 2013.", "Trump cherry-picked figures to claim a drop of \u201cover $22 billion\u201d in agricultural exports during the last two years of the Obama administration. But the decrease (actually $15.3 billion from 2014 to 2016) masks the overall increase in export values under Obama.", "Agricultural export values rose during the first half of Obama\u2019s tenure, peaking in 2014, before falling mostly as a result of lower commodity prices. Even with the drop in the last two years, export values rose by 17 percent over Obama\u2019s time in office. They\u2019ve gone up another 4 percent under Trump.", "Trump also misleadingly claimed that \u201cfarm income declined\u201d under \u201cpast administrations.\u201d The overall trend, similar to that of agricultural exports, has been a rise since the early 2000s, with a peak in 2013 and a general decline since.", "Trump, June 11:\u00a0Past administrations did nothing while the farm income declined. In the last two years of the previous administration, farm income plummeted by more than $30 billion, and\u00a0agricultural exports dropped by over $22 billion. Did you know that? Did you know that? You\u2019ll be hearing it a lot over the next little while. That\u2019s not a good number. \u2026", "By the end of this year, farm incomes are projected to rise by more than $10 billion from the day I was elected.", "Here\u2019s the longer-term trend for both farm income and agricultural exports since 1993.", "As the chart shows, the value of agricultural exports grew under Obama. Calendar-year\u00a0figures from the USDA\u00a0show that under former President George W. Bush the annual average was $70.8 billion, and it was $131.8 billion under Obama \u2013 a clear upward trend.", "Export values dropped from 2014, when they hit their peak of $150 billion, to 2015, when they were $133 billion. Jason Grant, director of the Center for Agricultural Trade at\u00a0Virginia Tech University, told us in an email that about 75 percent of the decrease from 2014 to 2015 was because of declining commodity prices, and the rest was attributable to a decline in export quantities.", "\u201cThe US also experienced a large appreciation in the value of the US dollar against a broad basket of foreign currencies,\u201d Grant said. \u201cDollar appreciation makes it more expensive for foreign customers to purchase our products, thus contributing to the decline in US agricultural exports during the last two years of the Obama presidency.\u201d", "Looking at quantities, not dollar values, shows that \u201c2016 was a record year for US soybean and corn exports (58 and 56 million metric tons, respectively, compared to 50 million metric tons each in 2014), even though the 2016 value of these exports fell short of 2014 values,\u201d Grant said.", "In other words: \u201cLower values do not always translate into farmers and ranchers producing less or selling less on the global market,\u201d since these values are moving with the change in commodity prices.", "Since Trump took office, the value of exports edged up a bit \u2013 to $138 billion in 2017 and $139 billion in 2018, according to data from the USDA. The 2018 figure is just $4 billion higher than exports in 2016.", "The average monthly agricultural export value in Obama\u2019s last year in office was $11.2 billion, and it has averaged $11.5 billion over the past 12 months under Trump.", "As for\u00a0net farm income\u00a0(a \u201cbroad measure of profits,\u201d the USDA\u00a0says), that, too, has been on a general upward trend since 2003. Farm income did drop by about $30 billion, as Trump said, from 2014 to 2016, when net farm income was $61.5 billion. But that came after an increase from 2009, the year Obama took office, until 2013, when it hit a peak of $123.4 billion. We\u2019ve explained before\u00a0that this trend largely reflects the ebb and flow in commodity prices.", "\u201cTrade agreements help and are important for longer run sustainability of the agricultural sector, but year-to-year changes in farm income are driven largely by movements in commodity prices which are a function of supply (weather, yield, stocks, etc) and demand balances,\u201d Grant said.", "Farm income during the Trump administration has fluctuated \u2014 rising in 2017 to\u00a0$75.2 billion, dropping to a projected $63.1 billion in 2018 and edging back up to a projected $69.4 billion in 2019.", "That would be a $7.9 billion increase from 2016 to 2019. Trump claimed \u201cfarm incomes are projected to rise by more than $10 billion from the day I was elected,\u201d a figure we couldn\u2019t confirm since USDA farm income figures are by year, not month or day. The 2019 projection is still below the recent historical average, the USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service notes. \u201cIf realized, inflation-adjusted net farm income and net cash farm income would remain below their historical averages ($90.0 billion and $108.0 billion) across 2000-17,\u201d it says.", "USDA ERS says \u201cmost\u201d of the forecasted bump up in farm income for 2019 was driven by an expected increase in commodity prices. Why are prices expected to go up this year? It\u2019s classic supply-and-demand. \u201cCommodity prices are expected to increase because of severe flooding and poor planting conditions which has plagued the Midwest this spring,\u201d Grant said. \u201cWhen supply is expected to fall, this is supportive for prices.\u201d", "The president also wrongly claimed that past trade policies \u2014 particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA \u2014 have hurt U.S. farmers \u201cso badly over a 15-year period.\u201d", "Trump, June 11:\u00a0How bad was NAFTA \u2014 what they did to you with NAFTA? And that\u2019s why, for 15 years, you\u2019ve been going \u2014 that and other reasons. That\u2019s why the farmer has been hurt so badly over a 15-year period.", "As we\u2019ve written before, U.S. farmers have had some down years recently, but not over a 15-year period and not because of trade.", "Farmers \u201cexperienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014 due to strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports,\u201d a February 2018 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said. Since 2013, farm income has been generally falling, mostly because of a drop in commodity prices.", "\u201cThe ag sector is seeing some hard times, but it is because of lower prices and not trade,\u201d Wallace E. Tyner, who teaches agricultural economics at Purdue University, told us when we looked into this issue last year. \u201cWeather has been pretty good, production high, and prices therefore lower.\u201d", "As for the impact of NAFTA on farmers, \u201cU.S. agriculture has benefited significantly from increasing market access in Canada and Mexico as a result of the formation of NAFTA some 25 years ago,\u201d according to a February paper written by agricultural economists at Purdue University\u2019s College of Agriculture.", "\u201cThe share of U.S. agricultural exports to these two countries has increased from 14.2% when the agreement was first signed to almost 30% currently,\u201d the paper said.", "Along with an increased market share, there has been a significant increase in the total value of U.S. agricultural exports since NAFTA took effect.", "In 1993, a year before NAFTA was implemented,\u00a0the U.S. exported about\u00a0$43 billion worth of agricultural products, according to USDA\u2019s calendar year export data. By 2007, agricultural exports had more than doubled ($90 billion). The next year, agricultural exports exceeded $100 billion for the first time ($114.8 billion). The total value of agricultural exports last year was nearly $140 billion.", "Tyner, a coauthor of the Farm Foundation paper, told us in an email that it\u2019s \u201chard to say exactly how much of the change in share of ag exports to Mexico and Canada was due to NAFTA.\u201d But, he added, \u201cMy sense is that most of it was due to NAFTA.\u201d", "In fact, the\u00a0USDA has a chart on its website\u00a0that shows NAFTA has had more of an impact \u2014 in terms of export value \u2014 than any other trade agreement. The USDA chart compares the five-year agriculture export average for periods immediately before and after the implementation of 12 trade agreements since 1994.", "\u201cAgricultural trade among NAFTA\u2019s member countries has grown tremendously during the NAFTA period,\u201d the USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service wrote in a February 2015 paper on the impact of NAFTA. \u201cThe total value of intraregional agricultural trade (exports and imports) among all three NAFTA countries reached about $82.0 billion in 2013, compared with $16.7 billion in 1993 (the year before NAFTA\u2019s implementation).\u201d", "Trump also claimed that his replacement for NAFTA \u2014 the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, or USMCA \u2014 will reverse the damage he says NAFTA has inflicted on farmers, claiming his plan is going \u201cto do pretty much the opposite\u201d of NAFTA.", "The Farm Foundation paper said that the USMCA will have a \u201cmodest\u201d impact on farm exports.", "\u201cThe new NAFTA agreement, the USMCA, consolidates the agricultural market access gains from the original NAFTA and in some sectors leads to an improvement in market access, most notably in dairy and poultry exports to Canada,\u201d the report said.", "The USMCA will expand import quotas in Canada for dairy and poultry products, the Purdue researchers say.", "We won\u2019t know the impact of the USMCA for sure unless and until it is ratified by Congress. For now, NAFTA remains in effect.", "Mary Marchant, a professor in Virginia Tech\u2019s Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, told us for a previous article on agricultural exports: \u201cBottom line, trade has been good for ag. overall & we are dependent on it for our success.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
