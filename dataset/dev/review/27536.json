["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Is President Barack Obama disavowing the Creator?\n\nA political action committee called Government Is Not God, or GING-PAC for short, has produced a newspaper ad claiming to reveal \"the true agenda of Barack Hussein Obama.\" The group says it\u2019s running the ad in several newspapers, mainly in Ohio and Florida.\n\nThe black-and-white ad includes a laundry list of claims against Obama, dealing with topics from Islamic law to abortion, most of which PolitiFact has debunked as False or Pants on Fire. The kicker: an accusation that Obama puts an atheistic spin on the Declaration of Independence. Obama, it says, is the \"only president in history who has deliberately removed the words \u2018endowed by their Creator\u2019 when referring to the Declaration of Independence not once but several times.\"\n\nFirst, a quick American history review. The Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia, proclaiming America\u2019s separation from the British empire and asserting the right to govern itself. Here\u2019s the most famous line, and the one at issue:\n\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\n\nPresidents and politicians often cite that line to stir the passions of voters. But is Obama unique among presidents in skipping the religious reference?\n\nIndeed, we did find video of Obama paraphrasing the line and leaving out the \"Creator.\"\nAt the 2010 Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute awards gala, he said it as, \"we hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, endowed with certain inalienable rights, life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\n\nSeveral conservative websites appear to be tracking his omissions.\n\nBut there\u2019s also video evidence of Obama saying \"their Creator\" when citing the Declaration. The blog of the liberal group People for the American Way even put together a compilation video of Obama reciting the line verbatim.\n\nBut Obama's not \"the only president in history\" who has done it. A website that investigates urban legends dug up examples of Calvin Coolidge, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan omitting the \"Creator.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nGING-PAC\u2019s ad says Obama is \"the only president in history who has deliberately removed the words.\"\n\nNot so. It\u2019s true that Obama has omitted \"endowed by their Creator\" in speeches, but he\u2019s also included those words many times. And at least three other presidents -- including Ronald Reagan -- have left out the Creator.\n\nWe rate the claim False.", "GING-PAC newspaper ad, September 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nGING-PAC website, \"Campaign to save America from Barack Hussein Obama,\" accessed Sept. 25 & 26, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, \"PAC's newspaper ad filled with falsehoods,\" Sept. 26, 2012\n\nDeclaration of Independence, July 4, 1776\n\nYouTube, \"Obama Leaves \"By their Creator\" Out of Declaration of Independence at Hispanic Caucus Speech,\" Sept. 18, 2010\n\nRightWingWatch.org, \"How Many Times Does Obama Have to Say 'Endowed by Their Creator' Before the Right Will Stop Lying?\" Aug. 9, 2012\n\nUrbanLegends.About.com, \"Email: Obama Omits 'Creator' in Declaration Quote,\" accessed Sept. 27, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
