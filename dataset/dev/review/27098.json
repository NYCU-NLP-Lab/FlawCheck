Mild reactions go away within a few days on their own. Severe or long-lasting side effects are extremely rare. Vaccines are continually monitored for safety, to detect rare adverse events\u2026 Remember, you are far more likely to be seriously injured by a vaccine-preventable disease than by a vaccine.\u201d", "Similar claims that vaccines contain toxic chemicals, or are harmful to health, also circulated online during the COVID-19 pandemic and were previously debunked by AFP here, here and here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
