["After President Joe Biden signed an executive order Jan. 20 regarding the miles of border wall under construction during the Trump administration, some took to Facebook to claim \u2014 inaccurately \u2014\u00a0that\u00a0Biden will tear down the wall.", "A Facebook user by the name of Giggle Palooza posted Jan. 24, \u201cJust seen where Biden signed an Executive Order to tear down the border wall. You all happy now?\u201d", "Since it was published, the post has received more than 3,000 interactions and more than 2,900 comments, many pointing out that the post is false. The Facebook user has not responded to USA TODAY\u2019s request for comment.", "More:Fact check: Posts criticizing Biden order on gender discrimination lack context", "The claim is referring to Biden\u2019s executive order that ended border wall construction projects and will redirect the project funds elsewhere.", "In his proclamation, Biden wrote that the government would no longer divert taxpayer dollars to construct a border wall. It is one of several executive actions the president signed since taking office on Jan. 20.", "\u201cLike every nation, the United States has a right and a duty to secure its borders and protect its people against threats,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution. It is a waste of money that diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security.\u201d", "Biden\u2019s executive order paused work on each construction project on the southern border wall within seven days and paused the obligation of funds related to the construction of that wall.
