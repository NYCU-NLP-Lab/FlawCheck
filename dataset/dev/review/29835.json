["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on March 6, 2020", "Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s endorsement of Joe Biden has been used as fuel for misinformation about the former vice president\u2019s gun control policy. If elected president, Biden did not say he is \u201ccoming for your guns.\u201d", "Joe Biden locked up endorsements from three former opponents in the Democratic presidential primary on the eve of Super Tuesday. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke each pledged support for the former vice president.", "The endorsement from O\u2019Rourke, who has called for a mandatory buyback policy for certain types of guns, has fueled a range of misinformation about Biden\u2019s proposed gun policy, which hasn\u2019t actually changed. That fact has been overlooked by many who are opposed to stricter gun laws, including at least one congressman who posted a video featuring his AR-15. Republican Rep. Ken Buck, of Colorado, challenged Biden and O\u2019Rourke to \u201ccome and take it\u201d in his video.", "Asked if Buck knew that Biden\u2019s proposed gun policy doesn\u2019t include a mandatory buyback program, spokeswoman Lindsey Curnutte told FactCheck.org in a phone interview that the video was made \u201cin response to Beto\u2019s general view on the issue.\u201d", "After O\u2019Rourke made his endorsement public at a rally in Dallas on March 2, he and his wife, Amy, took Biden to a Whataburger restaurant and broadcast the dinner on Facebook live. A clip from that video has now been widely misconstrued to say that Biden is \u201c\u2018coming for\u2019 your guns.\u201d", "One story perpetuating the falsehood carries the headline: \u201cWatch: Biden Looks Into The Camera And Promises To Take Away Americans\u2019 Guns.\u201d", "He didn\u2019t say that.", "This is what he actually said:", "\u201cAnd by the way, this guy can change the face of what we\u2019re dealing with, with regard to guns \u2014 assault weapons \u2014 with regard to dealing with climate change, and I just want \u2014 I\u2019m warning Amy, if I win, I\u2019m coming for him.\u201d", "This clip shows the exchange taken from the full video:", "Other organizations, including the National Rifle Association\u2019s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, have made more sweeping claims based on how Biden accepted the endorsement.", "Here\u2019s what Biden told the crowd after O\u2019Rourke spoke at the rally:", "\u201cI want to make something clear, I\u2019m going to guarantee this is not the last you\u2019ve seen of this guy \u2014 you\u2019re going to take care of the gun problem with me. You\u2019re going to be the one who leads this effort. I\u2019m counting on you. I\u2019m counting on you. We need you badly \u2014 the state needs you, the country needs you, you\u2019re the best.\u201d", "The NRA-ILA took a clip of that statement and spliced it with a clip of O\u2019Rourke advocating removal of certain types of guns during a Democratic debate in September. O\u2019Rourke advocated a mandatory buyback program, saying in part, \u201c[H]ell yes, we\u2019re going to take you\u2019re AR-15, your AK-47. We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d The NRA-ILA posted its spliced video on Facebook with this text: \u201cJoe promised that if president, Beto \u2018will be the one who leads\u2019 his gun control efforts.\u201d", "But it\u2019s misleading to suggest that Biden has adopted O\u2019Rourke\u2019s view on a mandatory buyback policy. Biden\u2019s platform\u00a0on gun control does not include mandatory buybacks. Rather, it offers a buyback program for those who don\u2019t want to register their \u201cassault weapons\u201d under the National Firearms Act.", "While the NRA-ILA\u2019s video is misleading, a headline on a website called The Truth About Guns goes further, claiming, \u201cBiden Would Make Beto O\u2019Rourke His Administration\u2019s Gun Confiscation Czar.\u201d", "Biden has made no such commitment and has not supported \u201cgun confiscation.\u201d", "A campaign advisor for Biden emphasized that O\u2019Rourke will be working on \u201cgrassroots\u201d efforts. This is the full statement that the campaign sent when we asked for clarification:", "\u201cVice President Biden is the sole candidate in the race who has beaten the NRA \u2014 twice. The epidemic of gun violence that is wracking communities across our nation is a full-blown moral and safety crisis, especially for our children. He\u2019s honored to have Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s endorsement, and is thrilled that Beto will be leading grassroots support for the Vice President\u2019s gun reform proposals that we absolutely can\u2019t afford not to make as soon as possible. It\u2019s vital that the next president be able to take on and defeat the gun manufacturers and their lobby, and Joe Biden is the only candidate with the right background and credentials to do so.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
