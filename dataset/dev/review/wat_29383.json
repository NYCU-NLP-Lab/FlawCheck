["About this rating", "Since at least early December 2020, a photograph of \"Sin City\" actor Nick Stahl appeared in an online advertisement along with the words: \"Actors Who Have Died in 2020 So Far This Year...\"", "This was misleading, however, as Stahl was not dead.", "The advertisement was hosted by the Outbrain advertising platform and likely appeared on a number of websites. For example, as of Dec. 10, 2020, it was showing up on the right-hand sidebar on CNN's website:", "An Outbrain advertisement appears on CNN.com on Dec. 10, 2020.", "To be clear, CNN and other websites that run Outbrain ads do not handpick individual ads. Thousands of new ads are activated on Outbrain each day. Publishers like CNN have the ability to select ad categories and block others, but they do not pick and choose specific advertisements to run on their websites. In other words, CNN did not handpick the misleading Stahl ad that made it appear he was dead.", "Readers who clicked on the advertisement were led to a more than 50-page slideshow story on Definition.org. The article was titled: \"All The Celebrities We\u2019ve Lost In The Past Year.\" Stahl did not appear on the list because, again, Stahl was not dead.", "The strategy behind such misleading online advertisements is to make more money on ads appearing against the slideshow than it cost to run the initial ad that showed Stahl's photograph. It's referred to as advertising \"arbitrage.\"", "Other than \"Sin City,\" Stahl is perhaps best known for his work on 2003's \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\" and the HBO series \"Carniv\u00e0le.\" TV Guide reported that Stahl \"decided to become an actor at age 4 when his mother took him to see a play\" and that he auditioned \"five times for the role of John Connor in 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.'\" He was also \"briefly thought to be missing in 2012 while he spent time in rehab,\" according to TV Guide. His IMDb page showed a number of upcoming projects in the works.", "One of the most prominent death hoaxes we've reported on in 2020 claimed falsely that Drake was killed in a drive-by shooting. Another falsely reported Woody Allen had died. Chuck Norris wasn't spared from death hoaxes in 2020, nor was U.S. President Donald Trump.", "We reached out to CNN about the ad that appeared on their website, and will update this story should we receive a response.", "Snopes debunks a wide range of content, and online advertisements are no exception. Misleading ads often lead to obscure websites that host lengthy slideshow articles with lots of pages. It's called advertising \"arbitrage.\" The advertiser's goal is to make more money on ads displayed on the slideshow's pages than it cost to show the initial ad that lured them to it. Feel free to submit ads to us, and be sure to include a screenshot of the ad and the link to where the ad leads.", "Jordan Liles is a Senior Reporter who has been with Snopes since 2016.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
