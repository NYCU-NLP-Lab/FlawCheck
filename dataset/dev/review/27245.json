That day, the president wrote:", "Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea, and they have given up nothing. Wow, we haven't given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, & no more testing!", "The remark came after Todd appeared on the Today show to discuss an announcement by North Korea that it would suspend both nuclear testing and launching intercontinental ballistic missiles ahead of both a scheduled summit with South Korea, and a prospective summit with the United States.", "\"So far, in this potential summit North Koreans have gotten a lot of out it, what has the United States gotten yet?\" Todd asked:", "We don't have a release of any of those Americans that they've held captive. We don't have a pledge of denuclearization as the ultimate goal.

In February 2016, he also referred to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as \"sleepy.\" Trump also called Todd \"sleepy eyes\" and \"a sleeping son of a bitch\" during a speech in Pennsylvania in March 2018.

He doesn't know,\" Todd said at the time. \"He said once 'I give someone a nickname I stay with it. Sometimes I give someone a nickname and I can't remember how I came up with it but I stick with it.'\" The Meet The Press host \u2014 who was raised in the Jewish religion \u2014 added that he did not take offense at being called \"sleepy eyes.\"", "Breitbart did confirm that while the descriptor in and of itself is not anti-Semitic, it has been used by white nationalists and Nazis in documents containing \"lists\" of \"telltale\" physical markers for Jewish people, including one document circulating online that was promoted by a user on the white nationalist web site Stormfront:", "An excerpt from the 1938 anti-Semitic children's book Der Giftpilz (\"The Poisonous Mushroom\") also makes reference to eyes being a Jewish physical \"marker\":", "One can also recognize a Jew by his lips. His lips are usually puffy. The lower lip often protrudes. The eyes are different too. The eyelids are mostly thicker and more fleshy than ours. The Jewish look is wary and piercing.
