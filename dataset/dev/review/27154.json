The \"pandemic response team\" firing claim referred to news accounts from Spring 2018 reporting that White House officials tasked with directing a national response to a pandemic had been ousted.", "Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer abruptly departed from his post leading the global health security team on the National Security Council in May 2018 amid a reorganization of the council by then-National Security Advisor John Bolton, and Ziemer's team was disbanded. Tom Bossert, whom the Washington Post reported \"had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks,\" had been fired one month prior.", "It's thus true that the Trump administration axed the executive branch team responsible for coordinating a response to a pandemic and did not replace it, eliminating Ziemer's position and reassigning others, although Bolton was the executive at the top of the National Security Council chain of command at the time.", "Legum stated in a follow-up tweet that \"Trump also cut funding for the CDC, forcing the CDC to cancel its efforts to help countries prevent infectious-disease threats from becoming epidemics in 39 of 49 countries in 2018. Among the countries abandoned? China.\" That was partly true, according to 2018 news reports stating that funding for the CDC\u2019s global disease outbreak prevention efforts had been reduced by 80%, including funding for the agency\u2019s efforts in China.", "But that was the result of the anticipated depletion of previously allotted funding, not a direct cut by the Trump administration. And as the CDC told FactCheck.org, the cuts were ultimately avoided because Congress provided other funding.", "On Feb. 24, 2020, the Trump administration requested $2.5 billion to address the coronavirus outbreak, an outlay critics asserted might not have been necessary if the previous program cuts had not taken place. Fortune reported of the issue that:", "The cuts could be especially problematic as COVID-19 continues to spread. Health officials are now warning the U.S. is unlikely to be spared, even though cases are minimal here so far.", "\"It's not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country any more but a question of when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a press call [on Feb. 25].", "The coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China, in the winter of 2019, and cases spread around the globe. The U.S. had 57 confirmed cases as of this writing, while globally, roughly 80,000 patients had been sickened with the virus and 3,000 had died. As of yet, no vaccine or pharmaceutical treatment for the new coronavirus. Data from China suggests the coronavirus has a higher fatality rate than the seasonal flu, although outcomes depend on factors such as the age and underlying health of the patient.", "Readers can find the latest coronavirus information from the CDC here.", "Legum, Judd. \u00a0 \"Unprepared.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Popular Information. \u00a0 25 February 2020.", "Garrett, Laurie. \u00a0 \"Trump Has Sabotaged America\u2019s Coronavirus Response.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Foreign Policy. \u00a0 31 January 2020.", "Sun, Lena H. \u00a0 \"Top White House Official in Charge of Pandemic Response Exits Abruptly.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post.\u00a0 10 May 2018.", "Sun, Lena H. \u00a0 \"CDC to Cut By 80 Percent Efforts to Prevent Global Disease Outbreak.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 1 February 2018.", "Salama, Vivian et al. \u00a0 \"Tom Bossert, Trump's Homeland Security Adviser, Fired as Bolton Takes Power, Source Says.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NBC News. \u00a0 18 April 2018.", "Branswell, Helen. \u00a0 \"New Data from China Buttress Fears About High Coronavirus Fatality Rate, WHO Expert Says.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 STAT. \u00a0 25 February 2020.", "Morris, Chris. \u00a0 \"Trump Administration Budget Cuts Could Become a Major Problem as Coronavirus Spreads.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Fortune. \u00a0 26 February 2020.", "Updated to clarify that the 2018 reductions in CDC efforts referenced were a result of the anticipated depletion of previously allotted funding, not a direct cut by the Trump administration.", "Updated to clarify that cuts to programs intended to fight epidemics globally did not take place.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who started her career as a daily newspaper reporter and has covered everything from crime to government to national politics.
