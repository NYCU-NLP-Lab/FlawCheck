If you look at the polls \u2014 Todd, and you know this no matter what they say \u2014 you look at the polls, Hillary Clinton wins every time with Donald Trump.\"", "For this fact-check, we'll look at whether Beck is accurately characterizing the national head-to-head polls.", "As it turns out, he is.", "Our source is the compilation of national surveys by RealClearPolitics.com. Since a Fox News poll dating back to Feb. 15, Clinton has won every hypothetical head-to-head matchup with the billionaire.", "And in every case, the winning margin has been larger than the poll's margin of error.", "The website\u2019s aggregation of the most recent polls gives Clinton a spread of 10.5 percentage points over Trump.", "The trend has been clear for the past year.", "If you go back to polls released in May 2015 (before Trump was officially a candidate), Clinton has bested Trump in 51 of 58 matchups.

The last time was in a February USA Today/Suffolk survey, where the two-point spread was within the margin of error. That poll has not been repeated.", "His winning margin hasn't been greater than the margin of error since a November survey by Fox News. More importantly, Fox's two newest\u00a0polls, from February and March, both\u00a0show Clinton winning. The March survey gives her a winning margin of 11 percentage points.", "One of those five polls, from early September, hasn't been repeated either.", "Two other surveys released since May 2015 have had him tied with Clinton. The most recent was conducted in early October. But once again, the latest versions of those polls, by Public Policy Polling in late March and CNN/ORC in mid March, have Clinton way ahead.", "Our ruling", "The bottom line is every recent poll shows Clinton clearly ahead of Trump.
