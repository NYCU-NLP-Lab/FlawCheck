(New York Times)", "During Bill Clinton\u2019s Democratic convention speech about Hillary Clinton, the former president touted his wife\u2019s efforts as secretary of state to improve the levels of support for the United States across the globe.", "He cited his wife as \"one of the reasons the approval of the United States was 20 points higher when she left the secretary of state's office than when she took it.\"", "We decided to check whether the approval ratings he cited were accurate.", "We found four surveys that asked questions on a regular basis about how the United States is seen in other countries. We\u2019ll go through them one by one.", "Pew Research Center", "We found Pew data for surveys taken in 20 countries between 2008 and 2013. Respondents were asked, \"Please tell me if you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of the United States.\"", "The figures in the chart below show the change in the favorable ratings -- either up or down -- between 2008, the year before Clinton became secretary of state, and 2013, the year she stepped down from the post.

That\u2019s an increase of 10 percentage points during Clinton\u2019s tenure -- in line with the median country in the Pew survey, but still half of what Bill Clinton said.", "Gallup", "Finally, every year, Gallup has asked respondents in various countries, \"Do you approve or disapprove of the job performance of the leaders\" of various countries, including the United States.", "In 2008, the United States had a 34 percent approval rating. By 2013, that had risen to 46 percent.", "That\u2019s an increase of 12 percentage points -- once again, roughly in line with the Pew and BBC polls and less than what Clinton said.", "Meridian International Center", "When we asked the Clinton campaign for supporting evidence, they pointed to a survey by the Meridian International Center and Gallup\u2019s U.S.-Global Leadership Project.

And the data for Asia in the same poll and the same time frame, according to the campaign, showed an increase from 31 percent to 45 percent. That\u2019s a rise of 14 points, which is less than the 20-point benchmark Clinton used. So we don\u2019t see the Meridian International Center data as supporting Clinton\u2019s assertion.", "Our ruling", "Bill Clinton said, \"The approval of the United States was 20 points higher when (Hillary Clinton) left the secretary of state's office than when she took it.\"", "The approval ratings for the United States did go up on Hillary Clinton\u2019s watch, and the Pew poll found that in some countries they did go up by 19 points or more.
