["By Joseph A. Gambardello", "Posted on October 21, 2020", "A video posted by a European-based group called World Doctors Alliance falsely claims the novel coronavirus is \u201ca normal flu virus\u201d and there is no COVID-19 pandemic. Actually, COVID-19 is deadlier than the seasonal flu, and some European nations are combatting a second wave of cases.", "According to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we remain in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, with an uptick in case numbers and hospitalizations straining the ability of medical centers in some areas to cope. Some European governments have imposed more restrictions to fight another wave of cases.", "Yet on Oct. 10, Heiko Sch\u00f6ning, a German physician and head of a group known by the German acronym ACU2020, announced formation of an organization called World Doctors Alliance to challenge the veracity of the COVID-19 pandemic. The alliance website claims it is \u201cabundantly clear that the \u2018pandemic\u2019 is basically over and has been since June 2020.\u201d", "An 18-minute video announcing the group\u2019s formation was posted on the ACU2020 website but has since been taken down by YouTube for violating its terms of service. Still, portions of the video featuring two doctors challenging the science behind the pandemic are circulating on Facebook with false assertions and statistics.", "Staking out the group\u2019s position, Elke De Klerk, a Dutch general practitioner, says on the video, \u201cWe do not have a pandemic\u201d and calls COVID-19 a \u201cnormal flu virus\u201d \u2013 claims flatly rejected by the WHO, CDC, and other experts.", "De Klerk claims the pandemic designation was based on poor testing, with the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, molecular test returning false positive results in \u201c89 to 94%\u201d of the cases. That\u2019s not true.", "While the false positive rate remains an area of continued examination, preliminary studies show the test\u2019s false positive rate is far less than De Klerk claims. A recent article in the British medical publication The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, said estimates in the U.K. place the false positive rate in the 0.8 to 4% range, while false negatives could run as high as 33%.", "As for the virus that causes COVID-19, scientists universally agree it is a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, not a strain of influenza.", "While the death rate for COVID-19 remains uncertain, as we have reported, evidence\u00a0suggests it is higher than for seasonal influenza.", "In De Klerk\u2019s own country, the Netherlands, there have been more than 6,800 deaths attributed to COVID-19 so far this year, compared to 2,900 due to flu and pneumonia in 2018-19.", "In the U.S., where COVID-19 has caused more than 220,000 deaths, the worst flu season in the past decade killed an estimated 61,000 people in 2017-18, as we\u2019ve reported. In fact, COVID-19 so far has killed more people in the U.S. than the\u00a0past five flu seasons\u00a0combined, and hundreds more die each day.", "In addition, a CDC study released Oct. 20 found hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration had a five times higher risk of death than patients with the flu.", "The other speaker in the video circulating on Facebook is Dolores Cahill, a professor at the medical school at the University College Dublin in Ireland. Cahill, who has become something of a lightning rod as a COVID-19 denier, claims on the video that there have only been 98 deaths in Ireland due to the coronavirus since April.", "But according to Ireland\u2019s Central Statistics Office, more than 1,800 people have died of COVID-19 in the country, all but 200 since April.", "And with cases on an upswing, the Irish government announced Oct. 19 that it was imposing tough new restrictions to slow the spread of the disease. The measures, which will last until at least Dec. 1, require all non-essential retail businesses, barbers, hairdressers, and salons to close and ban gatherings in homes. Restaurants and pubs will be limited to takeout and delivery service.", "Cahill has found herself under fire from both her university, which issued a statement disassociating itself from her views, and the European Union, which asked her to resign from an EU medical panel.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
