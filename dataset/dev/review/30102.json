Incidents of misconduct, which are exceedingly rare, are dealt with swiftly and appropriately.", "It does not appear that a larger number of customers ever stepped forward with subsequent similar claims. Conservative Tribune's report implied that anyone with a Kay Jewelers diamond was at risk of being fleeced, but we could not find any evidence that the claims go far beyond the original report.", "Although BuzzFeed identified at least eight customers who claimed that Kay Jewelers had switched out their gems for stones of inferior quality, we were unable to substantiate that the incidents transpired as described, nor could we track down any information suggesting that the incidents, if accurate, were widespread.", "Bates, Rob. \u00a0 \"'Fake News' And The Issues At Kay Jewelers.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 JCK Magazine. \u00a0 15 December 2016", "McNeal, Stephanie. \u00a0 \"Brides Say Their Engagement Rings Were Lost Or Ruined By Kay Jewelers.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 BuzzFeed. \u00a0 22 April 2016.", "McNeal, Stephanie. \u00a0 \"Kay Jewelers Owner Slams 'Grossly Amplified' Allegations Of Diamond Swapping.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 BuzzFeed. \u00a0 5 June 2016.", "McNeal, Stephanie. \u00a0 \"Women Say Kay Swapped Their Diamond For A Stone Of Worse Quality After A Repair.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 BuzzFeed. \u00a0 25 May 2016.", "Turner, Nick. \u00a0 \"Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\r\nKay Jewelers Owner Denies Engaging in \u2018Diamond Swapping.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Bloomberg. \u00a0 3 June 2016.", "Facebook. \u00a0 \"Boycott Kay Jewelers.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 14 March 2017.", "Conservative Tribune. \u00a0 \"ALERT: If You Had A Diamond Ring Repaired At THIS Store, You May Have A FAKE Now.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 25 May 2016.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
