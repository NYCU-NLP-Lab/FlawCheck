His stance has made him a target of anti-vaccine campaigners and other groups, who have implicated him in conspiracy theories about the crisis.", "The claims appear to trace back to one point made in a lengthy April 7 Instagram post by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nephew of former US\u00a0\u00a0president John F. Kennedy and a leader of the World Mercury Project, which advocates against mandatory vaccination.", "He wrote: \u201cIndian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating vaccine-strain polio epidemic that paralyzed 496,000 children between 2000 and 2017.\u201d", "His post was copied and reposted across Facebook, including here, here, here and here. The claim was also shared in Czech.", "India was officially declared polio-free in 2014 and there is no evidence that almost half a million Indian children were given polio or suffered from paralysis due to vaccine-derived polioviruses.", "Can you get polio from a vaccine?", "Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) are strains of poliovirus that have genetically mutated from the strain contained in the oral polio vaccine, and are extremely rare. They can change into a form that can paralyze and is known as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV).", "According to World Health Organization (WHO) data, there were 17 cVDPV cases recorded in India between 2000 and 2017.", "By going to this link, selecting India and a given year, one is able to find the number of cVDPV cases listed by the WHO.

This was the period when India was carrying out a widespread vaccination campaign of children under the age of five.", "WHO data show a sharp increase in the number of AFP cases in the years of the vaccination campaign. The numbers can be found in the second column of the WHO table, marked AFP.", "The study received criticism for its methodology, partly for including symptoms shown by children between ages five and 15, when the oral polio vaccine campaign focused on children under age five.
