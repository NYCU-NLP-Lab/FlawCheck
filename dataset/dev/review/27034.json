["About this rating", "Impossible and Beyond Meat Burgers share some ingredients with at least one brand of vegan, grain-free dog food selected for the comparison.", "The purported similarity between the three ingredient lists is overstated.", "In late June, 2019, University of California-Davis Professor Frank Mitloehner tweeted the ingredient list of three food items, two of which were popular plant-based burgers and one of which was \u201cpremium dog food\u201d:", "The point, Mitloehner later tweeted, was that the two most notable plant-based imitation burgers, Impossible Burgers and Beyond Meat Burgers, were \u201cindistinguishable from dog food.\u201d From a factual standpoint, the three images accurately depict ingredient lists for (from left to right) a Beyond Meat Burger, \u201cWalk About Dog Food\u201d brand \u201cSuper Premium\u201d grain-free vegan dog food, and an Impossible Burger.", "Let\u2019s get into the weeds: 10 of the ingredients (taking some chemical liberties and ignoring entirely the relative amounts of each) of the 20 listed for the Impossible Burger can also be found among the 28 in the vegan, grain-free dog food:", "Impossible Burger", "Dog Food (grain-free vegan)", "Food Starch Modified", "Pea Starch", "Mixed Tocopherols (Vitamin E)", "Vitamin E Supplement", "Niacin", "Niacin", "Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6)", "Pyridoxine Hydrochloride", "Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)", "Riboflavin Supplement", "Salt", "Salt", "Sunflower Oil", "Sunflower Oil Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols", "Thiamine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B1)", "Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B1)", "Vitamin B12.", "Vitamin B12 Supplement", "Zinc Gluconate", "Zinc Proteinate", "Most of the shared ingredients are vitamins and minerals. Using the current ingredient list (which differs slightly from the one used in the viral tweet), two of the 18 Beyond Meat burger ingredients also appear among the 28 in the vegan grain-free dog food:", "Beyond Meat Burger", "Dog Food (grain-free vegan)", "Pea Protein Isolate", "Pea Protein", "Salt", "Salt", "In the case of the Beyond Meat burger comparison, both use peas as their source for protein. Indistinguishability is perhaps in the eye of the beholder, but significant differences do exist between the burger-ingredient lists and the dog-food lists.", "A broader question, though, is what scientific point does such a comparison serve? One could make a similar argument that the ingredients in high-quality, organic beef dog food are \u201cnearly indistinguishable\u201d from canned beef chili served in the supermarket, but such a comparison wouldn't be all that illustrative. Indeed, like the Beyond Meat burger and the vegan dog food, the chili and the beef dog food both use the same protein source.", "We asked Mitloehner, who studies chemical emissions from animal agricultural practices and who has served as an expert witness defending the agricultural industry in the U.S. Congress, what scientific point he was illustrating with his tweet. Via email, he told us his concerns were with how the plant-based burgers were marketed:", "These plant-based alternatives are often marketed as burgers made from plants. In reality, they fully qualify for the NOVA definition of \u201cultra-processed foods,\" of which many (or most) nutrition scientists, dietitians and clinicians warn us constantly.", "The claim of them being more healthy and/or wholesome than real meat is not supported by facts. These patties are as ultra-processed and consist of almost identical ingredients as dog kibbles.", "If you compare the three, you might have had a hard time identifying the dog food yourself, right?", "Asked about his interest in the topic, Mitloehner told us it stemmed from \u201cthe many media requests I receive about plant-based products including several [media appearences] alongside [Impossible Foods founder] Pat Brown and [Beyond Meat founder] Ethan Brown and the many factually incorrect claims they make about animal agriculture, which often otherwise go unchallenged in the media.\u201d", "The original conceit behind these plant-based burgers was one of sustainability: being able to produce something that tastes like meat using a process that could scale up and still be sustainable. As an example, this is why the Impossible Burger uses GMO yeast to produce a protein \u2014 heme \u2014 that could theoretically be produced by widespread soy cultivation. The amount of soy required to produce heme would not be sustainable in the long-run. (Beyond Meat does not use GMO products and does not include the protein heme, which is touted as the key to Impossible Burger\u2019s taste.)", "These burgers are indeed often marketed as a healthy alternative to meat, and that assertion is a bit muddier. Pound for pound, meatless burgers have comparable amounts of protein, and Impossible Burgers have the same (or more) vitamins, and minerals added, according to Harvard Medical School\u2019s Health Blog:", "The protein content of these newer plant-based burgers has been created to compete with beef and poultry gram for gram. Both the Impossible Burger and Beyond Burger have comparable amounts, the former deriving protein mainly from soy and the later from peas and mung beans.", "Impossible Burger also adds vitamins and minerals found in animal proteins \u2014 like vitamin B12 and zinc \u2014 in amounts equal to (and in some cases, greater than) both red meat and poultry.", "On the negative side, these plant-based burgers also contain comparable, if not elevated, amounts of saturated fat, which can contribute to heart disease. Additionally, Mitloehner\u2019s point about the level of processing in plant-based burgers is a valid one \u2014 many of the ingredients are heavily processed and appear to meet international standards for ultra-processed food \u2014 generally considered to come with a host of nutritional deficiencies.", "In sum, there are shared chemicals in vegan dog food and plant-based burgers. In our view, two shared ingredients out of a combined 46 (in the case of Beyond Meat) or 10 shared ingredients out of a combined 48 (in the case of the Impossible Burger) do not meet the threshold for being \u201cindistinguishable,\u201d and as such we rank the claim mostly false.", "Impossible Foods. \u00a0 \u201cFAQ: What Are the Ingredients?\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 16 August 2019.", "Beyond Meat. \u00a0 \u201cBeyond Burger: Product Detail\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 16 August 2019.", "Chewy.com. \u00a0 \u201cNewman's Own Organics Grain-Free Beef Canned Dog Food, 12-oz, case of 12.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 16 August 2019.", "Amazon.com. \u00a0 \u201cWolf Brand Lean Beef Chili Without Beans, 15 Ounce.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 16 August 2019.", "Mitloehner, Frank. \u00a0 \u201cTestimony Before the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry U.S. Senate.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 United States Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.. \u00a0\u00a021 May 2019.", "Monteiro, C.A., et al. \u00a0 \u201cUltra-Processed Foods: What They Are and How to Identify Them.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Public Health Nutrition. \u00a0 12 February 2019.", "Jacoobsen, Rowan. \u00a0 \u201cThe Biography of a Plant-based Burger.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Pacific Standard. \u00a0 6 September 2016.", "Simon, Matt. \u00a0 \u201cThe Impossible Burger: Inside the Strange Science of the Fake Meat That 'Bleeds'.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Wired. \u00a0 20 September 2017.", "Beyond Meat. \u00a0 \u201cBeyond the Headlines: a Clarification Regarding Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 15 August 2017.", "Beyond Meat. \u00a0 \u201cOur Mission.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 16 August 2097", "Gelsomin, Emily. \u00a0 \u201cImpossible and Beyond: How Healthy Are These Meatless Burgers?\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Harvard Health Blog. \u00a0 15 August 2019.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
