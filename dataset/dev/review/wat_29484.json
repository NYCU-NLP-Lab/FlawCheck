The individual asked if Bhatt could come up with any specific things that people in her life could, cannot, or should have done to help her cope with her depression. She responded by saying that there was no answer to this question because every person is different and experiences depression differently every day. Speaking of her own experience, she added that on some days, talking to other people helped her cope. And on other days, it would be difficult for her to talk to people or answer questions about how she was doing. At the same time, she emphasized the importance of having a supportive person to listen to her without judgement and getting too affected. Mahesh Bhatt also weighed in here, discussing how the ability to listen was a very significant quality in people. He added that it was very important to have someone hear you cry. It is very important that someone listened to you as you cried. At 46:23, there was a follow-up question where an audience member asked, \u201cSo you don\u2019t really want answers?\u201d Responding to this, the director flared up, exclaiming that there were no answers in reality.
