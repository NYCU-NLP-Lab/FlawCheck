["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on February 25, 2019", "A viral meme claims that Girl Scout cookies support Planned Parenthood, but the organization says it has no \u201crelationship or partnership with Planned Parenthood.\u201d", "The first few months of the year bring Girl Scout cookies, and the internet brings overstated claims linking them to abortion.", "One popular meme circulating on social media claims: \u201cBefore you buy Girl Scout cookies, be aware that they support Planned Parenthood, which now endorses full term abortions.\u201d", "Some version of that claim has been going around for years. It dates to at least 2004 \u2014 the same year that Facebook began \u2014 when John Pisciotta, an anti-abortion activist in Waco, Texas, bought ads on a local Christian radio station calling for a boycott of Girl Scout cookies.", "On NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, host Lester Holt interviewed\u00a0Pisciotta and Kathy Cloninger, who had become the CEO of the national Girl Scouts six months earlier, about a local boycott that made national headlines.", "Pisciotta opened the interview, which took place on March 5, 2004, by praising the \u201cGirl Scouts for taking the decision to separate themselves from the controversial organization of Planned Parenthood.\u201d", "Days earlier, in response to Pisciotta\u2019s call for a boycott, \u201cthe Bluebonnet Council of\u00a0Girl Scouts, which oversees troops in the\u00a0Waco\u00a0area and 13 other counties, announced \u2026 that it would not be affiliated with\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0sex-education programs this year,\u201d the Associated Press reported\u00a0in a March 3, 2004 story.\u00a0The Girl Scouts in Waco had been affiliated only with the local Planned Parenthood\u2019s sex-education program \u2014 not with the organization\u2019s clinical services.", "Later in the show, Pisciotta announced that he had ended his boycott. \u201cIt is over, and I encourage everyone to go out and buy Thin Mints,\u201d he said.", "But the unfounded claim that\u00a0Girl Scout cookies support Planned Parenthood lives on \u2014 in large part because of Cloninger\u2019s interview that day on the \u201cToday\u201d show.", "Holt asked Cloninger, \u201cYou say there is no formal relationship between the Girl Scouts and Planned Parenthood. Can you describe what the relationship is or was?\u201d After criticizing Pisciotta as a \u201cbully,\u201d Cloninger went on to say:", "Cloninger, March 5, 2004:\u00a0The Girl Scouts in Waco, Texas, really made a decision based on local community context, they decided that in this particular situation that it would be in the best interest of girls and their families to discontinue the relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts is the largest voice for, and advocate for girls across the country. Know that girls grow up with very complex issues facing them. And so we do, across the country, tackle the issues of human sexuality and body image and all of the thing that\u2019s girls are facing. And we partner with many organizations. We have relationships with our church communities, with YWCAs, and with Planned Parenthood organizations across the country, to bring information-based sex education programs to girls.", "The last part of Cloninger\u2019s answer has lived on as the primary piece of evidence used by critics of the scouts.", "But the national organization, Girl Scouts of the United States of America, takes no position on birth control or abortion and has no relationship with Planned Parenthood, according to its website. And it didn\u2019t at the time, either, according to the AP\u2019s 2004\u00a0story.", "Also, there is no evidence of funds going to the group in the scout\u2019s 990 tax form.", "As for the suggestion that cookie sales \u201csupport\u201d Planned Parenthood, there is no evidence of that, either. Proceeds from Girl Scout cookie sales stay within the local councils \u2014 that\u2019s the tier between the national organization and the troops in the Girl Scouts\u2019 structure. Those councils largely decide on the programming and events that will be offered to scouts in their area.", "According to the Girl Scout\u2019s governing rules, the councils can work with local businesses, but those businesses have to maintain \u201cpolicies and operations compatible with the values of Girl Scouting.\u201d And, of course, the national organization \u201cdoes not have a relationship or partnership with Planned Parenthood,\u201d as it says on its website.", "While the Girl Scouts don\u2019t have a relationship with Planned Parenthood, they have historically had one with the Catholic Church. Prompted by questions about the potential relationship between the Girl Scouts and Planned Parenthood (among other related questions), the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops spent two years examining the issue. It did find the \u201cpossibility of local councils or troops collaborating with or forming a relationship with Planned Parenthood to be an area of serious concern deserving close attention at the local level,\u201d but it didn\u2019t give any examples that showed a relationship between the two organizations on a local level and it didn\u2019t recommend that the church cut ties with the scouts. Rather, it recommended that dioceses develop a memorandum of understanding with local councils, as has been done by at least two dioceses.", "So, although there has been concern over the years about a relationship between the Girl Scouts and Planned Parenthood, there is scant evidence that there is one.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Pro-Life Waco. \u201cVideo Today Show.\u201d YouTube. 5 Mar 2004.", "Associated Press. \u201cGirl Scout cookies, and troops, crumble in Texas.\u201d NBCnews.com. 3 Mar 2004.", "Girl Scouts of the United States of America.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
