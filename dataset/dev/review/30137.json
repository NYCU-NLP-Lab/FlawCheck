["President Donald Trump claimed that Senate Republicans could pass a health care reform bill by the end of September if a senator\u2019s hospitalization weren\u2019t preventing him from casting the deciding vote.", "\"We have one senator who\u2019s a \u2018yes\u2019 vote, a great person, but he\u2019s in the hospital,\" Trump told Fox & Friends in a Sept. 27 interview. \"And he\u2019s a \u2018yes\u2019 vote. So we can\u2019t do it by Friday. So we have the votes.\"", "Trump repeated similar claims throughout the day.", "\"With one Yes vote in hospital & very positive signs from Alaska and two others (McCain is out), we have the HCare Vote, but not for Friday!\" Trump tweeted Sept. 27.", "With one Yes vote in hospital & very positive signs from Alaska and two others (McCain is out), we have the HCare Vote, but not for Friday!", "We decided to look more closely at whether Senate Republicans in fact have the needed votes, and if a hospitalized senator, unable to cast his \"yes\" vote, is preventing its passage.", "It doesn\u2019t appear so.", "Under congressional rules, Republicans had until September 30 to pass the bill with a simple majority. Republican hold 52 seats in the Senate, meaning they could afford to lose two senators, and still pass the legislation, with the vice president casting the tie-breaking vote. No Democrats were expected to support the legislation.", "As of Sept. 25, however, three Senate Republicans \u2014 Maine Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, Arizona Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul \u2014 were firm \"no\" votes. Still\u00a0others expressed skepticism about the overhaul.", "So at most, even with all senators in attendance, Republicans had 49 votes in the Senate, short of the simple majority it needed for the bill to clear the chamber.", "Trump\u2019s repeated claims about a hospitalized senator were an apparent reference to Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.", "For his part, Cochran tweeted yesterday to clarify that he was ill but not in the hospital.", "\"Thanks for the well-wishes. I'm not hospitalized, but am recuperating at home in Mississippi and look forward to returning to work soon,\" Cochran tweeted.", "Thanks for the well-wishes. I'm not hospitalized, but am recuperating at home in Mississippi and look forward to returning to work soon.", "Cochran\u2019s office told the USA Today the senator was recovering from what they referred to as treatment for a \"urological issue.\"", "It\u2019s unclear whether Cochran\u2019s health concerns would prevent him from returning to cast a vote on the health care reform. But what\u2019s clear is that even with his vote, Senate Republicans are still short of the majority.", "Trump said Senate Republicans would have enough votes to pass health care reform but for a hospitalized senator who\u2019s unable to cast the deciding vote.", "At most, Senate Republicans have 49 \"yes\" votes \u2014 that\u2019s short of the majority they need to pass the latest health care overhaul. This shortfall would not be overcome even with a \"yes\" vote from Cochran, who is not hospitalized, but rather recuperating at home after receiving medical treatment.", "We rate this False.", "Fox & Friends, \"Trump on health care: We have the votes, but not enough time,\" Sept. 27, 2017", "Tweet by Donald Trump, Sept. 27, 2017", "Tweet by Thad Cochran, Sept. 27, 2017", "Transcript, Fox & Friends, Sept. 28, 2017", "CNN, \"Trump says hospitalized senator can't vote,\" Sept. 27, 2017", "NPR, \"3 GOP Senators Oppose Graham-Cassidy, Effectively Blocking Health Care Bill,\" Sept. 25, 2017", "USA Today, \"Trump cites support for health care bill from mystery senator in hospital,\" Sept. 27, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
