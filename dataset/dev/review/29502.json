["A Facebook post published on March 22, 2021, features three images of an old man alongside the caption: \u201cPapa Mike is Now 150 Years on Earth, If You Want Long Life, Wish Legend Old Papa Happy birthday (Sic).\u201d", "The same post was shared here on Facebook.", "The post includes three images of an elderly man and one of a cake with candles forming the number 146.", "In 2019, the same images circulated online alongside claims that the photos showed the world\u2019s oldest man, who was celebrating his 146th birthday. A different Facebook post published in 2020 also alleged that the same man was celebrating his 146th birthday that year.", "But these claims are false. The photos show\u00a0Mbah Goto, an Indonesian national also known as Sodimedjo or Grandpa Goto, who died in 2017.", "A reverse image search reveals 2017 news reports (here and here) on Goto\u2019s death. The photo agency Getty Images also covered his funeral on May 1, 2017.", "His papers indicated that Goto was born on December 31, 1870, meaning he would have been 146 years at the time of his death (see on Getty Images here). However, this has not been verified independently.", "Images of his last birthday party can be seen\u00a0here, here and here.", "AFP Fact Check previously\u00a0debunked a claim that Goto had been the world's oldest person. A\u00a0spokeswoman for Guinness World Records confirmed that he never held this official title.", "\u201cFrom what I can see from our records we have never verified Mbah Goto for one of these titles and it is likely down to the lack of ability to verify his age,\u201d Jessica Spillane told AFP on December 6, 2019.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
