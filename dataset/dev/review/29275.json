["By Lori Robertson, Robert Farley and Rem Rieder", "Posted on November 5, 2020", "In the two days after Election Day, Twitter has added warning labels to nine of President Donald Trump\u2019s election-related tweets, cautioning the messages \u201cmight be misleading.\u201d They are misleading, and in some cases, false.", "They continue a monthslong effort by the president to sow doubt about the U.S. election process and mail-in voting in particular. We\u2019ve chronicled how Trump has made a string of false, misleading and unsupported statements about the potential for voter fraud.", "Now, with the outcome of the election still hanging in the balance as several states continue to tally votes, Trump is using Twitter to spread misinformation.", "The social media platform has labeled eight tweets with the warning: \u201cSome or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process,\u201d with links to its \u201ccivic integrity policy.\u201d A ninth tweet was flagged with different language.", "Twitter\u2019s \u201ccivic integrity policy\u201d says users of the social media platform can\u2019t \u201cuse Twitter\u2019s services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes.\u201d", "The policy warns that Twitter \u201cmay label and reduce the visibility of Tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\u201d", "Violations of the policy include posting misleading information about election outcomes, such as claims about rigged elections and ballot tampering, as well as claiming victory before election results have been certified and inciting unlawful conduct to prevent the implementation of election results.", "We\u2019ll go through all nine of the flagged tweets.", "STOP THE FRAUD!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 5, 2020", "The facts: There has been no evidence of voter fraud affecting the outcome of the 2020 election, and the Trump campaign provided none when we asked. We don\u2019t know what specifically the president may be referring to, but the vague, baseless claim is similar to his past repeated assertions.", "In Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 26, Trump told his supporters \u201cthe only way we can lose, in my opinion, is massive fraud.\u201d In that and other Pennsylvania rallies late in the campaign, he made several false and misleading claims about ballots and voting.", "Over and over again, the president falsely has suggested that voter fraud is some kind of regular occurrence. But it isn\u2019t.", "\u201cElection fraud committed with absentee ballots is more prevalent than in person voting but it is still rare,\u201d\u00a0Richard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, and author of \u201cThe Voting Wars,\u201d told us earlier this year. \u201cStates can and do take steps to minimize the risks, especially given the great benefits of convenience \u2014 and now safety \u2014 from the practice.\u201d", "In an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0published in the\u00a0Washington Post, Hasen cited a\u00a0database\u00a0created by\u00a0News21, a national investigative reporting project that tracks cases of election fraud. News21 found absentee-ballot ballot fraud was the most prevalent type of election fraud, comprising about 24% of reported prosecutions between 2000 and 2012.", "\u201cBut the total number of cases was just 491 \u2014 during a period in which literally billions of votes were cast,\u201d Hasen wrote.", "All of the recent Biden claimed States will be legally challenged by us for Voter Fraud and State Election Fraud. Plenty of proof \u2013 just check out the Media. WE WILL WIN! America First!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 5, 2020", "The facts: Again, Trump claims there has been \u201cVoter Fraud\u201d and falsely says there is \u201cPlenty of proof.\u201d We asked his campaign for the proof but haven\u2019t received a response. The only claims of fraud we\u2019re aware of are bogus claims being spread on social media, including some retweeted by Trump and his son, Eric.", "In a news conference on Nov. 5, Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar was asked if she or the counties had investigated any allegations of voter fraud. She said she knew of only one case in which Luzerne County election officials caught a man who filled out an absentee application in the name of his deceased mother. That man was arrested in October and charged with voter fraud and forgery.", "During the campaign, Trump misleadingly described examples of unintentional errors as fraud.", "ANY VOTE THAT CAME IN AFTER ELECTION DAY WILL NOT BE COUNTED!", "\u2014 Donald J.

North Carolina will accept properly postmarked ballots through Nov. 12. Alaska cannot even begin counting absentee ballots until seven days after Election Day.", "Trump could be referring to Pennsylvania, where, due to a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in September, ballots can be received as late as 5 p.m. on Nov. 6 if they were mailed (or presumed to have been mailed) by Election Day.", "The justices said that ballots \u201creceived within this period that lack a postmark or other proof of mailing, or for which the postmark or other proof of mailing is illegible, will be presumed to have been mailed by Election Day unless a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that it was mailed after Election Day.\u201d", "State Republicans have, unsuccessfully, fought that deadline in court. The U.S. Supreme Court first let the state high court ruling stand, and then denied a request to rule on the merits of the case before Nov. 3. But Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s opinion said the court could decide the case later and that ballots received after Election Day polls closed should be set aside by Pennsylvania officials.", "The Trump campaign has asked to join that lawsuit.", "\u2026..there was a large number of secretly dumped ballots as has been widely reported!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 4, 2020", "The facts: Twitter warned under the first tweet in this thread: \u201cOfficial sources may not have called the race when this was Tweeted.\u201d We\u2019re not sure why Twitter was so tentative in its language. In fact, official sources had not called a winner in Pennsylvania, North Carolina or Georgia when Trump tweeted that he had \u201cclaimed\u201d them.", "As for Michigan, the Associated Press called the state for Biden at 5:56 p.m., one hour after Trump\u2019s tweet. Fox News and CNN had called the state before the AP.", "And media company election experts \u201ccalling\u201d a race for a candidate is not the same as \u201cclaiming\u201d it \u201cfor Electoral Vote purposes.\u201d That\u2019s determined by certified voting results from the states.", "Trump falsely claimed in his second tweet of the thread that there may be \u201ca large number of secretly dumped ballots\u201d in Michigan \u201cas has been widely reported!\u201d", "There were no \u201csecretly dumped ballots\u201d in the state. Trump is likely referring to a clerical error that was quickly corrected by a Michigan county. The data input error had briefly showed an unusually large uptick in votes for Biden.", "A GOP consultant who had questioned the uptick in a tweet \u2014 which Trump then amplified in a retweet (see below) \u2014 later corrected the record and deleted his original post.", "They are working hard to make up 500,000 vote advantage in Pennsylvania disappear \u2014 ASAP.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 4, 2020", "The facts: It\u2019s true that among the votes tallied the\u00a0night of the election,\u00a0Trump led Biden by more than 500,000 votes. But Trump\u2019s comment that \u201cThey are working hard\u201d to make that lead \u201cdisappear\u201d suggests nefarious intentions behind routine counting of legitimately cast ballots.", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve written, vote counting always goes past Election Day. There\u2019s nothing unusual about that.\u00a0Most states\u00a0\u2014 including Pennsylvania and Michigan \u2014 don\u2019t start counting mail-in ballots until Election Day, and with a larger volume of mail-in voting due to the coronavirus pandemic, several states expected the vote count to take at least a few days.", "Pennsylvania\u00a0could not\u00a0even begin pre-canvassing \u2014 opening envelopes and preparing the ballots to be counted \u2014 until 7 a.m. on Election Day. The morning after Election Day, Pennsylvania\u00a0reported\u00a0that about half of the nearly 2.6 million mail-in ballots had been counted.", "In\u00a0Michigan, some cities or townships \u2014 those with populations of 25,000 or more \u2014 were able to start pre-canvassing\u00a0one day\u00a0before the election, but that wasn\u2019t enough time to get the ballots counted by Election Day.", "While the votes counted in Pennsylvania and Michigan on the days after the election broke decidedly in Biden\u2019s favor, that\u2019s largely because more Democrats than Republicans voted by mail. In\u00a0Pennsylvania, nearly three times as many of the mail-in ballots came from Democrats.", "WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? https://t.co/6487pYLZnL", "\u2014 Donald J.

But as\u00a0we wrote, and explained above, that was due to a data input error by a county\u2019s reporting that was quickly corrected.", "Mackowiack later corrected the record and\u00a0tweeted: \u201cThis tweet was taken and share honestly. I have now learned the MI update referenced was a typo in one county. I have deleted the original tweet.\u201d", "The map, which\u00a0appeared on BuzzFeed News, was powered by the election data-gathering firm\u00a0Decision Desk HQ.", "\u201cThis morning there was a clerical error in the Shiawassee, MI county presidential data,\u201d the firm\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Twitter. \u201cOnce we identified the error, we cleared the erroneous data and updated it with the correct data as provided by officials.\u201d", "And Abby Bowen, elections clerk in\u00a0Shiawassee County, told us by phone that the error came down to a typo.", "\u201cThere was a typo in the initial report that went out to the Bureau of Elections. It was caught in a very short amount of time and quickly corrected,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cThere was an extra 0 added on the end when Biden\u2019s votes\u00a0were keyed in.\u201d", "\u201cThis is why we have the checks and balances,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is no kind of voter fraud. It was literally just a typo.\u201d", "Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the \u201cpollsters\u201d got it completely & historically wrong!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 4, 2020", "The facts: Trump\u2019s lead did not \u201cmagically disappear\u201d due to \u201csurprise ballot dumps.\u201d Rather, his lead narrowed in the days following the election in some states as election officials began counting legally cast mail-in ballots.", "As we noted earlier, more Democrats voted via mail-in ballots than Republicans did. And so, it is not \u201cVERY STRANGE\u201d \u2014 in fact it was expected \u2014 that as mail-in ballots were counted, Biden would gain ground.", "As for \u201csurprise ballot dumps,\u201d there isn\u2019t any evidence of that. The Trump campaign did not respond to our email seeking backup for that. It is possible that Trump was referring to the clerical error in Michigan we wrote about above, which was not a \u201cballot dump\u201d and as we said was quickly corrected.", "We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!", "\u2014 Donald J.

As we have written, some states allow votes postmarked before the polls closed, but not received until the days after the election, to be counted.", "As far back as August, the Trump campaign was\u00a0warning\u00a0that new election laws in\u00a0some states\u00a0might allow votes to be cast and counted after Election Day. For example, we wrote about a claim from Hogan Gidley, the national press secretary for the Trump campaign, who warned about the potential for \u201cmassive fraud\u201d of that type in Nevada \u2014\u00a0one of the states\u00a0that allow ballots received in the days after the election to be counted, provided they are postmarked by Election Day. Gidley cited\u00a0a Nevada law\u00a0that says ballots with a smudged and unreadable postmark, or no postmark at all, would be counted if received up to three days after the election. As a result, he said, voters could \u201cwake up on Wednesday morning, see that they don\u2019t like the results and then go drop their ballots in the mail,\u201d and that those votes would be counted.", "Wayne Thorley, Nevada\u2019s deputy secretary of state for elections, told us back in August that was wrong. He noted that all of the ballots received in the primary election had postmarks, and that 5,355 ballots were rejected because they were postmarked after the date of the election.", "\u201cIf your plan is to wait until the day after the election to vote, then I can say with almost 100 percent certainty your ballot won\u2019t be counted,\u201d Thorley said at the time.", "Jessica A. Levinson, a professor who specializes in election law at Loyola Law School in California, told us then that, \u201cTheoretically, a voter could vote the morning after Election Day, put it in the mail and pray for an ineligible postmark and quick delivery.
