["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on November 27, 2018", "In response to a question about climate change, President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the United States was \u201cthe cleanest we\u2019ve ever been.\u201d Data from a variety of sources show that while the country has made strides in the last decade, its carbon dioxide, or CO2, emissions are far from their lowest point.", "The president\u2019s comments came on Nov. 26 after he was asked by a journalist about the latest National Climate Assessment. The report, which was released on Nov. 23 and written by more than 300 government and non-government experts,\u00a0describes in detail how climate change has already begun to affect the nation. It also warns of future harm to people, ecosystems and the economy if more action isn\u2019t taken soon.", "Here is the\u00a0exchange:", "Reporter, Nov. 26: Mr. President, have you read the climate report yet?", "Trump: \u00a0I\u2019ve seen it, I\u2019ve read some of it, and it\u2019s fine.", "Reporter: They say economic impact could be devastating \u2014 of climate change.", "Trump: \u00a0Yeah. I don\u2019t believe it.", "Reporter: You don\u2019t believe it?", "Trump: \u00a0No. \u00a0No. I don\u2019t believe it. And here\u2019s the other thing \u2014 you\u2019re going to have to have China, and Japan, and all of Asia, and all of these other countries \u2014 you know, it \u2014 it addresses our country.", "Right now, we\u2019re at the cleanest we\u2019ve ever been, and that\u2019s very important to me. But if we\u2019re clean but every other place on Earth on is dirty, that\u2019s not so good.", "So I want clean air. I want clean water. Very important.", "Trump\u2019s comments echo previous claims that the United States has the cleanest water and air, which we\u2019ve previously debunked. Compared to much of the world, America has enviable air and water, but it doesn\u2019t rank as the \u201ccleanest,\u201d based on the\u00a02018 Environmental Performance Index.", "This time, it isn\u2019t entirely clear what the president means by \u201ccleanest,\u201d and the White House did not provide clarification. But when talking about climate change, the relevant metrics are greenhouse gases \u2014 particularly CO2, which is the primary driver. And here, the U.S. is neither tops in the world nor at its historical best.", "Some of the most comprehensive data about CO2 emissions come from the Energy Information Administration, or EIA. The agency reports on energy-related CO2 emissions, which includes things such as transportation, heating and electricity \u2014 and has been doing so since the early 1970s. Since 98 percent of all CO2 emissions in the U.S. stem from the energy sector, this is a pretty good indication of the national trend.", "The data, which we\u2019ve graphed below, reveal that despite a promising downward slope, CO2 emissions are nowhere near their nadir. In 2017, U.S. carbon emissions were 5,144 million metric tons \u2014 the lowest it has been since 1992. But emissions were lower than that every year from 1973 through 1992.", "World Bank data, which goes back even further, tells a similar story. In 2014, emissions were trending down, but were still more than 1.8 times those in 1960.", "One reason for the increase in emissions is a growing population \u2014 which improves the picture for the U.S. when measuring carbon emissions on a per-capita basis. These values have tumbled after peaking in the early 1970s. But they are still higher than the lowest recorded points in the 1960s.\u00a0On both absolute and relative terms, then, it is false to claim that America is at its \u201ccleanest.\u201d", "One caveat to these values is that they do not include other greenhouse gases or CO2 emissions from non-energy sources. EPA data does factor these in, but they only go back to 1990, making longer historical comparisons difficult \u2014 especially because this period is precisely when emissions begin to reach present-day levels.", "Finally, it is worth mentioning that the recent downward trend in CO2 emissions isn\u2019t expected to continue in the short term. In October, the EIA\u00a0projected\u00a0that CO2 emissions will go up 2.2 percent in 2018. If that happens, it will be the first rise in carbon emissions since 2014.", "The president also compared the U.S. to other countries when he said, \u201cif we\u2019re clean but every other place on Earth on is dirty, that\u2019s not so good.\u201d", "Although the U.S. has made progress on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, it is by no means one of the lower emitters on the world stage.", "Data from the International Energy Agency for 2016 show that the U.S. is second to China in its total CO2 output, followed by India, Russia, and Japan. And the U.S. is higher than all of these countries in its per-capita values. In fact, America ranks 10th highest for its CO2 emissions per person, behind No. 1 Qatar, as well as Saudi Arabia and Australia.", "So even though this number has fallen dramatically in the last decade, America is disproportionately contributing to climate change \u2014 far more than even China, which ranks 39th on a per-capita basis.", "Other countries may need to reduce their CO2 emissions, but to say that the U.S. is already \u201cclean\u201d is false.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
