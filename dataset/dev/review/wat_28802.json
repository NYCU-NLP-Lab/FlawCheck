To think something we would use to pull trailers now is being used for terror, it's crazy.\nNever in my lifetime would I think something like that.\"", "The truck can also be found in other photos:", "The plumbing company put the truck up for auction in November 2013. It's unclear", "The export market for used U.S. vehicles reaches across the globe. The cars and trucks we think of as old and busted hold immense value in other parts of\nthe world, and auction transactions happen fast. The truck likely passed through numerous hands and ended up on a dealer's lot in Syria.", "Oberholtzer said that shortly after the photo went viral, he started receiving phone calls accusing his company of supporting terrorist groups. Regardless of\nhow this truck ended up in Syria, Oberholtzer said he has learned a valuable lesson and will be removing the company's logo before selling any more trucks:", "We have a secretary here, she's scared to death. We all have families. We don't want no problems. We have nothing to do with terror at all.", "In December 2015, Mark Oberholtzer (Jeff Oberholtzer's father and also part owner of the company) filed a lawsuit in Texas state court against\nAutoNation Ford Gulf Freeway for $1 million for neglecting to peel off his company's decals before selling the truck he had traded in. The lawsuit contended\nthat he and his employees had received continual abuse and harassment - including death threats - by phone, email, and social media since the photos of the truck first showed up on Twitter.<!--Last updated: 15 December 2015", "Originally published: 14 December 2014-->", "Barr, Alice. \u00a0 \"Texas City Truck Seen on Islamic Military Group's Twitter Feed.\"\r\nKHOU News. \u00a0 18 December 2014.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
