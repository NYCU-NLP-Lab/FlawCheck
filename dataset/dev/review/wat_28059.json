["Donald Trump at the third and final presidential debate on Oct. 22, 2020 (AP)", "At the final presidential debate of the 2020 campaign, President Donald Trump tried to pin his administration\u2019s policy of separating families at the border on former Vice President Joe Biden.", "\"They did it. We changed the policy,\" Trump said.", "That claim needs context.\u00a0Like the Trump administration, the Obama administration used chain-link enclosures to hold migrants at border facilities, but it did not have a policy to separate families at the U.S.-Mexico border.", "On Facebook, some users took it a step further.", "\"If you heard Trump say \u2018good\u2019 about the kids being separated from their parents, and you still plan to vote for him, you\u2019re inhuman,\" says an Oct. 23 post from a Facebook page called Close the Camps.", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 1,400 times.", "Did Trump really say that separating families at the border is \"good?\"", "We checked the transcript of the debate. Trump did not make that comment \u2014 and other fact-checkers have debunked the claim. Close the Camps corrected its post after Reuters fact-checked it.", "Trump said \"go ahead\" to moderator Kristen Welker.", "The exchange came near the end of a debate segment about immigration. Trump was criticizing the Obama administration\u2019s \"catch-and-release\" policies, which provided for the release of migrants while they waited for their days in immigration court. The Trump administration announced it was ending the policy in September 2019.", "The president\u2019s comment to Welker came after Biden mentioned a report that found the Trump administration has yet to track down the parents of 545 children at the border. Here are the remarks in context:", "Welker: \"All right. Let\u2019s move on to the next section.\"", "Trump: \"But we don\u2019t have to worry about it, because they terminated it. So we don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore, Joe.\"", "Welker: \"Let\u2019s move on to the next section.\"", "Biden: \"That\u2019s right. And you have 525 kids not knowing where in God\u2019s name they\u2019re going to be and lost their parents.\"", "Trump (to Welker): \"Go ahead.\"", "Watch the moment for yourself in the video below. Trump is looking at Welker and says, \"Go ahead,\" not \"good.\"", "The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "BuzzFeed News, \"No, Trump Didn't Say \u2018Good\u2019 In Response To A Question About Kids Separated From Their Parents At The Border,\" Oct. 22, 2020", "Facebook post, Oct. 23, 2020", "NBC News, \"Lawyers say they can't find the parents of 545 migrant children separated by Trump administration,\" Oct. 20, 2020", "NPR, \"Trump Administration To End 'Catch And Release' Immigration Policy, Says DHS Chief,\" Sept. 24, 2019", "PolitiFact, \"Fact-checking Donald Trump, Joe Biden in the final presidential debate,\" Oct. 22, 2020", "Reuters, \"Fact check: Trump did not say it was \"good\" that over 500 children at the border had lost their parents,\" Oct. 23, 2020", "Rev, Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020, Oct. 22, 2020", "Vox, \"\u2018Catch and release,\u2019 explained: the heart of Trump\u2019s new border agenda,\" April 9, 2018", "YouTube video from C-SPAN, Oct. 22, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
