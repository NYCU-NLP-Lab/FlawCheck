["About this rating", "While one wouldn\u2019t automatically associate Elvis Presley, King of Rock and Roll, with Judaism, questions about his connection to the faith have arisen often from our readers. We did some research, and learned that Presley indeed had a Jewish ancestor.", "According to the biography \u201cElvis and Gladys\u201d written by Elaine Dundy, a journalist and author, the connection came from his maternal side. The book \u2014 described as a \u201cdefinitive\u201d biography of the icon \u2014recounted Elvis\u2019 early life and his relationship with his mother Gladys, and also dove into her family origins.", "The book describes the marriage in 1870 of Presley\u2019s great-grandfather White Mansell to Martha Tackett, who was the daughter of Abner and Nancy J. Burdine Tackett. Burdine was of \u201cparticular interest\u201d to Dundy: \u201cAccording to Elvis\u2019 third cousin Oscar Tackett (who shared the same ancestors Abner and Nancy), Nancy was Jewish. She and Abner had met as schoolmates in Tennessee. Again, names often tell a story and two of Martha\u2019s brothers were given Jewish names, Sidney and Jerome.\u201d", "According to Max Wallace and Jonathan Goldstein, authors of \"Schmelvis: In Search of Elvis Presley's Jewish Roots,\" Nancy Burdine \u201cprobably\u201d came from a family that immigrated from Lithuania around the time of the American Revolution.", "So Presley\u2019s maternal great-great grandmother was Jewish, and this connection was acknowledged by Presley and his estate generations later in 1964. According to the website for Graceland, Presley's mansion, which features historical details about Gladys' gravestone:", "Elvis' mother passed away on August 14, 1958, and was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis. The cross statue with angels was placed in March 1959. This headstone, which features the Star of David to represent Gladys' Jewish heritage, was placed at her grave in December 1964. In October 1977, both Elvis and his mother were buried at the Meditation Garden at Graceland.", "Presley himself attended the Assembly of God Church with his family in his early childhood, and was deeply impacted by the music he encountered there. He did not practice Judaism, even though a report on Haaretz, an Israeli news outlet, did claim him as Jewish thanks to his maternal ancestry.", "Because some Jewish traditions consider the heritage to be passed down along the maternal line, Presley's purported Jewish lineage is arguably a matter of religious interpretation. The question of what counts as Jewish identity has been hotly debated before. The man certainly did not identify himself as Jewish based on publicly available knowledge.", "Given that there is much historical evidence of his having a Jewish ancestor, we rate this claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
