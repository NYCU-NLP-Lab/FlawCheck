Harris, chairman of the Rhode Island Sierra Club\u2019s transportation committee, in the latter group.", "In a Dec. 24, 2013, \u00a0commentary in The Providence Journal, he made an energetic counterargument to the notion that tax increases drive productive residents to lower-taxing jurisdictions.", "\"Heck, you don\u2019t see Norway losing population, and its taxes are astronomical,\" Harris wrote.", "With its long winter nights, Norway is a prime place for astronomical observations, such as watching the aurora borealis. Are its taxes sky-high? And do Norwegians tend to stay put, regardless?", "We decided to check.", "First, Harris is right about the population. According to Eurostat, the census bureau of the European Union, Norway\u2019s population grew 11 percent between 2003 and 2013, to a record high of 5.05 million people, about the same population as the State of Colorado.", "So how about those \"astronomical\" taxes? Just as different countries speak different languages, different nations\u2019 tax systems are often set up in ways that make direct comparisons difficult.", "For example, both the United States and Norway tax income. But Norway, like much of Europe,also imposes a \"value added tax\" on items sold at retail that assesses a tax at each step of production, rather than at the point of sale. The United States has no comparable tax.", "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based association of 34 developed nations that share information and study economic policy, tracks an array of economic statistics from its member nations.", "One those statistics is taxation. To make apples-to-apples comparisons of tax burdens between nations, the OECD looks at how much a nation collects in tax revenue each year and \u00a0calculates what percentage that represents of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, the monetary value of everything the country produced in that year", "In 2011, the most recent year for which the OECD had complete figures, the United States federal tax bite was 24 percent of its gross domestic product. That was 32nd of the 34 OECD nations. The lowest was Mexico at 19.7 percent and Chile at 21.2 percent.", "Norway? It placed seventh on the list, with a national tax obligation equal to 42.5 percent of its gross domestic product, a little short of twice the United State\u2019s share.", "Of the top ten, eight countries were over 40 percent of their GDP, with Denmark topping the list at 47.7 percent. Half of the \u00a0OECD countries had levels over 34.1 percent.", "Our ruling", "Jonathan Harris of the Rhode Island chapter of the Sierra Club said, \"You don\u2019t see Norway losing population, and its taxes are astronomical.\"", "Census data shows he\u2019s correct on the first point.", "On the second point, by the OECD measure, Norway\u2019s relative tax burden is among the highest in the world. Federal taxes would need to be hiked 77 percent in the United States to reach Norway\u2019s level.", "Is Norway\u2019s ranking, seventh out of 34, \"astronomical\"?
