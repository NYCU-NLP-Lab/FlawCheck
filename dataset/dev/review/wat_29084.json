["About this rating", "On 7 November 2016, so-called \"viral evangelist\" Joshua Feuerstein \u2014 who is probably best known for a 2015 Facebook video in which he ranted that Starbucks \"hates Jesus\" because its holiday cups were solid red and bore no religious symbols \u2014 posted a video capture and text alleging that hiphop artist Jay Z, who had appeared with his wife, singer Beyonce, at a Hillary Clinton campaign event, had rapped the words \"Middle finger to the Lord, nigga grip, I'm a boss\" during his performance:", "Following Feuerstein's lead, other Facebook users posted helpful video clips with captions showing the allegedly blasphemous lyrics:", "There was just one problem: the transcription of Jay Z's lyrics was incorrect. The song was \"Dirt Off Your Shoulder,\" from \"The Black Album,\" released in 2003. And the verse in question (as noted by Media Research Center when it criticized President Obama for referencing the lyric in 2012) actually goes like this:", "I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force\nTryin to hustle some things that go with the Porsche\nFeeling no remorse, feeling like my hand was forced\nMiddle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls", "We'll grant you that if the standard being applied were offensiveness, the real lyrics are arguably no better than the erroneous ones. But the implicit claim isn't simply that the words are offensive; it's that they blaspheme Jesus \u2014 which, in fact, they do not.", "The technical term for misheard words or phrases is \"mondegreens,\" of which the annals of pop music are chock-full. The example before us is actually quite common and often turns up in Internet search results. If you look up the lyrics of \"Dirt Off Your Shoulder\" on Google, for instance, this is one of the top results (and it comes from Google Play itself!):", "I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force\nTryin' to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche\nFeelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced\nMiddle finger to the Lord, nigga grip I'm a boss", "As Hemant Mehta of Patheos demonstrates, however, \"middle finger to the Lord\" makes no sense in the context of the rest of the song:", "In his song \u201cDirt Off Your Shoulder,\u201d Jay Z isn\u2019t talking about raising a middle finger to the Lord. He\u2019s talking about a symbolic reaction to the law. He\u2019s rapping about doing what he had to do \u2014 things the police might have arrested him for \u2014 when he wasn\u2019t rich.", "The lyrics actually go like this:", "I probably owe it to y\u2019all, probably be locked by the force\nTryin to hustle some things that go with the Porsche\nFeeling no remorse, feeling like my hand was forced\nMiddle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls", "You can go to Genius to see what all that means, but the point is that it wasn\u2019t blasphemy. It\u2019s a song about not letting the haters get to you.
