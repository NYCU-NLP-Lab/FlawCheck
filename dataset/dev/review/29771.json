["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on June 8, 2018", "At a meeting on hurricane preparedness, President Donald Trump took credit for U.S. energy production milestones that have been expected for years, and misstated the facts in the process:", "At the same meeting, Trump also said the Department of Interior owns \u201calmost half the United States.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s about a fifth \u2014 not one-half.", "The president, who has made energy a priority for his administration, made his remarks on energy and federal land during a White House\u00a0meeting on 2018 hurricane preparedness.", "Trump went around the table to praise each member of his Cabinet. When he got to Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Trump made a series of boasts about U.S. energy production on the administration\u2019s watch.", "Trump, June 6: [Y]ou\u2019re doing a fantastic job at Energy. And we\u2019re now the largest in the world in energy, Rick. The largest in the world. And we\u2019re now exporting energy for the first time. Never did it. Now we\u2019re exporting energy. But we have become the largest energy producer in the world. Who would have thought? But we\u2019ve opened it up a little bit, Rick, right? And we\u2019ve let our people go and do their thing. And they\u2019re doing a great job.", "Trump repeatedly referred to \u201cenergy\u201d when, the White House tells us, he actually meant specific types of energy. But even so, Trump\u2019s boasts were either inaccurate or misleading.", "By total primary energy production, China\u00a0was the largest energy producer in 2015 and has been since 2008,\u00a0according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.", "The EIA has international data only through 2015. But China that year was far ahead of the United States, and U.S. primary energy production was slightly lower in 2017 than it was in 2015. (Go to the EIA link for \u201cInternational Energy Statistics,\u201d click on \u201cselect data,\u201d and choose \u201cprimary energy\u201d for data through 2015. Primary energy production includes fossil fuels \u2014 petroleum,\u00a0natural gas and\u00a0coal \u2014 nuclear energy, and renewable sources of energy.)", "It turns out, though, that Trump was not referring to all energy when he said that \u201cwe have become the largest energy producer in the world.\u201d", "The White House said the president was talking about crude oil and referred us to a Fortune magazine story about the\u00a0International Energy Agency\u2019s January Oil Market Report, which said the U.S. should overtake Saudi Arabia and perhaps Russia in 2018 to become the No. 1 crude oil producer.", "\u201cThis year promises to be a record-setting one for the US. Crude production of 9.9 mb/d [million barrels per day] is now at the highest level in nearly 50 years, putting it neck-and-neck with Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s second largest crude producer after Russia,\u201d IEA said in January. \u201cRelentless growth should see the US hit historic highs above 10 mb/d, overtaking Saudi Arabia and rivalling Russia during the course of 2018 \u2013 provided OPEC/non-OPEC restraints remain in place.\u201d", "The U.S. has averaged\u00a0more than 10 million barrels per day\u00a0every week since February, according to the EIA. So the U.S. remains on pace as projected by the IEA in January. But there is no indication that it has overtaken Russia.", "According to the EIA\u2019s most current monthly crude oil production data available for top producing oil countries, Russia produced about 10.6 million barrels per day, or bpd, in February, while the U.S. produced nearly 10.3 million bpd. Saudi Arabia was third at 10.1 million bpd.", "Since then, Russia reported producing 10.97 million bpd of crude oil for a third month in a row in May, while the U.S. four-week average reached a record 10.75 million bpd as of June 1.", "If and when it does happen, the milestone won\u2019t come as a surprise \u2014 as Trump implied, when he asked, \u201cWho would have thought?\u201d The answer is: IEA.", "In its 2012 World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency said the U.S. would become the top crude oil producer by 2020, largely because of technological advances that have made hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a popular method to extract natural gas and oil from tight spaces.", "IEA, World Energy Outlook, 2012:\u00a0Energy developments in the United States are profound and their effect will be felt well beyond North America \u2013 and the energy sector. The recent rebound in US oil and gas production, driven by upstream technologies that are unlocking light tight oil and shale gas resources, is spurring economic activity \u2013 with less expensive gas and electricity prices\u00a0giving industry a competitive edge \u2013 and steadily changing the role of North America in global energy trade.\u00a0By around 2020, the United States is projected to become the largest global oil producer. \u2026", "At a news conference in London that year, then-IEA chief economist Fatih Birol, who is now the IEA executive director,\u00a0told reporters that the U.S. would become the world\u2019s largest oil producer by 2017.", "So, the U.S. is pretty much on track with IEA\u2019s projections from six years ago.", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve often noted\u00a0when Barack Obama was president, the remarkable boom in U.S. oil production is chiefly the result of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing \u2014 not of any governmental policy.", "\u201cU.S. crude oil production has increased significantly over the past 10 years, driven mainly by production from tight rock formations using\u00a0horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing,\u201d the EIA said in April,\u00a0estimating\u00a0that fracking accounted for about half of U.S. crude oil production in 2016.", "There are other ways to measure energy production, and, by some measures, the U.S. became the largest producer of key energy sources years before Trump took office.", "For example, EIA last year\u00a0said\u00a0that the U.S. has been the No. 1 producer of petroleum\u00a0since 2013 and the leading producer of natural gas since 2009.", "EIA, June 7, 2017:\u00a0The United States has been the world\u2019s top producer of natural gas since 2009, when U.S. natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world\u2019s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia\u2019s.", "So, the U.S. is on pace to become the No. 1 crude oil producer, as expected by the IEA since 2012. But it already had been the No. 1 producer of petroleum, which includes crude oil and\u00a0petroleum products, such as gasoline.", "Trump also claimed that \u201cwe\u2019re now exporting energy for the first time.\u201d That\u2019s incorrect.", "The EIA\u00a0said\u00a0in February that it expects the U.S. will be a net exporter by 2022 \u2014 a few years earlier than it had previously expected \u2014\u00a0\u201cprimarily driven by changes in petroleum and natural gas markets.\u201d", "When told about the EIA\u2019s projections, the White House said the president was talking about natural gas. It\u00a0referred us to the House Energy and Commerce Committee blog\u00a0that said the U.S.\u00a0in 2017 was a net exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1957. The committee blog\u00a0cited the EIA.", "Trump didn\u2019t say natural gas, of course. But, even if he did, it is not the \u201cfirst time\u201d it has happened, and it was not unexpected.", "In 2015, the EIA projected that the U.S. would be a net exporter of natural gas by 2017.\u00a0That was the projection under EIA\u2019s \u201creference case,\u201d a most likely set of assumptions. The last time the U.S. was a net exporter of natural gas was in 1957, so Trump is wrong when he said that the U.S. \u201c[n]ever did it.\u201d", "As he went around the table to praise his Cabinet, Trump also gave a wildly inaccurate figure for how much land the federal government owns.", "The president joked that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is the \u201cworld\u2019s largest landlord.\u201d", "\u201cNobody knows that. But you\u2019re the largest \u2014 by far, the largest landlord,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost half the United States if you think about it. Right?\u201d", "Wrong. The Department of Interior controls less than 20 percent of land in the United States.", "\u201cThe federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, about 28% of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the United States,\u201d the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote in a March 2017 report on federal land ownership. The bulk of that land is owned by the Departments of Interior, Agriculture and Defense.", "Table 2 of the CRS report shows that three agencies within the Department of Interior \u2014\u00a0the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service \u2014 control about 417 million acres, which would be 18.4 percent of land in the U.S. The Interior Department\u2019s most recent annual report puts the figure at 20 percent.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
