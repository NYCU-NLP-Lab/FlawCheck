The report mentions that the incident occurred at the Ajmer Dargah market. The person who was beaten has been identified as a Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC) jawan. Navbharat Times also published a report on the incident.", "Alt News reached out to Ajmer SP Kunwar Rashtradeep for more information. \u201cThe investigation is still going on in this case. There is prima facie evidence that the man who was being beaten in the video was an RAC jawan who was drunk at the time. He had misbehaved with a Zayarin (a female Hajj pilgrim), which angered people and prompted the violence. The RAC jawan was found to be at fault here and has been suspended. His assailants filed a complaint against the jawan. At the same time, he also filed a complaint against them alleging assault. The investigation is ongoing in both cases. The fact that the RAC jawan was drunk was found to be credible to some extent, due to which he has been suspended,\u201d said Rashtradeep. The SP further stated that the incident did not have communal overtones.", "Therefore, a video of an RAC jawan beaten after he allegedly misbehaved with a female Haj pilgrim at Rajasthan\u2019s Ajmer Dargah was shared on social media with false communal claims. The clip was circulated to target the TRS as it was falsely claimed to have occurred in Hyderabad.", "Donate Now", "Kinjal Parmar holds a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology.
