Limbaugh said the web post went on to say the contemplated requirement that restaurants install costly devices to diffuse smoke led a business expert to tell council members \"these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin.\"", "\"It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue,\" Limbaugh echoed. What \"kind of an absurd requirement is this anyway?\" he added.", "Smoke pouring from commercial barbecue smokers has been a hot Austin topic, in particular pitting a new South Austin restaurant against nearby homeowners who say its smoke wafting their way has reduced the value of their homesteads.", "And did the council adopt a plan amounting to a ban on \u2018cue restaurants?", "Citing a website", "Limbaugh, according to a transcript of his program, recited as fact a July 25, 2015, web post on IAmATexan.com, headlined \"Austin City Council Votes to Ban BBQ Restaurants.\"", "That post said the council had passed a preliminary plan to restrict smoke from barbecue restaurants, continuing:", "\"The city council\u2019s current proposal will require smoke diffusers and will also limit the amount of time that restaurants can smoke. These restrictions will require at least $100,000 in extra investments for most barbecue restaurants as they will be forced to buy extra smokers along with severely expensive diffusers, and in some cases will have to lease or purchase more property.", "\"One business expert told council members that these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin.", "\"It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue.\"", "We didn\u2019t connect with the unnamed authors of that post. Nor did our query to Limbaugh draw a reply.", "But Austin American-Statesman news stories, City of Austin documents and responses by a city spokeswoman indicate that after the council talked about imposing controls to reduce unwanted smoke from restaurant smokers, members directed the city manager, Marc Ott, to gather public input and make recommendations.

Mike Black said in a January 2015 statement to the American-Statesman that he intended to work with residents to address concerns. In July 2015, residents filed a lawsuit against the restaurant.", "Credit for publicly suggesting the city regulate smoke from restaurants belongs to Austin City Council Member Sabino \"Pio\" Renteria, whose idea to require smoke mitigation wasn\u2019t embraced by pitmasters who said purchasing expensive \"smoke scrubbers\" could kill barbecue stands inside the city limits. \"It will force 99 percent of Austin BBQ places to either close or move out of town,\" John Mueller of John Mueller Meat Co. said in a statement.", "In March 2015, Renteria said he was revising his original proposal to have it apply only to restaurants and mobile food vendors within 100 feet of residential property\u2014down from 150 feet.

In all cases, the agency determined the odor and smoke were not nuisances subject to state intervention, commission spokeswoman Andrea Morrow said, adding that a nuisance would have to \"be injurious to or adversely affect human health, welfare, animal life, vegetation or property\" or \"interfere with normal use and enjoyment of animal life, vegetation, or property.\"", "On April 2, 2015, council members voted 9-2 to gather input from neighbors and businesses in the lead-up to a \"possible\" writing of smoke-control rules. The issue was to go first to the Economic Opportunity and Health and Human Services committees, both consisting of council members.", "Specifically, the council\u2019s resolution said members were initiating a possible amendment to the city code to address smoke from cookers, restaurants and trucks and their impact on residences with provisions to be considered including a requirement that restaurants and mobile vendors using a wood- or charcoal-burning stove or grill and located within 100 feet of a property used or zoned as a residence \"take appropriate action to mitigate the impact of smoke emissions\" on the lives of nearby residents \"by relocating smoke-emitting equipment\" or \"installing smoke-mitigating devices.\" The resolution also directed Ott to gather input from affected residents, business owners and others before presenting recommendations to the committees by July 31, 2015.", "Committee recommendations", "On May 11, 2015, the Economic Opportunity committee voted 4-0 to not pursue a city ordinance either requiring establishments to install smoke-clearing devices or to regulate nuisances.

However, the council didn\u2019t adopt such a regulation and we sniffed out no factual indication it\u2019s poised to do so.
