He topped the list of lawmakers who scored the highest dollar amounts in the House's defense bill for fiscal 2011, according to research by the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense and the newspaper The Hill.", "Critics say earmarks contribute to runaway spending, and contend legislators can improperly use earmarks to enrich themselves. Ryan\u2019s view is that earmarks are a way to direct federal dollars to worthwhile local projects and that they account for a tiny percentage of the federal budget.", "Ryan's office provided an overview of funding he secured in nine budget categories, with example projects. Defense topped the list, with a total of $61,154,000 passed and signed.
