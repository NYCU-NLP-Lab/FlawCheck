["By Robert Farley", "Posted on May 25, 2016", "Donald Trump took several verbal jabs at Republican New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez after she declined to attend his rally in Albuquerque. But his criticism of her effort to keep Syrian refugees out of New Mexico was way off base.", "Trump wrongly claimed that \u201cSyrian refugees are being relocated in large numbers to New Mexico.\u201d Only 10 Syrian refugees have been relocated to New Mexico while Martinez has served as governor.", "Trump also missed the mark when he boasted that \u201cif I was governor\u201d the\u00a0resettlement of Syrian refugees in New Mexico \u201cwouldn\u2019t be happening.\u201d Governors have no legal authority to bar refugees from relocation to their state, as those who have tried found out. The resettlement process is\u00a0guided by federal law.", "Trump\u2019s barbs at Martinez, who is chairwoman of the Republican Governors Association, came after the governor declined to attend Trump\u2019s first New Mexico campaign event in Albuquerque on May 24. Martinez, the nation\u2019s first Hispanic female governor, has criticized some of Trump\u2019s immigration remarks and has, according to the Albuquerque Journal, been \u201cnoncommittal as to whether she will support him.\u201d", "According to the Journal, when asked why she was not attending, she said she was \u201creally busy.\u201d So in his speech, Trump took the opportunity to opine that Martinez is \u201cnot doing the job.\u201d", "Trump, May. 24: Now here\u2019s a beauty that you\u2019re gonna all love. Syrian refugees are being relocated in large numbers to New Mexico. If I was governor, that wouldn\u2019t be happening. I couldn\u2019t care less. They say the governors have no choice. If I\u2019m governor, I have a choice, OK? Believe me.", "For starters, there has not been a large number of Syrian refugees relocated to New Mexico.", "According to statistics from the State Department\u2019s Refugee Processing Center, there have been 2,540 Syrian refugees relocated in the U.S. from the start of the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 to May 24. Just four of them were relocated to New Mexico. Over that period, New Mexico ranked tied for 33rd among states in the number of Syrian refugees relocated.", "In fact, over the entirety of Martinez\u2019s term as governor, which began at the start of 2011, a total of 4,421 Syrian refugees arrived in the U.S., and just 10 of them were relocated in New Mexico.", "\u201cNew Mexico is actually a state with very little refugee resettlement,\u201d said Matthew Soerens, a spokesman for World Relief, one of the nine resettlement agencies that help to relocate refugees from all over the world in the U.S.", "In other words, Trump\u2019s claim that \u201clarge numbers\u201d of Syrian refugees have been relocated to New Mexico under Martinez\u2019s watch is wrong.", "Experts tell is Trump is also off base with his boast that as a governor he could have stopped Syrian refugees from entering his state.", "The Refugee Act of 1980 \u201cmakes clear that the federal government has the responsibility for determining who is to be admitted as a refugee,\u201d Soerens told us via email.", "While more than 30 governors said last year that they oppose letting Syrian refugees into their states, and several vowed to prohibit it, none followed through or had any success.", "For example, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal signed an order in November that sought to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees in his state. Specifically, the executive order attempted to stop state agencies from being involved in accepting refugees.\u00a0 But Deal later rescinded that order after the state\u2019s Attorney General released an opinion in which he said he was \u201cunaware of any law or agreement that would permit a state to carve out refugees from particular countries from participation in the refugee resettlement program, no matter how well-intended or justified the desire to carve out such refugees might be.\u201d", "\u201cAccordingly, it is my official opinion that both federal law and the State\u2019s agreement to act as the state refugee resettlement coordinator prevent the State from denying federally-funded benefits to Syrian refugees lawfully admitted into the United States,\u201d Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens wrote.", "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also vowed to legally challenge the federal law, after announcing in November that his state would not accept any Syrian refugees. But a federal judge denied the Texas Attorney General\u2019s request for a temporary injunction to block the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Texas.", "\u201cThe Court does not deny that the Syrian refugees pose some risk. That would be foolish,\u201d U.S. District Judge David C. Godbey wrote in February. \u201cIn our country, however, it is the federal executive that is charged with assessing and mitigating that risk, not the states and not the courts.\u201d", "As those cases make clear, Soerens said, \u201cIf Mr. Trump intends to abide by the law and submit to the authority of our court system, he would not have \u2018a choice\u2019 as governor to halt resettlement.\u201d", "Added Kevin Appleby, senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies: \u201cThe law is pretty clear that the federal government has the power, once a refugee has been accepted, to resettle them anywhere in the U.S.\u201d", "And despite the rhetoric, threats and best efforts of some governors strongly opposed to resettlement of Syrian refugees, Stacie Blake, director of government and community relations for the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, told us that \u201cthe U.S. refugee program has continued unabated.\u201d She said, \u201cThe program [including for Syrian refugees] is proceeding as it always has. There has been no slow-down due to any of the statements or actions of any of the governors.\u201d\u00a0(You can read more about the resettlement process in a story we wrote in November debunking Trump\u2019s claim that Syrian refugees are steered to Republican states.)", "American University law professor Stephen I. Vladeck told us the governors\u2019 bold prohibitions against accepting Syrian refugees in their states was \u201ca lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\u201d", "\u201cStates have absolutely zero legal authority to refuse to allow refugees already admitted into the United States into their jurisdiction, specifically, regardless of their purported justification,\u201d Vladeck told us via email. \u201cAnd if a state is specifically barring refugees of particular national origin, race, or religious belief, then that policy is doubly unconstitutional \u2014 on both federalism and individual rights grounds.\u201d", "After Trump made his statements about Martinez, her press secretary Mike Lonergan, released a statement\u00a0 saying that Martinez \u201cwill not be bullied into supporting a candidate until she is convinced that candidate will fight for New Mexicans.\u201d Lonergan also noted that Martinez \u201chas strongly opposed the President\u2019s Syrian refugee plan.\u201d", "Last November, after the ISIS attacks in Paris, Martinez released a statement opposing President Obama\u2019s plan to accept more Syrian refugees \u201cuntil there is a very clear plan in place to properly vet and place the refugees, and the voices of governors and the public can be heard.\u201d Martinez\u2019s press office noted that Martinez\u2019s position was criticized by the mayor of Santa Fe, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson and the American Civil Liberties Union.", "The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for clarification of his comments. Trump may argue that he would have done more to try to stop relocation of Syrian refugees. But he can\u2019t say \u201cthat\u00a0wouldn\u2019t be happening,\u201d because the law and federal courts say otherwise.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ed9657cb-78d7-498f-b078-5b19910a9f2c", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
