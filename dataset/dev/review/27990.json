Some of the demonstrations turned violent.", "The post showed four images.

Peaceful protesters should be protected \u2014 but arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted \u2014 and local law enforcement can do that.\"", "After protests in downtown Portland, Ore., for every night for nearly three months following Floyd\u2019s killing, Biden said Aug. 30 in a statement while campaigning: \"I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right.
