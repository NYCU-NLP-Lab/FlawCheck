["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on September 23, 2020", "After Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death, social media users reprised a false claim about the late Supreme Court justice \u2014 arguing she wanted to \u201clower the age of consent for sex to 12.\u201d The old falsehood is a distortion of a report she co-authored in the 1970s on sex bias in federal laws.", "A decades-old falsehood about Ruth Bader Ginsburg was aired again on social media in the days following the late Supreme Court justice\u2019s Sept. 18 death.", "A screenshot of a tweet shared on the Instagram \u201cpoliticalward\u201d falsely declared: \u201cWhy is everyone pretending to be sad that RBG died? It was GOOD riddance by a long shot, she wanted to lower the age of consent for sex to 12.\u201d", "Liked by more than 4,000 users, the post called her \u201ca pedophile sympathizer\u201d and celebrated her death with an apparent nod to the rampant QAnon conspiracy theory, calling her \u201c[o]ne less Democrat Pedophile to worry about.\u201d The tweet appears to be from a related Twitter account: Its bio links to a website for \u201cPoliticalward Co.,\u201d which sells apparel and accessories supportive of President Donald Trump.", "But the attack on Ginsburg\u2019s character is built on a persisting, debunked distortion of work that Ginsburg did in the 1970s against sex discrimination in federal law.", "In fact, the claim about Ginsburg has been floated around since at least her Senate confirmation hearings to the high court in 1993.\u00a0At the hearings, for example, Susan Hirschmann, the then-executive director of a national conservative group called Eagle Forum, read a statement that posed numerous questions, including, \u201cDo you still believe, as you wrote in 1977, that the age of consent for sexual acts should be lowered to 12 years?\u201d", "Hirschmann\u2019s statement made reference to\u00a0\u201cSex Bias in the U.S. Code,\u201d a 1977 report by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights that Ginsburg had helped draft as a Columbia University law professor.", "The claim surfaced again in 2005 after Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham repeated it during a Senate confirmation hearing on John Roberts, now the Supreme Court\u2019s chief justice, saying, \u201cShe wants the age of consent to be 12.\u201d", "But the \u201cSex Bias in the U.S. Code\u201d report cited as evidence for the claims contains no actual arguments for changing the consent age in its 230 pages.", "Instead, the report at one point discusses how federal provisions relating to rape \u201cclearly fail to comply with the equal rights principle. They fail to recognize that women of all ages are not the only targets of sexual assault; men and boys can also be the victims of rape. In the case of statutory rape, the immaturity and vulunerability (sic) of young people of both sexes could be protected through appropriately drawn, sex-neutral proscriptions.\u201d", "It further says that a proposed Senate bill at the time, S. 1400, or the Criminal Code Reform Act of 1973 \u201cwould sex-neutralize the substance of several Title 18 provisions.\u201d The bill was sponsored by Republican Sen. Roman Lee Hruska and co-sponsored by Democratic Sen. John Little McClellan.", "The report later\u00a0offered recommendations for changing the language in several federal laws to be sex-neutral, including a section of the U.S. code on the issue of rape. It suggested the U.S. should \u201celiminate the phrase \u2018carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife who has not attained the age of sixteen years\u2019 and substitute a Federal, sex-neutral definition of the offense patterned after S. 1400 \u00a71633.\u201d", "It then\u00a0included\u00a0that purported section of the Senate bill, but it incorrectly\u00a0used\u00a0the language from a different section (1631), which\u00a0did\u00a0reference a consent age of 12.", "Sex Bias in the U.S. Code, April 1977:\u00a018 U.S.C. \u00a72032 \u2014 Eliminate the phrase \u201ccarnal knowledge of any female, not his wife who has not attained the age of sixteen years\u201d and substitute a Federal, sex-neutral definition of the offense patterned after S. 1400 \u00a71633: A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person, not his spouse, and (1) compels the other person to participate: (A) by force or (B) by threatening or placing the other person in fear that any person will imminently be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; (2) has substantially impaired the other person\u2019s power to appraise or control the conduct by administering or employing a drug or intoxicant without the knowledge or against the will of such other person, or by other means; or (3) the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old.", "As we said, the report was explicit that it was recommending a \u201cfederal, sex neutral definition\u201d for rape \u201cpatterned\u201d after that bill (emphasis ours); the report does not express support or rationale for lowering the age of consent.", "The report also\u00a0recommended changes \u201cof pronoun usage throughout the Senate bill S. 1400 to conform with the proposed sex-neutral terminology format. S. 1400 retains use of the masculine pronoun to cover individuals of both sexes.\u201d", "In a\u00a02004\u00a0blog post, University of California Los Angeles law professor\u00a0Eugene Volokh\u00a0initially\u00a0suggested\u00a0that the claim about Ginsburg seemed accurate based on a literal reading of\u00a0that section of the\u00a0report. But he\u00a0later\u00a0revised his reading\u00a0of the report, concluding that Ginsburg was likely \u201cthe victim of a drafting error\u201d by her team writing the report. He pointed out that the section number of the bill cited \u2014 1633 \u2014 was wrongly paired with the language from section 1631.", "A copy of the Senate bill shows that section 1633 deals with sexual abuse of a minor, and references a consent age of 16 with exceptions for those close in age.", "S. 1400, March 27, 1973: \u00a7 1633, Sexual Abuse of a Minor \u201c(a) OFFENSE.\u2014A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person who is not his spouse, who is less than sixteen years old, and who is at least five years younger than the actor.", "(Volokh wrote\u00a0that the report\u2019s recommendations were seemingly \u201calso intended to make sure that any sex with under-12-year-olds, regardless of the age of the other party, would be illegal.\u201d)", "Volokh told us in a phone interview there is nothing else in the report that suggests Ginsburg was actually advocating a policy of a flat consent age of 12. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like there was really a massive movement to try to lower the age of consent to 12\u201d at the time, he said, \u201cso it would kind of surprise me that they would \u2014 without much discussion \u2014 that that\u2019s what they would be trying to do.\u201d", "Slate\u2019s Timothy Noah, who thoroughly\u00a0examined\u00a0the matter in 2005,\u00a0noted that the language from section 1631 at the heart of the false claims\u00a0also allowed for rape of a spouse: \u201cI would further guess that neither Ginsburg nor her feminist cohorts at the Columbia Law School Equal Rights Advocacy Project were particularly crazy about the quoted language\u2019s get-out-of-jail-free card for married men who raped their wives.\u201d", "The issue did not appear to be of concern for the Senate that confirmed her, 96-3: During the 1993 confirmation hearings, the senators didn\u2019t ask Ginsburg about that part of \u201cSex Bias in the U.S. Code.\u201d", "But Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, referencing work she did with the American Civil Liberties Union, did ask whether she thought states had the right under the Constitution to criminalize sex between adults and minors, even if the minor \u201callegedly consents.\u201d She said they did \u2014 and referred to \u201cchild abuse\u201d as \u201ca deplorable thing.\u201d", "Hatch, July 22, 1993: [D]o you have any doubt that the States have the constitutional authority to enact statutory rape laws to impose criminal sanctions on sexual contact between an adult and a minor, even where the minor allegedly consents?", "Ginsburg: Not at all, Senator Hatch. What I did have a strong objection to was the sex classification.", "Hatch:\u00a0Sure.", "Ginsburg:\u00a0I think child abuse is a deplorable thing, whether it is same sex, opposite sex, male-female, and the State has to draw lines based on age. What I do object to is the vision of the world that supposes a woman is always the victim. So my only objection to that policy was its sex specificity.", "Hatch: So as long as they treat males and females equally, that is your concern?", "Ginsburg:\u00a0Yes, and I think that as much as we would not like these things to go on, children are abused, it is among the most deplorable things, and it doesn\u2019t\u2014", "Hatch:\u00a0And the State has power to correct it.", "Ginsburg: Yes, and has power to draw lines on the basis of age that are inevitably going to be arbitrary at the edge.", "So the claim that Ginsburg \u201cwanted to lower the age of consent for sex to 12\u201d appears to have been\u00a0based on\u00a0a drafting error\u00a0or an out-of-context reading of one paragraph of a 230-page report \u2014 whose main focus was sex discrimination \u2014 from 1977.", "There is nothing else we could find to support the argument that Ginsburg advocated such a position, or that she was a \u201cpedophile sympathizer\u201d for that matter, as is being claimed on social media.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
