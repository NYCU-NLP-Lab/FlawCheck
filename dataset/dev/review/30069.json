["Popular Nigerian activist Deji Adeyanju published the claim on his\u00a0Facebook page\u00a0-- which has\u00a0more than 260,000 followers -- and also on\u00a0Twitter.", "He said that Nigeria\u2019s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has borrowed 27 trillion naira over\u00a0the past five years. He compares this to 10.6 trillion naira ($27\u00a0billion) borrowed by the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) during their 16-year rule from 1999 to 2015.", "Nearly 1,500 people have shared a similar version of the claim published in this Facebook post.", "Africa's largest economy is facing growing debt costs as it has turned to local and\u00a0overseas lenders to fund key projects following a recession in 2016.", "How much debt did Nigeria owe under PDP?", "According to government figures, Nigeria\u2019s total public debt -- including local and international borrowing by the federal and state\u00a0governments -- stood at 12.1 trillion naira ($30 billion) in June 2015,\u00a0a month after the APC's Muhammadu Buhari\u00a0took over as president from the PDP's Goodluck Jonathan.\u00a0The figure exceeds the 10.6 trillion naira of debt Adeyanju attributed to PDP governments.", "On top of the 12.1 trillion in debt the APC inherited from the PDP\u00a0in 2015, the APC\u00a0had increased\u00a0borrowing to 27.4 trillion naira by December 2019, as shown in the table below.", "The APC administration has therefore piled up 15.3\u00a0trillion naira ($39 billion) in fresh debt since it took office, as opposed to the 27 trillion naira ($69 billion)\u00a0claimed by\u00a0Facebook posts.", "While the 27.4 trillion naira is actually the total outstanding debt accumulated by successive administrations in Nigeria as of December 2019, the APC government alone had borrowed 15.3\u00a0trillion naira\u00a0-- more than half of the country's total debt -- in nearly five years.", "AFP Fact Check has previously debunked claims that Nigeria paid off all its debts in 2007.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
