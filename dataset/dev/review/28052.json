Trump has referenced her foundation ties in the past, saying she needs to \"return the $25 million\" Saudi Arabia gave the foundation.", "The William J. Clinton Foundation was incorporated in 1997. The foundation agreed to disclose its donors when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009.", "We wondered whether the Clintons\u2019 donor list holds up to Trump\u2019s claim.", "But first, it is important to note that political candidates cannot take money from foreign entities.", "\"The prohibition in the Federal Election Campaign Act is against candidates or political committees soliciting, accepting or receiving contributions from foreign nationals, not only governments,\" said Michael Malbin, a political science professor at the University at\u00a0Albany.", "Hillary Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin also noted that the former first lady played no role in the foundation while she was secretary of state.", "\"Further, she did not blink before standing up to countries that oppressed their people and denied them of their rights, from LGBT rights to women's rights,\" Schwerin said.", "Nonetheless. looking at the Clinton Foundation\u2019s donor list, Saudi Arabia gave between $10 million and $25 million. But the foundation reported the Saudi money in December 2008,\u00a0and the amount hasn\u2019t changed since.\u00a0Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra pointed out that Saudi Arabia did not give to the foundation while Secretary Clinton was at the State Department.", "The foundation has also taken between\u00a0$1 million and $5 million each from United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. As The Wall Street Journal reported, several of these donations came in 2014, after Clinton's tenure at the State Department.", "We've fact-checked a similar claim before when\u00a0Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in April 2015 that Clinton took money from the kings of \"Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Oman and Yemen.\" Every country except Yemen has contributed\u00a0to the Clinton Foundation, but Preibus' claim made it seem like Clinton herself took the money.
