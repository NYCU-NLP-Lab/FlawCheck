["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on January 12, 2021", "A viral tweet that migrated to Facebook distorts the facts on the consequences of a potential, second impeachment of President Donald Trump. Impeachment alone would not strip Trump of his pension or bar him from pursuing office in the future, as the post falsely claims.", "The House is pursuing a potential, second impeachment of President Donald Trump \u2014 charging him with \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d that led to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. A vote is expected in the House on Jan. 13.", "But a viral message shared by left-leaning pages on social media distorts the facts surrounding the legal ramifications of an impeachment. Its false message is in part premised on a failure to distinguish between an impeachment (by the House) and a subsequent conviction and removal from office (which is a decision by the Senate). But the post is inaccurate for other reasons, too.", "The post, a screenshot of a tweet, reads: \u201cFor those wondering if it\u2019s worth impeaching him this time, it means he: 1) loses his 200K+ pension for the rest of his life 2) loses his 1 million dollar/year travel allowance 3) loses lifetime full secret service detail 4) loses his ability to run in 2024.\u201d The original tweet was retweeted more than 180,000 times before it was deleted.", "But an impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House does not alone result in any of those penalties.", "For starters, the prospect of Trump losing \u201cthe ability to run in 2024\u201d is not an automatic result of an impeachment, or even a conviction by the Senate. If the Senate did convict a president (which to date has never been done), a separate vote would be required to also disqualify him from holding future office.", "Brian Kalt, a Michigan State University law professor, noted to FactCheck.org that there is\u00a0some\u00a0debate\u00a0over whether the Constitution\u2019s language about such disqualification applies to the presidency. Kalt, for his part, said he believes it does.", "Peter J. Smith, a George Washington University professor who specializes in constitutional law, said in a phone interview that the argument that the presidency wouldn\u2019t qualify for disqualification is generally considered an \u201coutlier view\u201d \u2014 and one that is \u201cbased on a very close parsing of constitutional text\u201d and \u201cthat would lead to some very surprising results.\u201d", "As for stripping Trump of the benefits afforded to former presidents, the Former Presidents Act addresses eligibility for benefits \u2014 such as the pension, staff and an annual \u201csecurity and travel\u201d allowance. The act says those benefits would not apply to a president whose service is terminated \u201cby removal pursuant to section 4 of article II of the Constitution of the United States of America,\u201d which addresses impeachment and removal from office. (The emphasis is ours.)", "It appears unlikely that a potential Senate trial \u2014 and therefore any possible conviction \u2014 would take place before Trump leaves office on Jan. 20. (We also note that there is some legal debate over the process of conducting an impeachment trial after a president leaves office.)", "Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, argues that in his reading of the law, the exclusion of benefits would not apply to a president who is convicted in the Senate after having already left office.", "\u201cIf Trump is impeached before January 20, and convicted after January 20, he would still be a \u2018former President,'\u201d Blackman wrote in a Jan. 10 post on Reason.com. \u201cWhy? A \u2018former President\u2019 cannot be removed from a position he no longer holds.\u201d", "Smith, the George Washington University professor, said that was a reasonable read of the law\u2019s text but also said there could, in theory, be judges who would find that Congress meant to disqualify presidents who are convicted in an impeachment trial \u2014 and that it hadn\u2019t considered presidents convicted after leaving office.", "Either way, the viral post is wrong by saying that impeachment alone would result in the loss of such benefits. And there are other issues with the post, too.", "It says that Trump \u201closes lifetime full secret service detail\u201d if impeached.", "But legal experts said it was unlikely Trump would lose Secret Service protection even if he were convicted and removed from office before Jan. 20.", "Citing another part of federal law,\u00a018 U.S. Code \u00a7 3056, Blackman wrote that it\u2019s possible Trump would still be eligible for the Secret Service protection even if the president was removed from office. CNN points out\u00a0that former President Barack Obama signed a law in 2013 that amended that part of the U.S. Code to authorize lifetime Secret Service protection for former presidents, and that it does not define \u201cformer president.\u201d", "\u201cIt isn\u2019t clear that Section 3056 extends to a removed President, but I think the best reading, in context, is that it should,\u201d Blackman told us in an email.", "Cary Coglianese, a University of Pennsylvania professor of law and political science, said: \u201cIf President Trump were to be impeached and then convicted and removed from office before January 20, 2021, he would almost certainly not automatically lose the Secret Service protection which he would otherwise expect to receive after January 20, 2021.\u201d", "Coglianese in an email to FactCheck.org said the Former Presidents Act authorizes funds \u201cappropriated to the Administrator of General Services\u201d \u2014 which is separate from the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cThe power of the Secret Service to protect former Presidents is authorized by separate statute (18 USC 3056),\u201d he said.", "In short, he said that there was no reason to think the definition of a \u201cformer president\u201d used in the Former Presidents Act would apply to the Secret Service protections provided to former presidents under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 3056.", "We also asked the Secret Service to address this point and didn\u2019t hear back; we\u2019ll update this story if we do.", "Finally, the Former Presidents Act authorizes the $1 million per fiscal year for \u201csecurity and travel\u00a0related\u00a0expenses\u201d for former presidents \u201c[p]rovided\u2026 the former President\u2026 was not receiving protection for a lifetime provided by the United States Secret Service under section 3056 paragraph (a) subparagraph (3) of title 18, United States Code.\u201d", "In other words, the law does not provide former presidents with\u00a0both lifetime Secret Service protection and the $1 million travel and security allowance, as the post suggests.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
