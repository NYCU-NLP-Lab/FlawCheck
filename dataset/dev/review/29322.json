["By Mitchell Aronoff", "Posted on November 15, 2019", "President Donald Trump recently boasted about the unusually high number of judicial appointments he has made so far, but in doing so he exaggerated and mischaracterized some of the facts:", "Trump\u2019s comments came during a Nov. 6 press conference to celebrate the now more than 150 federal judges that have been appointed under his administration. During the press conference, Trump said that by the time he leaves office, he will have appointed more and better judges than any other president in history.", "Trump, Nov. 6: But in terms of, I\u2019d like to say, quality and quantity, we are going to be, I think, just about No. 1 by the time we finish \u2014 No. 1 of any president, any administration.", "It is true that Trump has been quickly filling judicial openings. According to a Sept. 4, 2018, Washington Post analysis, Trump \u201chas filled the influential circuit court judgeships at a faster pace than his recent predecessors.\u201d In his less than three years in office, Trump has filled two Supreme Court openings, 43 circuit court vacancies and 111 district court judgeships, according to data collected by the Federal Judicial Center on Nov. 14. (FJC, \u201cthe research and education agency of the judicial branch of the United States Government,\u201d updates this data nightly.) For comparison, Obama filled two Supreme Court positions, 55 circuit court vacancies and 269 district court openings in eight years.", "While the quality of these judges is a matter of opinion, the ratings of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees by the American Bar Association do not support his claim.", "The ABA releases Federal Judiciary Ratings according to which Congress received the nomination. According to its website, \u201cThe Standing Committee rates each nominee \u2018Well Qualified,\u2019 \u2018Qualified\u2019 or \u2018Not Qualified.\u2019 Unanimous committee ratings appear as a single rating. In other situations, the rating from the majority or substantial majority (constituting ten to thirteen votes) of the Committee is recorded first, followed by the rating or ratings of a minority of the Committee. The majority rating is the rating of the committee.\u201d", "No judge nominated or confirmed during the Obama administration\u2019s eight years received a majority \u201cNot Qualified\u201d rating by the ABA. However, nine of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees received a majority rating of \u201cNot Qualified.\u201d Five of these nine nominees have since been confirmed. Two more are still in the nomination process, and two of them failed to be confirmed by the Senate.", "Specifically, two appeals court judges appointed by Trump, Leonard Steven Grasz and Jonathan A. Kobes, received a \u201cNot Qualified\u201d rating by the ABA. Moreover, three Trump administration appointees to district courts received the same rating.", "According to data compiled by FJC, only five presidents (Donald Trump, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter and Lyndon B. Johnson) have had a judicial appointee confirmed with a majority ABA rating of \u201cNot Qualified,\u201d and none had as many as Trump\u2019s five. Both Bush and LBJ appointed four judges the ABA rated \u201cNot Qualified,\u201d while Carter and Clinton both got three judges confirmed with the same rating.", "As for the quantity of appointed judges, Trump again derisively thanked Obama for the large number of judicial vacancies he inherited when he came into office. But Trump\u2019s gratitude is misplaced.", "Trump, Nov 6: You know, it is true, when I first came to office \u2014 because of what I said before, that I\u2019ve always heard how important it is the choice of judges and the number of judges. And in my first day, I said to one of our assistants, \u201cHow many judges do I have to pick? How many are there?\u201d And I figured I\u2019d hear none or one, maybe two. They said, \u201cSir, you have 142.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, no, no, tell me truth. I want the truth.\u201d (Laughter.) That was it. And I say: Thank you, President Obama, very much.", "When Trump took office, there were 112 federal judicial vacancies. That\u2019s a high number of vacancies, but as we have written before, that was not the result of complacency by Obama, but rather opposition to Obama\u2019s judicial nominations from Senate Republicans who held a majority\u00a0during the last two years of Obama\u2019s presidency. Experts told us Senate Republicans confirmed far fewer judicial nominees in Obama\u2019s last two years than had been confirmed in the last two years of previous presidents. As a result, in early January 2017, just before Trump took office, there were\u00a059 federal court nominees\u00a0pending. That\u2019s why Trump inherited so many vacancies.", "Trump also misleadingly boasted that his newly appointed circuit court judges are significantly younger than Obama\u2019s, by an average of 10 years.", "Trump, Nov. 6: The average age of my newly appointed circuit court judges is less than 50. They\u2019re young, smart. That\u2019s 10 years younger than President Obama\u2019s nominees.", "The same claim was made in a White House fact sheet released after the press conference. We reached out to the White House press office for evidence for this claim, but we did not get a response.", "It\u2019s unclear whether the administration meant to distinguish between \u201cnominees\u201d and \u201cappointees\u201d of each administration, but we have data on the confirmed appointees to evaluate this\u00a0particular\u00a0claim\u00a0about the ages of the judges.", "While it is true that Obama\u2019s appointees are now on average 10 years older than Trump\u2019s, Obama\u2019s presidency began nearly 11 years ago in 2009. A more meaningful comparison is the average age of judicial appointments at the time the judges were confirmed. Using the same FJC data, we found that the average age of Trump\u2019s circuit court judges was about 48.5 at the time they were appointed. Obama\u2019s, on average, were about 53 years old. So Trump\u2019s appointees, on average, are younger, but by about 4.5 years, not 10.", "(FJC largely includes only the birth year, instead of full date of birth, for judges, making it impossible to calculate judges\u2019 exact age at the time of their confirmation. However, this information does still tell us how old they would have been during the year they were confirmed.)", "In a phone interview, Arthur D. Hellman, a University of Pittsburgh law professor who studies the federal judiciary, told us that this age difference is not particularly significant in terms of professional experience, but that being younger does give judges a longer time frame to utilize their lifetime appointments.", "In addition to a lengthier judicial career, the age and particularly the youth of judicial appointees has another important political ramification, Hellman explained. Younger judges have a better opportunity to plan their retirement, giving them the ability to give up a spot for the president to fill if they are of the same party, or perhaps wait for a more favorable shift in executive power. Youth, in effect, gives judges who are more politically focused a better opportunity to ensure that their vacancy goes to someone of the same political party who will share their view.", "Trump limited his comment about the youth of his judicial appointees to those for the circuit court. The circuit court, also known as the U.S.\u00a0Courts\u00a0of Appeals, is the second highest in the U.S. judicial system and often the last opportunity for legal disputes to be argued. The president also appoints judges to district courts \u2014 and typically in larger numbers.", "In an article published in March, BuzzFeed found that the average age of all judges confirmed by the two administrations is much closer: Under Trump the average age at the time of appointment was 50 years old, and under Obama the average age was 51.", "In terms of Supreme Court justices, the two administrations are also more similar in the ages of their appointments (albeit for a much smaller sample size). Trump and Obama both appointed two Supreme Court justices (who all currently sit on the Supreme Court). Trump appointed Brett Kavanaugh, who turned 53 during the year of his confirmation, and Neil Gorsuch, who turned 50. Similarly, Obama appointed Elena Kagan, who was 50 during the year of her confirmation, and Sonia Sotomayor, who became 55 in the same year she was confirmed.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
