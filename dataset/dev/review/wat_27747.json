["The Ohio Republican Party hosted its annual state dinner and fund-raiser in Cleveland on July 22, 2011, that rallied its members around state and national issues and candidates.\n\nThe annual event, which is moved outside Columbus during off-year elections, featured Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel of Lyndhurst (near Cleveland), who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, and Louisiana\u2019s Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, a conservative who regularly speaks about GOP priorities.\n\nThe two politicians and others at the dinner easily revved up the crowd by blaming Democrats for the nation\u2019s debt problems and by praising themselves for passing a collective bargaining law for public workers in Ohio that limits the power of unions.\n\nCuyahoga County Republicans deserved to have the event in their backyard because they provide the GOP a big chunk of votes in state elections, Ohio Republican Party chair Kevin DeWine said during the dinner.\n\nTo illustrate this point, he noted that in 2008 Republican Sen. John McCain garnered more votes for the presidency in the Democratic-dominated county than he did in seven states.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio thought the statistic was worth examining given the GOP\u2019s view \u00a0that Cuyahoga County, Ohio\u2019s most populous, is a battleground within a battleground state that could have a big say in the fate of the new collective bargining law, which will be before voters in November.\n\n\"The Republican Party must compete aggressively in Cuyahoga County in order to carry the state,\" explains DeWine, who sees the recent public corruption scandal involving Democratic officials as helping the GOP cause.\n\nSo how many votes did McCain win in the county?\n\nThe last amended 2008 general election results on file with the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections shows that McCain received 199,880, or about 30 percent. Democrat Barack Obama received 458,422 votes.\n\nComparing this figure against the state vote totals, McCain indeed racked up more votes in Cuyahoga County than he did in seven states.\n\nObama carried these four states, shown here with McCain\u2019s vote totals:", "Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, Amended Canvas Summary Reporter, Jan. 13, 2009\n\nU.S. Electoral College, 2008 popular vote tallies\n\nU.S. Census, interactive population map\n\nNew York Times, presidential election results interactive map", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
