Scott Walker, who was first elected in 2010, has warned about complacency and the prospect of Democrats winning the office in the fall.", "The race as of July is a still-dense field of Democratic candidates challenging Walker, who withstood challenges by Democrats Tom Barrett in 2012 and Mary Burke in 2014.", "State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers has been leading the field of Democrats in the polls, and in a June 27, 2018, campaign email made a claim we want to check: \"I\u2019m the first Democrat to ever lead Scott Walker in an election year.\"", "Is he right?", "The Evers poll", "When asked for backup, Evers\u2019 campaign team did not point to any independent polling that confirmed a lead over Walker.", "Instead, they pointed to an Evers-financed poll that was conducted from May 9 to 10, 2018, by the privately-owned, Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling.", "Those who participated in the automated telephone interviews were not informed of who paid for the poll, and Evers\u2019 campaign had nothing to do with the poll other than paying for it, said Jim Williams, an analyst with the firm.", "Respondents were asked: \"If the election for Governor were held today and the candidates were Democratic Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Schools Tony Evers, and Republican Governor Scott Walker, who would you vote for?\"", "The result: Evers received 49 percent, while Walker had 45 percent, with 6 percent undecided.", "According to a news release regarding the poll, the firm questioned 644 registered voters in Wisconsin.

Walker also led the rest of his potential opponents in head-to-head matchups.", "In the most recent poll, released July 18, 2018, voters were not asked about direct matchups with Walker, but Evers led fellow Democratic contenders, with 31 percent of voters choosing Evers.", "Still, about 38% said they did not know who they plan to vote for in the August primary, and it is not yet clear that he\u2019d bode well against Walker if he does proceed to the November election. In the July poll, Walker\u2019s approval rating was 47 percent, with 45 percent disapproving.", "So, the internal poll cited by Evers is at odds with the main public poll released during this cycle.", "But, the main question is whether his claim holds up when looking at past Walker runs.", "Polls in past gubernatorial races", "When asked to support his claim, the Evers\u2019 campaign referred to past Marquette Law School polls during Burke\u2019s run against Walker in 2014 and Barrett\u2019s run in 2012, as well as a New York Times compilation of independent pollsters regarding the 2010 election between Walker and Barrett.

Also like the Evers PPP poll, those results are within the margin of error of +/- 3.27 percent.", "A May 2012 Marquette poll also showed that among registered voters Barrett led Walker 47percent to 46 percent. However, the one-point advantage was the opposite among likely voters, who preferred Walker 48 to 47 percent.", "2014: Polls showed the race between Burke and Walker as a tight one.
