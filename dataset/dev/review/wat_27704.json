["\u201cSHOCKER: CDC admits COVID-19 \u2018positive result\u2019 just means you've previously contracted the common cold,\u201d one Facebook post\u00a0says.", "Similar Facebook posts have been shared South Africa here and in the\u00a0US\u00a0archived here\u00a0and here.", "This Polish Facebook post shared a screenshot of the actual paragraph from the CDC's website. The caption translates to:\u00a0\"American CDC reports that a positive test result (allegedly for COVID-19) could mean that you had any other cold or flu caused by other coronaviruses\".", "The screenshot used in the post can be found on the CDC website under the topic: \u201cTest for Past Infection (Antibody Test)\u201d.", "But health experts say\u00a0the social media posts have misinterpreted the\u00a0paragraph --\u00a0including Kenyan doctor Githinji Gitahi,\u00a0a board member\u00a0of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The\u00a0institution is part\u00a0of the African Union and unrelated to the American CDC.", "Gitahi, who also\u00a0runs the medical NGO\u00a0Amref Health Africa,\u00a0told AFP Fact Check there are two types of tests for COVID-19\u00a0-- the direct or viral test, and the indirect test, also referred to as the antibody test.", "Blood samples are used to check for\u00a0traces of antibodies, which indicate if someone was previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus that causes COVID-19.", "The viral test, meanwhile, uses samples from the respiratory system, such as a swab from the inside of your nose, throat or lungs to detect an ongoing\u00a0COVID-19 infection.", "\"Since there is currently no antibody test that is specific to antibodies produced to fight SARS-CoV-2, there is a likelihood to test positive if one tests for antibodies but it might not be because of COVID-19 but because the antibodies came from other coronaviruses, even the one that causes the common cold,\" Gitahi said.", "\u201cBecause of this confusion, we do not use the antibody test to confirm COVID-19 infection but we use the viral test, which is conducted in the nose or throat with swabs or in the lungs.\u201d", "The US-based CDC told AFP Fact Check that a viral test will not produce a positive result for COVID-19 from\u00a0the traces of other human coronaviruses.", "\"The viral test detects the SARS-CoV-2 virus in respiratory samples. The presence of other human coronaviruses in a respiratory sample do not\u00a0produce a positive result on a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2,\" spokeswoman Jasmine Reed said in an email.", "\"A positive result on an antibody test might mean that a person had a past\u00a0infection with SARS-CoV-2. But there is a small chance that antibodies from an infection with a different coronavirus, such as the one that causes the common cold, might cause a positive result on a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test.\"", "WHO acknowledges that antibody tests such as serology testing can be used in COVID-19\u00a0 surveillance to measure the extent of infection in the population.", "But it cautions against the uncertainty of the test in terms of sensitivity and specificity, and its ability to \u201cassess cross-reactivity\u201d with other coronaviruses.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
