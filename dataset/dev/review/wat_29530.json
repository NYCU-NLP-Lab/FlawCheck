["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on February 16, 2021 | Updated on February 17, 2021", "Last year, before she was vice president, Kamala Harris used her social media accounts to encourage donations to a Minnesota nonprofit \u201cto help post bail\u201d for individuals arrested in the state while protesting the death of George Floyd.", "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham twisted those facts to claim \u201cshe actually bailed out rioters,\u201d one of whom, he said, \u201cwent back to the streets and broke somebody\u2019s head open.\u201d", "We found no evidence that happened.", "Graham made those remarks during a Feb. 14 interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d in which he discussed the Senate vote\u00a0the day before to acquit former President Donald Trump on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. Graham said Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial, which the South Carolina senator called \u201ca joke\u201d based on \u201chearsay upon hearsay,\u201d had \u201copened Pandora\u2019s box.\u201d", "\u201cIf you use this model, I don\u2019t know how Kamala Harris doesn\u2019t get impeached if the Republicans take over the House, because she actually bailed out rioters and one of the rioters went back to the streets and broke somebody\u2019s head open,\u201d Graham said.", "His office didn\u2019t respond to our request for supporting documentation.", "As we wrote in September, Harris asked her Twitter and Facebook followers in early June to \u201cchip in\u201d to the Minnesota Freedom Fund \u201cto help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota.\u201d The nonprofit pays the bail amount \u2014 which is set by a judge \u2014 for individuals who would otherwise be unable to afford to secure their release from jail while they await their day in court.", "A spokesperson for the vice president declined to say whether Harris donated herself.", "But thanks, in part, to Harris and other public figures who promoted the organization, MFF \u201craised nearly $40 million in donations from over one million individual donors in 2020,\u201d Greg Lewin, the organization\u2019s interim executive director, told us in an email.", "Lewin said \u201cover half a million has been spent\u201d on bail for people who were arrested while protesting against racism and police brutality, including the killing of Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck during a May 25 arrest in Minneapolis. (The now former officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death.)", "He also said MFF \u201cset aside $1.5 million to help cover costs for legal representation and related support for those fighting their cases.\u201d But most of those who were arrested while protesting \u201cweren\u2019t detained and instead were given citations then released, have been released with no bail, or held with no bail,\u201d MFF has said.", "It\u2019s true that MFF posted bail for some people who were accused of rioting, including 27-year-old Jaleel Stallings of St. Paul, who was charged with firing multiple shots at SWAT officers patrolling in an unmarked vehicle in Minneapolis on May 30.", "According to the criminal complaint filed by the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s office, one bullet \u201csparked and ricocheted in front of officers,\u201d though no one was injured by the shots.", "We are not aware, however, of any \u201crioters\u201d MFF assisted who \u201cwent back to the streets and broke somebody\u2019s head open,\u201d as Graham claimed.", "The senator may have been referencing Lionel Timms, a 32-year-old Minneapolis man, whom MFF bailed out of jail in late July, after he was arrested and charged with assaulting a passenger on a bus. Timms was arrested again on Aug. 14 and charged with third-degree assault for allegedly punching and kicking a man in an alley, leaving the victim with a fractured skull and a brain injury.", "But neither of his arrests was related to the demonstrations Harris mentioned on social media; so he was not one of the protesters whom she asked the public to help.", "In an Aug. 25 statement, Lewin said the group was \u201cdeeply saddened and troubled\u201d by the news about Timms, whom Lewin argued was not given the \u201csupport he needed to safely come back to the community,\u201d such as housing.", "Lewin said the incident showed: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we need to take steps to strengthen our internal procedures for supporting those we bail out, renew our commitment to listen to the communities directly impacted by our efforts, and look for concrete ways of improving our internal procedures.\u201d", "The nonprofit says it believes everyone is innocent until proven guilty and the nature of an alleged crime does not factor into its decision to pay bail.", "\u201cNearly half the people we pay bail for have had their case completely dismissed, suggesting there was never a case for the arrest or charge to begin with,\u201d MFF says in an FAQ section on its website. \u201cTherefore, if a judge has decided that someone can be released so long as they can afford the price, we will pay that fee if we can afford it. That is how we will support an end to a pretrial system that punishes poverty and creates a two-tiered system for those who have not been convicted of a crime.\u201d", "President Joe Biden and Harris also campaigned on ending cash bail and replacing it with a \u201cfair\u201d pretrial system without bias or discrimination.", "Update, Feb. 17: After this story was published, Graham\u2019s office responded. A spokesperson emailed us links to news articles and videos that said Harris \u201csupported,\u201d \u201ctalked up\u201d and \u201cpromoted\u201d MFF. One of the articles the spokesperson emailed also said that Lionel Timms had been bailed out by MFF before he was charged with committing a second physical assault. As we noted, Timms\u2019 prior arrest was unrelated to either a protest or riot.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
