["About this rating", "On 5 March 2019, a conspiracy-minded Twitter account shared a video purporting to be from the site of a construction project funded by West Virginia taxpayer money for the purpose of housing 321 Syrian refugees. The video also claimed this was being done at the expense of \u201cregular\u201d Americans who, the man claims, were being pushed into \u201csubstandard housing.\u201d He asserted that the area he was standing in will be a \u201csharia zone,\u201d and no non-Muslims will be allowed to enter:", "Several factual problems exist with assertions in this video. Chief among them is the fact that this video shows the Littlepage Terrace housing project, a low-income, housing tax-credit property allocated through the West Virginia Housing Development Fund, which houses zero Syrian refugees and many \u201cregular\u201d Americans. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, someone who works next to the project refers to it as Littlepage:", "Second, a wider, composite view of the man\u2019s video shows clearly identifiable markers of the Littlepage housing complex, including a tell-tale smokestack and buildings that exactly match the structures built at Littlepage:", "For comparison, here\u2019s video shot at Littlepage:", "Third, Mark Taylor, the chief executive officer of Charleston-Kanawha Housing Authority, which works with the Littlepage Terrace project, confirmed to us by email that the suspect video was taken at that site during renovations that likely occurred in May 2017. He also confirmed to us that the community houses no Syrian refugees.", "Another significant oversight in the tweeted narrative is that the entire state of West Virginia has taken in far less than 321 Syrian refugees in total. In 2016, the year the United States took in the largest number of Syrian refugees, West Virginia resettled only five of them in their state. On 1 February 2017, the Trump Administration announced Executive Order 13769, commonly referred to as the \u201ctravel ban,\" which indefinitely suspended the admission of Syrian refugees to the United States. In 2017, West Virginia took in 13 refugees, but these individuals were not necessarily Syrian.", "It is true that Littlepage was torn down and rebuilt, but that decision had nothing to do with refugee housing. Instead, the renovations aimed to \u201creduce crime and revitalize the area,\u201d as reported by West Virginia\u2019s WCHS television station in 2016:", "The Charleston-Kanawha Housing Authority is now on the last phase of revitalizing three housing projects. Similar to Orchard Manor and Washington Manor, Littlepage Terrace will be demolished and rebuilt as two-story town homes. \u2026 This housing project was built nearly 80 years ago with no air conditioning and poor visibility. Now it is simply not a secure living space. \u2026 The goal for these new developments is to reduce crime and revitalize the area.", "Because the housing complex displayed was not built for Syrian refugees, and because the state has taken virtually no Syrian refugees at all, we rank the claims made in this video as aggressively and demonstrably false.", "Charleston-Kanawha Housing. \u00a0 \u201cDevelopments - Littlepage Terrace.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 14 March 2019.", "Zong, Jie, and Jeanne Batalova. \u00a0 \u201cSyrian Refugees in the United States\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Migration Policy Institute. \u00a0 17 January 2017.", "Beck, Erin. \u00a0 \u201cFew Syrian Refugees Resettle in WV, At Least for Now.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Charleston Gazette-Mail. \u00a0 2 September 2016.", "Whitehouse.gov. \u00a0 \u201cExecutive Order Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 27 January 2017.", "U.S. Department of State. \u00a0 \u201cProposed Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2019.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 24 September 2018.", "Gunderson, Kaela. \u00a0 \u201cResidents, Housing Officials Hope Littlepage Terrace Project Will Boost Safety.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 WCHS/WCAH ABC 8. \u00a0 3 August 2016.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
