I supply goods to various Kirana stores. Let me explain the context behind \u2018Jio Wheat\u2019. Once a wholesaler procures processed wheat in bulk, wheat is packaged with a catchy title that is easily recognised by the consumers. For instance, when the movie \u2018Bahubali\u2019 was released some wholesalers sold wheat with \u2018Babhubali\u2019 written on the packaging.

He informed, \u201cWheat sacks are not RIL products as Jio is not in the food business. As for Jio Mart, it is an online grocery channel that doesn\u2019t manufacture products. Therefore, it cannot be related to Jio Atta images.
