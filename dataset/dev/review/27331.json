He has even vowed to force the Mexican government to pay for it.", "But did Clinton once back a wall?", "Here is how Trump phrased it in his Aug. 5, 2016 rally at the KI Convention Center:", "\"We\u2019re gonna have strong borders. We\u2019re gonna have a wall -- a big, powerful wall. You know that Hillary Clinton wanted a wall, a number of years ago.

Clinton hasn\u2019t detailed specific plans but has said she will protect U.S. borders through a combination of efforts, one being physical barriers.", "But this factcheck is not about Clinton\u2019s current platform. Rather, it is about what she may have supported in the past.", "When asked for backup, Trump\u2019s campaign pointed to a 2006 bill that Clinton voted for while a senator from New York.", "The bill -- the Secure Fence Act of 2006 -- authorized about 700 miles of fencing to be installed along the country\u2019s southern border, along with other security measures. It was the beginning of an attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform.", "The original bill specifically called for double-layer fencing across 700 miles of the border. Clinton, and 25 other Democratic senators, voted in favor of the bill. It passed the Senate 80-19 and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.", "So, it\u2019s fair to say she once supported a barrier along a large portion of the border.", "Today, 702 miles of fencing separates the United States from Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But just 36 miles are double-layered.

Maybe in some places it was a wall.\"", "Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute said the semantic differences are irrelevant.", "\"Whether it\u2019s a wall or a fence, it blocks people,\" Nowrasteh said. \"Quibbling between a wall and fence -- it\u2019s just a word game at that point.\"", "He noted a 700-mile barrier is substantial.

The center favors reduced immigration.", "\"It's clear that, at one point, Clinton supported a secure border that includes physical barriers,\" Feere said.", "Our rating", "In a Green Bay speech, Trump said \"Hillary Clinton wanted a wall.\"", "Clinton did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. For our purposes, the differences between a wall and a fence in this claim are not significant -- both block people.", "But the fence Clinton backed is not nearly as expansive as the wall Trump is promoting.
