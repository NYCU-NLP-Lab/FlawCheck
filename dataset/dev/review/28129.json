["About this rating", "In January 2018, the White House published the results of a routine medical examination performed on President Donald Trump by his then physician, Navy Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.", "Some observers greeted the details of the \"periodic physical exam\" with skepticism, expressing doubt about Trump's weight, in particular, which Jackson listed as being 239 pounds, and his height, which he listed as 6'3\".", "This skepticism, which often comes from individuals who are otherwise critical of the president and his policies, and part of the loosely-defined anti-Trump \"Resistance,\" has coalesced online into a self-described \"Girther\" movement, a reference to the \"Birther\" conspiracy theory which surrounded former president Barack Obama and which was championed by Trump himself.", "In late April, Jackson was embroiled in controversy after reports emerged of an alleged pattern of drinking to excess while at work, overprescribing medication, and harassing colleagues. As a result of these allegations, Jackson withdrew from consideration for Veterans Affairs Secretary, a position for which Trump had nominated him.", "Around the same time, the \"Girther\" movement crystalized into a full-blown conspiracy theory, claiming corrupt practices by the president in nominating Jackson for a cabinet position in return for the favor of \u2014 according to the theory \u2014 lying about his vital statistics.\u00a0 In the midst of all this innuendo and outright allegation, a viral meme emerged which appeared to some to be the smoking gun. Although the exact wording has varied, the meme typically reads as follows:", "BREAKING NEWS from [the Wall Street Journal], leaked documents from Walter Reed Hospital shows [sic] [the President of the United States] weight is 289 lbs, [blood pressure] is 154/91, cholesterol is 237.

Body shapes and types vary from person to person, based on several factors, and not everyone who weighs 239 pounds and is 6'3\" has a muscular build, or is required to have one in order to meet that weight at that height.", "Dr. Martin Binks is an associate professor of nutritional sciences at Texas Tech University and an expert in obesity and metabolism. While he did not specifically address the case of President Donald Trump, Binks explained the science to us:", "Observations of weight status made based on a fully clothed individual\u2019s appearance are inappropriate...\"Appearance\", when it comes to body composition and health risk, is basically useless (as is weight). Two people of equal height and weight may have vastly different body composition based on relative differences in body fat, bone density, muscle and water retention.", "Weight by itself is not a \"meaningful gauge\" of a person's health, Binks added, and sometimes fat deposits that are not visible to the casual observer can be more strongly associated with health risks than are visible ones:", "Visceral fat deposits \u2014 those for example surrounding and within organs, typically beneath the muscle \u2014 are associated with greater health risk.
