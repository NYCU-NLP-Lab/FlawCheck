["By Robert Farley, Lori Robertson and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on October 10, 2018", "In an op-ed for USA Today, President Donald Trump made a series of false and misleading statements about Medicare and health insurance in general:", "Trump wrote his op-ed under the headline \u201cDemocrats \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 plan will demolish promises to seniors.\u201d And, as the headline implies, the piece is largely about the\u00a0Medicare for All Act,\u00a0introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sept. 13, 2017.", "But it also makes sweeping, unsupported attacks on the \u201cradical socialist plans of the Democrats.\u201d The president falsely claims, for example, that Democrats support \u201copen borders\u201d and says, without evidence, that the\u00a0Democrats \u201cwill seek to slash budgets\u201d for Medicare and Social Security.", "Trump starts his op-ed with the claim that Medicare for All would \u201ccost\u00a0an astonishing $32.6 trillion during its first 10 years.\u201d That\u2019s one estimate of the cost to the federal government. But that doesn\u2019t take into account the offsetting savings in health care costs for others.", "Under the plan, as the expense of health care shifts entirely to the federal government, people, employers and state governments would pay less for health care. So the cost to the federal government might be $32 trillion, but the overall health expenditures would not increase by that amount. And supporters maintain it would result in overall net savings.", "Trump, Oct. 10: Dishonestly called \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d the Democratic proposal would establish a government-run, single-payer health care system that eliminates all private and employer-based health care plans and would cost\u00a0an astonishing $32.6\u00a0trillion\u00a0during its first 10 years.", "Trump is referencing an analysis by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University of the\u00a0Medicare for All Act, as\u00a0introduced by Sanders. The paper concluded the bill would cost the federal government an additional $32.6 trillion over its first 10 years of full implementation.", "That the federal government would pay more under Medicare for All is a given. The government would absorb all of the cost of health care. But that also would mean people would no longer have to pay for private health insurance, or foot the bill for copays, deductibles and other costs from employer plans.", "So proponents of Medicare for All argue that the increase or decrease in overall health care expenditures is the true \u201ccost\u201d of the plan.", "What the Mercatus paper says about the bill\u2019s effect on overall health expenditures has been the center of intense political debate. Sanders claimed the study from the Mercatus Center \u2014 which gets some of its funding from the libertarian Koch brothers \u2014 showed that his bill would reduce overall health expenditures by $2 trillion. But as we wrote\u00a0in August, that calculation is based on assumptions in Sanders\u2019 bill about reduced administrative and drug costs, as well as deeply reduced reimbursement rates to health care providers under a universal health care system. The author of the Mercatus paper contends those savings are unrealistic.", "The Mercatus report considered another alternative scenario, one that assumed instead that payments to health care providers would \u201cremain equal on average to the current-law blend of higher\u00a0private and lower public reimbursement rates.\u201d Under that scenario, the numbers showed a $3.3 trillion net\u00a0increase\u00a0in health care spending. Still, not $32 trillion.", "An Urban Institute analysis of the Medicare for All plan proposed by Sanders during the 2016 presidential campaign (which differs a bit from the bill Sanders introduced in the Senate) also concluded the federal government would spend about $32 trillion more over 10 years. (Though the estimates from Mercatus and Urban \u201cseem remarkably similar,\u201d the Urban Institute noted that its analysis is different. For example, the analyses looked at different 10-year windows and made different assumptions about how much the government would pay to health care providers.)", "\u201cThe increase in federal spending is so large because the federal government would absorb a substantial amount of current spending by state and local governments, employers, and households,\u201d the report states.", "In other words, lead author John Holahan told us in a phone interview, yes, there would be an increase in federal government spending, and an increase in taxes to pay for that. But, he said, private spending on health care would be nearly eliminated.", "The Urban Institute analysis concluded national health expenditures would increase by $6.6 trillion (16.6 percent) between 2017 and 2026. Part of that increase is tied to an expansion of long-term care benefits that was part of Sanders\u2019 plan during the campaign but is not the bill he ultimately introduced.", "Sanders\u2019 office argues Medicare for All would save money on health care expenditures overall, due to savings such as administrative cost-sharing and reduced prescription drug costs.", "There are lots of assumptions and speculation involved in analyzing such a massive health care overhaul, and we take no position on whether Sanders\u2019 plan would reduce national health care expenditures, or increase them by several trillion dollars. The point is that Trump\u2019s claim that it would cost $32.6 trillion is an estimate of what it would cost the federal government. It is not an estimate of the impact on national health expenditures.", "An op-ed is an opinion piece, and the president offers his opinion that a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan would mean fewer benefits for seniors. The legislation as written, however, includes an increase in Medicare benefits.", "Trump wrote that the proposal would \u201ctake away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives.\u201d And he goes on to say: \u201c[T]he Democratic\u00a0plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care. Doctors and hospitals would be put out of business. Seniors would lose access to their favorite doctors. There would be long wait lines for appointments and procedures. Previously covered care would effectively be denied.\u201d", "In terms of benefits, the Sanders plan calls for adding new benefits to Medicare coverage, including dental, vision and hearing aids, and eliminating deductibles. That would be giving more benefits to seniors, not taking any away.", "The president offers his opinion that it wouldn\u2019t work out that way. A White House spokesperson pointed to\u00a0longer wait times\u00a0in the United Kingdom, as detailed in a January New York Times story, and \u201crationed\u00a0care,\u201d\u00a0in Canada, as a column in the conservative\u00a0National Review\u00a0said in 2017. And, the spokesperson said, once people leave private plans, they would \u201cundoubtedly\u201d lose \u201caccess to certain coverage and doctors.\u201d", "Trump overstates the consensus when he says that \u201cwe have seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal,\u201d referring to the Medicare for All Act.", "It\u2019s true that 16 Democrats in the Senate have co-sponsored Sanders\u2019 Medicare For All bill. And 123 Democrats in the House co-sponsored the Expanded & Improved Medicare For All Act introduced by former Rep. John Conyers.", "But it\u2019s not clear that Democrats are \u201cuniting\u201d around that one proposal. Sanders\u2019 bill is one of a handful of proposals in Congress.", "There\u2019s the Medicare-X Choice Act, which would offer a public plan option based on Medicare through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace. The bill was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Michael Bennett, and has 10 co-sponsors. It was introduced by Rep. Brian Higgins in the House, where it has nine co-sponsors.", "Another bill, Choose Medicare Act, would offer Medicare as an option in the ACA marketplace. Introduced by Sen. Jeff Merkley, it has 14 co-sponsors in the Senate. A companion bill was introduced by Rep. Cedric Richmond in the House, where it has nine co-sponsors.", "And the State Public Option Act proposed by Sen. Brian Schatz and U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, which would create a Medicaid buy-in option that states could offer through the ACA marketplace, has 20 co-sponsors in the Senate, including Sanders. It has 26 co-sponsors in the House.", "And those are just some of the ideas being kicked around in Congress. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a list of the various bills proposed by Democrats in this Congress that would expand the role of public programs in health care.", "Trump \u201cpicks the Sanders Medicare for All plan as if that\u2019s the only one Democrats are considering, and that\u2019s not true,\u201d said Holahan of the Urban Institute. \u201cIt really overstates the case. He picks the most extreme example of what Democrats are talking about.\u201d", "Trump says there are \u201cmany Democratic congressional candidates\u201d who support the Medicare for All plan, and that may be. But our fact-checking colleagues at the Washington Post Fact Checker noted 15 Democrats were targeted in attack ads for supporting Medicare for All who do not, in fact, support the plan.", "In his editorial, Trump also claimed:\u00a0\u201cAs a candidate, I promised that we would protect coverage for patients with\u00a0pre-existing conditions\u00a0and create\u00a0new health care insurance options\u00a0that would lower premiums.\u00a0I have kept that promise, and we are now seeing\u00a0health insurance premiums coming down.\u201d", "But the administration supports a lawsuit that it says would lead to the elimination of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s preexisting condition protections. And not all premiums are \u201ccoming down.\u201d", "In the op-ed, there\u2019s a link on \u201cpre-existing conditions\u201d to a Washington Post Fact Checker story that actually says Trump flip-flopped on his \u201cpromise.\u201d Indeed, we also found that the president has misleadingly claimed in recent weeks that\u00a0\u201cpreexisting conditions are safe\u201d with him as president and that he \u201cwill always fight for \u2026 patients with preexisting conditions.\u201d", "The fact is, the Department of Justice, \u201c[a]fter careful consideration, and with the approval of the President of the United States\u201d decided not to defend the U.S. government in a lawsuit seeking to overturn the Affordable Care Act, as a June 7 letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions explains.", "Sessions said that the administration sided with the plaintiffs, but didn\u2019t agree that the entire ACA would have to be eliminated, as the suit argues. The administration said two ACA provisions would need to be eliminated: those guaranteeing that people can\u2019t be denied coverage by insurers or charged more based on certain factors.", "Those provisions protect those on the individual market with preexisting conditions from being denied a policy or charged higher premiums.", "As we said when we addressed this claim last week, it\u2019s disingenuous for the president to claim he kept a promise to \u201cprotect coverage for patients with\u00a0pre-existing conditions,\u201d given the administration\u2019s stance in the lawsuit.", "Also, the president says he promised to \u201ccreate\u00a0new health care insurance options\u00a0that would lower premiums.\u201d He has kept that promise. But one of the new options wouldn\u2019t have to meet ACA\u00a0prohibitions against denying or pricing coverage based on health status \u2014 in other words, it wouldn\u2019t protect those with preexisting conditions.", "The administration issued a final rule, which took effect Oct. 2, to expand short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans. An Obama-era rule had limited such plans to less than three months in duration; the Trump administration rule said the plans could be up to 12 months in duration and insurers could renew such policies for up to 36 months.", "Short-term plans don\u2019t have to meet ACA requirements. As the journal Health Affairs explains, \u201cShort-term insurers can charge higher premiums based on health status, exclude coverage for preexisting conditions, impose annual or lifetime limits, opt not to cover entire categories of benefits (such as substance use disorder treatment or prescription drugs), rescind coverage, and require higher out-of-pocket cost-sharing than under the ACA.\u201d", "The administration\u2019s rule acknowledges that the plans could cause \u201creduced access to some services and providers for some consumers who switch from available individual market plans\u201d and a \u201cpotential increase in out-of-pocket costs for some consumers, possibly leading to financial hardship.\u201d But less expensive, less comprehensive coverage would be welcomed by others, it said. \u201cThis rule empowers consumers to purchase the benefits they want and reduce overinsurance.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s administration also expanded association health plans, through a rule that took effect in August, allowing\u00a0associations to form to offer insurance for those in the same trade or industry, or for businesses in the same state or metropolitan area. These plans\u00a0couldn\u2019t deny coverage or charge more based on health status, but they wouldn\u2019t have to\u00a0cover the\u00a010 essential health benefits\u00a0the Affordable Care Act requires of plans on the small-group market or individual market. They also could price plans based on age, gender or occupation.", "So, those plans, too, would likely be less expensive than other options available on the individual market, but that could be because they offer more limited benefits.", "The president claimed that he \u201ckept that promise\u201d on new health insurance options and preexisting condition protections \u2014 even though he hasn\u2019t on the latter point \u2014 \u201cand we are now seeing\u00a0health insurance premiums coming down.\u201d The op-ed links to a news article on Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announcing that average premiums for benchmark plans in the states using HealthCare.gov are expected to decrease by 2 percent for the 2019 plans. But experts told us most administration actions\u00a0in the past two years have driven premiums up.", "The actions the administration has taken \u2014 such as a repeal-and-replace effort and the elimination of cost-sharing subsidies on the ACA exchanges \u2014 \u201cby and large have destabilized the market,\u201d said\u00a0Cynthia Cox, the director of\u00a0the program for the study of health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "And while the new insurance options Trump cites would likely have lower price tags themselves, they would actually drive up premiums on HealthCare.gov.\u00a0The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a May report that it expects healthier individuals to join association and short-term plans, which would then increase premiums for those remaining in the individual and small-group markets by an estimated 2 percent to 3 percent \u201cin most years.\u201d", "When we looked at premiums for the individual market recently, health care experts told us lower growth was expected for 2019 for several reasons: less political uncertainty this year compared with 2017, slower growth in medical expenses, an overpricing of plans last year, and insurers\u2019 growing familiarity with the market.", "Kelley Turek, the executive director of employer and commercial policy at the insurer trade group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, told us that after several years under the ACA,\u00a0\u201cwe are getting to a point where issuers are getting a better sense of this market,\u201d she said, such as the population, their health costs and how to price plans.", "Premiums for employer-sponsored plans, where nearly half of Americans get their coverage, have continued to grow, meanwhile. Family premiums went up by 5 percent from 2017 to 2018, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s annual employer health benefits survey.", "The president also repeated some claims on border enforcement, the Affordable Care Act and Medicare\u2019s finances.", "Trump: Indeed, the Democrats\u2019 commitment to government-run health care is all the more menacing to our seniors and our economy when paired with some\u00a0Democrats\u2019 absolute commitment to end\u00a0enforcement of our immigration laws by abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That means millions more would cross our borders illegally and take advantage of health care paid for by American taxpayers.", "Today\u2019s Democratic Party is for open-borders socialism.", "As we\u2019ve written before, Democrats are not advocating open borders. Some rank-and-file Democrats in Congress have called for ending Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but they have also said many of ICE\u2019s functions should be redistributed to other government agencies.\u00a0Only one member of the\u00a0Senate\u00a0or\u00a0House\u00a0Democratic leadership \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 is among those calling for ICE to be abolished.", "No Democrat has called for abandoning border enforcement, as Trump suggests.", "Trump: Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicare by more than $800 billion\u00a0over 10 years to pay for Obamacare.", "Republicans have been using a version of this misleading attack for years. The fact is, there were no cuts to Medicare benefits under the Affordable Care Act. Instead, the health care law reduces the future growth of spending over a decade, primarily by slowing the growth of payments to hospitals. One benefit of the law was the closing of the so-called \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d in Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage for seniors.", "Even though he claims these Medicare changes in the ACA \u201chave already harmed seniors,\u201d Trump supported legislation that would have kept them in place. The GOP repeal bills in 2017 \u2014 including the House-passed American Health Care Act and the Senate\u2019s Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill\u00a0\u2014 would have retained the ACA\u2019s reductions to Medicare Advantage and provider payment growth, according to analyses by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.", "The president also repeated some spin about his \u201cpromise\u201d to \u201cprotect Medicare.\u201d", "Trump:\u00a0I also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare. That is why I am fighting so hard against the Democrats\u2019 plan that would eviscerate Medicare.", "As we\u00a0wrote before, Medicare\u2019s finances have actually gotten worse since Trump took office. The Medicare Part A trust fund, which covers payments to hospitals, will run out of money by 2026, three years earlier than the Medicare trustees projected just last year, according to\u00a0the latest trustees report. The tax cut law Trump signed in 2017 is partly to blame, for reducing Medicare revenues and increasing expenses.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
