["AAP councillor Mohammed Tahir Hussain, accused of facilitating mobs on his four-storey residence which was allegedly used to hurl petrol bombs during Delhi riots, was booked by the police for the murder of intelligence bureau staffer Ankit Sharma in the ongoing violence. Hussain, who has denied all allegations, was suspended from AAP. However, in his defence, AAP spokesperson Prince Soni tweeted a video on February 27 claiming it was recorded by Hussain during the riots. In the nearly one-minute clip, Hussain is seen appealing to the police to control the situation in northeast Delhi. He also claimed that goons forcibly entered his house.", "\u0926\u0902\u0917\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u092f AAP \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0926 #\u0924\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0930_\u0939\u0941\u0938\u0948\u0928 \u0915\u093e \u092f\u0939 \u0935\u093f\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0926\u0947\u0916\u093f\u090f\u0964 \u0926\u0902\u0917\u094b \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u0940\u0921\u093c\u093f\u0924 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092c\u093e\u0930-\u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092b\u093c\u094b\u0928 \u0915\u0930 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u092f\u0902 \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938 \u092c\u0941\u0932\u093e \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0925\u093e, \u0909\u0938\u092a\u0930 \u0906\u0930\u094b\u092a \u0932\u0917\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0947? pic.twitter.com/ILBQzGUWyh", "\u2014 Prince Soni (@PrinceAAP) February 27, 2020", "Soon after, several social media users claimed that the video was not shot during the riots but on the day it was made public on social media, i.e., February 27.
