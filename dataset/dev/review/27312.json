["About this rating", "Back in 2014, the decidedly pro-conspiracy website Natural News, whose founder Mike Adams sometimes serves as a guest host for Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars, gleefully exclaimed that science had proved conspiracy theorists are generally \u201cmore sane\u201d than people who hold more \u201cconformist\u201d views -- as evidenced by their publication of an article headlined \u201cScientific Study Reveals Conspiracy Theorists the Most Sane of All.\u201d", "In point of fact, the study referenced in that article, whose sole dataset comprised comments left by readers of news articles that included the term \u201c9/11\u201d and similar keywords, did not make such a claim. That paper, titled \u201c\u2018What About Building 7?\u2019 A Social Psychological Study of Online Discussion of 9/11 Conspiracy Theories\u201d made a series of qualitative observations based on 2,174 collected comments, as follows:", "We found that conspiracist commenters were more likely to argue against the opposing interpretation and less likely to argue in favor of their own interpretation, while the opposite was true of conventionalist commenters.", "Conspiracist comments were more likely to explicitly put forward an account than conventionalist comments were.", "Conspiracists were more likely to express mistrust and made more positive and fewer negative references to other conspiracy theories.", "Conspiracists were largely unwilling to apply the \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d label to their own beliefs and objected when others did so, lending support to the long-held suggestion that conspiracy belief carries a social stigma.", "Conventionalist arguments tended to have a more hostile tone.", "Natural News derived their assertion that \u201cconspiracists\u201d are \u201cmore sane\u201d from combining the latter observation about tone with their own severely flawed understanding of sampling biases:", "The researchers noted that they were surprised to find that it is now more conventional to leave so-called conspiracist comments than conventional ones. \"Of the 2174 comments collected, 1459 were coded as conspiracist and 715 as conventionalist,\" the researchers wrote ...", "That means the pro-conspiracy commenters are those who are now expressing what is considered conventional wisdom, while the anti-conspiracy commenters represent a small, beleaguered minority that is often scoffed at and shunned.", "That inherently flawed interpretation relied on the somewhat terrifying assumption that the views expressed in the comments section of news articles about the September 11th terrorist attacks were a representative cross-section of the population as a whole, a rather harrowing notion. In fact, it should be unsurprising that the majority of the comments collected by the researchers were pro-conspiracy theory, as that is explicitly the kind of comment the researchers searched for:", "For each article that resulted from these searches [of keywords such as \"9/11\"], the public comment sections were read, and from these, we extracted verbatim all relevant comments regarding the 9/11 conspiracy theories.", "The study did not even capture a representative sample of the comments left on news stories about 9/11, much less the views of the broader population about 9/11. Therefore, the study cannot be used to make the claim that \u201cpro-conspiracy commenters are those who are now expressing what is considered conventional wisdom.\u201d", "With regard to the tone of comments, it is unclear where Natural News got the idea that the hostile tone of a comment responding to a 9/11 conspiracy indicates a lack of sanity, but the study at no point makes any claim about comparative sanity levels.", "The study did conclude, however, that \u201cconspiracism is rooted in several higher-order beliefs such as an abiding mistrust of authority, the conviction that nothing is quite as it seems, and the belief that most of what we are told is a lie.\u201d The study also noted that their results aligned with previous observations \u201cthat conspiracy theories rely heavily on \u2018errant data\u2019 rather than on crafting coherent alternative explanations.\u201d", "If a hostile tone betrays a lack of sanity, then Natural News \u2014 an outlet whose operator created an entire website named \u201cHoggwatch\u201d dedicated to harassing Parkland school shooting survivor and gun control activist David Hogg \u2014 must be in desperate need of some rationality.", "Heyes, J.D. \u00a0 \"Scientific Study Reveals Conspiracy Theorists the Most Sane of All.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Natural News. \u00a0 8 October 2014.", "Wood, Michael J. and Karen M Douglas. \u00a0 \"\u2019What About Building 7?\u2019 A Social Psychological Study of Online Discussion of 9/11 Conspiracy Theories.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Frontiers in Psychology. \u00a0 8 July 2013.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
