In 2010, EIA data show, 726 million barrels of oil came from federal lands, including offshore wells. In 2011, it was 626. That\u2019s a drop of 13.77 percent, which can be rounded to 14 percent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis data, as well as a more complex measure (it involves royalties and British thermal units of energy, but we\u2019ll spare you), would appear to render the statement accurate.\n\nHow reliable is it?\n\nBut is the 14 percent figure cherry picked?\n\nYes, says Jay Hakes, who directed the independent U.S. Energy Information Administration for seven years during the Clinton administration. \"From a statistical standpoint, to take one year out of three \u2014 one year is not indicative of a trend,\" he said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo we pulled the numbers from when George W. Bush was in office -- January 2001 to January 2009 -- as well as from when Obama was in office. In our chart, we\u2019ve italicized the years he was in office and put in bold the years Obama led.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe note that:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022 From 2004-08, well into Bush\u2019s tenure, oil production on federal lands and waters fell in four of five years, for a net decrease of 16.8 percent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022 From 2009-11, the Obama years, oil production rose two of three years, for a net increase of 10.6 percent.", "It\u2019s also worth taking a closer look at what went into the overall number.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2010, oil production from offshore sources rose by 14.9 percent. Prior to that, before Obama\u2019s presidency, the offshore volume fell for several years, and it was erratic even during a phase in which it rose, EIA figures show.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nYet onshore oil production generally rose on federally owned land -- and did again in 2011, by 3.7 percent. Offshore production that took the hit, falling 16.8 percent.\n\nSo the big story of the one-year dropoff in public production is the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. A six-month moratorium on exploratory drilling followed \u2014 though it by no means stopped gulf oil production\u2014 along with changes in regulation that forced the industry to adjust.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile the moratorium could have been more targeted, it wasn\u2019t a policy choice unique to Obama, said Hakes, the former EIA director who also directed policy and research for the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. Bush had his own disasters to contend with: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 also drove a decline the next year, said Shirley Neff, a senior adviser at EIA. And President Richard Nixon ordered a moratorium in the wake of a 1969 well blowout off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif.\n\n\"Every president, if you have a blowout like that \u2026 is going to get a moratorium,\" Hakes said.\n\nWho gets the credit or blame?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s important to note that most big boosts in production, according to experts, follow years of earlier exploration and drilling -- efforts begun under the policies of prior administrations. By the same token, Obama\u2019s actions in office should have an impact in the years to come.\n\n\"I don't think Obama can claim a lot of credit for production levels now, and I'm not even sure that Bush can,\" said Hakes, the author of A Declaration of Energy Independence, which looks at energy policy from President Harry S. Truman to President George W. Bush. \"If you're going to go back \u2014 who should get the credit \u2014 I might be able to find something that Nixon did.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe recent expansion of hydrofracking \u2014 using pressurized fluid to get gas or oil out of rock formations \u2014 came about over decades.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"That's why attaching production things to any particular administration is a very, very tricky business, and probably best handled in books rather than in articles,\" Hakes said. \"There are just too many factors.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo, Obama certainly shouldn\u2019t be claiming full credit for increases in oil production on private land \u2014 but neither should supporters of Bush.\n\nOur ruling\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo: Did the United States produce 14 percent less oil on its public lands last year? Yes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut there\u2019s nuance in the number. Production under Obama was hobbled due to the Deepwater Horizon disaster, making a one-year figure subject to cherry-picking. And it\u2019s not at all clear that the president in charge when the oil is taken out of the ground deserves full credit or blame; years of prior policies on exploration and drilling had an impact.\n\nOn balance, we rate the claim Half True.", "Mitt Romney, transcript of second presidential debate, Oct. 16, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, \"Crossroads GPS ad says oil production on federal lands dropped under President Barack Obama,\" April 13, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, \"Rob Portman says oil production on public lands was down 14 percent in 2011,\" April 2, 2012\n\nRob Portman, radio interview with Fox News, March 26, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nGreenwire, \"Drilling leaves federal lands because state, private acres are cheaper, says BLM chief,\" by Phil Taylor, March 14, 2012\n\nGreenwire, \"OIL AND GAS: Production on federal tracts fell in 2011,\" Feb. 27, 2012\n\nCrossroads GPS, \"Too Much,\" uploaded April 10, 2012 via YouTube\n\nU.S. Department of Interior,Office of Natural Resources Revenue, \u00a0statistics database, accessed March 27, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhite House blog, \"American Energy: The Facts,\" March 15, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nU.S. Energy Information Administration, \"Sales of Fossil Fuels Produced from Federal and Indian Lands, FY 2003 through FY 2011,\" March 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nU.S. Energy Information Administration, \"Short-Term Energy and Summer Fuels Outlook,\" April 10, 2012\n\nTranscript, Bob Abbey testimony before Senate Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies, March 14, 2012\n\nNational Journal,\"Obama\u2019s Fuzzy Oil Production Math,\" March 17, 2011\n\nAmerican Petroleum Institute, \"Administration Oil Strategy Contributes to Price Increases,\" accessed April 12, 2012\n\nWashington Post, \"Petroleum institute\u2019s numbers on oil policy a matter of dispute,\" April 6, 2012\n\nPolitiFact Virginia, \"Barack Obama ad says U.S. oil production is at eight-year high,\" April 9, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPolitiFact, \"Barack Obama says U.S. oil production last year was highest since 2003,\" March 15, 2011\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPolitiFact,\"Barack Obama says U.S. oil production is at eight-year high,\"Jan. 24, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPolitiFact, \"Rick Santorum says Barack Obama has raised a 'stop sign' on oil exploration,\" June 6, 2011\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPolitiFact Rhode Island, \"Mike Huckabee says President Obama's refusal to issue offshore drilling permits is one reason gasoline prices are soaring,\" April 12, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPolitiFact, \"Obama says he issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater oil drilling,\" June 16, 2010\n\nEmail interview with Christine Mangi, spokeswoman for Rob Portman, March 27, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nInterview with Patrick Etchart, office of public affairs, U.S. Department of Interior, Office of Natural Resources Revenue, March 27, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Reid Porter, media relations representative, American Petroleum Institute, April 12, 2012\n\nInterview withJay Hakes, former director of the Energy Information Administration, April 12, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEmail interview with Jonathan Cogan, media contact for the U.S. Energy Information Administration, April 12, 2012\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEmail interview with Shirley Neff, senior adviser, U.S. Energy Information Administration, April 12, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
