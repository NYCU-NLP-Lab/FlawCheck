["U.S. Senate candidate Rush Holt set off a political firestorm last week with these three words tucked into a campaign ad about the dangers of climate change:", "\"Millions will die.\"", "Holt, a Democratic congressman, defended that claim in the face of criticism from Republican U.S. Senate candidate Steve Lonegan, who dismissed Holt\u2019s climate change assertions as \"silly hysteria.\"", "In the Aug. 13 Democratic primary, Holt is running against Newark Mayor Cory Booker, U.S. Rep.

Since February 1985, the global temperature for every month has been above its 20th Century average, she said.", "For instance, the NOAA found that the global temperature in June was 1.15 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average of all the months of June between 1901 and 2000.", "That measurement marked \"the 37th consecutive June and 340th consecutive month\u2014that\u2019s a total of more than 28 years\u2014with a global temperature above the 20th-century average,\" according to a summary of the NOAA\u2019s latest climate report.", "On the second point, it turns out that Holt's figure of the 12 warmest years on record occurring in the last 15 years was actually a conservative estimate.", "Based on NOAA data, the last 15 years -- from 1998 to 2012 -- have included the 14 hottest years on record since 1880 for global temperatures. The NOAA estimates that the hottest year was 2010.", "Using a different methodology, NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies estimates that the last 15 years have included the 13 hottest years since 1880 for global temperatures.", "In a statistical tie, either 2010 or 2005 may be considered the warmest year on record, according to Reto Ruedy, a climate scientist with the institute.", "The institute has said 2012 was the ninth warmest year on record, while the NOAA estimates that 2012 was the tenth hottest year.", "\"The record dates back to 1880 because that is when there were enough meteorological stations around the world to provide global temperature data,\" according to a news release on the institute\u2019s website.", "Our ruling", "In a campaign ad where he claimed \"millions will die\" from climate change, Holt cited two statistics about monthly and annual global temperatures.", "\"Every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average,\" Holt said. \"All 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years.\"", "Both of those statistics are backed up by data released by scientists at the NOAA and NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies.", "The global temperature in every month since February 1985 has been above the 20th Century average for its respective month, according to the NOAA.", "As for the warmest years on record, NOAA scientists estimate that the last 15 years have included the 14 hottest years and NASA scientists have said that same time period included the 13 hottest years.", "We rate the statement True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "You Tube, Rush Holt - Climate Change, July 22, 2013", "Star-Ledger, U.S. Senate candidate Rush Holt defends claim that 'millions will die' due to climate change, July 25, 2013", "Steve Lonegan campaign website, Lonegan: Holt Climate Change Video \"Silly Hysteria,\" July 22, 2013", "E-mail interview with Thomas Seay, spokesman for Congressman Rush Holt, July 24-25, 2013", "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Global Analysis: June 2013, accessed July 25, 2013", "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, June 2013 Global Climate Update, July 18, 2013", "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Global Analysis -- Annual 2012, accessed July 26, 2013", "PolitiFact, Barack Obama says the 12 hottest years on record have come in the last 15 years, Feb. 15, 2013", "National Aeronautics and Space Administration: Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA Finds 2012 Sustained Long-Term Climate Warming Trend, Jan. 15, 2013", "National Aeronautics and Space Administration: Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Global Temperature Update Through 2012, Jan. 15, 2013", "E-mail interview with Jessica Blunden, climate scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, July 25-26, 2013", "E-mail interview with Reto Ruedy, cliimate scientist with the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, July 25-26, 2013", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
