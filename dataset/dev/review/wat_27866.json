["About this rating", "The occurrence of a rare form of night cloud is increasing in parts of the world, and may serve as an indication that the presence of human-caused greenhouse gases responsible for climate change is also on the rise in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.", "Noctilucent (Latin for \u201cnight-shining\u201d) clouds are typically rare, and are located at a height of around 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth in a layer of atmosphere known as the Mesosphere. These wispy clouds are only visible on clear, summer nights at mid-to high latitudes, and only form under specific conditions, according to the United Kingdom Metrological Office. As water vapor freezes around specks of dust at low mesospheric temperatures, newly formed ice crystals are illuminated from the low-angled sun during dusk and dawn.", "But increasing human-caused pollutants \u2014 like methane and particulate matter \u2014 means that both the amount of water vapor and levels of dust in the atmosphere are also on the rise, spurring an increase in the occurrence of noctilucent clouds.", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=_-d6UJl83rU&feature=emb_logo", "Dust can come from man-made pollutants, as well as natural processes such as dust left behind from passing meteors or matter projected into the atmosphere from volcanoes. On the other hand, water vapor can come both from the Earth\u2019s surface through natural mechanisms or via methane, which produces water vapor through chemical reactions that occur in the atmosphere. As such, a 2018 study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters found that noctilucent clouds may serve as an indicator of human-caused climate change.", "To come to their conclusions, researchers with the American Geophysical Union ran computer models and satellite observations to simulate how greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels have contributed to an increased occurrence of noctilucent clouds over the last 150 years. Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, it appears that methane emissions have increased water vapor concentration by about 40 percent, contributing to more than double the amount of mesospheric ice.", "\u201cWe speculate that the clouds have always been there, but the chance to see one was very, very poor, in historical times,\u201d said Franz-Josef L\u00fcbken, an atmospheric scientist at the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics in K\u00fchlungsborn, Germany, in a statement.", "Though the presence of noctilucent clouds fluctuates every year, they were shown to become more frequent over the course of the study period, confirming similar findings published in a 1989 edition of Nature. Together, the studies provide a sign that the burning of fossil fuels appears to be affecting natural processes reaching high into Earth\u2019s atmosphere.", "The authors caution that observing interactions in the mesosphere is rather challenging.\u201d Little is known about trends over long periods of time and databases documenting long-term trends is \u201cstill rather poor.\u201d That being said, the researchers argue that modern technologies and increasing observational data in recent decades provide further evidence that human-caused greenhouse gases may increase the likelihood of noctilucent cloud formation.", "In 2020, the start of the Arctic noctilucent cloud season began on May 17, which NASA reports is the second-earliest start of the northern season that researchers have observed. Polar mesospheric clouds typically stay close to the Earth\u2019s poles, but were seen as far south as California and Oklahoma in 2019, The Washington Post reported at the time, and appear to be \u201cforming earlier and spreading farther each year.\u201d", "L\u00fcbken, Franz-Josef, Berger, Uew, Baumgarten, Gerd. \u00a0 \" On the Anthropogenic Impact on Long\u2010Term Evolution of Noctilucent Clouds.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Geophysical Research Letters. \u00a0 2 July 2018.", "Tran, Lina. \u00a0 \"NASA\u2019s AIM Spots First Arctic Noctilucent Clouds of the Season.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NASA. \u00a0 28 May 2020.", "Donegan, Brian. \u00a0 \"Rare Noctilucent Clouds, Earth\u2019s Highest Clouds, Spotted in the Northern U.S. Over the Weekend.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Weather Channel. \u00a0 10 June 2019.", "\"Early State for Noctilucent Clouds.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NASA Visible Earth. \u00a0 25 June 2013.", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
