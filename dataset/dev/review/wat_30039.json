Other examples of its work included articles claiming President Obama had granted himself a $100,000 pay raise and an Oklahoma teacher had been fired for praying when a tornado hit her school.", "If nothing else, the name of the \"reporter\" bylined on the story should have given away its japing nature: \"Jimmy Olsentwins\" is a conflation of the name of the cub reporter who works at the fictional Daily Planet newspaper in Superman comics and the surname of actresses Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Fuller Olsen, collectively known as the Olsen Twins.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
