Bob Hall from Edgewood expressed concern about the sustainability of the system based on changing demographics in the state.", "\"This world has changed significantly, but our overall retirement program hasn\u2019t changed much,\" he said, addressing the bill\u2019s author. \"If we were doing this today, we would probably take an entirely different approach.", "\"We\u2019re in a situation where we now have several hundred teachers that are over 100 years old and what I've read recently is that a baby born today, their age expectancy is 110, at least. Thanks to medical science.\"", "It\u2019s true that there are hundreds of retired teachers in Texas who are older than 100, but Hall\u2019s claim about life expectancy is off base.", "Hall\u2019s comment referred to retired teachers", "Kathi Seay, a policy adviser for Hall, said that his claim about teachers over 100 years old was about retired teachers who are members of the state\u2019s retirement system \u2014 not current teachers in the classroom.", "(A report from the Texas Education Agency says that the average age of Texas teachers during the 2016-17 school year was 31.2 and the oldest teacher that year was 75 years old.)", "Carolyn Perez, spokeswoman for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, said that as of February the system had 420,458 retired members.", "Of that group, 321 were over 100 years old.", "That number is consistent with the count from earlier years offered by Perez.

From there forward, the retirement age slowly increases. The retirement age for people born in 1960 or later is 67.", "During that time, the life expectancy increased.
