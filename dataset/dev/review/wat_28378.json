American Bridge also produced a video that makes an attack on Nicholson similar to the one in the Baldwin ad.", "According to the AP article, Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states as they moved to save money and shift production overseas.", "Examples included a company that bought Brillion Iron Works near Green Bay through a subsidiary in September 2016 and two weeks later announced it was shutting down the plant, resulting in a loss of 345 jobs.", "To be clear:", "The article said Nicholson did consulting for companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns.", "But it did not say that Nicholson provided any consulting on those decisions.", "The article also said Nicholson has reported being paid $362,417 in salary and $808,180 in fees (which is a total of more than $1.1 million) from 27 clients between January 2016 and November 2017.
