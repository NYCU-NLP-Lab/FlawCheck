["About this rating", "Back in January 2016, conservative web site Louder with Crowder dipped its toes into the world of fact-checking with an article (\"MYTH BUSTED: Actually, Yes, Hitler Was a Socialist Liberal\") that makes the claim that \"leftists\" have unfairly rewritten history to paint Hitler as right wing, based in part on the fact that the Nazi party had the word \"socialist\" in its name.", "Perhaps ironically, that article opens with a tidbit of literally rewritten history, misattributing a quote by Nazi party member Gregor Strasser to Adolf Hitler:", "We are Socialists, enemies, mortal enemies of the present capitalist economic system with its exploitation of the economically weak, with its injustice in wages, with its immoral evaluation of individuals according to wealth and money instead of responsibility and achievement, and we are determined under all circumstances to abolish this system!", "While Hitler may have co-opted elements of this language when it was politically expedient, they are not his words. Instead, these are the words of early Nazi party official Gregor Strasser, printed in a 1926 pamphlet titled Thoughts about the Tasks of the Future. That pamphlet, as we will discuss in detail below, attempted to appeal to ultranationalist movements on both the left and the right at a time when the Nazis were a fringe political party seeking to carve out as big a part of the German electorate as possible.", "Strasser's pamphlet went on to make these decidedly non-socialist sounding statements as well:", "The spirit of our National Socialist idea has to overpower the spirit of liberalism and false democracy if there is to be a third Reich at all!\u00a0 Deeply rooted in organic life, we have realized that the false belief in the equality of man is the deadly threat with which liberalism destroys people and nation, culture and morals. violating the deepest levels of our being!", "We have to reject with fanatical zeal the frequent lie that people are basically equal and equal in regard to their influence in the state and their share of power!\u00a0 People are unequal, they are unequal from birth, become more unequal in life and are therefore to be valued unequally in their positions in society and in the state!", "Gregor Strasser was a prominent Nazi propagandist in the formative days of the Nazi party. A World War I veteran active in post-war anti-Soviet paramilitary activities, he \u2014 along with Adolf Hitler \u2014 became one of the two most prominent voices for the party as it attempted to build a cohesive ideology and broad support across the various factions within a deeply divided Germany.", "As discussed in a biography of Strasser:", "Just as Hitler may be said to have pioneered and consolidated the party in southern Germany, so much the same was true of Strasser in the north. Strasser\u2019s success there clearly identified him as the man next in importance to Hitler [...]", "The confrontation was most crucial in this period of National Socialism, for it encompassed basic matters of ideological orientation, organisation, tactics, and possibly leadership. Strasser was the guiding spirit of the \u2018northern faction\u2019, and he even put his authority behind a draft \u2018socialist\u2019 programme of action as an alternative to the one endorsed by Hitler for the party in 1920 which was supposed to be immutable.", "As it happens, Hitler was not a fan of Strasser\u2019s ideas. While his efforts helped the Nazi\u2019s with early electoral victories in the elections of 1928, his views became dangerously discordant with Hitler\u2019s, and he was assassinated on Hitler\u2019s orders in 1934:", "By the early 1930s Strasser was head of the Nazi political organization and second only to Hitler in power and popularity. As leader of the party\u2019s left wing, however, he opposed Hitler\u2019s courting of big business as well as his anti-Semitism and instead favoured radical social reforms along socialist lines. He finally resigned his party offices in 1932. Hitler was able to avert large-scale losses in membership after Strasser\u2019s defection, and, after Hitler\u2019s accession to the chancellorship, Strasser lost almost all of his influence. He was murdered on Hitler\u2019s orders during the [Ernst] R\u00f6hm purge of 1934.", "The fact that Hitler disagreed with Strasser\u2019s view of \"National Socialism\" so much that he was killed in part for holding those views makes it all the more absurd to attribute this quote to Hitler, as Louder with Crowder has done.", "The political milieu of Germany in the 1920s was a hotbed of political unrest and paramilitary violence that cannot easily fit into simple \"left\" and \"right\" binaries. Hitler\u2019s use of \"socialism\" attempted to borrow the rhetorical devices of the left, but not the ideological ones, as discussed in The Coming of the Third Reich by Richard Evans:", "The \u2018National Socialists\u2019 wanted to unite the two political camps of left and right into which, they argued, the Jews had manipulated the German nation. The basis for this was to be the idea of race. This was light years removed from the class-based ideology of socialism. [...]", "By presenting itself as a \u2018movement\u2019, National Socialism, like the labour movement, advertised its opposition to conventional politics and its intention to subvert and ultimately overthrow the system within which it was initially forced to work.", "By replacing class with race, and the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the leader, Nazism reversed the usual terms of socialist ideology.", "The post suggests that \"this nifty thing called 'history' in combination with 'the internet'\" can \"bust this myth\" that Hitler was right wing. However, the web site takes a superficial view of German history based, in large part, on a comically misattributed quote. If anything, Louder with Crowder has made a strong argument for including some books along with that internet research.", "Kirchoff, Courtney. \u00a0 \"MYTH BUSTED: Actually, Yes, Hitler Was a Socialist Liberal.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Louder with Crowder. \u00a0 13 January 2016.", "Lane, Barbara M. \u00a0 Nazi Ideology Before 1933: A Documentation.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Manchester University Press, 1978. \u00a0 ISBN 0719007194.", "Stachura, Peter D. \u00a0 Gregor Strasser and the Rise of Nazism.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Routledge, 2014. \u00a0 ISBN 1317630726.", "Encyclopedia Britannica. \u00a0 \"Gregor Strasser.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 19 June 2017.", "Evans, Richard, J. \u00a0 The Coming of the Third Reich.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Penguin, 2005. \u00a0 ISBN 0143034693.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
