["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on June 22, 2018", "Q: Has Stormy Daniels announced she\u2019s running for president?", "A:\u00a0No. That false headline is based on a question she asked in jest.", "Adult film star Stormy Daniels continues to challenge President Donald Trump in public and in court over the legitimacy of an agreement that prohibits her from publicly discussing their alleged 2006 extramarital affair. Trump, who was married to now-first lady Melania Trump at the time, has denied the accusation.", "But the actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has not declared her intention to challenge Trump on the ballot.", "A false headline claiming as much \u2014 \u201cStormy Daniels Announces Plans To Run For President\u201d \u2014 appeared on several websites and circulated on Facebook this week, accruing thousands of comments and reactions. On pages such as the\u00a0 \u201cConservative Hub,\u201d commenters reacted to the supposed announcement with humor, disbelief and, in some cases, outrage.", "But the stories, such as the one on\u00a0conservative101.com, don\u2019t support the headline\u2019s claim.", "\u201cPorn star Stormy Daniels is considering running for President in 2020.

And then: \u2018The terrifying thing is I might win.'\u201d", "Apart from those comments, we could find no record of Daniels making any announcement about seeking any office.", "It\u2019s worth noting that Daniels actually did entertain the idea of entering politics once before. She\u00a0publicly\u00a0considered running against then-Sen. David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, in the 2010 midterm election, and notably declared she was switching\u00a0her party affiliation, from Democrat to Republican.", "Daniels said in an MSNBC interview at the time that she was prompted to weigh the run after fans drafted her in hopes that she could unseat Vitter.

Daniels\u00a0decided not to run and Vitter won reelection.", "The saga over Daniels\u2019 nondisclosure agreement spilled into public view in January, when the Wall Street Journal reported that, weeks before the 2016 election, Trump\u2019s longtime attorney, Michael Cohen, arranged to pay Daniels $130,000 to sign the agreement. Trump, who had initially\u00a0denied knowing about the payment or where Cohen got the money for it, later admitted that he had reimbursed Cohen.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.", "Greene, Morgan. \u201cIn Chicago, Stormy Daniels muses: \u2018Should I run for president?\u2019\u201d The Chicago Tribune. 16 June 2018.", "Magloff, Spencer. \u201cStormy Daniels Calls Off Senate Bid.\u201d CBS News. 15 Apr 2010.", "\u201cPress Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.\u201d Press release, White House. 7 Mar 2018.", "Rothfeld, Michael and Joe Palazzolo. \u201cTrump Lawyer Arranged $130,000 Payment for Adult-Film Star\u2019s Silence.\u201d The Wall Street Journal. 12 Jan 2018.", "Farley, Robert and Eugene Kiely. \u201cQ&A on Stormy Daniels\u2019 Payment.\u201d FactCheck.org. 3 May 2018.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
