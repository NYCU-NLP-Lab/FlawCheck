["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, under pressure to release his tax records,\u00a0now says he'll do it\u00a0in April 2012 \u2014 when taxes are due.\n\nWhy wait?\n\nThat's tradition, he argued at the Republican presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Jan. 16.\n\n\"You know, I looked at what has been done in campaigns in the past with Sen. McCain and President George W. Bush and others. They have tended to release tax records in April or tax season,\" he said.\n\nLater, he added, \"And if I become our nominee, and what's happened in history is people have released them in about April of the coming year, and that's probably what I would do.\"\n\nPolitiFact has already checked whether presidential candidates usually release their tax returns, a claim we found\u00a0Mostly True. (There are several notable exceptions, such as publisher Steve Forbes in 1996.)\n\nBut the question of timing intrigued us: Is April truly the month of choice?", "McCain, Bush and others", "We reviewed news accounts going back six presidential elections for clues.\u00a0\n\nWe've got to mention that there's nothing new about the battle for tax records. Candidates aren't required to disclose them and sometimes don't. Competitors and the press browbeat\u00a0Jesse Jackson\u00a0for weeks before he released returns in 1988. Forbes' refusal to release tax records became a hot campaign issue in 1996, since he focused on a proposal for a flat tax. And no sooner had John Kerry released his own tax records in 2004 than the drumbeat began for his wife's financial history.\n\nBut back to Romney's appeal to an April tradition.\n\nHere's what we found:\u00a0\n\n\u2022 April is a typical month to release tax records for the most recent year. It only makes sense \u2014 a candidate would file his or her tax return, then release it to the public. There were exceptions, of course, with candidates dragging their feet for weeks or\u00a0refusing to release records\u00a0at all.\n\n\u2022 Romney focused on two candidates who released tax records after they had wrapped up the GOP nomination, but plenty of primary contenders joined the disclosure-fest earlier in the process. (In 2008, several Republicans declined, but in 2004, all the major Democratic contenders released at least a year's returns, according to\u00a0Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.)", "\u2022 On Bush and McCain, Romney was generally right. In 2000,\u00a0Bush\u00a0released estimates of his earnings and taxes in April but got a six-month extension to release the actual forms in October. In 2004, as president,\u00a0Bush\u00a0released records in April. In 2008, Republican nominee\u00a0McCain\u00a0released tax records in April. (Democratic primary candidate\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0also released her tax return in April; Obama released a batch\u00a0in March, then his most recent return in\u00a0April.)\n\n\u2022 But the April trend was less clear when it came to previous years' tax records. In 1996, Republican candidate Bob Dole released 30 years of tax returns in January, weeks before he became the presumptive nominee. In 1987, Democrat\u00a0Michael Dukakis\u00a0released five years of federal tax returns in November \u2014 in advance of the election year and well before the primaries. Dole one-upped him in January 1988 with 21 years of tax returns.\n\nWho kicked off all this voluntary transparency? Romney's father, George, who as a presidential candidate in 1967\u00a0released 12 years of income tax returns \u2014 in November before election year.", "For a quick glimpse at when candidates released returns for the last six presidential races, here's a nonexhaustive list. (It doesn't include every primary candidate, such as the batch of Democrats in 2004 \u2014 many of whom were already in the habit of annually releasing returns \u2014 nor all sitting presidents, who\u00a0typically release returns\u00a0when they file. Both of those categories, because they mostly reflect current returns released around the same time they are filed, would further bulk up the April list.)\n\nMonths for tax return releases\n\nNovember before election year:\nBill Bradley, 1999\nMichael Dukakis, 1987 (5 years' worth)\n\nJanuary:\nBob Dole, 1996 (30 years' worth)\nPhil Gramm, 1996\nBob Dole, 1988 (21 years' worth)\n\nMarch:\nBarack Obama, 2008 (6 years' worth)\n\nApril:\nBarack Obama, 2008 (his just filed return)\nHillary Clinton, 2008\nJohn McCain, 2008\nJohn Kerry, 2004\nGeorge W. Bush, 2000\nAl Gore, 2000\nBob Dole, 1996\nBill Clinton, 1992 (12 years' worth)\n\nMay:\nMichael Dukakis, 1988\nJesse Jackson, 1988", "Our ruling\n\nRomney's right that there's a strong April trend for releasing tax records, especially among politicians who practice annual disclosure. But that's not Romney's history \u2014 he's steadfastly refused to open his personal tax records for public consumption. That weakens his appeal to tradition. He could just as easily follow in the footsteps of Obama, Bill Clinton, Dukakis, Dole and his own father and release a batch of earlier federal tax returns now. Meanwhile, he implies that only party nominees release their tax records \u2014 when recent history shows primary candidates opening their files to inspection. His statement that candidates \"have tended to release tax records in April\" is partially accurate, but\u00a0leaves out important details.
