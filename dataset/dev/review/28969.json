A nondenominational Protestant, Obama has worshipped at various churches in the Washington area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He has also attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat.", "We should also note that segments of the public have long told pollsters that they think Obama is a Muslim.
