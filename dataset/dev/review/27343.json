["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on September 14, 2012", "President Barack Obama has been claiming that the United States has \u201cdoubled our use of renewable energy.\u201d Not true. Wind and solar have doubled, but total renewable energy consumption is up by about one quarter from 2008 to 2011. Plus, since wind and solar started at such a low level, a doubling may not be as impressive to voters as it sounds.", "The largest category of renewable energy is biomass, such as ethanol that is blended in gasoline. And the second-biggest category is hydropower \u2014 electricity generated from dams. Hydro was 35 percent of all renewable energy in 2008 and 2011, and biomass dipped a bit to 49 percent for last year.", "Obama has made the claim in his speech at the Democratic National Convention and at several recent campaign stops.", "But it\u2019s simply not the case. All renewable energy accounted for 9 percent of the nation\u2019s energy consumption in 2011, up from 7 percent in 2008. Measured in units of energy, BTUs, the consumption went up by about 26 percent and production went up by about 27 percent (see Table 1.1).", "Even if we discount hydro, which isn\u2019t popular with clean-energy proponents, other renewable generation went up by 55 percent, still well short of a doubling.", "If the president had stuck to talking about wind and solar, he would have been correct. And he has come close at some campaign stops, such as one in Golden, Colo. \u2014 where he said on Sept. 13, \u201cWe\u2019ve doubled the amount of renewable energy that we generate from sources like wind and solar power.\u201d And he made the \u201cwind and solar\u201d stipulation in West Palm Beach on Sept. 9.", "Wind and solar energy generation has indeed doubled. Wind went from 55.4 million megawatt-hours in 2008 to 119.7 million megawatt-hours in 2011. And solar climbed from 864,000 megawatt-hours in 2008 to 1.8 million megawatt-hours in 2011. And the consumption numbers also show a doubling for wind and a near doubling for solar (see Table 1.3).", "But in the grand scheme of energy production and use, those million megawatt numbers are actually small. Wind still only accounted for 13 percent of all renewable energy generated in 2011 (up from 7.6 percent in 2008), and solar was at 1.3 percent of all renewables generated in 2011, up from 1.2 percent three years earlier.", "\u201cMaking large increases in wind power or solar power is not as big a challenge, let\u2019s say, as making a 50 percent increase in natural gas,\u201d says Frank V. Maisano, an energy expert at the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani. \u201cYou have to put it into context.\u201d Since wind and solar are coming from a small starting point, an increase percentage-wise sounds large, he says. But it doesn\u2019t sound as big when looking at the total megawatt-hours.", "\u2014 Lori Robertson", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/23bfd69a-becd-4baf-bafc-d69aa3d707d8", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
