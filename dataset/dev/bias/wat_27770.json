{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the severity of the assault on the traffic cops by stating that one person broke open a policeman's skull. The video clip shows the man hitting one of the policemen on the head with what appears to be a clay utensil, but it does not show the extent of the injury or if the skull was actually broken.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to verify the details of the incident. It only provides a video clip and a translated message without any further evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is related to the recently amended traffic regulations, which stipulate steep penalties for traffic violations. However, it is later mentioned that the incident in the video is an old video from Karnataka dating back to October 2018 and is not related to the recently amended traffic regulations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, which is that the man in the video assaulted the policemen after he was stopped for not wearing a helmet. This explanation is mentioned in a report by Times Now and supported by eyewitness accounts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is not related to the recently amended traffic regulations. It is an old video from Karnataka and does not represent the current situation.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating any information or downplaying the severity of the incident.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by providing conflicting information about the location of the incident. While Times Now mentions Bengaluru as the scene of the incident, there are reports from NDTV and ANI stating that it occurred in Davangere, Karnataka."}
