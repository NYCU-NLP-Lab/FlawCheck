{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has tried to defund special education. While there were proposed cuts to certain programs, the bulk of special education funding remained intact.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the proposed budget did seek to eliminate federal contributions to the Special Olympics, which DeVos later said she opposed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that DeVos has tried to defund special education. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the majority of federal funding for special education remained the same.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any attempts to cut funding for certain programs equate to an overall attempt to defund special education, which may not be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the proposed budget cuts, such as the directive to cut 10 percent from the overall education budget."}
