{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Minnesota public schools made learning Arabic mandatory, when in fact it is just one of several foreign language options available to students.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the assertion that Minnesota public schools have made learning Arabic mandatory.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by linking the teaching of Arabic in Minnesota schools to the presence of Somali refugees and implying that it is part of a larger plot to take over.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the claim is a type of racial incitement that plays off ongoing hoaxes targeting U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents Minnesota's 5th Congressional District. This suggests that the claim is driven by biases against Muslim people and immigrants."}
