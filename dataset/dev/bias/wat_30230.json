{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Social Security shifted to electronic delivery. While there was a significant shift, it was not a complete elimination of mailed checks.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that some recipients still receive their Social Security checks by mail.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Obama determined Social Security would not send checks through the USPS due to security concerns.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the shift to electronic delivery was solely due to concerns about the security of the Postal Service, which is not supported by the evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The evidence suggests that the shift to electronic delivery was primarily driven by cost savings, environmental impact, and increased security for payments, rather than concerns about the security of the Postal Service."}
