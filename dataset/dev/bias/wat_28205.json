{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money that can be saved by not giving out money to Medicare recipients that don't exist for procedures that didn't happen. The expert's verdict states that the $125 billion figure assigned entirely to Medicare is inaccurate and that Medicare's improper payments amount to $47.9 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that $125 billion can be saved by not giving money to non-existent Medicare recipients.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all improper payments identified can be returned as savings to taxpayers, which the expert's verdict states is inaccurate. Improper payments can include a range of factors and may not be entirely recoverable.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the improper payments identified. The expert's verdict mentions that the $125 billion figure includes improper payments for various government programs, not just Medicare, indicating that there may be other factors contributing to the figure.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the $125 billion figure assigned entirely to Medicare is inaccurate. The expert's verdict provides the correct figure of $47.9 billion for Medicare's improper payments."}
