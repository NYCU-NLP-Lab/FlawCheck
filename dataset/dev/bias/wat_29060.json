{"Exaggerate": "The claim of presiding over \"more than 10,000 cases\" may be an exaggeration, as the spreadsheet provided by the Milwaukee County circuit clerk's office shows 11,808 cases assigned to Dallet. The actual number of cases she presided over may be different.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to verify the number of cases Dallet presided over. The spreadsheet provided by the court clerk's office may both overcount and undercount Dallet's cases, making it difficult to determine the exact number.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation as the spreadsheet provided by the court clerk's office includes cases in which another judge conducted all the hearings, but the case was technically transferred to Dallet before it was officially closed. This suggests that Dallet may not have had significant involvement in all the cases listed.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as the expert mentions that the spreadsheet provided by the court clerk's office may both overcount and undercount Dallet's cases. This inconsistency raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that presiding over a large number of cases automatically indicates significant involvement and experience. However, the claim does not provide any context or details about the nature or complexity of these cases, making it a problematic assumption.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement in the claim."}
