{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Scott Walker's stance on birth control by stating that he wants to ban common forms of birth control, including the pill. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim goes much further than previous claims made against Walker.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to prove that Scott Walker wants to ban common forms of birth control. The expert's verdict mentions that the evidence provided by the Barrett campaign is based on an endorsement Walker received and a questionnaire he filled out, which may not directly address the issue of birth control.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Scott Walker's endorsement by Pro-Life Wisconsin and his answers on a questionnaire indicate his intention to ban birth control. The expert's verdict mentions that the survey does not include specific birth control questions, but Walker's answers on related questions are cited as evidence by the Barrett campaign.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the endorsement by Pro-Life Wisconsin does not necessarily mean that Walker supports an outright ban on birth control. It states that the group insists on candidates aligning with its views on a survey, which may not directly address birth control.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by Barrett's campaign contradicts the fact that Walker scored 100 percent on the Pro-Life Wisconsin survey, which did not include specific birth control questions.", "Understate": "There is no indication of understatement bias in the provided claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no indication of the claim faltering at times or being inconsistent in the provided information."}
