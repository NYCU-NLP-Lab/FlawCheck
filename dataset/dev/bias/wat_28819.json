{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the dropout rate by stating that \"1/3 of our kids drop out (of high school), cannot go to college or start a career.\" The actual dropout rate is significantly lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that one-third of high school graduates cannot go to college or start a career.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the low high school graduation standards and the need for remediation automatically mean that one-third of high school graduates cannot go to college or start a career. This assumption may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the high numbers of minority students, particularly black and Hispanic students, not graduating from high school may contribute to the claim's exaggeration."}
