{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Kamala Harris \"bragged, boasted or laughed\" about prosecuting a homeless single mother. The expert's verdict clarifies that Harris spoke with satisfaction about the success of an anti-truancy initiative, and her goal was to provide help and resources to reduce truancy rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Harris bragged or laughed about prosecuting a homeless single mother. The expert's verdict provides a more comprehensive explanation of Harris' speech and the context of the anti-truancy initiative.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Harris' speech indicates a callous and uncaring attitude towards the plight of poor people. This assumption is problematic as it oversimplifies the purpose and intent of the anti-truancy initiative.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Harris' speech, such as her intention to emphasize the importance of reducing truancy rates and providing support to parents.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Harris' speech was focused on the success of an anti-truancy initiative and not on bragging or laughing about prosecuting a homeless single mother.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times."}
