{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the video by stating that it has been viewed nearly 130,000 times and received more than 2,000 shares. This information may not be directly relevant to the veracity of the claim itself.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the man set on fire in Ma On Shan was actually a stuntman. The evidence provided in the form of video footage and translations does not conclusively prove the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because the video includes images of a man on fire and mentions a film producer's perspective, it must mean that the man was a stuntman. This assumption may not be accurate, as there could be alternative explanations for the presence of these elements in the video.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the video footage, such as the possibility that it was staged or manipulated for other purposes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that an incident did occur in Ma On Shan where a man was doused with a flammable liquid and set ablaze. The claim suggests that this incident was staged and the man was a stuntman, which contradicts the reported facts.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting information that is not directly relevant to the veracity of the claim, such as mentioning the video's view count and shares.", "Understate": "There does not appear to be any significant understatement bias in the provided claim."}
