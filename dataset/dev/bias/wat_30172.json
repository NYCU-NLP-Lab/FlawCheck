{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of students killed in U.S. schools since 2012 by stating it as 7,182, while the actual number is significantly lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the stated number of student deaths.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the shoes on the Capitol lawn represent only students killed in U.S. schools since 2012, which is not the case according to the Avaaz news release.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the presence of shoes on the Capitol lawn, such as representing child deaths from gun violence as a whole, rather than just school-related incidents."}
