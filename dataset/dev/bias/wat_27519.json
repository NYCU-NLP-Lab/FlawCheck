{"Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of Hardy's voting record and public statements on DACA funding.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the accusation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting to defund DACA automatically means voting against programs that protect people not legally in the country from being deported, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Hardy's votes, as he voted against one amendment defunding DACA but supported another amendment blocking funding for Obama's expanded DACA program and a separate executive order shielding parents from deportation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Hardy voted against defunding the original 2012 DACA program, but supported defunding the expanded DACA program and the executive order shielding parents from deportation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not accurately representing Hardy's voting record and the reasons behind his votes."}
