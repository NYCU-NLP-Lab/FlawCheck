{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of the abortion-clinic owner by stating that they \"threw\" the baby in a biohazard bag and put her remains in the trash. The expert's verdict clarifies that the baby was disposed of in a biohazard bag, but does not mention throwing or putting the remains in the trash.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the viability of the baby by not mentioning that medical experts deemed the baby non-viable and incapable of surviving longer than a few moments. This information was provided in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the implications of the owner's actions. The expert's verdict clarifies that the descriptions of the incident were misleading and did not provide the full context of the situation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the abortion-clinic owner's actions were unethical or illegal without providing sufficient evidence or context. The expert's verdict does not explicitly address this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for the actions of the abortion-clinic owner. The expert's verdict does not offer alternative explanations either.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the baby was non-viable and could not have survived longer than a few moments, regardless of the clinic owner's actions. The expert's verdict provides this clarification.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more specific information. The expert's verdict does point out that the descriptions of the incident were misleading, but it does not explicitly state if the claim falters at times."}
