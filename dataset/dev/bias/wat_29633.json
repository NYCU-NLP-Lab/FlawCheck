{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Barack Obama has played over 90 rounds of golf as president is supported by statements from a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, Mitt Romney, and conservative blog posts. However, there is no direct evidence or official record provided to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that playing over 90 rounds of golf is excessive or indicative of neglecting presidential duties. This is a subjective assumption and may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Obama's golfing, such as using it as a form of relaxation or networking with other leaders.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing a comprehensive analysis of Obama's golfing habits compared to previous presidents. It only mentions that many presidents have played golf, but does not provide a clear comparison or context.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of rounds of golf played by Obama by using phrases such as \"over 90 rounds\" without providing specific evidence or sources.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim itself, but the lack of concrete evidence or official records contradicts the claim's accuracy.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim."}
