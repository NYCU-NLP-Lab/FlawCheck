{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the \"Modi Modi\" slogans being raised in the Pakistani parliament, presenting it as a major event or embarrassment for Pakistan and Imran Khan.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that \"Modi Modi\" slogans were actually raised in the Pakistani parliament. The evidence provided consists of social media posts, tweets, and a broadcast from India TV, but there is no independent verification or official confirmation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video showing the alleged \"Modi Modi\" slogans in the Pakistani parliament is authentic and accurately represents the events. However, there is no verification or confirmation of the video's authenticity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the video, such as it being a manipulated or edited footage, or the slogans being raised by a small group of individuals rather than the entire parliament. These alternative explanations are not explored or considered in the claim."}
