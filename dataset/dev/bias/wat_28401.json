{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of abortions performed by Planned Parenthood by stating that they performed \"hundreds of thousands\" of abortions in a recent year, when the actual number provided in the expert's verdict is 327,653.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that Planned Parenthood received $528 million from taxpayers in violation of the Hyde amendment. The expert's verdict mentions that Cornyn's office did not provide any explanation or evidence for this conclusion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funding received by Planned Parenthood is in violation of the Hyde amendment, without providing any evidence or explanation for this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions that the Hyde amendment does not single out specific groups barred from receiving funds.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the data being presented in a confusing way in Planned Parenthood's annual report or the ambiguity of federal funding being directly or indirectly used for abortions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Hyde amendment does not specifically exclude Planned Parenthood from receiving funds, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing consistent and accurate information, as evidenced by Senator Cornyn deleting and modifying his original tweet after further inquiry.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
