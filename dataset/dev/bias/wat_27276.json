{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Trident chewing gum has been declared haram. The expert's verdict mentions that a report on the Daily Pakistan website claimed that the gum had been declared haram, but it also includes statements from Mondelez Pakistan and the Punjab Halal Development Agency stating that the gum is halal certified. Therefore, the claim may be exaggerating the situation by disregarding these opposing statements.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively state that Trident chewing gum sold in Pakistan has not been declared haram. While the expert's verdict provides evidence from Mondelez Pakistan and the Punjab Halal Development Agency suggesting that the gum is halal certified, it also mentions the Daily Pakistan report that claimed otherwise. Without further evidence or confirmation, it is difficult to determine the true status of the gum.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that Trident chewing gum sold in Pakistan has not been declared haram. This assumption disregards the conflicting information provided in the expert's verdict, which includes statements from the Daily Pakistan report suggesting the gum is haram. It is problematic to make such an assumption without considering all available information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the conflicting claims regarding the halal certification of Trident chewing gum. The expert's verdict mentions that other Trident chewing gum products available in Pakistan may have been imported through unofficial channels and could have different ingredients. This alternative explanation suggests that the halal status of the gum may vary depending on the source or distribution channel.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not considering the conflicting information and statements provided in the expert's verdict. While the claim asserts that Trident chewing gum sold in Pakistan has not been declared haram, the expert's verdict presents evidence from both sides, making it difficult to reach a definitive conclusion. The claim's failure to acknowledge this conflicting information indicates that it may falter in its assertion."}
