{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Barack Obama is not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come to the United States. The expert's analysis provides information about the vetting process for refugees, which suggests that there are significant measures in place to ensure security.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that Barack Obama is not for vetting people.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Barack Obama has an open-door policy when it comes to immigrants, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis provides an alternative explanation by highlighting the vetting process for refugees and the efforts made to ensure security. This suggests that the claim may not accurately reflect the reality of the situation."}
