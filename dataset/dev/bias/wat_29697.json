{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the new ruling by stating that it would \"force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow.\"", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, and therefore, it is not a \"new ruling\" as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is not backed up with sufficient evidence or data to prove the assertion that dairy farmers would be forced to comply with the same regulations as oil and natural gas producers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new ruling treats milk spills the same way as oil spills, without providing substantial evidence or clarification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the EPA's website, which states that the rule change announced in 2009 aims to exclude milk and dairy farms from the SPCC program, contradicting the claim made by Rep. H. Morgan Griffith."}
