{"Understate": "The claim may understate the likelihood of Rep. Barton becoming the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman if Republicans were to regain control of the House. The expert mentions that exceptions have been made in the past and Rep. Barton could seek a waiver from the Steering Committee, but the likelihood of this happening is not clearly stated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively state that Rep. Barton would become the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman if Republicans were the majority. The expert mentions that Rep. Barton's third term heading the Republican contingent on the committee will end at the conclusion of this Congress, and waivers for term limits will only be considered in \"extraordinary circumstances.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if Republicans were the majority, Rep. Barton would automatically become the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman. However, the expert points out that Republican rules and sources indicate that Rep. Barton has little to no chance of becoming the chairman due to term limits imposed by House Republicans.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that Rep. Barton may not become the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman even if Republicans were the majority, due to term limits and the decision of the Steering Committee to adhere to those limits."}
