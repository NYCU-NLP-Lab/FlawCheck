{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the budget proposal on disabled veterans' benefits, as it only mentions one possible scenario and does not provide information on the potential impact on veterans with higher disability ratings and more dependents.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement about cuts in benefits to highly disabled veterans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed cuts in benefits to disabled veterans were a part of President Trump's 2018 budget proposal, without providing clear evidence or context for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the proposed cuts in benefits, such as potential budget constraints or other policy priorities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the proposal to cut \"individual unemployability\" for disabled veterans was abandoned by the Trump administration after criticism from veterans' groups.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information that is not entirely accurate or may be misleading, such as the meme that appeared on social media and the analysis from journalist David Cay Johnston's book.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential impact of the budget proposal by presenting a scenario where disabled veterans could see their annual disability benefits fall from around $35,000 to around $13,000, without providing clear evidence or context for this specific scenario."}
