{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"not a dollar would be paid out until jobs in the Foxconn development area were created\" lacks enough support as it is contradicted by the fact that the state will pay Foxconn up to $2.85 billion in cash over 15 years, depending on job creation and investment in the plant.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incentive package is solely based on fulfilling the contract and that no state tax dollars are awarded with the sales tax break. However, this assumption may be problematic as there may be other factors and conditions involved in the incentive package.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Foxconn fell short of its job goals for 2018 and did not receive the related state money. This suggests that some dollars were paid out without the creation of the expected jobs.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential financial impact of the incentives provided to Foxconn. The total incentives, including aid from local government and utility ratepayers, are estimated to be worth about $4 billion, which is not fully acknowledged in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it does not fully address the discrepancies between the initial plans and the changes made by Foxconn. It fails to acknowledge the reconsideration of plans and the political finger-pointing that followed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the changes in Foxconn's plans and the incentives provided. The claim does not explore these alternative explanations, such as the role of the company's negotiations with President Trump and CEO Terry Gou."}
