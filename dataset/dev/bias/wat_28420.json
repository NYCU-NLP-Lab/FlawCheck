{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Republicans didn't increase state funding for nursing homes in the last budget, when in fact they allocated $30 million in state funding.", "Understate": "The claim understates the increase in funding for nursing homes, as it grew to a $74 million boost when matched with federal dollars.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it contradicts the fact that Republicans did allocate $30 million in state funding for nursing homes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the lack of increase in state spending on nursing homes is solely due to Republicans, when it is actually because fewer Medicaid recipients are choosing to reside in nursing homes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the decrease in state spending on nursing homes is due to fewer Medicaid recipients choosing to reside in nursing homes, rather than a lack of funding from Republicans."}
