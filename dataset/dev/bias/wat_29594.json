{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific sources or studies to support the statement that almost 40 percent of people with HIV are not diagnosed until they have developed AIDS.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statistic of almost 40 percent of people with HIV not being diagnosed until they have developed AIDS is accurate, without providing sufficient evidence or sources to back it up.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no exploration or mention of alternative explanations for why people with HIV may not be diagnosed until they have developed AIDS. The claim presents this statistic as a standalone fact without considering other factors that may contribute to late diagnosis.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the severity of the issue by stating that people may not be diagnosed until up to 10 years after being infected with HIV. This timeframe could be seen as an understatement if the actual average time to diagnosis is shorter.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the annual number of new HIV infections has remained relatively stable at about 50,000 a year, as reported by the CDC. The claim suggests that a significant portion of people with HIV are not being diagnosed until they have developed AIDS, which could imply a higher rate of new infections than reported.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing clear and specific sources for the statistic mentioned. The expert's attempt to contact the association mentioned as a source also suggests a potential lack of reliability or inconsistency in the claim's supporting evidence."}
