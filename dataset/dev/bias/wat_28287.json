{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to fully verify its accuracy. The expert's verdict provides some information and examples, but it is not comprehensive enough to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that people who undergo amputations can sign paperwork allowing them to take the removed limbs home after the procedure. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there are certain health risks and legal restrictions that may prevent patients from taking their limbs home.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions alternative explanations such as religious beliefs and burial practices that may influence the decision to retain amputated limbs. This suggests that there are alternative factors at play beyond simply signing paperwork.", "Contradict fact": "The claim implies that all people who undergo amputations can take their removed limbs home, but the expert's verdict contradicts this by stating that not all hospitals have such policies in place. This indicates that the claim may be overstating the availability of this option.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential health risks associated with taking amputated limbs home. The expert's verdict mentions that if there are virus or bacteria-related issues with the limb's tissue, patients may not be allowed to take it home. This suggests that the claim does not fully address the potential health concerns.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the prevalence of people taking their amputated limbs home. The expert's verdict mentions that while it is not unheard of, it is not a common practice in many facilities. This suggests that the claim may be overstating the frequency of this occurrence."}
