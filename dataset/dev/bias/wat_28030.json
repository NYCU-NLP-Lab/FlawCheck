{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential impact of mRNA vaccines on tumor-suppressing genes, suggesting that they may promote cancer.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence or research to support the assertion that mRNA vaccines interfere with tumor-suppressing genes in a way that could promote cancer.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the research conducted by the Sloan Kettering Institute on chronic lymphocytic leukemia can be generalized to all mRNA vaccines and their potential effects on cancer.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that mRNA is a naturally occurring genetic molecule found in all cells and does not inherently carry cancer-causing changes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misinterpreting and misrepresenting the research conducted by the Sloan Kettering Institute, leading to a flawed conclusion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the findings of the Sloan Kettering research, such as specific to chronic lymphocytic leukemia and not applicable to other types of cancer or mRNA vaccines.", "Understate": "No biases of understating are evident in the claim."}
