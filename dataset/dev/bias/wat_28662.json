{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as the study conducted by the experts did not produce the figure of 34,000 alcohol-related admissions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the 34,000 hospital beds being occupied are solely due to alcohol-related cases, without providing evidence or considering other potential causes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the study conducted by the experts did not predict close to 34,000 extra or current alcohol-related admissions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as the police minister's spokesperson quoted information from Andrew Nicol, who was unfamiliar with the 34,000 number.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the occupancy of hospital beds, such as other medical conditions or accidents unrelated to alcohol.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of alcohol-related cases on the availability of hospital beds by stating that 34,000 beds are occupied solely due to alcohol-related trauma patients."}
