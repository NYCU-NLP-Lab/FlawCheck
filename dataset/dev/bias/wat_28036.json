{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or references to support the statement that a \"grossly obese\" man survived without eating for one year and 17 days. However, the expert's verdict provides a case report and explanation of how stored fat can fuel the body in the absence of food, which adds some support to the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the man survived solely on his body fat and supplemental vitamins, without providing any evidence or explanation of how this was possible. The expert's verdict, however, explains the process of using stored fat as fuel during fasting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the man's survival without eating for such a long period, such as potential medical interventions or undisclosed factors not mentioned in the claim or expert's verdict. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine if alternative explanations exist.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any known facts, as the expert's verdict confirms the accuracy of the claim based on the provided case report.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not seem to exaggerate any details, as it accurately states the duration of the fast, the weight loss, and the intermittent bowel movements, which are supported by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information, as it provides the relevant details of the man's fast and weight loss.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence or indication that the claim falters at any point. The expert's verdict supports the claim and provides additional information and context."}
