{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support, as there is no factual basis or documentation to prove that Walt Disney put a clause in his will requiring the company to remake classic movies every ten years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Walt Disney favored continual innovation and artistic risks over retreading the same entertainment ground. The example of the \"Three Little Pigs\" sequels shows his reluctance to repeat successful formulas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Walt Disney had the authority to dictate what the company could or could not do in his will, despite not owning a majority stake in Walt Disney Productions at the time of his death.", "Understate": "The claim understates the lack of evidence by presenting a viral tweet as a basis for the assertion, even though the tweet's author later admitted uncertainty about its accuracy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is presented by looking at the number of times classic Disney films have been remade since their original release. The fact that some films have not been remade for several decades contradicts the claim of a requirement to remake them every ten years.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a viral tweet that was shared as fact by thousands of people, despite its lack of factual accuracy.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of a viral tweet by presenting it as a basis for a widespread belief, even though it was later clarified as potentially untrue."}
