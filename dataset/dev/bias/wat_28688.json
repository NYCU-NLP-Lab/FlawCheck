{"Understate": "The claim states that the federal government poisoned alcohol to curb consumption during Prohibition, while the expert's verdict clarifies that the government did purposely add poisonous substances to alcohol, resulting in deaths. This suggests that the claim may have understated the extent of the government's actions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that 10,000 people died from poisoned alcohol during Prohibition. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides more detailed information and cites Deborah Blum's book as a source. This suggests that the claim may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the federal government intentionally poisoned alcohol to curb consumption. The expert's verdict clarifies that the government added poisonous substances to alcohol sold for industrial purposes to make it unfit for human consumption, but it does not suggest that the intention was to poison people. This suggests that the claim may have a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the government's actions, stating that the practice of adding poisonous substances to alcohol sold for industrial purposes was introduced to exempt producers from taxes. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the government's actions, which the claim does not consider."}
