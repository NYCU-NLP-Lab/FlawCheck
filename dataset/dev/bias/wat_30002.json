{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that 2 to 3 Texas women per week have major complications after an abortion, and 10 women per week seek help at an ER. These numbers may be an exaggeration as the statistics provided by the expert show a lower incidence of complications and ER visits.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statistics mentioned. The source of the statistics is an expert for the petitioners in the abortion case, and the claim does not provide additional corroborating evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statistics provided by the expert are accurate and representative of the entire population of Texas women who have abortions. It does not consider potential biases or limitations in the study or data used to derive the statistics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reported complications and ER visits. It does not explore other factors that could contribute to these outcomes, such as pre-existing health conditions or complications unrelated to the abortion procedure."}
