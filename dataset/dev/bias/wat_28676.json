{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Bernie Sanders' proposal by stating that he wants to raise taxes to 52% on anyone making over $29,000 per year. The expert's verdict clarifies that Sanders has never suggested such a tax rate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support for its assertion that Bernie Sanders wants to raise taxes to 52% on anyone making over $29,000 per year. The expert's verdict provides information about Sanders' actual proposals, which include options such as raising taxes to 52% for incomes above $10 million and implementing a 4% income-based premium.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bernie Sanders wants free healthcare for all and that his solution is to raise taxes to 52% on certain income earners. However, the expert's verdict explains that Sanders' Medicare for All plan involves multiple options for funding, and he has never suggested a 52% tax on earnings over $29,000.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Bernie Sanders has never proposed a 52% tax on earnings over $29,000. The expert's verdict clarifies this and provides accurate information about Sanders' proposals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or options for funding Bernie Sanders' healthcare plan. The expert's verdict mentions other options, such as a 4% income-based premium, that would contribute to the tax burden but not to the extent claimed in the original post.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as the provided information does not mention any inconsistencies or contradictions within the claim itself.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information, as it makes an exaggerated statement about Bernie Sanders' tax proposal."}
