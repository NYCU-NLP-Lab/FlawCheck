{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict points out that there is no clear evidence or guidelines indicating that the Marine Corps emblem itself violates Facebook's community standards. The claim lacks sufficient support to prove that the emblem is a violation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the posting of the Marine Corps emblem is a violation of Facebook's community standards without providing concrete evidence or guidelines to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the suspension of the \"Locked and Loaded\" page, such as text or commentary posted alongside the emblem that may have triggered a complaint. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that the emblem alone was the reason for the suspension.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that images of the Marine Corps emblem were readily available on other Facebook groups and pages, including the USMC's verified Facebook page. This contradicts the claim that posting the emblem is a violation of Facebook's community standards.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the situation by not providing a complete understanding of the circumstances surrounding the suspension of the \"Locked and Loaded\" page. The expert's verdict suggests that there may be more to the story than just the posting of the emblem."}
