{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the National Football League (NFL) completely ended its donations to various charitable commitments and shifted all funding to the Black Lives Matter movement. The expert's verdict clarifies that the funding was not completely stopped, but rather a portion of it was allocated to social justice activities over a seven-year period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or citations to support its assertion that the NFL stopped funding military charities and redirected the money to Black Lives Matter. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was made without any supporting evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the NFL's decision to allocate funding to social justice programs means that it is specifically going to the Black Lives Matter movement. The expert's verdict clarifies that the funding was intended for social justice activities but does not specify that it is solely for the Black Lives Matter movement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no plan for the NFL to provide funding to the Black Lives Matter movement. The expert's verdict states that reports suggesting such a plan misrepresent the agreement between the NFL and protesting players.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists in the expert's verdict, which explains that the funding allocated by the NFL was intended for social justice activities as part of an agreement with the Players Coalition, a group of NFL players involved in national anthem protests. The claim fails to acknowledge this alternative explanation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the details of the agreement between the NFL and protesting players. The expert's verdict clarifies that the claim is false and provides accurate information about the agreement.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
