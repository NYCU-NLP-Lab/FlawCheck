{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Hillary Clinton was asked repeatedly to provide security in Benghazi, as there is no clear evidence provided to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton was repeatedly asked to provide security in Benghazi, as there is no direct evidence provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Hillary Clinton's name on diplomatic cables is evidence of her involvement in security decisions, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by Hillary Clinton herself, who stated that security requests from Libya never came to her attention, suggesting that she may not have been aware of the repeated requests for security."}
