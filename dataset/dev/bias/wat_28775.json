{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the level of opposition and controversy surrounding Gorsuch's confirmation to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006. It suggests that there was very little opposition, but in reality, there was some questioning from Senator Lindsey Graham during the confirmation hearing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Gorsuch's confirmation to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals was unanimous. It only mentions a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report without providing further details or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of opposition during Gorsuch's confirmation to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals indicates unanimous support from all Democratic senators, including Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. However, there is no concrete evidence or confirmation that all Democratic senators supported Gorsuch's confirmation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the lack of opposition during Gorsuch's confirmation to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. It assumes that the absence of objections from Biden and Schumer means they fully supported Gorsuch, without exploring other possible reasons for their lack of opposition."}
