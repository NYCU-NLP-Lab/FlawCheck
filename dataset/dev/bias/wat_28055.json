{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a lobbying registration filing from 2002 and the merger of the union with the AFL-CIO in 2005. There is no additional evidence provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that lobbying for the PACE International Union, which later merged with the United Steelworkers, automatically means lobbying for the AFL-CIO. This assumption may not be accurate as there could be other unions or organizations involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Dan Branch's involvement with the PACE International Union, such as representing the union's specific interests rather than lobbying on behalf of the AFL-CIO as a whole."}
