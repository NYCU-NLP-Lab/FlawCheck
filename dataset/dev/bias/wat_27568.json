{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which illegal immigration is at a 40-year low. The expert's verdict mentions that there are ways to gauge changes in illegal immigration, but it is impossible to know the exact level.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of illegal immigrants in the country. The expert's verdict mentions that experts agree that there are around 11 million to 12 million U.S. residents without legal permission to live here.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that illegal immigration is lower than it's been in 40 years. The expert's verdict mentions that there are ways to gauge changes in illegal immigration, but it is difficult to have precise data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the level of illegal immigration is a crisis or a significant problem. The expert's verdict mentions that Republicans, including Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, consider illegal immigration to be a huge crisis, but it does not provide evidence to support or refute this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in illegal immigration. The expert's verdict mentions that the flows of immigrants across the border correlate with economic conditions outside the president's control, suggesting that there may be other factors influencing the level of illegal immigration."}
