{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Obamacare on small businesses by stating that 75 percent of them will be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the employer mandate under Obamacare will lead to small businesses firing workers or reducing hours, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or data to support the statement that 75 percent of small businesses will be affected in this way.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why small businesses may choose to fire workers or cut hours, such as economic factors unrelated to Obamacare."}
