{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of Mitt Romney's tax plan on working families by stating that he is \"raising taxes on 18 million working families.\" This may be an exaggeration because it does not provide enough evidence or context to support the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to substantiate the assertion that Mitt Romney is proposing to cut his own taxes while raising them on working families. The expert's verdict mentions that they contacted the Romney campaign for more details on his tax plan but did not receive a response, indicating a lack of sufficient information to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mitt Romney's tax plan would result in higher taxes for working families and lower taxes for the wealthy. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the potential complexities and nuances of tax policy and its impact on different income groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Mitt Romney's tax plan, such as potential benefits or incentives for economic growth and job creation. It presents a one-sided view without acknowledging potential counterarguments or alternative perspectives."}
