{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"2.5 million young adults now have coverage\" is supported by a Health and Human Services analysis of data from the National Health Interview Survey. However, the original CDC study found a smaller number, indicating that there may be some lack of consensus or certainty in the data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in insurance coverage for young adults is solely due to the new health care law. It does not consider other factors that may have contributed to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the original CDC study found a smaller number of young adults gaining coverage. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the data.", "Falters at times": "While the claim is supported by data, the expert's verdict mentions that the film cherry-picked the higher number to emphasize the impact of the health care law. This implies that the claim may falter in presenting a complete and unbiased picture.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates the number of young adults gaining coverage. The claim and supporting data both indicate an increase of 2.5 million.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim exaggerates the number of young adults gaining coverage. The claim and supporting data both indicate an increase of 2.5 million.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any known facts. The claim is supported by data from the Health and Human Services analysis."}
