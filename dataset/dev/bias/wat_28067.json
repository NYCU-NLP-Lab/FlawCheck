{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that a Chinese ship used a water cannon to attack Philippine vessels. The provided information only includes a photo with a Philippine flag overlay and a caption questioning the actions of the Philippine President.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo of a ship spraying water on two smaller boats is evidence of a Chinese ship attacking Philippine vessels. However, there is no direct evidence or context provided to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the original photo, which is being used to support the claim, is actually from a different incident involving a Japan Coast Guard patrol ship spraying water at a Taiwanese fishing boat.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by presenting the photo as evidence of a Chinese ship attacking Philippine vessels without any concrete proof or verification.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing a clear and reliable source of information. The information is sourced from a misleading Facebook post and a Twitter account that repeatedly publishes the same captioned photo.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the photo, such as the possibility of it being unrelated to Chinese ship attacks on Philippine vessels."}
