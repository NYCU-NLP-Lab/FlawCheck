{"Understate": "The claim \"In every state, women are paid less than men\" may be considered an understatement because it doesn't fully capture the severity of the gender wage gap issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that women are paid less than men in every state. It relies on general statistics without providing a comprehensive analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the gender wage gap exists in every state without considering the possibility that there may be variations or exceptions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the gender wage gap, such as differences in occupation, education, or experience.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its generalization by not acknowledging potential variations or fluctuations in the gender wage gap across different states or over time.", "Contradict fact": "While the claim aligns with the commonly cited statistic that women are paid 77 cents for every dollar paid to men, it may contradict specific instances or cases where women earn more than men in certain states or industries."}
