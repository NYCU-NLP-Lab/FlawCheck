{"Understate": "The claim may understate the issue of institutional bias in law enforcement by only focusing on the disparity in drug arrests and prison rates, without considering other factors that contribute to the overrepresentation of African-Americans in the criminal justice system.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that African-Americans don't use drugs at a higher level than whites. The expert's verdict mentions that there is little evidence to suggest that blacks sell drugs more often than whites, but it does not directly address drug use rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the higher rates of African-Americans going to prison for drug offenses are solely due to institutional bias, without considering other factors such as sentencing disparities or differential policing practices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the disparity in drug arrests and prison rates, such as differences in drug enforcement strategies or socio-economic factors that may contribute to higher rates of drug offenses in certain communities."}
