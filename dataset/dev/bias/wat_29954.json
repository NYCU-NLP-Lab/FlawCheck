{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that voter's licenses are asked for and verified in the state of Texas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the current ID requirements are sufficient without providing any evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for why driver's licenses may be requested at the polls in certain counties or situations, such as the use of a computerized system or the option for voters to use an ID or license instead of their voter registration card.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual requirements for voting in Texas, as it fails to mention that voters can provide alternative documents such as a utility bill or bank statement if they do not have a driver's license.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that according to state law, voters are not required to show a photo ID during early voting or on election day. The claim implies that driver's licenses are always asked for and verified, which is not accurate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which driver's licenses are asked for and verified at the polls, as it does not provide any evidence or data to support the claim that this is a widespread practice throughout the state of Texas.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing clear and consistent information about the actual requirements and practices for voter identification in Texas."}
