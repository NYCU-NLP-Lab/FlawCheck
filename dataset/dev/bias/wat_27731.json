{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the effectiveness of Obama's efforts to secure the border, as it presents the lowest number of illegal border crossings since the 1970s without providing sufficient evidence or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on limited data and does not consider alternative sources or measurements to evaluate the number of illegal border crossings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of apprehensions by the U.S. Border Patrol accurately reflects the overall number of people trying to cross the border illegally, which may not be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in illegal border crossings, such as changes in economic conditions or enforcement strategies."}
