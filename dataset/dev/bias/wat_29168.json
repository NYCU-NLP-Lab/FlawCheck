{"Understate": "The claim states that the resolution to ban assault rifles was \"not enforceable and never enforced.\" The expert's verdict confirms that the resolution was not a ban and had no legal authority.", "Lack enough support": "The claim states that \"no one got the benefit\" of the resolution to raise the minimum wage because it was not enforced. The expert's verdict confirms that the minimum wage increase was struck down by the courts before it went into effect.", "Contradict fact": "The claim presents the resolutions as if they were successfully implemented by Philip Levine, while the expert's verdict clarifies that they were not enforceable or did not go into effect.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the resolutions would have been beneficial if they were enforced, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative reasons for the resolutions not being enforced, such as legal challenges or opposition from other parties."}
