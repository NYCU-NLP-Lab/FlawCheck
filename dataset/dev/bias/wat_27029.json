{"Exaggerate": "The claim describes the \"Zombie deer virus\" as \"scarier than the coronavirus\", which may be an exaggeration since there is no evidence to support this comparison.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or scientific sources to support the existence or severity of the \"Zombie deer virus\".", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the \"Zombie deer virus\" is a real and significant threat, without providing any substantial evidence or expert opinions to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the claim may be referring to chronic wasting disease (CWD), a known disease in animals, rather than a new and unique \"Zombie deer virus\"."}
