{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of school kids in Ohio who qualify for subsidized lunch by stating that it is a \"record\" four out of every 10 students. The expert's research shows that the actual percentage may be higher than 40%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement that four out of every 10 school kids in Ohio qualify for subsidized lunch.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of students qualifying for subsidized lunch is an indicator of how families are struggling. It may be a problematic assumption to directly link the two without considering other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that there may be Ohio schools that do not participate in the federal subsidized lunch program, which could affect the overall percentage of students receiving free or reduced-priced lunch."}
