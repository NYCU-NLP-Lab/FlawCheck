{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it suggests that there have been 1,671 dead bodies recovered in Texas since 2011, while the data provided by CBP shows a lower number of bodies discovered along the entire border during that time period.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered to understate the actual number of deaths as it focuses on a limited timeframe (since 2011) and only includes bodies discovered in Texas, while the CBP data shows a higher number of deaths across the entire U.S.-Mexico border.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the number of dead bodies mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of dead bodies recovered in Texas is indicative of a crisis at the border, without considering other factors such as changes in migration patterns or border security measures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the number of dead bodies discovered in Texas, such as the geography and terrain of the region, which may make it more dangerous for migrants attempting to cross the border."}
