{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that household printers leave hidden yellow dots that provide identifying information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all household printers have the capability to leave hidden yellow dots, without providing evidence or specifying which brands or models are involved.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which printers employ the technology, as it mentions that \"a majority\" of laser printers produce secret metadata, but it is unclear how many printing companies and models actually employ this feature.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the purpose of the yellow dots, such as counterfeiting deterrence or tracking for security purposes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the yellow dots are not actually invisible, but can be seen under blue LED light or with modifications on a computer."}
