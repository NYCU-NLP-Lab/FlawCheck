{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the threat made by Nigeria, as there is no evidence or official statement that Nigeria gave Ghana seven days to rebuild the demolished High Commission building.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Nigeria made such a demand within a specific timeframe.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nigeria accused Ghana of destroying its embassy building and threatened to invade Ghana, but there is no concrete evidence or official statement supporting this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the demolition of the Nigerian High Commission building, such as the involvement of non-state actors and disputes over land ownership, which are not mentioned in the claim."}
