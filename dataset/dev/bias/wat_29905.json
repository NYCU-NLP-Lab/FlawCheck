{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the amount of money Chris Koster has received from \"union bosses\" by stating it as $8 million, while the actual amount is $12.2 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that Chris Koster opposes right-to-work efforts solely because of the union campaign donations he has received.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct correlation between the amount of money received from unions and opposition to right-to-work efforts, without considering other potential factors or motivations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for Chris Koster's opposition to right-to-work efforts, such as his political beliefs or support from labor unions for his campaign."}
