{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Gov. Scott Walker's policies on unemployment growth in Wisconsin by stating that \"unemployment is increasing in Wisconsin at twice the rate it is nationally.\" The evidence provided only supports a one-month comparison, not a longer-term trend.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a long-term trend of unemployment growth under Gov. Scott Walker. The evidence provided only includes a one-month comparison and does not provide data or analysis for a longer period.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in unemployment in Wisconsin is solely due to Gov. Scott Walker's policies, without considering other potential factors or alternative explanations for the unemployment rate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in unemployment rates between Wisconsin and the national average. It attributes the difference solely to Gov. Scott Walker's policies without exploring other potential factors such as regional economic conditions or industry-specific challenges."}
