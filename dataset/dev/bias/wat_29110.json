{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the investigation into Adam Schiff's connections to Burisma by stating that he is \"under investigation,\" when in fact there is no evidence to support this.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Adam Schiff is under investigation for Ukrainian Burisma oil connections.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that campaign donations from companies tied to Burisma automatically imply a connection between Schiff and the Ukrainian energy company, which is a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that campaign finance records show neither Blackrock nor Franklin Templeton made any campaign donations to Schiff.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Schiff's financial disclosure form, which shows dividends, capital gains, and interest earned on funds managed by Blackrock and Franklin Templeton. This suggests that the investments were not related to campaign donations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the nature of Schiff's financial disclosures and confusing investment earnings with campaign donations.", "Understate": "The claim understates the factual errors and misleading innuendo present in One America News' report, which contributes to the bias in the claim."}
