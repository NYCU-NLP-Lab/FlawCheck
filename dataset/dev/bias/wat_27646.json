{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part-time, as it is based on a specific time period (December 2012 to July 2013) and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all new jobs created throughout the year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the trend of an overwhelming majority of new jobs being part-time is a troubling one, without providing sufficient evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide additional data or evidence to support the statement that more workers will find their hours and earnings reduced, or that jobs will be lost as a result of the trend of part-time jobs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in part-time jobs, such as the impact of the Affordable Care Act or companies' preferences for part-time workers after the recession.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, who stated that 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions since the passing of the Affordable Care Act."}
