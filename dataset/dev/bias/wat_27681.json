{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the free public university tuition program is paid for by a tax on Wall Street's speculation. The expert's verdict mentions that only two-thirds of the cost would be funded by the tax, with participating states expected to contribute the remaining costs.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential challenges and difficulties in persuading states to participate in the program. The expert's verdict mentions that there is concern among skeptics about state governments refusing to contribute the remaining costs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to fully substantiate the assertion that the free public university tuition program is entirely paid for by a tax on Wall Street's speculation. The expert's verdict highlights that the tax revenue will not fund the program 100 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax on Wall Street's speculation is a reliable and sustainable source of funding for the program. The expert's verdict mentions that there is disagreement over how much the tax would actually raise and that the revenue estimates vary.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative funding sources or strategies for the free public university tuition program. The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention this bias, but it suggests that the tax on Wall Street's speculation is not the sole funding mechanism for the program."}
