{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Joe Biden has been using Perry Studios instead of the real White House is an exaggeration. The expert's verdict confirms that the remarks made by top Democrats were indeed made at the real White House, not at the film set version at Tyler Perry Studios.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion. The expert's verdict provides multiple pieces of evidence, including photographs, White House transcripts, and confirmation from a spokesperson for Tyler Perry Studios, all indicating that the remarks were made at the real White House.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the remarks made by top Democrats were filmed on a movie set without providing any substantial evidence. The expert's verdict refutes this assumption by presenting evidence that the remarks took place at the actual White House.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that the remarks were filmed on a movie set, implying an alternative explanation for their location. However, the expert's verdict dismisses this alternative explanation by providing evidence that the remarks were made at the real White House.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the remarks were made at the real White House. The expert's verdict confirms this fact and debunks the claim.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times since the provided information does not indicate any inconsistencies or contradictions in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information as it suggests that Joe Biden has been using Perry Studios instead of the real White House, which is an exaggeration.", "Other biases": "None of the other biases listed (understate, falters at times, lack enough support) are applicable to the claim."}
