{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if Oregon's Legislature authorizes $450 million for the Columbia River Crossing (CRC), it will leave Oregon holding the bag for a great deal more cost responsibility. This assumption may be problematic because it does not provide enough evidence or reasoning to support the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to back up the assertion that Oregon will be left with a greater cost responsibility if it authorizes $450 million for the CRC. The expert's analysis points out that tolling on the I-205 bridge is unlikely due to federal regulations, but it does not provide enough evidence to fully support or refute the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis raises the possibility that drivers may avoid the I-5 bridge and use the I-205 bridge instead if tolls are implemented on the new bridge. This alternative explanation suggests that the responsibility for the project's cost could be shared between Oregon and Washington, rather than solely falling on Oregon.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Washington Legislature's prohibition of tolling on the I-205 bridge is meaningless because neither state could toll it without a federal waiver. This contradicts the claim's implication that tolling on I-205 could significantly impact the cost responsibility for Oregon.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of mega-projects like interstate bridges. The expert's analysis highlights the intricacies involved in funding and tolling regulations, suggesting that the claim's assertion of Oregon being left \"holding the bag\" oversimplifies the situation.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's analysis.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making assumptions without providing sufficient evidence or addressing alternative explanations. It may not fully consider the complexities and limitations of tolling regulations and funding agreements."}
