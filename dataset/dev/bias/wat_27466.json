{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides evidence of a TikTok video depicting a McDonald's employee cooking and storing the McRib menu item. There is no additional evidence or sources provided to corroborate the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the TikTok video, such as the possibility of it being staged or not representative of standard McDonald's practices.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the McRib sandwich has been available since 1981, as stated in the expert's verdict. The TikTok video implies that the McRib is a new or recent menu item.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the TikTok video by implying that it reveals something scandalous or surprising about the preparation of the McRib. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the McRib's preparation is not secret or hidden information.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the popularity and long-standing presence of the McRib sandwich at McDonald's. The expert's verdict highlights the sandwich's recurring popularity since its debut in 1981.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the TikTok video or considering other factors that could affect the perception of the claim's validity."}
