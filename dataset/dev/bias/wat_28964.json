{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the basis of the wiretapping warrant for Carter Page was \"all based on a dossier\" lacks enough support. The expert's verdict mentions that the reporting tracing the genesis of the Page investigation to the Steele Dossier is not cut-and-dried, indicating a lack of sufficient evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the wiretapping warrant for Carter Page was solely based on the dossier. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the dossier contained unverified claims, suggesting that there may have been other factors considered in obtaining the warrant.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the initiation of the investigation into Page, indicating that the claim's assertion of the dossier being the sole basis may not be accurate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the investigation into Page did not solely rely on the dossier, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the importance and influence of the dossier in initiating the investigation, as the expert's verdict indicates that it is not the sole determinant.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not acknowledging alternative explanations or additional factors that may have contributed to the initiation of the investigation into Page."}
