{"Understate": "The claim understates the number of people who can buy a health care plan for $30 a month on the federal health care exchange. The expert's analysis found that it is \"a good bit less\" than half of the people who would qualify for Medicaid expansion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that \"about half the people\" can buy a health care plan for $30 a month. The expert's analysis highlights that the actual number is lower than half.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all people who would qualify for Medicaid expansion can easily access and afford a health care plan for $30 a month on the federal health care exchange. The expert's analysis shows that the number is lower than claimed and involves a deep dive into how the health care law works.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents only one alternative solution for those who would qualify for Medicaid expansion, ignoring other potential options or alternatives. The expert's analysis mentions that in states that don't expand Medicaid, people making between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level can shop for private insurance with subsidies."}
