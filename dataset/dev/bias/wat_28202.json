{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the relationship between Andrew McCabe and Hillary Clinton by stating that he received $700,000 from her for his wife.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the money received by McCabe's wife from Terry McAuliffe, who has ties to the Clintons, was a bribe or political favor.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the implication that McCabe's wife's campaign influenced the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the money received by McCabe's wife was part of a larger effort by Virginia Democrats to take back the state Senate, rather than a direct payment from Hillary Clinton."}
