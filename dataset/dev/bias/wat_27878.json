{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of overturning Roe v. Wade on abortion laws in Wisconsin. It states that \"abortion could become effectively banned in states across the country, without ever overturning Roe v. Wade,\" suggesting that Wisconsin's law alone would not immediately make abortion a crime. However, it does not provide enough information to fully assess the potential impact and restrictions that would be placed on abortion in Wisconsin if Roe v. Wade is overturned.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing enough context or evidence to support its assertion. While it mentions the existence of a law in Wisconsin that would make abortion a crime, it does not provide further details or analysis on the likelihood of the law being enforced or the potential legal challenges it could face.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate its assertion. It mentions the existence of a law in Wisconsin that would make abortion a crime, but does not provide additional evidence or analysis to support the claim that the law would immediately come into effect if Roe v. Wade is overturned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption by suggesting that the existence of a law in Wisconsin automatically means that abortion would immediately become a crime if Roe v. Wade is overturned. While the law does include abortion as a crime, its enforceability and potential legal challenges are not fully addressed in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations or consider other factors that could impact the legality and availability of abortion in Wisconsin if Roe v. Wade is overturned. It focuses solely on the existence of the law in Wisconsin without exploring other potential legal, political, or social factors that could influence the outcome."}
