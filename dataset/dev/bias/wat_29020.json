{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of Obama in authorizing federal agents' use of force in Portland. While Obama did sign the National Defense Authorization Act, which included provisions regarding military detention, it does not directly authorize the use of force by federal agents in Portland.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the signing of the National Defense Authorization Act by Obama is directly responsible for the actions of federal agents in Portland, which is a problematic assumption. There are other factors and legal authorities involved.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct link between Obama's signing of the National Defense Authorization Act and the actions of federal agents in Portland. It presents a photo of Obama signing the act, but does not provide further evidence or explanation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that solely blames Obama for authorizing federal agents' use of force in Portland. The claim fails to consider other legal authorities and executive orders issued by President Trump that have contributed to the deployment of federal agents in Portland."}
