{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of support for staying in the Paris Agreement among President Trump's supporters and voters. While the poll mentioned in the expert's verdict shows that 47 percent of Trump voters wanted to participate in the agreement, it does not necessarily represent a \"majority\" as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only cites one poll conducted by Yale University and George Mason University. While this poll provides some insight into the views of Trump voters, it may not be representative of the entire population of Trump supporters.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the views of Trump voters accurately reflect the desires of a \"majority\" of President Trump's supporters and voters. However, the poll results indicate that only 47 percent of Trump voters wanted to participate in the Paris Agreement, which falls short of a majority.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. It assumes that a \"majority\" of his supporters and voters wanted to stay in, without exploring other factors that may have influenced his decision.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the level of support for President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement among his supporters. The poll mentioned in the expert's verdict shows that 28 percent of Trump voters supported opting out, which is a significant portion of his base.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Trump announced on June 1, 2017, that he would set the country on a course to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. This decision indicates that a majority of his supporters and voters did not want the United States to stay in the agreement."}
