{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific references to back up its statement about the existence of tolls on the Newport Bridge.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Newport Bridge was supposed to become toll-free once the bonds were paid off, but there is no explicit mention of this in the 1954 act.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the law did call for eventually turning everything, including the Newport Bridge, over to the state, but it does not specifically dictate the end of tolls on the bridge.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making an unsupported assumption and not providing enough evidence to support its statement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Newport Bridge has always charged a toll, even after the bonds were paid off.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the 1954 act and the lack of specific mention about tolls on the Newport Bridge.", "Exaggerate": "There is no exaggeration bias present in the claim."}
