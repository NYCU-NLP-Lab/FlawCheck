{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the difference between Wisconsin's criminal threshold for drunken driving and the surrounding states by stating that it is \"way out of line\" without providing specific data or comparison.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Wisconsin's criminal threshold for drunken driving is significantly different from the surrounding states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the criminal threshold for drunken driving in surrounding states is the benchmark for what is considered reasonable public policy without considering other factors or alternative perspectives.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Wisconsin is the only state where first-offense drunken driving is not charged as a crime, which is presented as a counter-argument to the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the differences in criminal thresholds for drunken driving among states, such as variations in legal frameworks, law enforcement strategies, or cultural factors, which are not addressed in the claim."}
