{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the US is the only major oil-producing nation in the world with a self-imposed ban on exporting crude oil. The expert's verdict confirms that the US is the only major producing country that does not allow exports of raw crude oil, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all major oil-producing nations.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there have been unsuccessful attempts to lift the ban in recent years, but it does not provide extensive evidence or data to support the claim that the US is the only major oil-producing nation with such a ban.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the expert's verdict confirms that the US is the only major oil-producing nation without an export ban on raw crude oil, it does not explore or provide alternative explanations for why other nations may or may not have similar limitations."}
