{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on U.S. census tables that only provide employment levels as of March of each year, which does not align closely with Kaine's tenure as governor.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the size of the state government workforce is solely under the control of the governor, disregarding the influence of other factors and branches of government.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the total number of full-time-equivalent employees in the executive branch actually fell during Kaine's tenure as governor, according to the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual decrease in the state government workforce during Kaine's term, as the drop of about 2,909 employees or 2.5 percent is not mentioned in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in the state government workforce during Kaine's term, such as factors outside of the governor's control or changes in the structure of the government."}
