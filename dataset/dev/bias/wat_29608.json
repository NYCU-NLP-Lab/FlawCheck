{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the \"activist Left is now targeting\" a New York City statue of President Teddy Roosevelt, implying a recent and ongoing effort. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the protest occurred in October 2016, well before the events in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the \"activist Left\" is targeting the statue of President Teddy Roosevelt. The expert's verdict provides information about a protest in 2016 but does not indicate an ongoing campaign.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by stating that the protest against the statue is driven by the \"activist Left\" and implies that it is part of a broader trend of demanding the removal of statues. However, the expert's verdict does not provide evidence to support this assumption and only mentions specific indigenous rights activists and artists protesting the statue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the protest against the statue. It attributes the protest solely to the \"activist Left\" and their demand to remove statues, but the expert's verdict mentions indigenous rights activists and artists as the organizers of the protest, focusing on specific concerns related to the statue's representation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the protest against the statue of President Teddy Roosevelt occurred in October 2016, not after the events in Charlottesville in August 2017, as implied by the claim.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understating bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear evidence of a faltering bias in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
