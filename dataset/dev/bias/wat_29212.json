{"Understate": "The claim states that the median income of a middle-class family went down by $2,100 from 2001 to 2007. This could potentially be an understatement if the actual decrease in median income was larger than $2,100.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict provides evidence to support the claim, including data from the Census Bureau and calculations by an economist. However, it is unclear if there is enough support to conclusively prove the claim, as additional data or analysis may be needed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in median income from 2001 to 2007 is solely due to economic factors and does not consider other potential factors that may have influenced the change in income.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in median income, such as changes in household composition or shifts in the distribution of income.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as the expert's verdict does not provide any indication of inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any factual information.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the decrease in median income, as it provides a specific dollar amount ($2,100) without any additional embellishment."}
