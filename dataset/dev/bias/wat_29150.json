{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of \"Human Coronavirus\" on the Lysol label means that the novel coronavirus is not new. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain that is different from the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the government and pharmaceutical companies are using the coronavirus to scare people and profit from selling placebo medicine, face masks, gloves, etc. The expert's verdict does not provide any supporting evidence for these claims.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain that was first reported in December 2019. The presence of \"Human Coronavirus\" on the Lysol label does not negate the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a new and distinct virus.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the presence of \"Human Coronavirus\" on the Lysol label by suggesting that it proves the novel coronavirus is not new. The expert's verdict clarifies that the label referred to the family of coronaviruses before SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, and that Lysol products had already been tested against older strains of coronaviruses prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no evidence of alternative explanations being presented in the provided information."}
