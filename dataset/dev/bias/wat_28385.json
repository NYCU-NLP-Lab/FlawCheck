{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of times Adam Hasner voted to raise his pay, as it only mentions four instances.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Adam Hasner voted to raise his pay four times.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting for appropriations bills that include salary raises automatically means supporting pay increases for legislators.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the fourth vote in 2010, suggesting that it was a drafting error and not a deliberate vote to raise pay."}
