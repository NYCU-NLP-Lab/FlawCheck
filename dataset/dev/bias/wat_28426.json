{"Understate": "The claim may understate the increase in the average minimum wage by stating that it has only increased by 12% since 2013. This is in contrast to the expert's statement that the inflation rate has gone up cumulatively by 40%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or data to support the statement that the average minimum wage has only increased by 12%. It lacks enough supporting information to verify the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the average minimum wage is low or insufficient based on the 12% figure. However, without considering other factors such as inflation or economic conditions, it is difficult to determine whether a 12% increase is significant or not.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in the average minimum wage. It does not explore factors such as changes in labor market conditions, government policies, or economic growth that could contribute to the wage increase."}
