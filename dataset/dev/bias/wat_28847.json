{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the effectiveness of the fence by stating that it cut the illegal immigration rate by \"99 percent.\" While there was a significant decrease in illegal crossings, it is unclear if it was solely due to the construction of the fence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the fence was the primary factor in reducing illegal immigration. It relies on statements from politicians and a news article without presenting a comprehensive analysis or expert opinions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in illegal immigration can be solely attributed to the construction of the fence, without considering other potential factors such as changes in border security measures or political situations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the decrease in illegal immigration, such as changes in immigration policies, increased border enforcement, or other factors that may have contributed to the decline.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the situation. It relies on anecdotal evidence and statements from politicians without presenting a balanced view or considering potential counterarguments.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of the issue by attributing the reduction in illegal immigration solely to the construction of the fence. It does not consider other factors that may have played a role in the decrease.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evident contradiction of facts in the provided claim."}
