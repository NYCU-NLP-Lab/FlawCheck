{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the \"COVID-19 breakout map\" by using the term \"outbreak\" when the map actually represents cumulative confirmed cases.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the importance of comparing incidence rates rather than cumulative case numbers in order to make a more accurate comparison between countries with different populations and population densities.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough support or evidence to back up its assertion that the border should remain shut based on the map.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to substantiate its argument for keeping the border shut.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the map supports the argument for keeping the border shut, without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the purpose or interpretation of the map, such as using it for informational or research purposes rather than as a basis for border policy decisions."}
