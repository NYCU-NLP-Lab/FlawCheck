{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement by stating that \"every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average.\" While it is true that global temperatures have been consistently above the 20th-century average since February 1985, the claim exaggerates by using the phrase \"every single month.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support in terms of providing specific data or references to back up the statement. It does not provide any specific numbers or sources to support the claim that \"all 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years.\"", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear distinction between global temperatures and regional temperatures. It is important to specify whether the claim refers to global temperatures or temperatures in a specific region.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the historic average is a reliable and accurate representation of normal climate conditions. However, this assumption may be problematic as climate conditions can vary over different time periods.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the observed increase in temperatures, such as natural climate variability or other factors that may contribute to global warming. It presents the increase in temperatures as solely attributed to human-induced climate change.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts or scientific consensus. The provided evidence from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies supports the claim's statements about monthly temperatures and the warmest years on record."}
