{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of deaths by stating that 60 people were found dead in Ohio, implying a sudden massive death wave, when in reality it refers to ongoing deaths from opioids in a specific county.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that 60 people were found dead in Ohio. It only provides a headline and a ripoff story without credible sources or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the headline could lead viewers to believe there was a sudden one-day death toll in Ohio, but it fails to provide evidence of this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was no one-day wipeout of 60 people in Ohio, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual number of opioid-related deaths by only mentioning the 60 deaths in February 2017, while the expert's verdict provides additional data of 727 total drug deaths in 2017 and at least 137 suspected opioid-related deaths in 2018 so far.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents an alternative explanation for the deaths as ongoing deaths from opioids in Cuyahoga County, rather than a sudden one-day death toll."}
