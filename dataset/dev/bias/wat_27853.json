{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Bernie Sanders' health care plan does not propose raising the tax rate to 52% on incomes over $29,000. Instead, it proposes a 4% income-based premium on earnings over $29,000 and a 52% tax rate on earnings over $10 million.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the tax rate proposed by Bernie Sanders' health care plan, stating it as 52% for incomes over $29,000, while the actual proposal is a 4% income-based premium.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that Bernie Sanders' health care plan proposes a 52% tax rate on incomes over $29,000.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Bernie Sanders said during a debate that he would raise taxes to 52% on anyone making over $29,000 a year, which is not true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is provided by Sanders himself, who stated that any tax increase for low-wage workers would be offset by lower health care costs."}
