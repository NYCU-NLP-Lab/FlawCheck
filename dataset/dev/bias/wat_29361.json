{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that evidence for Donald Trump actually hitting his second grade music teacher is lacking.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict states that whether the passage describes an actual event from Donald Trump's childhood is doubtful. Some skeptics have cast doubt on his story, and even Trump himself has backpedaled on it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that none of Trump's childhood friends recall the incident or Donald talking about it then. The teacher involved also reportedly stated that Trump had never struck him.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the passage in 'The Art of the Deal' is missing the sentences immediately preceding and following it, which could potentially provide more context or clarification.", "Exaggerate": "It is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict that the claim exaggerates the incident, but the mention of Trump giving his music teacher a black eye and almost getting expelled could be seen as an exaggeration of the severity of the incident.", "Understate": "It is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict that the claim understates the incident, but the mention of Trump punching his music teacher and giving him a black eye could be seen as downplaying the seriousness of the act.", "Contradict fact": "It is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict that the claim contradicts fact, but the lack of evidence and doubts raised by skeptics suggest that the claim may not be entirely accurate."}
