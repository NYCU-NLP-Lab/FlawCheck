{"Understate": "The claim suggests that Joe Biden understated the number of H1N1 deaths by saying 14,000, while the expert explains that the actual estimate is 12,500 deaths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that Joe Biden said 14,000 people died from H1N1.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Joe Biden's statement was referring to the number of H1N1 deaths in the United States, not worldwide.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Biden's statement was meant to be a factual statement rather than a comparison between H1N1 deaths and COVID-19 deaths.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that Joe Biden's statement was intended as a comparison of H1N1 deaths in the US and COVID-19 deaths under Trump's administration."}
