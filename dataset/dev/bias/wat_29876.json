{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of Americans who have access to healthcare for the first time because of Medicaid expansion. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim has attracted scrutiny and has been given a \"Four Pinocchios\" rating by the Washington Post Fact Checker.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a report released by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. However, it does not provide specific details about the data and methodology used in the report to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 7 million Americans who have access to healthcare for the first time are a direct result of Medicaid expansion. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the Supreme Court decision allowed states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion, and not all states have chosen to expand their Medicaid programs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Medicaid expansion under the law lifted income limits and opened the program to those with low incomes. It is possible that some of the 7 million Americans who have access to healthcare for the first time may have qualified for Medicaid even before the expansion, but were previously unaware of their eligibility or did not apply for it."}
