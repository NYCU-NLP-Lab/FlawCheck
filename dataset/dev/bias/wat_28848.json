{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Elizabeth Warren was paid $400,000 to teach one class at Harvard Law School is an exaggeration. While she did earn over $400,000 for her work at Harvard, it is incorrect to suggest that all she did was teach one class.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that Elizabeth Warren was paid $400,000 to teach one class.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $400,000 payment was solely for teaching one class, without considering other work or responsibilities that Warren may have had at Harvard Law School.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim leaves out important context about the other work Warren was doing at Harvard Law School, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the payment she received."}
