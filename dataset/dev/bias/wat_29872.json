{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of open carry laws on violent crime by stating that it is 23 percent lower in states that allow open carry. The reality is more complex and there are other factors at play.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on a comparison of crime rates in states with and without open carry laws in 2012. More recent and comprehensive data would be needed to provide stronger evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lower violent crime rate in states that allow open carry is directly caused by the presence of open carry laws. However, there may be alternative explanations or confounding factors that contribute to the difference in crime rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lower violent crime rate in states that allow open carry. Other factors such as socioeconomic factors, demographics, or law enforcement strategies could also influence crime rates."}
