{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that Georgia state troopers blocked off entrance to their state days before Hurricane Florence made landfall. The expert's verdict mentions that there was no validity to the claim and that various sports teams and tourist attractions in Georgia were offering free or discounted tickets to people fleeing into the state to avoid the storm.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or reports from any agency stating that the state of Georgia was \"at capacity\" and turning away vehicles.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Georgia state troopers were blocking off entrance to their state, but the expert's verdict mentions that there was no validity to the claim and it was based on a single Facebook post.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation could be that the Facebook post was spreading misinformation and there was no actual blocking of entrance by Georgia state troopers."}
