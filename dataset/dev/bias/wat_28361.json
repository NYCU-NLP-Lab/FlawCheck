{"Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the swine flu pandemic in comparison to COVID-19 by suggesting that if the swine flu had been as lethal as COVID-19, 2 million American lives would have been lost. The expert points out that the swine flu was not especially lethal and resulted in an estimated 12,469 deaths over a year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of evidence or data to back up the assertion that the strategic national stockpile was left empty. The expert's verdict does not provide any specific information related to this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the strategic national stockpile was left empty, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption. The expert's verdict does not address this specific claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the two viruses (swine flu and COVID-19) were very different and required different responses. This implies that the claim may overlook the differences between the two pandemics and the reasons for different approaches taken.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that around 60 million Americans were estimated to have contracted swine flu, while the claim suggests that only 7.5 million people contracted it. The expert's verdict points out the discrepancy between the claim and the estimated number of swine flu cases.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the swine flu pandemic by suggesting that if it had been as lethal as COVID-19, 2 million American lives would have been lost. The expert's verdict highlights that the swine flu was not particularly deadly.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by making broad assertions without providing sufficient evidence or context. The expert's verdict does not provide specific information related to the claim, indicating a potential lack of support or inconsistency."}
