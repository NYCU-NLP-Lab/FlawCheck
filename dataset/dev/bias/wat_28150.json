{"Understate": "The claim may understate the differences in minimum wages between France, Australia, and the U.S. by only showing the average minimum wages without specifying the specific rates for each country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the correlation between average minimum wages and the cost of a Big Mac in each country. It does not provide any evidence or data to establish a direct relationship between these two factors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average cost of a Big Mac is directly related to the average minimum wages in each country, without considering other factors such as local market conditions, currency exchange rates, or purchasing power parity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the differences in minimum wages and the cost of a Big Mac in each country, such as variations in labor laws, economic policies, or market competition, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the French and Australian governments list different minimum wages from those posted in the graphic, indicating that the information presented in the meme may not be accurate or up-to-date.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on a meme and social media activism as a source of information, which may not always provide reliable or comprehensive data.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it mainly presents a comparison between minimum wages and the cost of a Big Mac. However, without further context or supporting evidence, it is difficult to determine if any exaggeration exists."}
