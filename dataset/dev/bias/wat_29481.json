{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks evidence or references to support the figure of 60,000 Christians killed by Fulani Herdsmen in Nigeria.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the killings attributed to Fulani herders are targeted specifically at Christians, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of deaths by stating that 60,000 Christians have been killed, without reliable estimates or evidence to back up this figure.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear source for the figure of 60,000 deaths and by combining different statistics from separate time periods to reach that number.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the conflict between Fulani herders and farmers is primarily about land-use and not a religious jihad, as reported by the International Crisis Group.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the conflict, such as the competition for resources between nomadic herders and sedentary farmers."}
