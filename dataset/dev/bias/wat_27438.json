{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that a mosque exists on the platform of the Old Delhi railway station. The evidence provided in the form of images and social media posts is not enough to establish the truth of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the mosque on the platform of the Old Delhi railway station has not been removed, contrasting it with the demolition of the Hanuman temple. However, this assumption is not supported by concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation reveals that the viral image actually shows the Line Shah Baba tomb at the Prayagraj Junction, not the Old Delhi railway station. This alternative explanation undermines the claim that a mosque exists at the Old Delhi railway station.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the viral image does not depict a mosque at the Old Delhi railway station but rather a tomb at the Prayagraj Junction.", "Understate": "The claim understates the importance of conducting further research and verification before accepting viral images and claims on social media as true. It is important to critically evaluate information before drawing conclusions.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
