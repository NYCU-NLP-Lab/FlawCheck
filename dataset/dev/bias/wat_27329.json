{"Lack enough support": "The expert's claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or studies to back up the statement that \"you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if marijuana legalization is done correctly, there will be steady decreases in youth use. However, this assumption is not backed up by concrete evidence or clear criteria for what constitutes doing it \"right.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's claim does not consider alternative explanations for the observed changes in youth marijuana use. The data from Colorado, for example, shows no clear pattern of decline in youth pot use, contradicting the claim that legalization leads to steady decreases.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's claim contradicts the fact that the data from Colorado and other states do not reveal a clear pattern of decline in youth pot use after legalization.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the potential negative impact of easier access to marijuana on youth use. Critics have raised concerns about greater use among teens, even with legal sales restricted to those above 21.", "Falters at times": "The expert's claim falters by not providing the promised studies from Colorado and failing to explain what they mean by \"do it right.\" This lack of clarity weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the positive impact of legalization on youth use by stating that steady decreases occur if done correctly, without sufficient evidence to support this assertion."}
