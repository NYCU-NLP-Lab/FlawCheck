{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that \"half of everyone that's here illegally came here legally on a visa and have overstayed their visa,\" which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on outdated data from a 2006 Pew Research Center report, and there is a lack of updated statistics on the percentage of undocumented immigrants who have overstayed their visas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that visa overstays account for half of the people in the country illegally, without considering other factors or alternative explanations for illegal immigration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim focuses solely on visa overstays as a factor contributing to illegal immigration, ignoring other factors such as unlawful border crossings."}
