{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Sen. McCain's tax plan provides \"virtually nothing to the middle class,\" when in fact there are provisions that would benefit middle- and lower-income households with children.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential benefits of Sen. McCain's tax plan for the middle class by not acknowledging the proposed increase to the exemption for dependents and the raising of the threshold for the alternative minimum tax.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Sen. McCain's tax plan provides \"virtually nothing to the middle class.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence of provisions that would benefit the middle class, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the entire tax plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the only way to benefit the middle class is through direct tax cuts. It does not consider other potential ways in which a tax plan could benefit the middle class, such as through economic growth or job creation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Sen. McCain's tax plan may focus more on benefiting wealthy Americans. It does not explore potential economic or policy justifications for this approach."}
