{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the age of the Greenland shark by stating it is 512 years old, as there is some uncertainty and the age range is between 272 and 512 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the claim of the Greenland shark being 512 years old.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the age of the oldest living Greenland shark is definitively 512 years old, which may be a problematic assumption considering the range of possible ages and the uncertainty involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the age of the Greenland shark, such as different methods of age estimation or factors that could affect the accuracy of the age determination."}
