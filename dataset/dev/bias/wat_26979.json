{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the 15% difference between Biden's vote and exit polling in Massachusetts, presenting it as a \"huge red flag\" for fraud.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that fraud occurred based on the exit polling discrepancy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a difference between exit polling and actual vote counts is evidence of fraud, without considering alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the discrepancy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the difference between exit polling and the final vote count, such as changes in voter preferences or other factors that may have influenced the outcome.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the exit polling numbers in Massachusetts actually showed 34% support for Biden, which is the same percentage he received in the final vote count.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using incomplete reporting on other races and faulty interpretation of exit polling to cast doubt on the integrity of the Super Tuesday elections."}
