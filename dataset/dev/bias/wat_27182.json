{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of the fruit-seller by stating that he \"sprinkled urine over the fruits.\" This is an exaggerated description of the incident.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the fruit-seller actually sprinkled urine over the fruits. The videos shared on social media do not clearly show this action.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the elderly fruit-seller is Muslim based on the use of the term \"Mulla\" and \"Jihadi\" in the social media posts. This assumption is problematic as it generalizes and stereotypes an entire religious community.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the actions of the fruit-seller. The videos do not provide enough context or evidence to conclusively determine what exactly happened.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the fruit-seller is seen apologizing and admitting to making a mistake in the second video. This contradicts the initial claim that he intentionally sprinkled urine on the fruits.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent narrative of what happened. The different social media posts and videos present conflicting information and perspectives."}
