{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo is not from the Golden Gate Bridge's 1937 opening but from a 1987 celebration.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the bridge \"almost collapsed\" during its opening, which is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence to suggest that the bridge almost collapsed during its 1937 opening.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the large crowd in the photo is the reason for the potential collapse, without providing evidence or expert opinion to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the bridge's potential collapse in 1987, such as high winds and the flattening of an arch on the bridge deck."}
