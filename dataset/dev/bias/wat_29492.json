{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the infrastructural development achieved by the state government in the last five years by using misleading images.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the road shown in the images is not a newly constructed road in remote villages but rather a road in Bangalore and a stretch between Thirumangalam and Virudhunagar.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the images used to depict the road construction are not related to the claimed development in Bihar.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the images represent the actual road construction in remote villages by BJP Bihar, which is not supported by the evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the images, suggesting that they were not taken in Bihar but in different locations and time periods."}
