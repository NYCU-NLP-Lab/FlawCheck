{"Contradict fact": "There is a contradiction between the claim and the expert's verdict. The claim states that an Illinois janitor collected $20 million in life insurance benefits on policies placed on teenagers who were then murdered, while the expert's verdict provides evidence that the claim is likely false and based on fake news.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the janitor's alleged actions by stating that he collected $20 million in life insurance benefits. The expert's verdict suggests that this amount may not be accurate or supported by evidence.", "Understate": "There is no indication of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of its accuracy and reliability, as indicated by the expert's verdict. It is based on fake news and lacks sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support, as it is based on fake news and there is no credible evidence provided to verify its accuracy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the janitor collected $20 million in life insurance benefits on policies placed on murdered teenagers, without providing any evidence or proof to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may be a variation on a controversial practice known as \"dead peasant insurance\" and could be a hoax playing off the belief that Chicago is excessively violent and dangerous. This alternative explanation challenges the validity of the claim."}
