{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered to have an element of exaggeration as it states a specific dollar amount for the difference in wages between union and non-union jobs without providing specific supporting evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific supporting evidence or data to back up the stated wage difference between union and non-union jobs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all union jobs and non-union jobs have a consistent wage difference, which may not be accurate as different sectors and occupations can have varying wage gaps.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis provides alternative explanations by highlighting that the wage difference varies across different sectors and occupations, with some non-union workers actually earning more than union members in certain fields."}
