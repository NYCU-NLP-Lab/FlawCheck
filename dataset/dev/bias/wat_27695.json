{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the low death rate in relation to the CDC's classification of COVID-19 as an epidemic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CDC still considers COVID-19 an epidemic despite the dip in death rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific death rate figures or evidence to support the assertion that the death rate is becoming so low that it wouldn't meet the CDC's definition of an epidemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CDC's classification of an epidemic is solely based on death rates, which is a problematic assumption as other factors are considered.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the CDC's classification of COVID-19 as an epidemic, such as the overall number of cases or the potential for resurgence in death rates."}
