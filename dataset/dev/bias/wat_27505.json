{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the bias by stating that \"school boards sent home letters with children\" when the evidence only supports the existence of a note being sent home by a Sunday school class.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the bias by not fully acknowledging the broader anti-Catholic sentiment and conspiracy theories that surrounded Al Smith's candidacy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to fully support the assertion that school boards sent home letters, as the only evidence provided is a mention of a note being sent home by a Sunday school class.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the note sent home by a Sunday school class represents the actions of school boards in general, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could be subject to alternative explanations, such as the possibility that the note was an isolated incident rather than a widespread action by school boards."}
