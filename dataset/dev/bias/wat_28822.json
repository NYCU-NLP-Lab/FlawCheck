{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the House's COVID-19 relief bill on states' rights to administer elections. While the bill does propose changes to how federal elections are conducted, it does not completely strip states of their right to administer elections.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at any point.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the assertion that the bill strips states of their right to administer elections.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the House's COVID-19 relief bill would completely strip states of their right to administer elections, which is a problematic assumption as the bill still allows states to administer elections while implementing certain requirements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation provided in the claim."}
