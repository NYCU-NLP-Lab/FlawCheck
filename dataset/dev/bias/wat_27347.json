{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of the Bajrang Dal members by stating that they stripped and beat up a Christian woman in the middle of a bazaar. The video evidence does not support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that the Bajrang Dal members were responsible for the incident. There are no reports or evidence to suggest their involvement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Indian government is doing nothing to save minority communities, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the incident, stating that the woman was suspected to be involved in the death of a youth, which resulted in protests and her assault.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence to suggest that the assault was carried out by Bajrang Dal members. The expert's verdict clarifies that a RJD leader was among those arrested for the violence, indicating a different group's involvement.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an exaggerated and unsupported narrative without providing sufficient evidence or context.", "Other biases": "None of the other biases (falters at times, understate, contradict fact, lack enough support, problematic assumption) are applicable in this case."}
