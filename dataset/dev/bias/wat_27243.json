{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement about higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses in nearly every state.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the national economic recovery is the sole reason for the higher tax revenues and budget surpluses in Wisconsin and other states, without considering other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the higher tax revenues and budget surpluses, such as prudent financial decisions or disinvestments in the future.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the national economic recovery on tax revenues and budget surpluses by using the phrase \"higher than expected\" instead of quantifying the actual increase.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement from a Democratic news release that argues the budget surplus in Wisconsin is not a result of prudent financial decisions but rather disinvestments in the future.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to the budget surpluses and tax revenues in nearly every state."}
