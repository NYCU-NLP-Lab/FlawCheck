{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or data to support the statement that 97 percent of food stamp benefits are paid in the proper amounts to eligible people.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the error rates for food stamps are only 3 percent, but it does not provide any context or explanation for how this percentage was determined or what it means in terms of program effectiveness.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why food stamp benefits may be paid in the proper amounts. It does not address factors such as the effectiveness of program administration, the accuracy of eligibility determinations, or the potential for underreporting of errors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that food stamp fraud exists and accounts for a certain percentage of benefits. This suggests that the claim may be overstating the accuracy of benefit payments.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential for error in food stamp benefit payments by only mentioning a 3 percent error rate. It does not provide any information on the potential impact of these errors on eligible recipients.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the accuracy of food stamp benefit payments by stating that 97 percent are paid in the proper amounts.
