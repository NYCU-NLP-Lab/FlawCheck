{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the nurse's confession. The article is based on a single source, which may not be reliable or credible.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the nurse's confession is true without providing any additional evidence or verification. It is possible that the nurse's statement is false or exaggerated.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no nurse match was found during the investigation conducted by the General Nursing Council of Zambia. This suggests that the nurse's confession may not be accurate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated in terms of the number of babies swapped. Swapping nearly 5,000 babies over a period of 13 years at a rate of one infant per day seems unlikely and raises doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the alleged swapping of babies, such as possible errors in records or misidentification of infants.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of its credibility due to the extreme skepticism expressed by readers and the lack of evidence supporting the nurse's confession."}
