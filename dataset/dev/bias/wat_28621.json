{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that Donald Trump \"wants to undo marriage equality\" without providing concrete evidence or direct quotes from Trump expressing such intent.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it presents conflicting statements made by Donald Trump regarding his stance on same-sex marriage. Trump has expressed different views over the years, making it difficult to determine his true position.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide substantial evidence or specific instances where Donald Trump explicitly stated his desire to reverse marriage equality.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Donald Trump's statements about same-sex marriage were made in the past and his views may have evolved or changed since then. The claim does not consider the possibility of a shift in Trump's stance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump's appointment of Supreme Court justices who may want to overturn the law automatically translates to his personal desire to undo marriage equality. This assumption may not necessarily be accurate.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of Donald Trump's position on same-sex marriage by presenting only selected quotes and not providing a comprehensive analysis of his statements and actions related to LGBTQ rights."}
