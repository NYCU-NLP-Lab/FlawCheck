{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Americans who depend on Social Security by stating that 60 million Americans rely on it, when the actual number is slightly higher at 64 million.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the number of seniors who depend on Social Security for 90 percent of their income. While the claim states that one-third of all seniors in America rely on Social Security for 90 percent of their income, the actual percentage is 36 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that the government took money involuntarily from individuals with the promise of returning it upon retirement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that breaking the promise of Social Security is \"absolutely ridiculous\" without providing sufficient reasoning or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the numbers provided, such as the potential flaws in the Social Security Administration's definition of income and the exclusion of sporadic sources of income like money from IRAs or 401ks."}
