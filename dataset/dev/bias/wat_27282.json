{"Understate": "The claim states that school funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation. However, the expert's investigation found that public education spending, when adjusted for inflation, will actually drop by 17 percent between the 2008-09 school year and the 2015-16 year. This suggests that the claim may be understating the decrease in funding.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a study released by the Commonwealth Institute, a liberal think tank. While the expert's investigation did not directly dispute the findings of the study, it did mention that the calculation is largely based on data of past spending and inflation rates, and assumes that the General Assembly will not adjust its education budget for this school year. This suggests that the claim may lack enough support to fully establish its accuracy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the General Assembly will not adjust its education budget for this school year and that inflation rates will not markedly change through mid-2016. The expert's investigation does not directly challenge this assumption, but it does mention that their own calculations were based on data available from 2008 through 2014, seeking to avoid assumptions about future budget levels and inflation. This suggests that the claim may be based on a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation does not provide an alternative explanation for the claim, but it does mention that the Virginia Education Association has its knives out for legislation before the General Assembly that might allow some of the state's lottery proceeds to be spent on veterans. This suggests that there may be alternative motivations or agendas behind the claim."}
