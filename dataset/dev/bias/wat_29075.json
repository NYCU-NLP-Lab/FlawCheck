{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or information to support who vandalized the bust of Abraham Lincoln or why it was vandalized.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the vandalism of the Lincoln bust was in protest of Confederate statues, but this assumption is not confirmed or supported by evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation suggested by an Englewood resident that the damage to the Lincoln bust may have been caused by fireworks set off on July 4th, which contradicts the claim that it was vandalized in protest of Confederate statues."}
