{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Trump was not given an \"orderly\" transition when he took office in 2017, as there are examples provided that contradict this assertion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump did have an orderly transition of power, as evidenced by his own inauguration address and the actions of the General Services Administration in 2016.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it primarily relies on a statement from White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, which is contradicted by other evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an \"orderly\" transition of power can only be defined by the acceptance of the presidency by the opposing party, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the actions and statements mentioned, leaving room for other interpretations."}
