{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or examples to substantiate the assertion that Evelyn Sanguinetti \"publicly did not stand in opposition to\" the bill expanding public funding of abortions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if Sanguinetti did not publicly oppose the bill, it means she supported it. This assumption may not be accurate as there could be various reasons for not publicly expressing opposition.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as news articles published at the time of the bill's announcement reveal that Sanguinetti did make her opposition clear.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Sanguinetti did publicly express her opposition to the bill expanding public funding of abortions.", "Understate": "The claim understates Sanguinetti's opposition to the bill by suggesting that she did not take an overt stand against it, despite evidence to the contrary.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing Sanguinetti's stance on the bill by disregarding her public opposition and portraying her as standing by Rauner without expressing her disagreement.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the lack of public opposition from Sanguinetti by stating that \"whatever opinion she had was never picked up by the media,\" despite evidence of her opposition being reported in news articles."}
