{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a list of senators who did not co-sponsor an impeachment-related resolution, without considering the fact that six of them did sign on to that measure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that not co-sponsoring one non-binding resolution implies support for the Democrats' impeachment efforts, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, which is that the list of senators was originally created in October based on their lack of co-sponsorship for an impeachment-related resolution, and it has been misleadingly circulated again without considering the subsequent actions of some senators.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actions taken by the senators so far in the impeachment trial, as there has been little action taken by them at the time of the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that most of the senators named actually did co-sponsor the resolution mentioned, undermining the argument that they \"joined Democrats on impeachment.\"", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the implication that the senators' lack of co-sponsorship for one resolution equates to them supporting the \"Democrat witch hunt.\"", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misleadingly accusing the nine Republican senators of joining Democrats on impeachment without considering the full context and subsequent actions of the senators."}
