{"Exaggerate": "The claim \"We can fix our roads without raising taxes\" may be seen as an exaggeration because it implies that all road repairs can be funded without any increase in taxes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that road repairs can be funded without raising taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amendment to create a lockbox for transportation funds will effectively prevent lawmakers from diverting those funds for other purposes, which may be a problematic assumption considering the history of borrowing from the road fund in Illinois.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or options for funding road repairs, such as reallocating funds from other areas of the budget or finding cost-saving measures."}
