{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent and impact of Chipotle's 2015 outbreaks of foodborne illness by attributing them to pro-GMO bioterrorists without sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that the outbreaks were the work of pro-GMO bioterrorists. The only evidence provided is the presence of a \"rare genetic strain\" of E. coli and unrelated allegations against the biotech industry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the biotech industry would resort to acts of bioterrorism to destroy food companies that oppose GMOs, without providing concrete evidence or a logical connection between the two.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the outbreaks, such as poor food handling practices or contamination during the supply chain process."}
