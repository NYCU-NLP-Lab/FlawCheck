{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the level of taxes in Norway by describing them as \"astronomical.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Norway's taxes are high.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between high taxes and population loss, without considering other factors that may influence population changes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Norway's stable population, such as social or economic factors unrelated to taxes."}
