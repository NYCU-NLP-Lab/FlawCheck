{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the severity of the alleged attacks by stating that \"unarmed men, women, children being attacked by Indian Army\" and describing it as \"inhumane.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the video represents the Indian army attacking Kashmiris.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video tweeted by PTI represents a recent crackdown in the Kashmir valley, without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the video is a combination of two old videos, one from 2018 and another from 2017, which undermines the claim's assertion of a recent attack by the Indian army."}
