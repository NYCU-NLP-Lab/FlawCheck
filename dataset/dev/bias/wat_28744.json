{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in Wisconsin's unemployment rate under Scott Walker's leadership by stating that it went \"up\" from 4.8% to 6.2%, without providing the full context of the overall downward trend in unemployment during his tenure.", "Understate": "The claim understates the overall improvement in Wisconsin's unemployment rate during Scott Walker's time in office by focusing solely on the increase from 4.8% to 6.2%, without acknowledging the higher starting point and the subsequent decrease.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that unemployment is \"up\" under Scott Walker. The provided evidence suggests a gradual decrease in the unemployment rate during his tenure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the increase in unemployment from 4.8% to 6.2% is solely attributable to Scott Walker's policies, without considering other factors that may have influenced the rate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in unemployment, such as external economic factors or changes in the national job market that could have impacted Wisconsin's unemployment rate."}
