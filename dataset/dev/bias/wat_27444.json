{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the \"public option\" considered in the health care law backed by Tammy Baldwin was \"wildly unpopular.\" However, the expert's verdict indicates that the claim lacks enough support to prove that it was widely unpopular.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which made the claim, did not provide sufficient evidence to back up their assertion of the public option being \"wildly unpopular.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the public option was widely unpopular based on the fact that Tammy Baldwin supported it. However, the expert's verdict states that Baldwin took a position that most people at the time opposed, suggesting that this assumption may not be entirely accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the public option was floated in part to appease more liberal Democrats who were critical of the bill's reliance on private health insurers. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Baldwin's support of the public option, which could challenge the claim's assertion of it being unpopular."}
