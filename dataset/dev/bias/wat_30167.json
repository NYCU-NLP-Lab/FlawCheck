{"Exaggerate": "The claim that George Soros was arrested for election-related crimes is an exaggeration as there is no evidence or proof to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a doctored version of an indictment against six Russian hackers, with George Soros's name photoshopped in. This lack of genuine evidence undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the doctored indictment is real and that George Soros is guilty of election-related crimes without any proper investigation or legal proceedings.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that George Soros has not been arrested for any election-related crimes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the claim is based on conspiracy theories and attempts to discredit George Soros due to his philanthropic and liberal activities."}
