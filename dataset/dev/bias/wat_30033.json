{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of Joe Biden's votes by stating that he was the deciding vote in raising the percentage taxed on Social Security from 50% to 85% in 1993. The expert's verdict clarifies that Biden wasn't the sole deciding vote.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific sources to support the assertion that Joe Biden voted in favor of taxing 50% of Social Security in 1983 and that he was the deciding vote in raising the percentage taxed on Social Security from 50% to 85% in 1993.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for Biden's votes, stating that the legislation in 1983 had bipartisan support and was intended to shore up Social Security, while the 1993 vote was part of President Bill Clinton's deficit reduction plan.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Biden wasn't the deciding vote in 1993, as clarified by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a simplified and potentially misleading representation of Biden's voting record on Social Security without providing the full context or considering other factors.", "Understate": "There doesn't seem to be any significant understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Biden's votes on Social Security were solely responsible for the tax changes mentioned, without considering the broader legislative context or the influence of other actors involved."}
