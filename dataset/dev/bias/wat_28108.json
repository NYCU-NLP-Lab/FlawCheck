{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people who tested positive for drugs under Arizona's drug-testing program for welfare recipients. It states that only one person out of 87,000 tested positive, while the actual number is higher.", "Understate": "The claim understates the cost of the drug-testing program. It mentions a cost of $3.6 million, but the actual cost per test is $25.43, which could be considered a significant expense.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for its statement. The sources cited in the claim do not provide concrete evidence to back up the numbers presented.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the drug-testing program is ineffective based on the low number of positive results. However, it fails to consider other potential reasons for the low number, such as the deterrent effect of the program.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the low number of positive results, such as recipients being deterred from drug use due to the threat of testing."}
