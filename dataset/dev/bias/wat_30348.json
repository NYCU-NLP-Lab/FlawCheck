{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the increase in President Obama's approval rating by stating that it \"gained 3 points in the last couple months.\" This is contradicted by multiple headlines and polls that show his approval rating sinking or hitting record lows.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that multiple polls and headlines show President Obama's approval rating sinking or hitting record lows, while the claim suggests an increase.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides one statement from a White House adviser without presenting any concrete evidence or data to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the White House adviser's statement is accurate and reliable without questioning the credibility or potential bias of the source.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the inclusion of outlier polls in the aggregate data that may skew the average and create the appearance of a 3-point increase in approval rating."}
