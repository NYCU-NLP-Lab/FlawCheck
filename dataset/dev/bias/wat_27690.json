{"Understate": "The claim may understate the average student debt coming out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison by using the phrase \"something like $28,000.\" This suggests that the actual average debt could be higher than stated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only provides a statement from a former U.S. Senator without additional data or sources to back up the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the average student debt at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, such as variations based on different majors, financial aid packages, or individual circumstances. The claim does not explore these alternative explanations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have student debt, but it fails to consider the possibility that some students may graduate without any debt.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a statement from a politician without providing a comprehensive analysis or evaluation of the data and methodology used to determine the average student debt.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any established facts."}
