{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the rate at which trade cases were brought against China by the Obama administration compared to the previous administration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that trade cases were brought against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the difference in trade cases brought against China, such as changes in trade policies or priorities between administrations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rate of trade cases brought against China is the sole measure of holding trade partners accountable, without considering other factors or approaches to trade enforcement.", "Contradict fact": "Without further evidence, it is unclear whether the claim contradicts factual information or if it accurately represents the comparison between the two administrations.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a comprehensive analysis of all types of trade cases and enforcement measures, focusing only on cases brought before the World Trade Organization.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim may understate the actual difference in trade cases brought against China by the Obama administration compared to the previous administration. However, without specific data, it is difficult to determine the extent of the potential understatement."}
