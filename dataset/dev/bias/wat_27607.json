{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the sequester by suggesting that it doesn't make distinctions between bloated programs and vital services. The expert's verdict explains that the sequester imposes across-the-board cuts on most types of federal spending, which could have significant consequences for various programs and services.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that the sequester does not consider the distinction between bloated programs and vital services. It is not backed up by sufficient evidence or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there are bloated programs that have outlived their usefulness and vital services that Americans depend on every single day. This assumption may be subjective and not universally agreed upon.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the sequester does not make distinctions between programs. It presents a single perspective without exploring other possible reasons or motives behind the design of the sequester."}
