{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the Hurricane Sandy relief bill had nothing to do with Sandy, as the expert's verdict states that the extras amounted to far less than what was stated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to demonstrate that two-thirds of the bill had nothing to do with Sandy, as the expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funds allocated for non-emergency spending in the relief bill were unrelated to Sandy, which is a problematic assumption as the expert's verdict points out that the funds largely went to the states affected by Sandy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the allocation of funds in the relief bill, as the expert's verdict suggests that the money allocated for non-emergency spending was still related to Sandy."}
