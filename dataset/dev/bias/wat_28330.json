{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of money that Iran will receive from the nuclear deal by stating it as $150 billion, which is on the high end of estimates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that Iran will receive $150 billion from the deal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if the deal gets rejected, Iran will still receive the money, which may not necessarily be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may affect the amount of money Iran will receive from the deal."}
