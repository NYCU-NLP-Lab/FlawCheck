{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that there were over 600 reports of Texas votes for Donald Trump in the state's 2016 Republican primary, virtually all getting tallied for Marco Rubio. However, the evidence provided does not support this claim and it may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a post from stopthesteal.org, which is a website for a super PAC supporting Donald Trump. The post raises concerns about fraud in several states, including Texas, but does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim of 600 reports of votes being tallied incorrectly.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reported irregularities in the Texas primary were intentional fraud and that they were all in favor of Marco Rubio. However, the evidence provided does not establish this assumption and it may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reported irregularities in the Texas primary. It assumes that the irregularities were due to intentional fraud, but there could be other factors at play, such as human error or technical issues.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Ted Cruz won the Texas primary with 43% of the GOP vote, while Donald Trump finished second and Marco Rubio finished third. The claim suggests that virtually all votes for Trump were tallied for Rubio, which is not supported by the official results.", "Falters at times": "The claim is based on a post from stopthesteal.org, which is a website created by a Trump supporter and former campaign operative. This source may be biased and its reliability may falter at times.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information or facts."}
