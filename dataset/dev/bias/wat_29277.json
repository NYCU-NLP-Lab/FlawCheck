The expert's verdict provides more context and information about the negotiations and decision-making process, indicating that Obama was involved.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama was involved in the negotiations and decision-making process regarding the debt limit and budget cuts, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not fully acknowledging Obama's involvement and role in the proposal of sequestration.
