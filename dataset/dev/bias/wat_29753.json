{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the abilities of the Koran reciter, stating that they have the \"highest voice and longest breath in the world\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence to support the assertion that the reciter is an \"International Koran reciter\" or the \"first winner\" without any further context or verification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being a Koran reciter from Papua automatically makes the reciter international or the best in the world, without providing any evidence or criteria for such a claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video is identified as being from a different source and titled \"Surah al Balad Qari Eidi Shaban ||Qari Edi Shaban from Africa || Beautiful recitation of Quran\", suggesting that the reciter may actually be from Africa rather than Papua."}
