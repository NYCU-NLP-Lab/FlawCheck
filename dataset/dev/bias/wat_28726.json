{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount spent by taxpayers to develop remdesivir. The expert's verdict states that the Department of Defense paid $34.5 million, the National Institutes of Health granted $6 million, and the NIH invested $30 million in the clinical trial. These amounts do not add up to $70 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the $70 million figure. The expert's verdict provides evidence of the funds provided by different organizations, but none of them amount to $70 million.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the entire cost of developing the drug was covered by taxpayers. However, the expert's verdict mentions the involvement of Gilead Sciences, a private drug manufacturer, which suggests that private funding may have also been involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative sources of funding or collaboration that may have contributed to the development of remdesivir. The expert's verdict mentions the partnership between the U.S. government and Gilead Sciences, indicating that there may have been other parties involved in the development process.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by overstating the amount spent by taxpayers and not providing sufficient evidence to support the claim. The expert's verdict highlights the discrepancies between the claim and the actual funding sources."}
