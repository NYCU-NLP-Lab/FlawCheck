{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the damage caused by Hurricane Irma, stating that Mar-A-Lago was destroyed, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Jared Kushner is missing. The expert's verdict states that Kushner was seen at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., a day after the hurricane.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Mar-A-Lago was allegedly destroyed, Jared Kushner must be missing. However, there is no logical connection between the two events.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the whereabouts of Jared Kushner, such as him being in a different location or simply not being available for contact."}
