{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Wendy Davis is \"threatening to raise taxes up to $35 billion.\" The expert's analysis suggests that Davis has endorsed a study of tax exemptions and has mentioned the need to review $35 billion in tax exemptions, but there is no clear indication that she is actively proposing to raise taxes by that amount.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Davis's mention of reviewing tax exemptions automatically translates to a threat to raise taxes. However, reviewing tax exemptions does not necessarily mean that taxes will be increased. It is an assumption made by the claimant.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Wendy Davis is threatening to raise taxes up to $35 billion. The expert's analysis only provides statements from Davis indicating her support for reviewing tax exemptions, but there is no concrete evidence of her intention to raise taxes by the stated amount.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Davis's mention of reviewing tax exemptions. It is possible that she is considering ways to generate more government revenue without necessarily resorting to tax increases. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and instead jumps to the conclusion that Davis is threatening to raise taxes.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating or oversimplifying Davis's position on taxes. The expert's analysis suggests that Davis has endorsed a study of tax exemptions and has mentioned the need to review $35 billion in tax exemptions. However, the claim reduces this complex stance to a simple statement of Davis threatening to raise taxes, which may not accurately represent her full position on the issue."}
