{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Barack Obama \"said when he was running for office four years ago that he would halve the annual deficit by the end of his first term,\" implying that he made this promise during his campaign, when in fact he made the pledge soon after taking office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully back up the statement that Barack Obama did not halve the annual deficit by the end of his first term. It only provides information about the deficit figures during his time in office without providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors that influenced those figures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Barack Obama's failure to halve the annual deficit is solely his responsibility, without considering external factors or obstacles that may have impacted his ability to fulfill the promise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the annual deficit was not halved, such as economic factors or political challenges that may have hindered the president's efforts."}
