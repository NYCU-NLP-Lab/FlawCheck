{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Lay's chips contain an additive derived from pork based on the video and the website shown by the man. However, this assumption is refuted by SANHA and the director general of Pakistan's Halal Authority, who state that the additive used in Lay's chips comes from plant sources.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Lay's chips contain an additive derived from pork. The only evidence provided is the video and the website shown by the man, which is contradicted by official statements from SANHA and Pepsico Pakistan.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that SANHA and Pepsico Pakistan have both stated that the additive used in Lay's chips is derived from plant sources, not pork.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the credibility and authority of SANHA and the director general of Pakistan's Halal Authority, who are government-approved certification agencies and have verified that the additive used in Lay's chips is halal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the video and the website shown by the man may be misleading or inaccurate, and that the claim itself may be based on misinformation or misunderstanding."}
