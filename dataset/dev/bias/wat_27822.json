{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of states that allow personal belief exemptions. The claim states that there are 19 states that allow personal belief exemptions, but the expert's verdict mentions that there are 19 states with exemptions for philosophical, personal reasons.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that \"it used to be that the only children at school who weren't vaccinated were those who had true medical conditions.\" The expert's verdict mentions that there are exemptions for religious reasons in every state except for Mississippi and West Virginia, indicating that there may have been other reasons for non-vaccination even in the past.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in personal belief exemptions is wrong without providing further justification or evidence for this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions that medical experts stress the risk that unvaccinated people pose to public health, but it does not explicitly state that the increase in exemptions is wrong.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in personal belief exemptions, such as pressure from anti-vaccine organizations on policymakers. The expert's verdict mentions that experts attribute the growth of personal belief exemption laws to this pressure.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are exemptions for religious reasons in every state except for Mississippi and West Virginia. The claim states that the only children who weren't vaccinated in the past had true medical conditions, but the expert's verdict mentions exemptions for religious reasons.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without further context or information."}
