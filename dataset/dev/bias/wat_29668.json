{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Obama plans a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year, when in reality, Obama's plan is to increase taxes on those making more than $200,000 if single or $250,000 if married filing jointly.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that Obama plans a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's votes on budget resolutions automatically translate to voting for a tax increase, which is a problematic assumption as budget resolutions are nonbinding and do not include precise details on taxes or spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that Obama wants to increase taxes by rolling back the Bush tax cuts on people making more than $200,000 if single or $250,000 if married filing jointly."}
