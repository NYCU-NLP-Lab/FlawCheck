{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between Speaker Pelosi and Rep. Schiff to a \"prominent Ukrainian arms dealer\" when the individual in question primarily develops airships and has donated to both parties.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the connection between Pelosi, Schiff, and the supposed Ukrainian arms dealer. The photo used in the claim is not from a political fundraiser, and there is no evidence of a direct connection between the individuals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a photo of Pelosi with a comedian and former radio show host is evidence of a connection to a Ukrainian arms dealer, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the photo, such as it being taken at a different event (2018 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner) and the individuals involved having no connection to a Ukrainian arms dealer."}
