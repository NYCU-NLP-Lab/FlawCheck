{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the graduation rates in Texas colleges. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the actual graduation rates are higher than the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the graduation rates mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a four-year tuition freeze for incoming freshmen would give students an economic incentive to graduate on time. This assumption may not necessarily be true and can be seen as problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the low graduation rates, such as the quality of education, financial constraints, or other factors that may contribute to students taking longer to graduate."}
