{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that \"Because of Barack Obama, 32 million new people will have healthcare.\" This statement implies that all 32 million people gained healthcare solely because of Obama, which may be an overstatement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that 32 million new people gained healthcare because of Barack Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the healthcare coverage of 32 million people is solely attributable to Barack Obama's actions, without considering other factors or the contributions of other individuals or entities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may not entirely be \"because of Barack Obama.\" It mentions that Obama's position on healthcare reform changed after he was elected, indicating that other factors and individuals may have played a role in the expansion of healthcare coverage."}
