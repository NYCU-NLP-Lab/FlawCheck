{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of jobs that would be killed by President Obama's veto of the Keystone XL pipeline. The expert's verdict states that the State Department estimated that the pipeline project would support 42,000 jobs, most of which would last no more than a year or two during the construction phase. The claim fails to provide this context and presents the number as jobs that were already in existence and would be killed by the veto.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that President Obama's veto of the Keystone XL pipeline killed 42,000 jobs. The expert's verdict mentions that PolitiFact has rated similar pipeline-related jobs claims, including one from President Obama, as \"False\" on the Truth-O-Meter. This suggests that the claim may not have enough reliable evidence to support its statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 42,000 jobs mentioned in the State Department report would have been permanent jobs. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the report estimated that most of the jobs would last no more than a year or two during the construction phase, with only around 50 permanent jobs required for maintenance once the pipeline was completed. The claim fails to acknowledge this distinction and presents the number as permanent jobs.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of permanent jobs that would be required to maintain the completed pipeline. The expert's verdict mentions that the State Department report estimated that no more than 50 permanent jobs would be required for maintenance. However, the claim does not mention this and implies that all 42,000 jobs would have been lost permanently due to the veto.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the job loss, such as the potential economic and environmental concerns associated with the Keystone XL pipeline. The expert's verdict mentions that the project has been controversial and that there have been differing opinions on the number of jobs it would create. The claim fails to acknowledge these alternative viewpoints and presents the job loss solely as a result of President Obama's veto."}
