{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating by stating that Gov. Doug Ducey wants to use \"taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards.\" The provided information does not explicitly mention this intention of the governor.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide direct evidence or statements from Gov. Ducey regarding his intentions to increase the salaries of private prison guards.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the purchase of the prison by the state automatically implies an intention to increase the salaries of private prison guards. This assumption may not be supported by the available information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the state's plan to purchase the prison, such as cost-saving measures or refinancing to reduce interest payments. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
