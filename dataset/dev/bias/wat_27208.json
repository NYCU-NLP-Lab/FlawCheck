{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by suggesting that CNN falsified their reporting with phony images to exaggerate the human toll of violence in three different areas.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that CNN used the same girl to represent three different refugee crises.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs of the same girl were used by CNN to represent three different refugee crises, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photographs, stating that they simply capture one girl being passed around from one rescuer to another in the same disaster zone as part of humanitarian efforts undertaken after a single bombing event in Syria."}
