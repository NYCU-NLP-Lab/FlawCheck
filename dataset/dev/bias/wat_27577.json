{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that this was the first 4-year term without a new war since Eisenhower.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of a formal declaration of war is the only criteria to determine if a new war has occurred, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations by highlighting that military conflicts and engagements have occurred during the 4-year term in question, even if they were not formally declared as wars."}
