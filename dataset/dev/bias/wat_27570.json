{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the Supreme Court's decision by stating that it was the 13th time the Court voted 9-0 against the president's constitutional authority. The expert's verdict suggests that this claim is not supported by the evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict states that the NLRB case, which is included in the 13 cases referenced, is actually different from the rest and was ruling on a separations of power issue and presidential overreach.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 13 cases referenced are examples of the president exceeding his constitutional authority. However, the expert's verdict points out that eight of the cases occurred under President George W. Bush and were challenged by the court, not initiated by the president.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim's assertion of the Supreme Court's ruling being emblematic of Obama's term may have alternative explanations, such as the cases being handled by different administrations and the common practice of the Justice Department defending actions to the Supreme Court."}
