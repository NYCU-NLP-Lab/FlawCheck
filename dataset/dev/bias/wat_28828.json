{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential cost increases of the ARC project by only mentioning estimates of $10 billion to $13 billion, while federal officials had estimated costs could increase to between about $9.8 billion and roughly $12.4 billion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that New Jersey alone would have been responsible for all cost overruns, without considering potential contributions from other sources or alternative funding options.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify the statement that New Jersey alone would have been on the hook for all overruns. It only mentions the opinion of state Sen. Jennifer Beck and a spokesperson from the U.S. Department of Transportation, without providing further details or sources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of alternative funding options or the potential contributions from other entities, such as New York officials or the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that federal officials had presented options to fund the remaining costs of the project, including federal loans and a public-private partnership, before it was ultimately terminated by Gov. Chris Christie.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the financial burden on New Jersey by stating that the state alone would have to cover all overruns, without considering potential contributions from other sources or alternative funding options.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and comprehensive explanation of the financial responsibilities and potential cost overruns of the ARC project. It lacks consistent and detailed information to support its assertions."}
