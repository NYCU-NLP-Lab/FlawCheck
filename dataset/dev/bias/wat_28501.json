{"Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that Allen's campaign isn't providing many clues about his proposed flat tax plan, indicating a lack of sufficient information to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that George Allen's flat tax plan would shrink revenues further than the Perry plan, without providing concrete evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that flat tax supporters argue that lower levies would fuel economic expansion, while critics argue that the plans would sap more revenues than can be made up by added growth. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the impact of Allen's flat tax plan on revenues.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the Perry plan on federal revenues, as an analysis by economic consultants estimated that it could drain about $5 trillion in federal revenues through 2020.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear whether the claim contradicts any specific facts, as the expert does not provide information to support or refute the claim."}
