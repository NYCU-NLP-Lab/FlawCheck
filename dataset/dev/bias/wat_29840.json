The expert's verdict provides information from a 1999 analysis, but it does not directly support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Secure Fence Act authorized the allocation of $50 billion for border fencing. The expert's verdict highlights that the Act did not authorize any funding for this purpose.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that Congress members were voting to allocate $50 billion for border fencing, but the expert's verdict explains that the claim may have been derived from a 1999 study and not from the actual Secure Fence Act."}
