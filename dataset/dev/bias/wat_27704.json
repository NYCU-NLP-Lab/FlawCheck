{"Contradict fact": "The claim suggests that a positive test for COVID-19 is the same as having had a common cold. However, the expert's verdict contradicts this by stating that a positive test for COVID-19 does not mean that someone had a common cold.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the interpretation of a paragraph from the CDC's website, suggesting that it means a positive test for COVID-19 could indicate having any other cold or flu caused by other coronaviruses. The expert's verdict clarifies that the social media posts have misinterpreted the paragraph.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a positive test for COVID-19 is equivalent to having had a common cold, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict states that a positive test for COVID-19 does not necessarily mean having had a common cold.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that a positive test for COVID-19 is the same as having had a common cold. The expert's verdict provides evidence from health experts and the CDC to counter this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests an alternative explanation that a positive test for COVID-19 could be due to antibodies from other coronaviruses, including the common cold. However, the expert's verdict explains that the viral test used for COVID-19 specifically detects the SARS-CoV-2 virus and not other human coronaviruses."}
