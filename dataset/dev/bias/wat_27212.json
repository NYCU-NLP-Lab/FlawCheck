{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that no court has ruled on fraud and corruption committed by Ferdinand Marcos and his family, when in fact the Philippine Supreme Court has ruled multiple times on the matter.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or references to back up its assertion that no court has ruled on the issue.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Philippine Supreme Court has indeed ruled on the fraud and corruption committed by Ferdinand Marcos and his family.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that because no court has ruled the Marcoses as thieves, it means they are not guilty of fraud and corruption.", "Understate": "The claim understates the extent of the ruling by only mentioning the 2003 ruling on Swiss bank account deposits, while there were also rulings in 2012 and 2017.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the Marcoses were indeed guilty of fraud and corruption, as proven by the court rulings."}
