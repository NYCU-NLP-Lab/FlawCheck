{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides photos without any further evidence or context to support the assertion that the person who shot three people during the protest is a police officer.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person shown in the photos is the one responsible for the shootings, without providing any concrete evidence or confirmation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the person arrested in connection with the shootings is Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, and not the police officer shown in the photos.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the person shown in the photos may be unrelated to the shootings and could be a different individual altogether."}
