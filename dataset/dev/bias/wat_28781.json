{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the recall of Ventolin inhalers by stating that GlaxoSmithKline is recalling 600,000 inhalers. The expert's verdict clarifies that the recall actually took place in April 2017 and involved nearly 600,000 inhalers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement about the recall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the recall is a recent event in February 2018, but the expert's verdict explains that it is a rehashed article from the actual recall in April 2017.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the recall or provide any context about the reasons behind it. The expert's verdict mentions propellant leakage and manufacturing problems as the causes of the recall.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was no new Ventolin inhaler recall in February 2018, as confirmed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and GlaxoSmithKline's websites.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a false urgency and sensationalist headline, which could mislead people and put their health at risk.", "Understate": "The claim understates the extent of the recall by not mentioning the expansion of the recall in May 2017, which included additional batches of the Ventolin HFA inhaler.", "Fails to mention additional recalls": "The claim fails to mention the recalls of Ventolin Diskus in Canada and Ventolin Accuhaler in the U.K., which were announced by GlaxoSmithKline after the article was originally published."}
