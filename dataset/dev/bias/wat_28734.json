{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Hillary interned with the head of the California Communist Party, when in fact, Bob Treuhaft had left the party before Clinton started her internship.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Hillary's association with a law firm known for taking on discrimination and social injustice cases implies her own political beliefs, which may not be accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary interned with the head of the California Communist Party.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that Hillary interned at a law firm known for its work on civil rights cases, rather than having a direct affiliation with the Communist Party."}
