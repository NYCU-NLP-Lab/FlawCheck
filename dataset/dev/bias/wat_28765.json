{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of insecurity at the border by stating that \"at least three sectors of the border...are just completely insecure.\" The experts mention that there is no set definition for what constitutes a \"secure\" border, and the claim lacks a grounded metric to support the assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that three sectors of the border are \"completely insecure.\" The experts mention that there is no clear data on the percentage of successful border crossings or drug running missions, making it difficult to determine the level of insecurity.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of operational control in four sectors in 2010 implies complete insecurity in those sectors. However, the experts note that this data is from 2010 and it is unclear how those sectors have fared since then.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The experts highlight that border patrol agents have multiple duties, including preventing illegal migration, drugs and weapons trafficking, potential terrorist plots, and money laundering. The claim fails to consider these alternative explanations for the challenges faced at the border, potentially overlooking other factors contributing to the perceived insecurity.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the level of insecurity at the border by making a sweeping statement without providing specific evidence or a clear definition of what constitutes \"completely insecure.\" The experts emphasize the need for a more nuanced understanding of border security."}
