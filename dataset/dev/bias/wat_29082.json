{"Contradict fact": "The claim made in the meme contradicts the fact that Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network did not report that Mexican drug cartels are paying Pelosi and Schumer millions to keep the border open.", "Exaggerate": "The claim in the meme exaggerates the situation by suggesting that Mexican drug cartels are paying politicians millions to keep the border open, without any evidence to support it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to substantiate the allegation that Mexican drug cartels are paying Pelosi and Schumer to keep the border open.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the reason why politicians don't want a border wall is because they are being paid off by Mexican drug cartels, without any evidence or logical reasoning.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the political debate over building a wall on the southern border, instead attributing it solely to alleged payments by drug cartels.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a tweet by Lou Dobbs that shared a story making a similar claim without providing any evidence to support it.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the situation."}
