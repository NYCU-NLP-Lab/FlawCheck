{"Exaggerate": "The claim that President Trump \"brought back Big Ten football\" may be an exaggeration as it fails to acknowledge the role of medical advice and increased availability of rapid testing in the decision-making process.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that President Trump's words and actions directly led to the return of Big Ten football.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump's involvement was the sole or primary factor in the decision to resume the football season, disregarding other potential influences or considerations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the return of Big Ten football, citing medical advice and increased testing availability as significant factors, which contradicts the claim made by President Trump."}
