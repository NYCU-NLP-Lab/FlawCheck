{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Donald Trump's second impeachment \"cost $33 million\" lacks concrete evidence or support. Tax policy experts and the Congressional Budget Office do not have a cost estimate for the impeachment resolution.", "Contradict fact": "The $33-million figure is inaccurate and stems from a report on the costs of Robert Mueller's investigation, which is unrelated to Trump's second impeachment.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual cost, as it suggests that the impeachment likely did not cost taxpayers much beyond what was already budgeted. However, without concrete estimates, it is difficult to determine the true cost.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $33 million figure is accurate without providing sufficient evidence or sources to support it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could impact the cost of the impeachment.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the cost of the impeachment by using an inaccurate figure of $33 million.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable information about the cost of Trump's second impeachment. Different sources and experts offer conflicting statements and lack concrete estimates."}
