{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the situation by stating that a positive diagnosis was made without a test. The expert's verdict suggests that no report is generated for a person who does not show up for a test, and thus no result exists.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a Facebook post that has been shared multiple times, but it does not provide any verifiable evidence or official sources to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a positive test result can be generated even without actually taking the test. The expert's verdict contradicts this assumption by stating that no result exists for individuals who do not show up for a test.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the claim by stating that the number of Covid-19 cases in Canada is more likely to be underestimated than overcounted. This suggests that there may be other factors contributing to the reported case numbers."}
