{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance and relevance of the video by stating that it shows how COVID-19 infections spread in hospitals through close contact. However, the video is actually about general infection control and was produced almost a decade before the COVID-19 outbreak.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that the video was issued by the Canadian health authority. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the video was produced by the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust in the UK.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was not produced by the Canadian CDC, as it suggests. The expert's verdict confirms that the video was produced by a UK hospital group.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is relevant and applicable to the COVID-19 outbreak, despite it being produced before the outbreak and focusing on general infection control.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the video was shared with good intentions but mistakenly attributed to the wrong source."}
