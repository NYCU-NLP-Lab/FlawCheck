{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of donations that are going towards fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations. It states that over 73% of all donations are going towards these expenses, which may be an exaggeration based on the available information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that over 73% of donations are being used for fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations. It is based on a blog post without any contact information or verifiable sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the allocation of funds towards fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations is inherently negative or fraudulent. It assumes that these expenses are not necessary for the functioning and success of the organization.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or reasons for the allocation of funds towards fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations. It presents a one-sided view without exploring potential justifications for these expenses.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the ALS Association has not admitted or made any statements supporting the claim that over 73% of donations are not used for ALS research. The expert's verdict highlights that the ALS Association has not addressed or confirmed these claims.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact and effectiveness of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge by focusing solely on the allocation of funds. It does not acknowledge the significant increase in donations and awareness that the campaign generated for ALS research and support programs.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misidentifying the organization involved (referring to it as the \"ALS Foundation\" instead of the ALS Association) and by presenting misleading information about the ALS Association's statements or admissions."}
