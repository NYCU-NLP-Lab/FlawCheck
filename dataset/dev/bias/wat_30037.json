{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the RAISE Act in preventing new immigrants from collecting welfare. The expert's verdict states that the current federal law already bars most new immigrants from most federal public assistance programs for five years, so it is misleading to suggest that all immigrants can now \"immediately go and collect welfare.\"", "Understate": "The claim understates the exceptions to the current law regarding welfare eligibility for new immigrants. The expert's verdict mentions that there are exceptions for children and pregnant women, and the proposed bill would tighten eligibility requirements but many new immigrants would still remain eligible for public assistance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the assertion that the RAISE Act prevents new immigrants from collecting welfare. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the current law already restricts access to welfare for new immigrants, and the proposed bill would make minimal changes in this regard.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the RAISE Act completely prevents new immigrants from collecting welfare, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict clarifies that the bill would make some changes to eligibility requirements but would not entirely prevent new immigrants from accessing public assistance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for the impact of the RAISE Act on welfare access for new immigrants. The expert's verdict, however, highlights that the bill aims to reduce the number of immigrants based on family ties and emphasizes a \"merit-based\" immigration system, but its impact on welfare access is limited."}
