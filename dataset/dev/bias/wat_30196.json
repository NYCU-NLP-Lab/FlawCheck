{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of states with less than 200 cases of COVID-19. The expert's verdict states that only 17 states, not 19, had fewer than 200 cases as of March 26.", "Understate": "The claim understates the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States by focusing on the 19 states with low case numbers, while ignoring the overall high number of cases and deaths in the country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that 19 states have persistently low levels of cases.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the low number of cases in the 19 states is representative of the entire country, without considering the population size or the potential for the virus to spread rapidly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the low number of cases in the 19 states, such as limited testing availability or underreporting of cases."}
