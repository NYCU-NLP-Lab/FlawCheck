{"Understate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Hillary Clinton's involvement in smashing her mobile phone with a hammer during the FBI investigation. The expert's verdict clarifies that it was one of her aides who disposed of her unwanted mobile devices in that manner, not Clinton herself.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton used a hammer to smash her mobile phone. The expert's verdict provides information from FBI documents and statements from Clinton's aides, but there is no direct evidence or confirmation of Clinton personally using a hammer.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of a hammer to destroy mobile devices during an FBI investigation is suspicious or indicative of wrongdoing. However, the expert's verdict explains that the use of a hammer was mentioned in a 47-page document and was picked up by Donald Trump and the media for sensationalism, but it does not necessarily imply any criminal activity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the mobile devices were destroyed. The expert's verdict mentions that the devices were disposed of by breaking or hammering them, but it does not provide further context or reasons for this action.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Hillary Clinton did not personally destroy her phone with a hammer, as clarified by the expert's verdict. This bias arises from the claim's assertion that Clinton herself used the hammer.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a simplified and misleading version of the events surrounding the destruction of the mobile devices. The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced and detailed explanation, highlighting the complexities and context of the situation.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the hammer incident by framing it as a deliberate act to obstruct justice. The expert's verdict explains that the hammering of the devices was mentioned in a larger investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server, and it does not indicate intentional misconduct."}
