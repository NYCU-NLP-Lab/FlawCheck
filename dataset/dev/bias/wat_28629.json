{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of money being spent on lobbying expenses per congressman. While the expert's analysis shows that the finance sector spent over $1 million per member of the House, it does not specify how much of that money was specifically spent on lobbying expenses for financial reform.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating any facts or figures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the claim that there is a million dollars being spent per congressman on lobbying expenses for financial reform.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount of money being spent on lobbying expenses is a significant factor in the prospects for financial reform. However, it does not take into account other factors such as public opinion, political dynamics, or the actual content of the proposed reforms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the influence of lobbyists on financial reform that are not addressed in the claim, such as the role of campaign contributions or the power of industry associations."}
