{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the video surveillance footage by suggesting that it shows poll workers using suitcases to hide ballots from Republican observers. The actual footage and its interpretation may not support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that poll workers were using suitcases to hide ballots. The evidence presented in the expert's verdict suggests that the footage was part of a wider effort to delegitimize Biden's win, but it does not provide concrete proof of the specific claim made.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actions shown in the surveillance footage were illegal or improper. However, without more context or evidence, it is difficult to determine the true nature of the actions captured in the footage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the actions shown in the surveillance footage. Without further investigation or additional evidence, it is possible that the actions were not intended to hide ballots but had a different purpose.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its presentation of the evidence or the interpretation of the surveillance footage. The expert's verdict suggests that the Trump attorneys used the footage as part of a wider effort to delegitimize Biden's win, which raises questions about the credibility and reliability of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that a Trump-requested ballot recount in Atlanta's Fulton County concluded with Biden being certified as the clear winner. This suggests that the claim's implication of widespread voter fraud or manipulation may be unfounded.", "Understate": "There is no indication of any bias of understating in the claim."}
