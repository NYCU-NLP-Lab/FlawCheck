{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the incident by stating that Priyanka Gandhi was \"totally sloshed\" after 4 shots of vodka and hitting her own party worker. This is not supported by any evidence or factual information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Priyanka Gandhi hit a Congress party worker. The only information provided is a video of her being escorted by a group of people and saying \"hato\" (move).", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of Priyanka Gandhi being escorted and saying \"hato\" is evidence of her hitting a party worker. However, there is no clear connection or evidence provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation provided by Alt News and other reports suggests that the incident took place during a protest march where Priyanka Gandhi lost her cool due to being pushed around by the crowd. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that she hit a party worker.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no Congress representative named Rubina Malik exists, as confirmed by a Google search.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on social media posts and messages without verifying the authenticity or credibility of the sources.", "Understate": "The claim understates the context of the incident by not mentioning the heckling and crowd disturbance that Priyanka Gandhi faced during the protest march. This context is important in understanding her reaction and behavior."}
