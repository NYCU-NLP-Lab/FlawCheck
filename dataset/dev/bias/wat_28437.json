{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Charlie Crist implemented Jeb Bush's A+ Plan is supported by evidence from Crist's campaign spokesman and his role as education commissioner, but more specific details or evidence could be provided to further support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that implementing Jeb Bush's A+ Plan is a positive accomplishment, without considering any potential drawbacks or criticisms of the plan.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The article mentions speculation that the Progressive Choice Florida group may be a GOP front funded to draw Democratic voters away from Crist, suggesting that their attack on Crist's implementation of Jeb Bush's plan could be politically motivated and not based on objective analysis."}
