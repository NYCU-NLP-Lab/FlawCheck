{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the invasion of \"sea lice\" on Florida beaches by using the term \"invaded.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the term \"sea lice\" is not widespread, especially among social media users residing in the northern states, which may not be accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to show the extent of the invasion or the impact on beach-goers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that the term \"sea lice\" has been used since at least the 1950s and that it refers to small parasites that affect fish, which provides an alternative explanation to the invasion narrative."}
