The term \"nonessential\" is used to describe activities, not employees.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that shifting the salaries of nonessential employees to state education budgets would be a better use of funds. This assumption is not supported by evidence or analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the use of the term \"nonessential\" during the 2013 shutdown. It was used to describe activities, not employees, and the terms for employees themselves are \"exempt/nonexempt\" or \"excepted/nonexcepted.\""}
