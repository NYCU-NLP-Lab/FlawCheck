{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Sen. Luther Olsen supported the sale of state-owned power plants to the biggest donors with no oversight. The expert's verdict mentions that Olsen voted to approve an amended version of Walker's budget, which included the no-bid sale language, but it does not provide further evidence or details about the extent of Olsen's support.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as the expert's verdict only mentions Olsen's vote on the amended version of Walker's budget, without providing additional evidence or context to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Sen. Luther Olsen supported the sale of state-owned power plants to the biggest donors with no oversight, without providing concrete evidence or examples to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations for Olsen's support of the sale of state-owned power plants, such as potential benefits or justifications for the decision."}
