{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that defense spending has declined by 21 percent since 2010, and even discounting the drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan, it has still declined by 12 percent. This may be an exaggeration of the actual decline in defense spending.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rubio's office did not confirm the source of his statistic, but it is assumed to have come from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments' analysis. Without further confirmation or evidence, the claim may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a decline in defense spending is dangerous without providing further context or evidence to support this assumption. It may be a problematic assumption to automatically equate a decline in defense spending with danger.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions the Budget Control Act caps and sequestration as factors that have imposed spending cuts on defense. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the decline in defense spending, such as budgetary constraints imposed by legislation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by discounting the drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan when assessing the decline in defense spending. This may be seen as a flaw in the argument, as these drawdowns could have a significant impact on the overall decline.", "Contradict fact": "Without further evidence or confirmation, it is unclear whether the claim contradicts any specific facts. However, the lack of support for the claim's statistic raises questions about its accuracy."}
