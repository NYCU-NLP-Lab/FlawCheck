{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Gov. Cuomo ordered \"thousands\" of COVID-19 patients to be sent to nursing homes, while the USNS Comfort remained \"empty and unused.\" The reality is more nuanced, with both the nursing home directive and the underutilization of the USNS Comfort being influenced by various factors.", "Understate": "The claim understates the utilization of the USNS Comfort by stating that it was \"empty and unused.\" In fact, the ship treated 179 patients during its three-week deployment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the assertion that Gov. Cuomo ordered thousands of COVID-19 patients to be sent to nursing homes. The expert's verdict clarifies that recovering COVID-19 patients were discharged from hospitals and sent to nursing homes based on a directive from the New York state health department.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the underutilization of the USNS Comfort can be solely attributed to Gov. Cuomo. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the underutilization was due to a combination of bureaucratic and military restrictions, as well as the use of the Javits Center as a temporary hospital.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the underutilization of the USNS Comfort, including bureaucratic and military restrictions, as well as the use of the Javits Center as a temporary hospital. This suggests that there are alternative factors to consider beyond Gov. Cuomo's actions."}
