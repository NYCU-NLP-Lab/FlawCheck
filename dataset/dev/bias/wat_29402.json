{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump supporters were blocking access to polling sites in Clifton City Hall in New Jersey.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or complaint received by the Passaic County Clerk's office or the Clifton Police Department regarding Trump supporters blocking access to polling sites.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo shared on social media depicting a man holding a pro-Trump flag near a drop-off ballot box outside of Clifton City Hall is evidence of Trump supporters blocking access to polling sites, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Trump supporters blocking access to polling sites is a Class A Felony, which is not supported by evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by incorrectly stating that Trump supporters were blocking access to polling sites on Election Day, when in fact the photo was taken two days earlier.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by Lt. Robert Bracken, who stated that the man in the photo was not harassing or intimidating voters, but rather engaged in a brief suspicious act."}
