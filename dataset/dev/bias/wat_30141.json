{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential broadness of the law regarding talking about a John Doe investigation, as there are instances where others have disclosed details of ongoing probes in the press and public court filings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove the assertion that \"anyone who knows anything about a John Doe can't talk about it.\" It is unclear if this is a broad interpretation of the law or if there are specific restrictions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the law prohibits anyone with knowledge of a John Doe investigation from talking about it, without providing evidence or clarification on the exact limitations or exceptions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why Governor Scott Walker has chosen not to comment on the John Doe investigation, such as political strategy or legal advice, rather than solely attributing it to the law itself."}
