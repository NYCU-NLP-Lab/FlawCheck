{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that shutting down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor would require adding seven new lanes to I-95.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that shutting down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor would result in all rail passengers switching to cars and using I-95, which may not be a realistic assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of shutting down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor by suggesting that seven new lanes would be needed on I-95 to accommodate the increased traffic.", "Falters at times": "The claim may have some inconsistencies or inaccuracies in its estimation of the impact on traffic if Amtrak's Northeast Corridor is shut down.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative transportation options or solutions to accommodate the potential increase in traffic if Amtrak's Northeast Corridor is shut down, which the claim does not consider."}
