{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Jeb Bush on in-state tuition increases by stating that he \"oversaw\" an average increase of 48.2 percent during his tenure, implying that he had direct control over the tuition rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Jeb Bush was solely responsible for the tuition increases.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tuition increases are solely the result of Jeb Bush's actions, without considering other factors or external influences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the tuition increases, such as changes in state funding for education or economic factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the governor does not have direct control over setting tuition rates in Florida, as it is determined by the Legislature."}
