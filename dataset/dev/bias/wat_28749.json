{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the prevalence of transgender individuals by stating that they make up \"about 1-in-300 people.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that the actual estimate is lower, with the Williams Institute estimating that 0.6 percent of U.S. adults identify as transgender.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that transgender residents make up \"about 1-in-300 people.\" The expert's verdict highlights that the estimate is based on a report from the Williams Institute, but it does not provide a direct link or reference to the specific report.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the prevalence of transgender individuals can be accurately determined based on the estimate from the Williams Institute. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the U.S. Census Bureau has not estimated the number of Americans identifying as transgender, indicating that there may be limitations or uncertainties in the estimate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not mention any alternative explanations for the prevalence of transgender individuals. However, it does provide alternative estimates from the Williams Institute's previous research, which estimated that 0.3 percent of U.S. adults identified as transgender based on surveys taken in Massachusetts and California.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not necessarily contradict any specific facts, as it is based on an estimate from the Williams Institute. However, the expert's verdict presents alternative estimates and highlights the limitations of the data, suggesting that the claim may not be entirely accurate or reliable."}
