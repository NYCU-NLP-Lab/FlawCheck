{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the decrease in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations over the past 50 years. While it is true that the claim states corporations have gone from paying 5 percent to 2 percent, it does not provide specific years or sources for these percentages, which may lead to an exaggeration of the decrease.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific years or sources to support the percentages mentioned. Without this additional information, it is difficult to fully evaluate the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that giving more tax cuts to corporations is wrong, without providing further explanation or evidence to support this assumption. This assumption may be seen as problematic by those who believe in the benefits of corporate tax cuts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the decrease in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations. It does not consider other factors that may have contributed to this change, such as changes in tax laws or economic conditions.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of the tax bill signed by President Donald Trump in December, which significantly reduced the corporate tax rate. The claim does not mention this reduction in the corporate tax rate, which could have influenced the decrease in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations."}
