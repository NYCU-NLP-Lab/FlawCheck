{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of Americans who have said \"either don't do anything or start over\" on health care reform. The expert's verdict mentions that the closest poll result they found was 69 percent, which is not far from 75 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the stated percentage. The expert's verdict mentions that they couldn't find the exact poll mentioned by the claim and the closest poll result they found was 69 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the American people's opinion on health care reform can be accurately represented by a single poll result. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there are multiple polls with differing results, indicating that the public's opinion may not be as clear-cut as the claim suggests.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents the poll result as evidence that the American people do not want the current health care reform proposals. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there are other polls showing a narrow majority opposing the current plans, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the public's stance on health care reform."}
