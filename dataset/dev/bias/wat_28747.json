{"Understates": "The claim may understate the number of people who attended Kamala Harris's rally in Orlando, Florida by stating that only six people attended. The evidence provided suggests that there were more people present, including cars at the drive-in event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single video that shows only a small portion of the rally. There is additional evidence suggesting that there were more people present, such as tweets from a local reporter and videos posted on Harris's official YouTube page.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the number of people visible in the video represents the total attendance at the rally. However, it fails to consider the possibility that there may have been more people present who are not visible in the footage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the low number of visible attendees, such as the rally being a drive-in event where supporters were asked to stay in their cars to limit the spread of COVID-19.", "Contradicts fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the rally was a drive-in event, as stated in the evidence provided. It fails to acknowledge the unique circumstances of the event and the precautions taken due to the pandemic.", "Exaggerates": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the low number of visible attendees by not providing a broader context of the event and the restrictions in place.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not considering all the available evidence and providing a comprehensive analysis of the rally attendance. It relies heavily on a single video and does not take into account other sources of information."}
