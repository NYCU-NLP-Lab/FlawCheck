{"Exaggeration": "The claim may be exaggerating the level of support for reinstating a federal ban on assault weapons by stating that \"no poll done this year... shows less than a majority\" in favor of the ban. This implies that every single poll conducted this year has shown majority support, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data from the polls to support the statement that \"no poll done this year... shows less than a majority\" in favor of the ban. It lacks enough support to validate the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the level of support for reinstating a federal ban on assault weapons is the same in all polls conducted this year. It does not take into account the potential variations in survey methodology, sample size, or respondent demographics, which can influence the results and make the assumption problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge the possibility of alternative explanations for the poll results. It assumes that the only reason for not finding less than a majority in favor of the ban is due to the mobilization of gun owners and the NRA. However, there could be other factors influencing the poll results, such as the wording of the survey questions or the context in which they were asked."}
