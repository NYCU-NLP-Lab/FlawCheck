{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Joe Biden's statement by stating that he said, \"They don't do this\" very clearly, implying that he completely ruled out FBI involvement in investigating allegations of sexual misconduct.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the FBI has conducted background investigations on Supreme Court nominees in the past, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim understates the level of detail provided by Ford in her allegations, suggesting that the FBI had nothing to investigate because they didn't know any details, which is not true.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because the FBI didn't know specific details, there was nothing to investigate, overlooking the possibility of conducting a broader investigation to gather more information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that investigating allegations of sexual misconduct by a Supreme Court nominee is \"not for the FBI.\" It relies solely on Joe Biden's statement without providing additional evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for why the FBI could investigate, such as conducting a broader background investigation or gathering additional information from witnesses."}
