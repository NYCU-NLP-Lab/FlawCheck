{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the protest by stating that it shows the reaction to the UAE-Israel peace deal, when in fact it is footage from a protest in 2018.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up its assertion that the video shows a protest over the UAE-Israel peace deal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is related to the UAE-Israel peace deal without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the video is not related to the UAE-Israel peace deal, but rather a protest against Donald Trump's visit to the UK in 2018."}
