{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the depreciation of the rupee-dollar exchange rate by stating that it has only slipped by one rupee since 2014. The actual exchange rate has reached an all-time low of Rs.69.0925 to the dollar on June 28, 2018.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its statement. It only provides two data points for the exchange rate in 2014 and 2018, without considering the fluctuations in between.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the exchange rate of the rupee against the dollar was 68 in 2014, which is not accurate. The actual exchange rate on May 17, 2014, was 58.57.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the rupee-dollar exchange rate has reached an all-time low on June 28, 2018, at Rs.69.0925 to the dollar."}
