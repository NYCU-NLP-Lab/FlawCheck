{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the belief that chanting \"Bloody Mary!\" thirteen times in front of a candlelit mirror will summon a vengeful spirit. The expert's verdict mentions that belief in summoning the mirror-witch was widespread, but it does not provide concrete evidence or support for the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on anecdotes and personal experiences rather than scientific evidence or research.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that chanting \"Bloody Mary!\" will actually summon a vengeful spirit, without providing any logical or factual reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the experiences people have had while performing the ritual. It presents the belief in summoning Bloody Mary as a fact, without exploring other possible psychological or perceptual factors that could contribute to the reported experiences.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts scientific facts and rational explanations by suggesting that chanting a specific phrase in front of a mirror can summon a supernatural entity. The expert's verdict does not provide any scientific evidence to support the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on personal anecdotes and stories rather than verifiable evidence or research.", "Other biases": "None of the other biases listed apply to the claim or the expert's verdict."}
