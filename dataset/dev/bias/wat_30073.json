{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent and nature of the \"robocalls\" by suggesting that they are made by a group supporting President Donald Trump, when in fact they were prank calls made by a private company.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the existence of a group supporting President Donald Trump making threatening \"robocalls.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the alleged \"robocalls\" are politically motivated and linked to a specific group supporting President Donald Trump, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the calls, stating that they were prank calls made by a private company, rather than being politically motivated."}
