{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the claim that Daniel Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home. It only mentions Webster's involvement with the Institute in Basic Life Principles and his statement about the group's influence on his life.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Webster's involvement with the Institute in Basic Life Principles automatically makes him an advocate for the group's teachings on mothers working outside the home. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any direct evidence or statements from Webster himself confirming this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not explore alternative explanations for Webster's involvement with the Institute in Basic Life Principles. It does not consider the possibility that Webster may have other reasons for his association with the group, such as shared values or personal connections, rather than specifically advocating against mothers working outside the home."}
