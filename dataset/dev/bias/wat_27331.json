{"Contradict fact": "There is a contradiction between the claim that Hillary Clinton once \"wanted a wall\" on the Mexican border and her statement that her party \"builds bridges not walls.\"", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Hillary Clinton's support for a barrier along the border, as she voted in favor of a bill that authorized 700 miles of fencing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton once \"wanted a wall\" on the Mexican border.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting a barrier along the border is equivalent to supporting a wall like the one proposed by Donald Trump, without considering potential differences in design or intent.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Hillary Clinton's support for the 2006 bill, such as the larger context of comprehensive immigration reform."}
