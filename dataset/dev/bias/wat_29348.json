{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that 5.7 million illegal immigrants might have voted in the 2008 election. The original study that the claim is based on was widely discredited and had a small sample size of only 38 survey responses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the original study's findings are accurate and reliable, despite the controversy and criticism surrounding it. It also assumes that the number of illegal immigrants who voted in the 2008 election could be as high as 5.7 million, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its presentation by referencing a tweet and a web article instead of providing direct and verifiable sources. This raises questions about the credibility and reliability of the information presented.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the original study it is based on has been widely discredited and disputed by multiple sources. The expert's verdict highlights the flaws and limitations of the study, indicating that the claim contradicts the available evidence.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the potential number of illegal immigrants who voted in the 2008 election by suggesting it could be as high as 5.7 million without sufficient evidence to support such a claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation bias in the claim."}
