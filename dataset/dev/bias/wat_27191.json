This is not supported by factual evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or reliable sources to support the statement about Kevin Hart's injuries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Facebook post sharing Hart's injuries is accurate and reliable, without questioning its credibility or verifying the information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, which suggests that the Facebook post originated from a website known for making up fake stories about celebrities. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
