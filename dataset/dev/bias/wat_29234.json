{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the restrictions and differences between unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals. It states that unvaccinated people will face a three-month lockdown and be restricted from travel, voting, and commerce, while vaccinated people will have more freedoms. However, the expert's verdict states that there are no restrictions based on vaccination status and that the information on the flyer is false.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to validate the existence of a \"National Mask Code\" and the specific color-coded mask requirements for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. The expert's verdict states that the flyer is false and that there are no requirements or restrictions based on vaccination status.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes the existence of a \"National Mask Code\" and presents it as a factual statement. However, the expert's verdict states that the information on the flyer is false and that there are no such requirements or restrictions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are no restrictions based on vaccination status, as confirmed by the expert's verdict and the official response from the Utah Department of Health.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
