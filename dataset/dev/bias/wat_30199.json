{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Muslims are taking an oath against Hindus based on a video of Rahul Gandhi offering namaz with Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad. The video does not provide evidence of any oath or anti-Hindu sentiment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the act of offering namaz or visiting a dargah automatically implies being against Hindus or promoting a Muslim kingdom in India. This assumption is not supported by any concrete evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Muslims are taking an oath against Hindus. The video and accompanying messages do not provide any evidence or context to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the video, stating that it shows Rahul Gandhi paying tribute at Ambedkarnagar\u2019s Kichhocha Sharif Dargah. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim made in the video.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video actually shows Rahul Gandhi paying tribute at a dargah, rather than Muslims taking an oath against Hindus.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in this claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times bias in this claim."}
