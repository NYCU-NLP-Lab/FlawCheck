{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the dosage of radiation in 5G compared to 3G by stating that it is 10,000 times higher. This is not supported by sufficient evidence or data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific reports or sources to support the statement that 5G radiation dosage is 10,000 times higher than 3G. It lacks sufficient evidence to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that higher dosage of radiation in 5G is inherently harmful to people who are electrosensitive, without providing evidence or considering alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for any potential differences in radiation dosage between 5G and 3G. It assumes that the difference is solely due to the technology itself, without considering other factors that may contribute to variations in radiation exposure."}
