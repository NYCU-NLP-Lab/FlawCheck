{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a tweet by Don Winslow, which was later deleted, and does not provide any concrete evidence of Ron Johnson's absence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ron Johnson did not show up for a day of impeachment hearings based on a tweet, without considering alternative explanations or verifying the accuracy of the information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that senators were allowed to watch the proceedings from other locations, such as the upstairs gallery or adjacent rooms, which suggests that Johnson's absence from the Senate Chamber does not necessarily mean he was not present during the hearings.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict provides photo and video proof that Ron Johnson was present at the impeachment hearings on both days, contradicting the claim that he did not show up.", "Understate": "The claim understates Ron Johnson's attendance by falsely stating that he did not show up for a day of impeachment hearings, when evidence shows that he was present on both days.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on a deleted tweet and not considering the possibility of alternative explanations for Johnson's absence from the Senate Chamber.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
