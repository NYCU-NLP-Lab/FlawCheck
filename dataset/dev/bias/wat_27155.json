{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the fact that abortions have not gone down during the presidency of a president opposed to abortion over the last eight years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that legal abortions have actually fallen since the start of the 21st century, as supported by statistics from reputable sources.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it fails to provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that abortions have not decreased.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sole responsibility for the decrease in abortions lies with the president's stance on abortion, without considering other factors that may contribute to the decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the decrease in abortions may be influenced by various factors other than the president's opposition to abortion."}
