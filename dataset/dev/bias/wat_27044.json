{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Michael Bennet \"chose the insiders over our generals\" in the battle against ISIS. This implies that Bennet intentionally prioritized insiders over the military, which may not be accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Bennet chose insiders over generals in the fight against ISIS. The evidence provided by Restoration PAC mainly criticizes President Obama's decision to withdraw troops from Iraq, but does not directly link Bennet's actions to this decision.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that choosing \"insiders\" over generals is inherently detrimental to national security. This assumption may not be universally accepted and can be subjective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, as Democrats often blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS due to the aftermath of the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein. This suggests that Bennet's actions may have been influenced by previous decisions and circumstances."}
