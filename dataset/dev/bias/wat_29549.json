{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"22 veterans take their own lives each day\" is an exaggeration as the more recent research from the VA suggests an average of about 20 veteran suicides per day.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual number of veteran suicides per day, as the more recent research shows an average of about 20 veteran suicides per day, which is close to the 22 suicides per day cited by Harris.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a widely-cited figure from a 2012 Suicide Data Report that examined veterans deaths in only 21 states and cautioned against interpreting the estimated number of veterans with caution due to the use of data from a sample of states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the figure of 22 veteran suicides per day is accurate and representative of the entire veteran population, even though the more recent research from the VA suggests an average of about 20 veteran suicides per day.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation provided by the more recent research from the VA, which found an average of about 20 veteran suicides per day based on records from every state."}
