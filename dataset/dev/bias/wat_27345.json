{"Understate": "The claim may understate the legal clout of ICE detainers by implying that they are not valid warrants.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that ICE detainer requests are not valid warrants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by Miller about ICE detainer requests is inaccurate without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by Joseph Kyzer, a spokesman for Moore, who stated that Moore was referring to Miller's decision to not comply with ICE rather than Miller's statement about ICE detainers. This alternative explanation suggests that there may be a different interpretation of the claim."}
