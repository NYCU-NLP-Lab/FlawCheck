{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Trump administration cut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's anti-pandemic work in over 40 countries to just 10. The CDC confirmed that this is not true.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of programs closed by President Trump. It states that he closed 37 programs, while the CDC's statement indicates that the hypothetical cuts were avoided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on outdated news reports from early 2018 and does not provide sufficient evidence to support the assertion that President Obama set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 countries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the closure of some programs by President Trump was a result of ignoring expert advice, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the closure of some programs may have been due to funding constraints and the need to prioritize resources."}
