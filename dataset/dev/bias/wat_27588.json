{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the video has circulated online since at least November 2015 contradicts the expert's finding that it was published on Facebook on May 11, 2020.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the video has been circulating since 2015.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video has been circulating online for a long period without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the video was published on Facebook in 2020 and was also found on a YouTube channel in 2015, suggesting that it may have been previously available but not widely circulated until recently."}
