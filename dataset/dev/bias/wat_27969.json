{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that the individual is the sole reason for not having to pay a toll on the bridge at MoPac and William Cannon.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the individual is solely responsible for the absence of tolls on the bridge.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of tolls on the bridge is solely due to the actions of the individual, without considering other factors or individuals involved in the decision-making process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why tolls are not in place on the bridge, such as financial constraints faced by the Texas Department of Transportation or other political factors."}
