{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which white people think that black people are less intelligent, less trustworthy, and less patriotic. The expert's verdict states that while there is a group of white people who hold negative views of blacks, it is not a majority.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that polls accurately indicate the beliefs of white people about black people. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the results of polls can vary and may not represent the views of the entire white population.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence from the polls to support the assertion that white people think black people are less intelligent, less trustworthy, and less patriotic. The expert's verdict references a 2012 survey, but it does not provide detailed information about the sample size or methodology.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that while there may be a group of white people who hold negative views of blacks, it does not mean that the majority of white people think that way. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that \"white people\" as a whole think negatively of black people."}
