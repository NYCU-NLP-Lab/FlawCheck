{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the comparison between the amount spent on the Cash for Clunkers program and the space program.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to back up the statement that the Obama administration spent more money on the Cash for Clunkers program than the space program.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the comparison is between the entire NASA budget and the Cash for Clunkers program, without considering specific programs within NASA.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the comparison made by Rubio is specifically referring to the Constellation program within NASA, rather than the entire space program."}
