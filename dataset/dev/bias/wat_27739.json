{"Exaggerate": "The claim by Tony Evers that he is the first Democrat to ever lead Scott Walker in an election year may be an exaggeration as it is not supported by independent polling or concrete evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as Evers' campaign team did not provide any independent polling data to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that leading in the polls among Democratic candidates automatically translates to leading against Scott Walker in the general election, which may not be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The Marquette University Law School poll shows that as of June, Walker led Evers by a margin of 4 percent, suggesting an alternative explanation to Evers' claim of leading Walker in an election year.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Scott Walker has previously faced challenges by Democrats Tom Barrett in 2012 and Mary Burke in 2014, indicating that Evers may not be the first Democrat to lead Walker in an election year.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information."}
