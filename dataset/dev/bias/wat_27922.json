{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the statement that 55 percent of provisional ballots in Florida did not count. It only mentions a statement made by Senator Bill Nelson without further verification or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for the high percentage of provisional ballots not counting is solely due to the proposed changes in election law. It does not consider other factors or potential reasons for the discounting of provisional ballots.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for why provisional ballots may not have counted, such as voter error or incomplete information on the ballots.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the percentage of provisional ballots not counted varied significantly between different counties in Florida, as reported by the Pew Center on the States. The claim does not acknowledge this variation and presents a generalized percentage without considering the differences.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and potential reasons for the discounting of provisional ballots by attributing it solely to the proposed changes in election law."}
