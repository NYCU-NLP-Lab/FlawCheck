{"Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of cell replacement in the human body by suggesting that every cell is replaced every seven years, which is not entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that every cell in the human body is replaced every seven years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations and evidence that contradict the claim, indicating that different cells in the human body have different lifespans and rates of regeneration.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by oversimplifying the process of cell replacement and failing to acknowledge the variations in lifespan and regeneration among different types of cells.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all cells in the human body have a uniform lifespan and regeneration rate, which is not supported by scientific research.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that some cells in the human body, such as those in the lining of the stomach or certain parts of the eye, do not regenerate or have much longer lifespans.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the notion that every cell in the human body is replaced every seven years, disregarding the fact that some cells can last a lifetime without being replaced."}
