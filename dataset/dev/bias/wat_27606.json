{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people in prison in the United States by stating that it is more than Russia, China, and North Korea combined. The expert's verdict confirms that the claim is not entirely accurate, as the wrong countries were used in the statistic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that the United States has more people in prison than Russia, China, and North Korea combined. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was not caught by one of the readers, indicating a lack of thorough fact-checking.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having a large number of people in prison is inherently negative without providing further context or analysis. It suggests that the \"colossal net\" cast over many non-violent individuals is unwarranted, but does not provide evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accuracy, as the wrong countries were initially used in the statistic. This suggests a lack of attention to detail or fact-checking.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high number of people in prison in the United States. It does not explore factors such as crime rates, legal systems, or social policies that may contribute to the incarceration rate.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate the number of people in prison in the United States. Instead, it exaggerates the number by comparing it to the combined prison populations of Russia, China, and North Korea.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the wrong countries were initially used in the statistic. However, the expert's verdict confirms that the overall point that there are more people locked up in the United States than in other countries still holds true."}
