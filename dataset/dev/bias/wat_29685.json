{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the person being considered for a top science job by President Trump called scientists \"dumb regular people that think dinosaurs existed.\" This statement has been found to be fake and is not supported by any evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a fake news site, USPOLN.com, which is known for deliberately posting false or fake stories. The site includes a disclaimer stating that its articles should be considered satirical and may include unreliable information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person being considered for the science job, Sam Clovis, lacks a science background and questions the legitimacy of climate change. While it is true that Clovis lacks a science degree, it is not clear if he questions the legitimacy of climate change.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the quotes attributed to Sam Clovis calling scientists \"dumb regular people\" are fake. Multiple sources have confirmed that these quotes are not genuine.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the claim is a deliberate attempt to spread misinformation about Sam Clovis and his qualifications for the science job."}
