{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that Jared Kushner registered to vote as a woman in New York. The information provided is based on a data entry issue and ambiguous registration in New Jersey, but there is no concrete evidence of Kushner intentionally registering as a woman.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the registration as a woman was intentional or indicative of wrongdoing on Kushner's part. However, the evidence suggests it was a mix-up or error in the voter registration system.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the gender discrepancy, such as a technical error or data entry mistake.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information from different sources. It is unclear whether the blame lies with Kushner or the New York City Board of Elections.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Kushner's 2011 New York City voter registration form clearly shows he checked off the box marked \"male.\" This contradicts the earlier claim that he registered as a woman.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the mix-up, as it could potentially have implications for voter impersonation or fraudulent voting. However, without further evidence, it is hard to determine the extent of the issue.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any information or make exaggerated claims."}
