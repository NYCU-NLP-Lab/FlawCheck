{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Richard Nixon released his tax returns to the public when he was running for president, which is not entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the statement that Nixon released his tax returns while running for president.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Nixon released his tax returns as president, he must have also released them while running for president, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that Nixon only released a brief summary of his financial affairs during his 1968 campaign, which does not qualify as releasing his tax returns."}
