The company behind the bracelet has been struck off the registry of commerce and companies, and there are no recent videos or active social media accounts related to the product.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video showing the bracelet is a real-life depiction of the product, when in fact it is a concept video featuring mock-up images.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the bracelet is not available for sale and the company behind it has been deregistered.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the videos and claims surrounding the bracelet, such as tutorials on how to create similar visual effects and videos from consumers who claim they tried to buy the product but it never arrived."}
