{"Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and limitations of Florida's laws on driverless cars. While it is true that Florida does not require a permit to operate or test a driverless car, the expert's verdict suggests that this does not necessarily mean that driverless cars are readily available for public use in Florida.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the assertion that \"we in Florida welcome driverless cars.\" The expert's verdict mentions that while Florida does not require a permit, it does not mean that driverless cars are widely accessible or readily embraced by the public.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of a permit requirement in Florida indicates a welcoming attitude towards driverless cars. However, the expert's verdict suggests that this assumption may not be entirely accurate, as there are still limitations and challenges surrounding the use of driverless cars in Florida.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the differences in driverless car regulations between California and Florida. The expert's verdict highlights that each state has its own set of laws and regulations, and the absence of a permit requirement in Florida does not necessarily mean that the state is more welcoming towards driverless cars compared to California."}
