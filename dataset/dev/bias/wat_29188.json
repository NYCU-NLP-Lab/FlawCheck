{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of flu vaccine deaths in South Korea by stating that there were \"a hundred 'flu vaccine deaths'\" when the actual number is 97 deaths unrelated to the flu vaccine.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the flu vaccine is the main cause of death in South Korea. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KCDA) states that there is no evidence of causality between the vaccine and the deaths.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the flu vaccine is responsible for the deaths without providing concrete evidence or considering alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the deaths other than the flu vaccine. The KCDA is still investigating four deaths, indicating that there may be other factors involved.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence that thimerosal, an ingredient in flu vaccines, causes harm. The claim asserts that thimerosal is a dangerous ingredient, despite evidence to the contrary.", "Understate": "The claim understates the safety and effectiveness of flu vaccines by suggesting that they are causing a significant number of deaths without sufficient evidence. The CDC maintains that flu vaccines are safe and subject to rigorous safety standards and oversight.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in presenting a coherent argument by relying on unsupported claims and contradictory information. It fails to provide a consistent and reliable perspective on the issue."}
