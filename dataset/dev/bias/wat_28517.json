{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Sen. John McCain's vote by stating that it \"stopped attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act for FY `17.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the bill was returned to the Senate calendar, indicating that the repeal attempts were not completely halted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that McCain's vote single-handedly stopped the repeal attempts. The expert's verdict provides additional information and context to show that the claim is incorrect.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that McCain's vote was a calculated move to prevent future repeal attempts and force Republicans to work with Democrats to create a better healthcare bill. This assumption is not supported by concrete evidence and is subjective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for McCain's vote and the consequences of it. The claim presents a single perspective without considering other factors or motivations behind the vote."}
