{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration as it presents a statement made by Rahul Gandhi about unemployment among eagles, which is not directly supported by the provided evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a video clip with a partial statement made by Rahul Gandhi, without providing the complete context or speech.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rahul Gandhi is blaming PM Modi for the lack of employment among eagles based on the provided video clip, but it does not provide enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Rahul Gandhi's statement, such as using eagles as a metaphor or analogy to highlight a point about economic disparity, which is not addressed in the claim."}
