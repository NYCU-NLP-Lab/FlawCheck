{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to prove that Bhagat Singh's sister Prakash Kaur died in March 2021. The only evidence provided is a caption on a Facebook post, which is not sufficient to confirm the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that no politicians expressed condolences for Prakash Kaur's death, but this assumption is not supported by any evidence. It is possible that politicians did express condolences, but the claim does not provide any information about their response.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Prakash Kaur actually passed away in September 2014, as reported by various reputable sources. The claim's assertion of her death in March 2021 is clearly false.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Prakash Kaur's death by suggesting that it went unnoticed by politicians. However, there is evidence that politicians, including Capt. Amarinder Singh, expressed their condolences at the time of her actual death in 2014.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by providing false information about Prakash Kaur's death, which occurred in 2014 and not in March 2021 as claimed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation bias present in this claim as the alternative explanation (Prakash Kaur's death in 2014) is supported by multiple sources."}
