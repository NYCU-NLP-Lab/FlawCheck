{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Wisconsin is on pace to double the number of layoffs may be an exaggeration because the actual number of layoffs has not yet reached double the number from the previous year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on the data from the state Department of Workforce Development, which may not accurately represent actual layoffs and job losses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of layoff warning notices accurately reflects the number of actual job losses, which may not always be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in layoff warning notices, such as changes in business ownership or other factors unrelated to the state's economy.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual number of layoffs if it does not include the layoffs announced by Oscar Mayer in early November."}
