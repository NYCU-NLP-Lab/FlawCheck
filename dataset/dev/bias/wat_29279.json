{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Barack Obama \"provided guns to Mexican drug cartels\" may be seen as an exaggeration because it implies a direct and intentional action by Obama himself.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on a statement made by Gov. Rick Perry without providing specific evidence or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Fast and Furious operation, which involved the botched federal gun trafficking investigation, was directly authorized or approved by Barack Obama himself.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have alternative explanations as it is related to the Fast and Furious operation, which involved multiple agencies and individuals, making it difficult to attribute sole responsibility to Obama."}
