{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the transportation package would impose the \"largest tax increase in Virginia's history\" may be an exaggeration because it does not provide enough evidence or comparison to previous tax increases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to prove that it is indeed the largest tax increase in Virginia's history.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the transportation package would result in the largest tax increase without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and definitive answer, as the expert's verdict indicates that it is difficult to determine whether it is the largest tax increase without further evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that former Gov. Mark Warner had the biggest tax increase in 2004, which was $1.4 billion, according to Jamie Radtke's response."}
