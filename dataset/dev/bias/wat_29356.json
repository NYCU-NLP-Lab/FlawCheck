{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Pam Bondi explicitly stated that she will side with corporate special interests as attorney general. This may be an exaggeration of her actual statements or intentions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or direct quotes to support the assertion that Pam Bondi made such a statement to a group of lobbyists.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that siding with corporate special interests is inherently negative without providing any further context or explanation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Pam Bondi's interactions with lobbyists or her stance on certain issues that are not considered in the claim."}
