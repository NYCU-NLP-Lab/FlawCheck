{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Romney touted the Massachusetts health plan for the nation in his hardcover book but then deleted it for the paperback edition. This could be seen as an exaggeration because it implies a significant change in Romney's stance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or quotes from the book to support the assertion that Romney deleted references to the Massachusetts health plan in the paperback edition.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any changes made between the hardcover and paperback editions of Romney's book were intentional and done to downplay his support of the Massachusetts health care plan. It does not consider the possibility of other reasons for the changes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for any changes made between the hardcover and paperback editions of Romney's book, such as editorial decisions or updates based on new information."}
