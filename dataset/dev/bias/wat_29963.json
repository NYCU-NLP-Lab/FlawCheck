{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of trade deficits on the economy by stating that they \"hurt the economy very badly.\" The expert's verdict suggests that there is little direct relationship between trade deficits and weak GDP growth.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by implying a direct causation between trade deficits and slow economic growth, which the expert's verdict disputes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that trade deficits significantly harmed the economy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the slow GDP growth in 2016 is solely attributable to trade deficits, which may be a problematic assumption according to the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that other factors, such as technological advances and global developments, can also have significant effects on economic performance, indicating the existence of alternative explanations for slow GDP growth."}
