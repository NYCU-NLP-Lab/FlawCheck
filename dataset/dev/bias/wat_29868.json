{"Understates": "The claim understates the fact that the Ukrainian Constitution guarantees the free development, use, and protection of Russian and other languages of national minorities in Ukraine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new Ukrainian government introduced a law abolishing the use of languages other than Ukrainian in official circumstances, without providing enough evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to prove that the new Ukrainian government actually introduced a law abolishing the use of languages other than Ukrainian in official circumstances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the request for Moscow's assistance in Crimea was prompted by the concern for protecting Russian citizens or ethnic Russians in Ukraine, rather than solely due to the alleged law on language use."}
