{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which Wisconsin is below the national average in wage growth and job growth. This bias is supported by the graphic shown on \"Meet the Press\" which indicates that Wisconsin's wage growth and job growth are both below the national average.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it only relies on the graphic shown on \"Meet the Press\" without providing additional evidence or data to back up the statement. This bias is supported by the fact that the claim is based solely on a graphic without further explanation or sources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Wisconsin's below-average wage growth and job growth that are not explored in the claim. This bias is supported by the statement from Walker's office, which suggests that most states had job growth during the same period that was at or below the national average.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Wisconsin's below-average wage growth and job growth could impact Walker's viability as a presidential contender. This bias is supported by the statement that Walker's economic record in Wisconsin could bear on his potential presidential campaign.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts or information.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the extent of Wisconsin's below-average wage growth and job growth.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at any point."}
