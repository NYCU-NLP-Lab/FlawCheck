It only mentions that an adviser to Ocasio-Cortez incorrectly stated that the document was doctored, without providing any evidence or further explanation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the FAQ document was not put out by Ocasio-Cortez's office, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of alternative explanations for the existence of the FAQ document, such as a mistake or miscommunication by Ocasio-Cortez's office.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the FAQ document was indeed released by Ocasio-Cortez's office, as acknowledged by her adviser.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing consistent and clear information about the origin and authenticity of the FAQ document. It mentions conflicting statements by Ocasio-Cortez's adviser and the existence of the document on her website, creating confusion.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any information or make exaggerated claims."}
