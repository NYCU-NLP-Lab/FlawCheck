{"Lack enough support": "The claim of the explosion being caused by a missile or direct-energy weapon is largely based on a single grainy piece of footage, which does not provide sufficient evidence to support the theory.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the explosion was not a suicide car bombing carried out by Anthony Quinn Warner but was instead caused by a missile or direct-energy weapon. This assumption is not supported by substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations for the explosion, such as a suicide car bombing, which contradicts the claim of a missile or direct-energy weapon being the cause.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim of a missile strike is largely based on a single piece of footage, implying that it may be an understatement to conclude that the explosion was caused by a missile or direct-energy weapon.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the explosion was a suicide car bombing set up by Anthony Quinn Warner, as determined by authorities.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the grainy footage by attributing the cause of the explosion to a missile or direct-energy weapon based solely on that footage.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and well-supported explanation for the cause of the explosion, as it relies on speculative theories and lacks substantial evidence."}
