{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that 70% of Americans in poverty are white, which is higher than the actual percentage found in the expert's research.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statistic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that dividing and pitting different racial groups against each other is a common practice, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact found in the expert's research, which states that non-Hispanic whites accounted for 42% to 43% of people living in poverty, not 70% as claimed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There might be alternative explanations for the statistic, such as differences in income distribution, access to resources, or systemic inequalities that contribute to poverty rates among different racial groups.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be considered to falter at times as it relies on a misquote of Bernie Sanders and presents an exaggerated statistic without sufficient evidence."}
