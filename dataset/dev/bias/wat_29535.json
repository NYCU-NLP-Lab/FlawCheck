{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the impact of the executive order on insulin prices by stating that it reduced the cost to \"virtual pennies\" for seniors, when in reality, insulin copays for seniors actually rose between 2017 and 2018.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the executive order significantly reduced the cost of insulin for seniors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the executive order targeting expensive insulin will have a widespread and substantial impact, when in reality, it would only affect a small percentage (less than 20%) of clinics and provide a minimal percentage (10% or less) of all prescription drugs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the reduction in insulin prices, such as public pressure and voluntary price reductions by some drug manufacturers.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that insulin copays generally increased from 2017 to 2018, particularly for those on Medicare who saw their costs rise by about 10%.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of the executive order by stating that it reduced the cost of insulin from \"big dollars to virtual pennies,\" without providing sufficient evidence or context for such a drastic reduction."}
