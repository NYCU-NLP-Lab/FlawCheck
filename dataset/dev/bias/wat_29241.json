{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by President Trump that Mexico would pay for the wall is exaggerated, as he never specified how exactly Mexico would pay for it and has since changed his stance multiple times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no concrete plan or evidence provided to show how Mexico would actually pay for the wall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mexico would willingly agree to pay for the wall, without considering the potential resistance or disagreement from the Mexican government.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations to how Mexico would pay for the wall, such as cutting off remittances or imposing tariffs, but experts have stated that these methods are not feasible or effective.", "Contradict fact": "President Trump's claim contradicts the fact that he initially stated Mexico would pay for the wall and now denies ever saying that they would write a check, despite evidence to the contrary.", "Falters at times": "President Trump's claim falters at times as he has amended his \"Mexico will pay\" pledge and has offered different explanations for how Mexico would indirectly pay for the wall through trade deals.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity and challenges associated with getting Mexico to pay for the wall, as it simplifies the process and does not acknowledge the potential economic and diplomatic consequences."}
