{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Nathan Deal's vote on funding abortions by stating that he \"explicitly voted to fund abortions.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the bill Deal voted for did not become law, suggesting that the claim may be overstating the actual outcome of his vote.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting for the Family Planning Amendments Act of 1993 equates to explicitly voting to fund abortions. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the bill was an authorization bill and did not directly allocate funds for abortions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that Nathan Deal explicitly voted to fund abortions. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was made by an influential blogger, but does not provide additional evidence or analysis to verify the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the claim, stating that it may be more about the conduct of Georgia Right to Life rather than Nathan Deal's stance on abortion. This suggests that there may be alternative motives or factors influencing the claim."}
