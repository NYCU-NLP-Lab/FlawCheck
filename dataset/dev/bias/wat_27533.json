{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of bipartisan bills passed by House Democrats, as it states that they have passed \"more than 275\" bills, which may not accurately reflect the actual number of bipartisan bills.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to verify the number of bipartisan bills passed by House Democrats, as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bills passed by House Democrats are automatically bipartisan, without considering the criteria used to define a bill as bipartisan.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why the bills are not progressing in the Senate, such as differing priorities or disagreements on specific provisions, which the claim does not consider."}
