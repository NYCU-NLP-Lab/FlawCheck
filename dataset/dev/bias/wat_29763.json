{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the man \"drops dead\" in the middle of the street, implying an immediate death.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the man's death was due to coronavirus. It only relies on a blog post without providing any credible sources or official reports.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the man's collapse and subsequent death were caused by the coronavirus without any factual basis or confirmation from reliable sources.", "Contradict fact": "The New York City Police Department stated that the incident was unrelated to the coronavirus, contradicting the claim's assertion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting misleading information and not verifying the accuracy of the reported incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the man's collapse and death, such as pre-existing health conditions or other factors unrelated to the coronavirus."}
