{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Pepsi admitted their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients. The expert's verdict clarifies that the claim is based on a legal battle and the presence of a byproduct called 4-Methylimidazole (4-MEI) in cola products, rather than direct admission by Pepsi.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details about Pepsi's admission or the cancer-causing ingredients. The expert's verdict explains the background of the legal battle and the presence of 4-MEI as a byproduct.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of 4-MEI in Pepsi's soda makes it cancer-causing. The expert's verdict explains that the carcinogenic potential of 4-MEI is still a subject of debate and that different agencies have reached different conclusions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that 4-MEI is a byproduct formed during the manufacturing of caramel coloring used in cola-type beverages and other foods. It suggests that the presence of 4-MEI is not a deliberate addition by Pepsi but a result of the manufacturing process."}
