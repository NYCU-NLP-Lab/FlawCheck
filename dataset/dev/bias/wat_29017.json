{"Understate": "The claim may understate the role of sheriff's deputies in courthouse security by implying that they are merely sitting passively in chairs while county workers handle the security checkpoints.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that deputies collecting overtime while observing the security checkpoints is unnecessary or inefficient, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or support to prove that deputies collecting overtime is a widespread or ongoing issue, as it only provides one instance of deputies observing rather than actively working the checkpoints.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the presence of deputies at the security checkpoints, as they are stated to be there to provide an armed presence for the protection of the public and employees, rather than solely to watch the screeners.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging that deputies actively work some of the security checkpoints, as observed by the expert and courthouse visitors.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the issue by implying that deputies are consistently sitting passively in chairs while county workers handle all the security work, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the responsibility for security checkpoints lies with the county Division of Facilities Management, not the Sheriff's Office."}
