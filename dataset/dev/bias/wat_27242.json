{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the availability of lobster for purchase using food stamps. The expert's investigation found that while it is possible to buy lobster with food stamps, it is not a common or affordable choice for most recipients. The claim may have exaggerated the ease or frequency of purchasing lobster with food stamps.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that lobster can be bought with food stamps. The expert's investigation found a single anecdotal example of someone using food stamps to buy lobster, but this does not prove that it is a widespread or common occurrence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ability to buy lobster with food stamps is a negative aspect of the program. It implies that food stamp recipients are using their benefits to purchase luxury items like lobster instead of more basic or affordable food options. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks the diverse needs and choices of food stamp recipients.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation suggests an alternative explanation for the claim. It mentions that the lawmaker who made the claim may have been influenced by Fox News reports about an individual who used food stamps to buy lobster. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may have been influenced by media coverage rather than objective evidence."}
