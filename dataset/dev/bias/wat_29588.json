{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails. It is not clear how this percentage was calculated or what specific emails have been released.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the release of 10 percent of Jeb Bush's emails is significant or relevant without providing any context or comparison to other politicians or public figures.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of emails released by Jeb Bush, as it mentions that he has released \"just under 10 percent\" of his 3 million emails, but it does not provide an exact number.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Jeb Bush may have released only a portion of his emails, such as privacy concerns or legal requirements.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Jeb Bush set up a special website to make his emails available to the public, which suggests a level of transparency.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information from different sources, making it difficult to determine the accuracy or reliability of the claim."}
