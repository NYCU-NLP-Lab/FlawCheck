{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Tom Hanks was photographed wearing a T-shirt with an anti-Trump message. In reality, the image was doctored, and the original photograph showed Hanks wearing a plain white shirt without any wording on it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it presents a false image without providing any credible evidence or sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image of Tom Hanks wearing an anti-Trump message T-shirt is false and doctored.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tom Hanks is openly against Trump based on his previous political endorsements and statements, but it does not provide any direct evidence linking him to the doctored image.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the doctored image was created and shared to mislead or deceive people, rather than being an accurate representation of Tom Hanks' political views."}
