{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Donald Trump campaigned on not cutting Medicare and Social Security. While Trump did promise to protect these programs, the claim implies that it was a central focus of his campaign, which may be an exaggeration.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact of Tom Price's nomination on Medicare and Medicaid. While Price has supported reducing the government's role in these programs, the claim does not provide enough information to determine the extent to which he would actually cut them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Tom Price \"made his career on cutting Medicare and Medicaid.\" While Price has supported reducing spending on these programs, it is unclear if this can be considered the sole focus of his career.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tom Price's nomination contradicts Donald Trump's promise to not cut Medicare and Social Security. However, the claim does not provide enough evidence to determine if Price's stance on these programs directly contradicts Trump's promises.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Tom Price's nomination. It is possible that Price's nomination was based on other qualifications or policy positions, rather than solely his stance on Medicare and Medicaid."}
