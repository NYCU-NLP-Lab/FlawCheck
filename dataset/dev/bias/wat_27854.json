The article mentions that the divers' equipment stops working when they approach the object, but it does not provide concrete evidence or explanation for this phenomenon.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the object discovered at the bottom of the Baltic Sea is a UFO without presenting any substantial evidence to support this assumption. It jumps to conclusions without considering alternative explanations or possibilities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider or explore alternative explanations for the object found at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
