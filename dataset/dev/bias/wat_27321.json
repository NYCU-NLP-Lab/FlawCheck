{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Johnson Controls was bailed out and its role in saving the auto industry. The expert's verdict mentions that Johnson Controls benefited indirectly from a federal bailout of the auto industry, but it was not facing bankruptcy like the big automakers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Johnson Controls wants to avoid paying taxes without providing enough evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that Johnson Controls wants to avoid paying taxes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Johnson Controls was not an auto parts company when it was bailed out, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Johnson Controls' actions or motivations regarding taxes."}
