{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential impact of higher state worker pension and health care payments by stating that the alternative is either 1,500 layoffs of state employees or close to 200,000 children being bumped off Medicaid-related programs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that removing nearly 200,000 kids from Medicaid would save $30 million over three months, as there is no evidence provided that the state has the authority to cut kids from the Medicaid program.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the only alternatives to higher state worker pension and health care payments are either layoffs or cutting children from Medicaid, without considering other potential solutions or budget adjustments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations or options that have not been explored or presented in the claim."}
