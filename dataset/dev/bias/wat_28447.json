{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the student with long hair in the CCTV footage is Shadab Farooq lacks sufficient evidence or support. Farooq himself denies being the person in the video, and other students provide alibis for his whereabouts during the time of the incident.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person in the CCTV footage is Shadab Farooq based on a visual resemblance with another individual. However, visual similarity alone is not enough to establish the identity of a person.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that the student in the CCTV footage is Shadab Farooq. The student could be someone else who bears a resemblance to Farooq, but is not actually him.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Farooq himself denies being the person in the CCTV footage. His denial directly contradicts the assertion made in the claim.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim understates the significance of Farooq's denial and the alibis provided by other students. These factors strongly challenge the claim's assertion and should be given more weight in evaluating its validity.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing a clear and convincing argument for the identification of the student in the CCTV footage. It relies on speculation, visual resemblance, and lacks concrete evidence.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
