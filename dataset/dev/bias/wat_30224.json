{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict provides evidence and information about the video, including the presence of the company logo on the objects and the description of the precision of the company's machining tools. However, there is no additional information or evidence provided to support the claim that the metal pieces fit together so well that they appear to be single unmodified blocks of metal when combined.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the metal pieces shown in the video are a result of the precision of the Chinese company's machining tools. While the expert's verdict mentions that the clips are demonstrations of the precision of the company's tools, it does not explicitly state that these specific metal pieces were created using those tools.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that some viewers were quick to attribute the videos to computer-based special effects. This suggests that there could be an alternative explanation for the appearance of the metal pieces fitting together seamlessly, other than the precision of the machining tools. However, the verdict does not explore or provide further information about this alternative explanation."}
