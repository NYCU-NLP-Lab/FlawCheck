{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the wages paid by Goodwill Industries International to workers with disabilities by stating that they are as low as \"pennies per hour.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the National Federation of the Blind claims that Goodwill doesn't adequately compensate its disabled workers but does not provide specific evidence of wages being as low as pennies per hour.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Goodwill Industries International pays workers with disabilities wages as low as pennies per hour. The expert's verdict mentions that there have been reports and criticism about low wages at Goodwill, but it also states that the company officials deny these claims and argue that they are special cases, not indicative of the overall pay scale.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Goodwill Industries International pays workers with disabilities wages as low as pennies per hour without providing concrete evidence or specific data. The expert's verdict mentions that only 64 out of 165 affiliate agencies pay disabled workers below minimum wage, indicating that it is not a universal practice within Goodwill.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the low wages paid to workers with disabilities, such as the existence of Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which allows employers to obtain special wage certificates to pay disabled workers less than the federal minimum wage. The expert's verdict mentions this provision and the fact that it has been in place for over seventy years, suggesting that there may be legal justifications for the lower wages.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by Goodwill Industries International's corporate officials, who argue that the cases highlighted in reports are special cases and not indicative of the overall pay scale. The expert's verdict mentions this contradiction and presents both sides of the argument.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the wages paid by Goodwill Industries International to workers with disabilities. The expert's verdict acknowledges the criticism and reports of low wages but also presents the company's perspective and the fact that not all affiliates pay below minimum wage.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
