{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the speed at which the peak of infections has been reached, as it suggests it could have already passed in some cases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the peak of infections has been reached.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that reaching the peak of infections is a sufficient condition for reopening the economy, without considering other factors such as testing capacity, contact tracing, and healthcare system readiness.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the decrease in new cases and fatalities, such as improved testing or reporting methods, rather than solely attributing it to reaching the peak of infections."}
