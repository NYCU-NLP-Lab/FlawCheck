{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the free rides being offered by Lyft and Uber on St. Patrick's Day in 2021. The expert's verdict states that Lyft offered 1,500 rides in Washington, D.C., and some cities in Indiana also offered rides. However, it does not provide information on whether Uber offered any free rides or if there were other cities or states where free rides were available.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it states that Lyft and Uber were offering free rides to impaired drivers on St. Patrick's Day in 2021. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that these free rides were not available nationwide and were limited to specific cities and regions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Lyft and Uber were offering free rides to impaired drivers on St. Patrick's Day in 2021 without providing sufficient evidence. The expert's verdict highlights that the claim is based on rumors and headlines, but the reality is that the free rides were limited to certain locations and had specific terms and conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations by mentioning that some cities and states have special programs to ensure people get home safely, such as the SoberRides.org website featured by the Texas Department of Transportation in the past. This suggests that there are alternative options available for impaired drivers to get a safe ride home, rather than solely relying on Lyft and Uber's free rides."}
