{"Exaggerate": "Biden made false and exaggerated claims about the Senate waiting until after the election to choose Ginsburg's replacement.", "Understate": "Biden suggested that naming someone to replace Ginsburg could wait until after the election because \"there's no court session between now and the end of this election,\" which may understate the urgency of filling the vacancy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Trump campaign asked Biden to release his list only after Ginsburg's passing.", "Problematic assumption": "Biden assumes that the Senate should follow the precedent set in 2016 when Republicans argued that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the Trump campaign asked Biden to release his list only after Ginsburg's passing."}
