{"Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the problem by stating that most bridges were only designed to last for 50 years, without emphasizing the fact that 60% of Missouri's bridges are past their intended design life.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement that most bridges in Missouri were only designed to last for 50 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average age of bridges in Missouri being 48 years old is a cause for concern and implies that they are at risk of failure, without considering other factors such as maintenance and monitoring.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the average age of bridges in Missouri, such as the lack of records before 1900 and the variation in design life standards over the years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the design life of a bridge is not a set expiration date and does not necessarily mean that a bridge becomes unsafe on its 50th birthday.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a complete picture of the bridge situation in Missouri, such as not knowing the age of the oldest bridges and not considering the variation in design life standards.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the urgency and danger associated with driving over bridges in Missouri by stating that it's not time to panic every time, implying that the aging bridges are not a significant concern."}
