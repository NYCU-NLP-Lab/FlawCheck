{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the novelty of the Apple Watch Series 4 as \"the first ECG product offered over-the-counter directly to consumers.\" This is called into question by the existence of AliveCor's KardiaBand, which has been on the market for several years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Apple Watch Series 4 is the first ECG product offered over-the-counter directly to consumers, without considering alternative products like AliveCor's KardiaBand.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the Apple Watch Series 4 is indeed the first ECG product offered over-the-counter directly to consumers, as it does not provide comprehensive evidence or comparisons with other similar products.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The existence of AliveCor's KardiaBand suggests an alternative explanation to the claim, indicating that Apple may not be the first company to offer an ECG product over-the-counter directly to consumers."}
