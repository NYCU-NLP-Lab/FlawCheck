{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that both jellyfish and lobsters are considered biologically immortal, when in fact only one species of jellyfish (Turritopsis nutricula) has been documented to be biologically immortal.", "Understate": "The claim understates by not mentioning that lobsters can die from old age, despite not showing typical signs of aging during their lives.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any scientific evidence or references to back up the statement that jellyfish and lobsters are biologically immortal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that all jellyfish and lobsters are biologically immortal, without considering the variability among species.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations by stating that biologically immortal organisms can still die from predators, diseases, or environmental changes, and that the term \"biological immortality\" is a misnomer."}
