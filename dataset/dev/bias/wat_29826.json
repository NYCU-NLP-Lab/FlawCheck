{"Understate": "The claim may understate the cost of stabilizing the recent financial crisis by stating that it will cost less than 1 percent of GDP, without considering potential hidden costs or long-term effects.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between the cost of stabilizing the recent financial crisis and the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s was a \"much smaller crisis\" compared to the recent financial crisis, without providing evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the difference in cost between stabilizing the recent financial crisis and the savings and loan crisis, such as changes in economic conditions or policy approaches."}
