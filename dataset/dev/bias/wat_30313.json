{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of in-person voter fraud by stating that only 10 cases have been proven nationally since 2000. This suggests that the problem is not significant or widespread.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide detailed evidence or sources to back up the claim that only 10 cases of in-person voter fraud have been proven.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that in-person voter fraud is the only type of voter fraud that is relevant or significant, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the low number of proven cases of in-person voter fraud, such as underreporting or difficulties in detecting and proving such cases.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that voter ID laws have been implemented in many states based on the argument that they are necessary to combat voter fraud, suggesting that the claim may be biased in contradicting this fact.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the rarity of in-person voter fraud by stating that it is extremely rare without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not addressing other types of voter fraud or considering the broader context of election integrity."}
