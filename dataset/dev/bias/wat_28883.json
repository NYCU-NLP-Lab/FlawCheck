{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which pain medications are prescribed in the United States by stating that 90 percent of all pain medications are prescribed in the country, when the actual figure is reported to be around 80 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to validate the specific percentage mentioned. Although it refers to papers published by the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians and the United Nations, it does not provide direct citations or links to these sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a high percentage of pain medications prescribed in the United States is a negative outcome, without considering potential legitimate reasons or medical needs for such prescriptions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the high consumption of pain medications in the United States, such as differences in healthcare systems, cultural factors, or the prevalence of certain medical conditions."}
