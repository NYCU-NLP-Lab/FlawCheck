{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the video does not provide evidence that the person in the video was added to the no-fly list for participating in the Capitol riot.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person in the video was added to the no-fly list for their involvement in the Capitol riot, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the person being kicked off the plane, such as not wearing a mask, rather than being on the no-fly list.", "Understate": "The claim understates the difficulty of identifying everyone in the crowd at the Capitol riot and adding them to the no-fly list, as it would require significant time and resources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the charges filed so far for the Capitol riot have not been related to terrorism but rather trespassing, disorderly conduct, and weapon possession.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the person in the video and the no-fly list without sufficient evidence to support this link.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not addressing the fact that the person in the video was able to obtain a boarding pass and make it through security, which would be difficult for someone on the no-fly list."}
