{"Understate": "The claim states that there has never been a Supreme Court vacancy lasting longer than 237 days in the last 30 years, which understates the actual length of some vacancies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that no vacancy has lasted longer than 237 days in the past 30 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the length of vacancies in the past 30 years is the relevant benchmark for evaluating the current situation, without considering historical vacancies outside of this timeframe.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the length of vacancies, such as political factors or challenges in the confirmation process.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been vacancies lasting longer than 237 days in the past, as evidenced by the example of Justice Abe Fortas' resignation in 1969.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the 237-day benchmark by suggesting that failure to fill the vacancy within this timeframe would \"really hurt people\" and undermine the constitutional system.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by selectively choosing a specific timeframe (30 years) to support its argument, without considering the broader historical context of Supreme Court vacancies."}
