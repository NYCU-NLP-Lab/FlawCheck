{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential increase in premiums for families purchasing their own policy through the health care exchanges. It states that families would be paying $2,100 more, which is an exaggeration of the average increase projected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that families would be paying $2,100 more for their policy through the exchanges. It does not provide specific evidence or data to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in premiums projected by the CBO applies to all families purchasing their own policy through the exchanges. However, the CBO report mentioned that more than half of the people seeking coverage would be eligible for subsidies that would significantly reduce their premiums.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential increase in premiums. It solely attributes the increase to the creation of health exchanges without considering other factors that could contribute to premium changes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that subsidies would be available to a significant portion of individuals purchasing their own policy through the exchanges. It fails to acknowledge the impact of these subsidies on reducing premiums.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential increase in premiums by only mentioning a 10 percent increase. The CBO report mentioned a range of 10 to 13 percent increase in premiums for new individual policies, suggesting that the actual increase could be higher.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the CBO report and cherry-picking certain aspects to support the argument against health exchanges. It fails to consider the full context and findings of the report."}
