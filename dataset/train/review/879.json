["Is the United States the only industrialized country without universal health care?", "The debate over health care in the United States has been a hot-button issue for years.", "From private-pay to Medicare/Medicaid to the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and now to \"Medicare for All,\" lawmakers have argued over how, who, and how much Americans should pay for their health care.", "U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, has been routinely tweeting out his support for the proposed Medicare for All Act, including this tweet from April 30, 2019:", "\"The United States is the ONLY industrialized country without universal healthcare. The #MedicareforAll Act ensures that every person living in the U.S. has access to healthcare and comprehensive benefits. Today's hearing is a historic step towards making it happen.\"", "We decided to focus on the first part of the tweet. Is the United States the only industrialized country without universal health care?", "Let\u2019s take a look.", "What is the Medicare for All Act?", "In April 2019, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, unveiled an updated \"Medicare for All\" bill. Sanders\u2019 plan would create a government-run system that would provide health care coverage to all Americans.", "According to an analysis by PolitiFact National, Medicare for All would replace private insurance, as well as Medicaid and Medicare. The Affordable Care Act would go away. A government-run health insurance program would replace them all. The veterans health system would stay in place, as would Indian Health Services.", "The new Medicare for All bill largely mirrors an earlier one, but this version fully covers long-term care. PolitiFact National has created a guide to Medicare for All that answers many questions about the program.", "The United States vs. other countries", "In June 2015, our colleagues at PolitiFact National checked a very similar claim from U.S. Sen.

As of 2013, coverage had reached about 87% of the population.", "However, by 2018, Mexico had implemented a public health care system known as Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social , which provides universal health care to Mexican families and foreign residents enrolled in the system.", "The other country on the OECD\u2019s lack of universal health care list: The United States.", "(A footnote: Sanders framed his claim around major countries with a guaranteed right to health care, speaking as though every advanced economy had it. In reality, some do and some don\u2019t. As such, Sanders\u2019 claim was rated Half True.)", "In that respect, Pocan\u2019s claim is more straightforward -- he spoke of universal coverage.", "Emails to Pocan\u2019s office seeking more information on his claim went unanswered. That said, Pocan spoke of industrialized nations, so the OECD is a good starting point.", "Other sources", "An April 26, 2018 article in The Economist noted:", "\"Despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, America remains an outlier in health care provision. It has some of the best hospitals in the world, but it is also the only large rich country without universal health coverage.

Government provided single-payer;", "2. Two-tier providing basic care, along with secondary coverage offering more services based on the ability to pay; and", "3. Mandate insurance from an employer or individually purchased, supplementing national coverage.", "Its report classified countries in this manner, and noted that when you move beyond the OECD -- to less industrialized nations -- there are dozens with universal health care. Among them: Belarus, North Korea, Mongolia, Romania, Tajikistan and Uruguay.", "Our ruling", "Pocan said \"the United States is the ONLY industrialized country without universal health care.\"", "Our research, including an earlier fact-check done by PolitiFact National, made clear this is the case.
