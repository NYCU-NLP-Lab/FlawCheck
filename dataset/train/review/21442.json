["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on October 1, 2019", "President Donald Trump and some of his defenders have advanced a bogus theory that whistleblower rules were changed to allow a complaint alleging misconduct by the president to be forwarded to Congress based only on secondhand information.", "There was no such change in law or policy, according to a Sept. 30 statement issued by the independent Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community.", "\u201cIn fact, by law the Complainant \u2013 or any individual in the Intelligence Community who wants to report information with respect to an urgent concern to the congressional intelligence committees \u2013 need not possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint,\u201d the three-page statement said.", "The ICIG statement also said that the whistleblower had \u201cdirect knowledge of certain alleged conduct\u201d and that \u201cother information obtained during the ICIG\u2019s preliminary review supported the Complainant\u2019s allegations.\u201d", "Earlier that day, however, Trump sought to discredit a whistleblower\u2019s recent complaint accusing him of \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d The president \u2014 who has repeatedly charged that the whistleblower had \u201call second hand information\u201d \u2014 took to Twitter and asked, in all capital letters, \u201cWHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT?\u201d", "WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019", "He wasn\u2019t the only one to claim a change had been made.", "\u201cI want to know why they changed the rules about whistleblowers,\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sept. 29. \u201cThe hearsay rule was changed just a short period of time before the complaint was filed.\u201d", "And on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d the same day, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan said the unnamed whistleblower \u201chad no firsthand knowledge\u201d and had only \u201cheard something from someone who may have heard something from someone.\u201d That prompted a real-time fact-check from Jake Tapper, the show\u2019s host.", "\u201cYou know as well as I do that you do not need to have firsthand knowledge to be a whistleblower,\u201d Tapper told Jordan.", "\u201cWell, you don\u2019t now because they changed the form,\u201d Jordan retorted. \u201cYou used to. They changed the form.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of that,\u201d Tapper shot back. \u201cExperts say it has never been true that you need to have firsthand knowledge to be a whistleblower.\u201d", "Jordan\u2019s office told us the congressman was referring to a change that was made to the May 24, 2018, version of ICWSP Form 401, which intelligence community whistleblowers previously used to submit complaints of potential wrongdoing.", "The Federalist, a conservative online magazine, wrote about the form in a Sept. 27 story.", "\u201cBetween May 2018 and August 2019, the intelligence community secretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings,\u201d the Federalist claimed. Trump shared the story on Twitter over the weekend.", "The disclosure form was modified in August, but that did not change the rules for submitting complaints. Instead, in its Sept. 30 statement, the office of the ICIG said that particular form and a few others had been under review since earlier this year and were recently modified to clarify language that could have been misinterpreted by would-be whistleblowers.", "\u201cIn the process of reviewing and clarifying those forms, and in response to recent press inquiries regarding the instant whistleblower complaint, the ICIG understood that certain language in those forms and, more specifically, the informational materials accompanying the forms, could be read \u2013 incorrectly \u2013 as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint with the congressional intelligence committees,\u201d the statement said.", "\u201cConsistent with the law, the new forms do not require whistleblowers to possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint or information with respect to an urgent concern.\u201d", "The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 defines an \u201curgent concern\u201d as, among other things, \u201ca serious or flagrant problem, abuse, violation of the law of Executive order, or deficiency relating to the funding, administration, or operations of an intelligence activity involving classified information.\u201d", "The old form included two pages of background information on the ICWPA submission process. The section titled \u201cFIRST-HAND INFORMATION REQUIRED\u201d said:", "ICIG ICWSP Form 401, May 24, 2018: In order to find an urgent concern \u201ccredible,\u201d the IC IG must be in possession of reliable, first-hand information. The IC IG cannot transmit information via the ICWPA based on an employee\u2019s second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing. This includes information received from another person, such as when a fellow employee informs you that he/she witnessed some type of wrongdoing. (Anyone with first-hand knowledge of the allegations may file a disclosure in writing directly with IC IG.) Similarly, speculation about the existence of wrongdoing does not provide sufficient legal basis to meet the statutory requirements of the ICWPA. If you think that wrongdoing took place, but can provide nothing more than second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions, IC IG will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as an ICWPA.", "That language does not appear along with the new version of the form dated August 2019, but it never meant that whistleblowers couldn\u2019t file a complaint based on hearsay, or secondhand information, in the first place.", "\u201cIt\u2019s clear the language at issue is about what gets escalated, not what\u2019s reportable,\u201d tweeted Cato Institute senior fellow Julian Sanchez, whose studies focus on national security and intelligence surveillance. \u201cWhat the form they\u2019re citing\u201d says is \u201c\u2018this won\u2019t go up the chain without something more,\u2019 which the IG did indeed get in this case,\u201d he explained in another tweet on the subject.", "In fact, the old form gave filers the following options to indicate how they obtained the information that was being disclosed: \u201cI have personal and/or direct knowledge of events or records involved\u201d; \u201cOther employees have told me about events or records involved\u201d; or \u201cOther source(s) (please explain).\u201d", "\u201cAlthough the form requests information about whether the Complainant possesses first-hand knowledge about the matter about which he or she is lodging the complaint, there is no such requirement set forth in the statute,\u201d the ICIG\u2019s statement said. \u201cThe ICIG cannot add conditions to the filing of an urgent concern that do not exist in law.\u201d", "The statement went on to add that since Michael Atkinson started as inspector general on May 29, 2018, \u201cthe ICIG has not rejected the filing of an alleged urgent concern due to a whistleblower\u2019s lack of first-hand knowledge of the allegations.\u201d", "Furthermore, the ICIG statement said that the whistleblower who filed the Aug. 12 complaint against Trump used the old form \u2014 not the new one \u2014 and checked the boxes indicating that the claims were based on both direct knowledge of events and information obtained from others. (The new form still asks similar questions.)", "Office of the ICIG, Sept. 30: As part of his determination that the urgent concern appeared credible, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community determined that the Complainant had official and authorized access to the information and sources referenced in the Complainant\u2019s Letter and Classified Appendix, including direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct, and that the Complainant has subject matter expertise related to much of the material information provided in the Complainant\u2019s Letter and Classified Appendix. In short, the ICIG did not find that the Complainant could \u201cprovide nothing more than second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions,\u201d which would have made it much harder, and significantly less likely, for the Inspector General to determine in a 14-calendar day review period that the complaint \u201cappeared credible,\u201d as required by statute. Therefore, although the Complainant\u2019s Letter acknowledged that the Complainant was not a direct witness to the President\u2019s July 25, 2019, telephone call with the Ukrainian President, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community determined that other information obtained during the ICIG\u2019s preliminary review supported the Complainant\u2019s allegations.", "So, not only was there no rule change for complaints based on hearsay, but those details from the ICIG also refute claims that the whistleblower \u201chad no firsthand knowledge,\u201d as Jordan, the Ohio congressman, claimed in his interview with CNN\u2019s Tapper.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
