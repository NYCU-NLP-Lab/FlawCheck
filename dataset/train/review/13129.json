And Gingrich would have been on firmer ground had he stuck to the narrative of Trump's ascension rather than focusing on the timeline.", "But the speed at which Trump went from his announcement at Trump Tower to becoming the GOP standard bearer isn\u2019t a remarkable achievement.", "Trump announced his candidacy for president June 16, 2015, in New York, and officially clinched the GOP nomination May 26, 2016, after 29 unbound delegates said they would support Trump.", "That\u2019s a span of 346 days, if you include May 26.", "We didn\u2019t have too look too far to find shorter spans for non-incumbents.", "John Kerry in 2004", "John Kerry didn\u2019t announce his run for the White House until Sept. 2, 2003, and he clinched the Democratic nomination May 5, 2004.
