["About this rating", "In late 2015, as Donald Trump's presidential run began reaching a fever pitch, a few enterprising programmers created apps, pages, or browser extensions\u00a0for people\u00a0who wanted to minimize their exposure to Trump, his fans, or both.", "One such browser extension is called \"Trump Filter.\" \u00a0It was created by Rob Spectre,\u00a0a self-described\u00a0\"Internet Mathemagician,\" who created the software with three settings (\"Mild,\" \"Aggressive,\" and \"Vindictive\") which the user could adjust\u00a0based on how strong his or her dislike of Trump might be.", "\"I picked Trump for this extension in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the media coverage around this election,\" Spectre told us.", "Even at this early stage with this wide field of candidates in the American presidential campaign, there is some research that suggests Trump is dominating 46% of all the headlines devoted to the election.", "Even finding other ideas behind the ridiculous notion of banning 1.6 billion people from entering the United States can be difficult to do on the Internet right now. I needed a way to turn the reality TV candidacy off \u2014 that's what I hope the Trump Filter does.", "For the rest of the field, that's really up to the developer community. I did publish the source code with a permissive license on Github \u2014 it is free for anyone to modify. It looks like a few developers are using it to create their own filters for other presidential candidates, some other politicians in other countries and, importantly the entire Kardashian family.", "In the interest of science, we installed the extension, set it to \"Mild,\" and tried it out on a recent article\u00a0about Donald Trump:", "The filter worked exactly as advertised:", "Spectre\u00a0created\u00a0a similar filter in 2011 to remove\u00a0mentions of Derek Jeter from the user's internet.", "Brooke Binkowski is a former editor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
