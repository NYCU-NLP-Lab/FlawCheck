This is a scam,\u201d the tweet reads. \u201cThe best information on legitimate sources of help in your area will come from local officials & @TDEM (Texas Division of Emergency Management).\u201d", "In a second tweet posted the same day, the agency also informed social media users that it was\u00a0 providing generators to \u201csupport critical sites like hospitals,\u201d as well as 729,000 liters of water and more than 50,000 cotton blankets.", "Carman Apple, District Coordinator for the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said by email that it had been made aware of the false claim circulating on social media.", "\u201cWe echo our partners at FEMA in saying that \u2018This is a scam,\u2019\u201d she said.", "Similarly, Officer Daniel Segura of the Fort Worth Police Department said it had issued a warning about the scam on Facebook.", "George Fuller, mayor of the city of McKinney, issued a warning on February 18, and explained in a Facebook message that FEMA told him that \u201cthey do not directly interface with homeowners, etc. in that way.\u201d", "Even though the phone number mentioned in the social media posts appears on FEMA\u2019s website here, it is not currently linked to any form of emergency lodging programs.", "When called, the line connects the speaker to an automated menu to reach the \u201cFEMA internet technical help desk.\u201d", "The automated voice is then followed by a manually-recorded message: \u201cFEMA is not currently providing assistance directly to individuals and families for the winter storm in Texas.

If you have other needs such as food or shelter, hang up and dial 211 for a referral to a voluntary organization that may be able to assist.\u201d", "Through a Facebook search, AFP found that one of the first posts to share the claim, on February 17, linked to a CLC Lodging web page about the Emergency Lodging Assistance Program in designated disaster areas for FEMA qualified individuals.", "\u201cFEMA is paying for hotels.
