["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on June 17, 2020 | Updated on June 29, 2021", "A Facebook post is spreading the false claim that former President Barack Obama gave $3.8 million to a lab in Wuhan, China. The money referenced was actually provided to a U.S. research group. Only $600,000 went to the lab as part of a U.S.-approved collaboration.", "A post circulating on Facebook is spreading a debunked falsehood about U.S. funding that went to a lab in Wuhan, China \u2014 the city where the outbreak of the novel coronavirus began \u2014 as well as a false claim about the origins of the virus.", "\u201cPresident Trump just announced that the \u2018biological\u2019 lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus was created was \u2018funded\u2019 by President Barak Hussein Obama in 2015 to the tune of $3,800,000 American dollars,\u201d the post reads.

That group was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats and first received the grant in 2014.", "Of that amount, EcoHealth gave $600,000 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology \u2014 a collaborator on the project that was pre-approved by NIH and the State Department \u2014 Robert Kessler, EcoHealth\u2019s spokesperson, previously told us.", "The grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, Kessler said \u2014 and EcoHealth received $292,161 that year (part of the total $3.4 million it received). NIH terminated the grant in April.", "President Donald Trump has also previously floated an unsupported claim that the amount received by the Wuhan lab was even higher \u2014 $7.5 million \u2014 and that he \u201cended it.\u201d But as we explained before, the grant that was discontinued was EcoHealth\u2019s and the portion that went to the lab was $600,000.", "A Fox News story in April also made reference to another $3.4 million NIH grant \u2014 regarding a behavioral study \u2014 and suggested that some of the funding may have gone to the Wuhan lab. (The story noted, however, that it was \u201cnot clear exactly how much U.S. funding went directly to the Wuhan Institute of Virology because it worked in collaboration with other institutions on the projects funded by the American grants.\u201d)", "But the recipient of that other grant, which was renewed this year \u2014 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York \u2014 told us that wasn\u2019t the case.", "\u201c[B]ased on CSHL\u2019s records for its NIH R01 award MH101214, there is nothing to indicate that any money from this grant was provided to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\u201d Dagnia Zeidlickis, the lab\u2019s vice president of communications, told us in an email.", "Update, May 21, 2021: The exact origin of the coronavirus remains unknown.
