The Trump administration has not said it would make any COVID-19 vaccine mandatory. President-elect Joe Biden has not said he would mandate it either.", "The federal government has invested more than $9 billion in vaccine deals with multiple private companies. The agreements vary in scope; some are only for the purchase of vaccines, others provide funding for the research, manufacturing and purchase of vaccines. But the messaging from the Trump administration so far has been about voluntary vaccination. A report from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department talks about \"ensuring that every American who wants to receive a COVID-19 vaccine can receive one.\"", "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, was asked at a town hall in August if he\u2019d support a nationwide mandate of a COVID-19 vaccine.", "\"No, definitely not,\" said Fauci, who has accepted an offer by the Biden administration to stay on in his director role and act as a White House medical adviser. \"You don't want to mandate and try and force anyone to take a vaccine. We\u2019ve never done that. You can mandate certain groups of people, like health care workers, but for the general population you can\u2019t. \u2026 We don't want to be mandating from the federal government to the general population.
