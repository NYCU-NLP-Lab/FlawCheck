["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 3, 2021", "Social media posts falsely claim that the November election in Myanmar was conducted using Dominion Voting Systems, the company that was the focus of bogus theories about the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The company said its systems aren\u2019t used in Myanmar, and there\u2019s no indication that the country uses any voting machines.", "A false narrative pushed in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election \u2014 that a voting systems company had somehow facilitated massive fraud to the detriment of former President Donald Trump \u2014 is now being recycled to suggest a similar tale in Myanmar.", "But that insinuation is also bunk. The Southeast Asian nation does not use Dominion Voting Systems, contrary to claims on social media.", "The erroneous claim surfaced online Feb. 1, following news that Myanmar\u2019s military had staged a coup and detained the country\u2019s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and other members of her party. The military, which is closely aligned with the country\u2019s major opposition party, announced that it would impose a state of emergency\u00a0for a year.", "Suu Kyi\u2019s party handily won the election in November, but the military has claimed that widespread irregularities could have led to fraud \u2014 despite a national election commission saying there is no evidence to back up that allegation \u2014 as the Associated Press reported.", "On Twitter and Facebook, some users suggested the Myanmar military\u2019s election fraud claim is somehow related to Dominion.", "\u201cThe White House is freaking out after Myanmar Military arrests political leaders for Election Fraud in their November 8 elections. Myanmar used Dominion Voting Systems,\u201d a Facebook post reads. The post included a 2012 photo of\u00a0former President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meeting with Suu Kyi.", "A spokesperson for Dominion told us in a statement that \u201cDominion had absolutely no involvement whatsoever in Myanmar in any capacity.\u201d", "\u201cNeither Dominion\u2019s machines nor its software had any role in Myanmar\u2019s elections or the ongoing political unrest there,\u201d the spokesperson added.", "Allegations of election fraud lodged against Dominion in the U.S. have been repeatedly\u00a0debunked, including by\u00a0audits\u00a0of the underlying paper ballots. Some organizations that provided a platform to baseless claims about the company have since distanced themselves from those claims or apologized, following threats of legal action by the company.", "There is also no evidence that Myanmar used technology from Smartmatic, another election systems company\u00a0that was the focus of baseless allegations about vote switching, as we\u2019ve\u00a0reported.\u00a0One viral\u00a0tweet\u00a0claimed \u201cMyanmar\u2019s Nov election: Used Dominion & Smartmatic\u201d \u2014 and seemed to suggest the U.S. should have taken steps similar to Myanmar\u2019s coup.", "But there is no indication that Myanmar even used voting machines for its election.", "A report\u00a0by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance on Myanmar\u2019s 2020 election makes no mention of any voting machines \u2014 let alone Dominion or Smartmatic systems\u00a0\u2014 being used. Nor does a\u00a0report\u00a0outlining observations from the election by the Myanmar-based People\u2019s Alliance for Credible Elections.", "The former report, on page 21, outlines a process by which a voter \u201cmarks the candidate\u201d with a \u201cvoting stamp,\u201d then folds the ballot and inserts it into a ballot box. It makes no references to machines being used to count votes.", "Tun Myint, an associate professor of political science at Carleton College in Minnesota, likewise told us in a phone interview that he was not aware of machines being used in the elections. Myint is a native of Myanmar (also known as Burma) whose studies focus on the country and on Southeast Asia.", "Myint described the process like the one outlined in the reports, pointing out that news photos of the military leader, Min Aung Hlaing, voting in the November election show him casting his paper ballot into a ballot box.", "\u201cThe infrastructure is not there,\u201d he said, of villages and towns using machines to facilitate elections.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
