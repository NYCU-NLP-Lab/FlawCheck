We often hear stories of people saying: \u2018Yesterday, I was talking with him, why did he die suddenly?\u2019 The reason is that when you get up at night to go to the toilet, it often happens quickly. We stop immediately and the brain does not have blood circulation.\"", "The post then says that the three and a half minutes after you wake up are important because \"by suddenly rising, the brain will be anemic and will cause heart failure for lack of blood.\" Therefore, according to the post, you should stay in bed for a minute and a half when you wake up, sit in bed for another half minute, and then lower your legs and sit on the edge of the bed for another half minute.", "\"After three and a half minutes, your brain will no longer be anemic and your heart will not weaken, which will reduce the risk of falling and sudden death,\" the post says, encouraging people to share this guidance with family and friends.", "On Facebook, this post was shared more than 10,000 times and it was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

If someone gets out of bed quickly to use the bathroom, their blood pressure could drop causing something called \"postural hypotension,\" he explained. Someone could faint due to that sudden drop in blood pressure and, \"obviously, if they faint and fall and hit their head on something hard they could sustain a head injury and die,\" he said. But he doesn\u2019t know of a direct link between the condition and death absent a secondary injury.", "And, of course, deaths during the night do happen \u2060\u2014 and for many reasons, Gharib said, including due to drug overdoses. One of the most common causes is known as \"sudden cardiac death.\" This is often due to an underlying coronary heart disease that may have been unrecognized, Gharib said. There\u2019s also some evidence that untreated sleep apnea may increase the risk of sudden death, possibly as a trigger for an abnormal heart rhythm.", "But that\u2019s unrelated to anything described in this Facebook post.", "We rate it False.", "Facebook post, Aug. 30, 2019", "Business Insider, Here\u2019s why Googling your symptoms is a terrible idea, July 16, 2015", "Email interview with Sina Gharib, associate professor of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Sept. 24, 2019", "Email interview with Marcus Drake, professor of physiological urology, University of Bristol, Sept. 25, 2019", "Email interview with Hashim Hashim, consultant urological surgeon and honorary professor of urology, Bristol Urological Institute, Sept. 25, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
