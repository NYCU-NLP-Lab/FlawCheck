["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "One bit of conventional wisdom gleaned from the November 2010 elections is voters turned Democrats out of office in Washington because they were turned off by their spending.\n\nThe results, no doubt, were more complicated than that.\n\nBut even if spending were only one reason Republicans took control of the U.S. House, would an outgoing Democratic congressman -- just weeks after his party got clobbered -- make a special federal funding request for potato pests in Wisconsin?\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2010, U.S. Sen John McCain (R-Arizona) took to the Senate floor to blast 2011 earmark requests made by various lawmakers.\n\nAn earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker.\n\nMcCain, reciting with disdain some of his \"favorite\" requests, highlighted an earmark for \"$277,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin.\"\n\nTwo days later, a 1,900-page, $8 billion bill that included the earmarks was abandoned by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat. That means the earmarks are not likely to be funded, said Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense (and a University of Wisconsin Law School graduate).\n\nNevertheless, let\u2019s find out whether McCain\u2019s claim was on target.\n\nThe 2008 presidential candidate said his source on the earmarks he highlighted was EndingSpending.com, which has a 2011 earmarks database.\n\nThe database was assembled by three Washington, D.C., organizations: Taxpayers Against Earmarks, led by Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts; Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group; and WashingtonWatch.com, which is run by a staff member of the Cato Institute, a libertarian research foundation.\n\nOur check of the database found that an earmark request for $300,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin was made by U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wausau).\n\nObey, who decided not to seek re-election in November after 41 years in Congress, was regarded as one of the most powerful members as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. He\u2019ll be replaced in January by Republican Sean Duffy, a former prosecutor and lumberjack athlete.\n\nSo, did Obey request the potato money?\n\nYes, said Ellis Brachman, spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee. He referred us to Obey\u2019s official website, pointing out that members of Congress are required to post their earmark requests.\n\nObey\u2019s site does not label his requests as earmarks, but rather \"Wisconsin projects submitted for consideration in FY 2011 appropriations.\" If you click there on Obey\u2019s home page, you get a list of his more than 80 earmark requests.\n\nAmong them: $36 million for studies of high-speed passenger rail between Madison and the Twin Cities; $2.5 million to replace the Bad River Tribal Youth Center in Ashland; and millions of dollars for water or waste water system improvements in communities including Cadott, Elcho and Unity. \u00a0\n\nAs for Obey\u2019s potato pest request, here\u2019s the summary:\n\nRecipient: University of Wisconsin College of Agriculture and Life Sciences\n\nAddress: 1450 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706\n\nAmount: $300,000\n\nDescription: Funding will help promote the development and adoption of bio-intensive integrated pest management practices to reduce or eliminate the use of pesticides, enhance habitat quality, develop marketplace incentives for ecologically-produced potatoes and maintain economically viable farming operations in the fragile central sands region of Northern Wisconsin.\n\nObey was just renewing the potato earmark request. He won $849,000 for the same earmark from 2008 to 2010, according to earmarks databases kept by Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n\nJust how important are potatoes in Wisconsin? The state ranks third in potato production, behind Idaho and Washington, according to the Wisconsin Potato & Vegetable Growers Association.\n\nAmong the threats to Wisconsin potatoes is the Colorado potato beetle, which isn\u2019t easily killed by predator bugs. It is \"the most serious insect pest\" found on commercially produced potatoes in the central sands area, according to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Entomology.\n\nWe wondered why McCain said the potato pest management request was for $277,000, while the database he cited and Obey put the figure at $300,000. McCain\u2019s office didn\u2019t reply to our question. However, a \"working database\" of 2011 earmarks maintained by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), indicates the request was reduced to $277,000 before being put into the bill that was ultimately abandoned.\n\nObey\u2019s wasn\u2019t the only potato pest management earmark request. Maine\u2019s congressional delegation asked for $450,000 for its program, according to the Coburn database.\n\nOK, let\u2019s return to McCain\u2019s claim.\n\nCiting a database, the Arizona senator said an earmark request had been made for $277,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin. The database shows the request was made by Obey, the outgoing congressman. He doesn\u2019t dispute it. (But it\u2019s entirely possible his office considers us a pest on this issue.)\n\nWe rate McCain\u2019s statement True.", "PolitiFact.com, Richard Lugar says ending earmarks won\u2019t save money, Nov. 18, 2010\n\nPolitiFactWisconsin.com, U.S. Rep.
