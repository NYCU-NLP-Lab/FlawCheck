["About this rating", "A meme popular on social media posits that a photograph depicts a praying diner who was belittled by atheists for his faith until a salt shaker on his table fell and the spilled crystals miraculously formed an image of Jesus:", "The narrative attached to this picture is a ridiculous and fabricated one, a spoof of the type of inspirational stories known as \"glurge (in particular, the subset of glurge tales involving tests of faith.) The photograph seen here is real, however -- but its explanation is an artistic rather than a miraculous one.", "The person pictured here is artist Rob Ferrel of San Antonio, Texas, who uses a variety of media to create his artworks, including salt and other food products, as reported on Oddity Central:", "A true artist doesn\u2019t really need expensive tools and materials to produce something beautiful, and San Antonio artist Rob Ferrel is the perfect example.

Once the portrait is ready, he photographs it and posts it to Instagram, and then gathers up all the salt to make his next masterpiece.", "His posts regularly get thousands of likes, but some of the more popular portraits are of Michael Jackson, Snoop Dogg, John Lennon, Lebron James, the cast of Fast & Furious, and The Notorious B.I.G, which he made on a wooden floor.", "But it\u2019s not just salt Ferrel works with. The young artist is so talented that he can produce breathtaking art out of pretty much anything. He runs a salon in San Antonio called Rob the Original Barbershop, where he gives customers crazy haircuts sculpted with logos, patterns, and celeb portraits.", "Ferrel demonstrated his \"salt art\" during a television appearance on KRPC's Houston Life with hosts Derrick Shore and Courtney Zavala:", "Ferrel also posts his creations to his Instagram page:", "Sumitra. \u00a0 \"The Awe-Inspiring Salt Portraits of Rob Ferrel.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Oddity Central. \u00a0 18 December 2015.", "Peters, Mitchell. \u00a0 \"Artist Creates Spot-On Adele Portrait with Only Ketchup: See the Photos.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Billboard. \u00a0 9 January 2016.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
