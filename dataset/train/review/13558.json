Tom Wolf vowed to continue counting votes in his state after\u00a0Trump demanded an end to the count.", "\"The planned attacks on our elections this morning are undemocratic and all elected officials must denounce them,\" Wolf said in a statement Thursday morning. \"Pennsylvania will be prepared to protect our election workers and our votes.\"", "Pennsylvania elections officials have not yet tabulated all of the mail-in ballots cast in the state, many from counties that have favored Democrat Joe Biden.
