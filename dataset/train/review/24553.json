And one wild theory is spreading on social media: that the incoming vice president will oust President-elect Joe Biden and tap Pence to replace her.", "\"I heard a rumor @KamalaHarris is planning on pulling the 25th Amendment on @JoeBiden the minute he is sworn in, and then appointing @MikePence as her Vice-President,\" read one Facebook post. \"Is this true?\"", "It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Soon after, Trump tweeted without evidence that Pelosi was \"looking at the 25th Amendment in order to replace Joe Biden with Kamala Harris.\" There was no factual basis for that claim either.", "Now that the amendment is in the news again, Biden and Harris have not commented on calls to use it to remove Trump.", "\"President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris are focused on their duty \u2014\u00a0preparing to take office on Jan. 20 \u2014\u00a0and will leave it to Vice President Pence, the cabinet and the Congress to act as they see fit,\" Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for the Biden transition, told the New York Times.", "We\u2019ve previously fact-checked other unfounded allegations that hinge on the fears of some conservatives that Biden is a \"Trojan Horse\" for a Harris presidency. Some social media posts have included the inaccurate claim that Pelosi would automatically become Harris\u2019 vice president.", "And we find no credible evidence to suggest that there is any discussion of Harris seeking to replace Biden once sworn in. It\u2019s especially unfathomable that Harris, a Democrat, would nominate Pence, a Republican, as her vice president if she replaced Biden. If that were to happen, and Harris were then to leave the office of the president, she would effectively hand over power to the other party \u2014 Pence would become the new president.", "The claim that Harris plans to oust Biden and appoint Pence as her vice president is False.", "This fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "Facebook post, Jan. 7, 2021", "PolitiFact, Using the 25th Amendment or impeaching Trump: Could they happen?
