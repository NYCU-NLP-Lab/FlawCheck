(AP)", "Mike Bloomberg said he opposed raising the minimum wage in 2015.", "Bloomberg called for expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, rather than raising the minimum wage.", "During his 2020 campaign, Bloomberg called for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.", "U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders welcomed Democratic rival Mike Bloomberg into the thick of the presidential primary with a slew of attacks on the former New York City mayor\u2019s moderate record.", "Speaking at a gathering of Democrats in Nevada, Sanders contrasted his own consistent support for raising the minimum wage with Bloomberg\u2019s on-the-record opposition.", "\"We will not defeat Donald Trump with a candidate who in 2015 stated, and I quote: \u2018I, for example, am not in favor, have never been in favor of raising the minimum wage,\u2019\" Sanders said.", "We wondered if that was true, and it is. It\u2019s worth clarifying that this is no longer Bloomberg\u2019s position in 2020.", "Bloomberg supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, up from $7.25, putting him in line with the rest of his primary opponents.", "RELATED: Who led the way for a $15 minimum wage in New York?", "RELATED: Fact-checking Bernie Sanders on a $15 minimum wage", "In 2015, Bloomberg spoke against raising the minimum wage:", "\"I, for example, am not in favor, have never been in favor of raising the minimum wage,\" Bloomberg said on the Bloomberg TV channel.

About 29 states have passed their own earned-income tax credit. While mayor in 2004, Bloomberg signed legislation starting a local tax credit.", "In 2018, Bloomberg again called for using the tax credit rather than hiking the minimum wage. During an interview with Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund, he repeated his concern that a hike in the minimum wage would lead to job losses. (The Congressional Budget Office has found far more people would receive wage hikes than likely lose their jobs under a national increase to $15 an hour.)", "Bloomberg\u2019s support for the tax credit rather than a rise in the minimum wage is shared by some experts. However, others say the two policies can work in tandem, and both could help poor workers.", "While Bloomberg spoke broadly against a minimum wage increase, in 2012 he did support raising the minimum wage in New York to $8.25 an hour.
