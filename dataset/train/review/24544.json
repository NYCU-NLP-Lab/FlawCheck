["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on January 22, 2020", "A viral YouTube video rehashed, and added to, a debunked hoax about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi taking money from Social Security to pay for the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump. The claim originated on a self-described satirical website.", "As the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump began in the Senate, a long-circulating hoax about the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry received renewed life in the form of a viral YouTube video.", "\u201cPelosi Steals Closer To $5 Billion From Social Security To Pay For Impeachment \u2013 Not $2.4 Billion,\u201d the video\u2019s headline read.", "The video peddled a false claim about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that we debunked months ago and that was completely made up \u2014 explicitly so \u2014 by a website that calls its work satire. The video weaved additional layers of misinformation into the claim, too.", "The original bogus claim \u2014 \u201cPelosi Diverts $2.4 Billion From Social Security To Cover Impeachment Costs\u201d \u2014 was first spread in October by a website under the umbrella of America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. That publication uses a number of websites to spread its self-declared satirical work, but many of its stories sow confusion among social media users.", "The new YouTube video was posted Jan. 16 by an account belonging to a frequent YouTube user named William Mount. It was viewed more than 190,000 times in the days following, gaining shares on Facebook with the help of conservative groups and pages. The video was deleted after we contacted Mount about his claims, but the false headline remains on Facebook posts that shared the video.", "\u201cWhat you\u2019re about to see will stun you, shock you, anger you, if you have an IQ above room temperature,\u201d Mount told his viewers in the video.", "The video began by reporting the Last Line of Defense story as fact, showing the bogus article and quoting a section about Pelosi filing a \u201cre-appropriation form 77-A in the Congressional Budget office\u201d to move \u201cthe amount from the Department of Social Security to cover the cost.\u201d No such form exists, and the agency responsible for Social Security is the Social Security Administration.", "Using the imagined story about the $2.4 billion diversion as a basis, Mount then launched into a long diatribe filled with more erroneous claims about \u201cstolen\u201d money from Social Security.", "For example, referring to the annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, he claimed: \u201cWonder why federal employees got a 2.4% COLA raise and Social Security only got a 1.6% raise? This was used by Pelosi to pay for the impeachment.\u201d", "Social Security recipients did receive a 1.6% cost-of-living raise for 2020, but as we\u2019ve previously explained, that amount is not determined by lawmakers. Instead, the annual adjustment is\u00a0determined by economic calculations to ensure that the purchasing power of Social Security benefits isn\u2019t eroded by inflation.", "We don\u2019t yet know how much the House\u2019s impeachment investigation \u2014 or the now-unfolding Senate impeachment trial \u2014 will ultimately cost taxpayers. Unofficial, outside projections of the cost of the House inquiry have offered figures in the millions, not billions.", "The five-month impeachment proceedings against former President Bill Clinton cost about $1.2 million, according to a 1999\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0report, which would be nearly $1.9 million\u00a0in today\u2019s dollars, when\u00a0adjusted for inflation.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "\u201cAbout Us.\u201d Potatriotsunite.com.
