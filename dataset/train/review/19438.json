It reads, in part:", "The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy, like a deceptive fox. In my opinion, I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn\u2019t kill everyone, but kills \u201cenough,\u201d especially the elderly and in-firmed. Back in WW 2 Hitler thought the same way. He got rid of what he considered the useless and rejects of society.", "However, we found no evidence that O'Reilly, who currently publishes commentary on his own website, wrote the essay in question. Readers reported spotting the essay on Facebook and also in forwarded emails. But it was not posted by O'Reilly on his website or his social media accounts.

At that time, the post was labeled \"False\" by Facebook's independent fact-checking partners.", "We have not been able to ascertain who added O'Reilly's byline to the essay, but within days of its initial posting a version appeared containing both Besmer's name and O'Reilly's, followed by variants attributed to O'Reilly alone.", "In a statement to Snopes, a representative for O'Reilly's website confirmed that \"Bill O\u2019Reilly did not write a single word of the essay in question,\" adding that the pundit \"does not traffic in conspiracy theories.\"", "We therefore rate this quoted item \"Misattributed.\"", "Morona, Joey.\u00a0\"Bill O\u2019Reilly Says People Who Died from Coronavirus 'Were on Their Last Legs Anyway.'\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Syracuse.com.\u00a09 April 2020.", "[15 April 2020] Updated to include a statement from a representative for Bill O'Reilly.", "[20 April 2020] Correction: A previous version of this article created confusion about the origin of the misattribution to Bill O'Reilly.
