["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on August 4, 2020 | Updated on February 10, 2021", "A viral headline on Facebook claims that a vaccine isn\u2019t \u201cNeeded\u201d for COVID-19 because \u201cThere Is Already A Cure.\u201d But the supposed \u201ccure\u201d is an asthma medication, touted by a Texas doctor, that has not yet been proven in clinical trials as an effective treatment for COVID-19 \u2014 though researchers are exploring its efficacy.", "In a video interview shared on social media in early July, a Texas doctor promised a \u201csilver bullet\u201d and \u201ccure\u201d for COVID-19.", "The answer, Dr. Richard Bartlett claimed, is an existing asthma medicine \u2014 inhaled budesonide, a corticosteroid \u2014 whose success, he suggests, negates the need for a vaccine. The video has racked up 4 million views on YouTube and its claims have migrated elsewhere. A headline shared on Facebook nearly 40,000 times, for example, claims that \u201cCOVID-19 No Vaccine Needed, There Is Already A Cure.\u201d", "But experts say the medication has not yet been proven as an effective treatment for COVID-19 and, even if helpful, wouldn\u2019t dismiss the need for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus that causes the disease \u2014 which would help to prevent people from becoming sick in the first place. The World Health Organization also notes that there is \u201ccurrently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19.\u201d", "Bartlett, a general practice doctor who initiated a short-lived run for Congress as a Republican in 2019, said in his interview on the conservative talk show \u201cAmerica Can We Talk?\u201d that he uses a nebulizer machine to administer the budesonide. He said he also uses zinc and clarithromycin, an antibiotic.", "\u201cMy silver bullet is inhaled budesonide,\u201d he said. \u201cIt works. One hundred percent of my patients are alive.\u201d He said that patients \u201ctell me, \u2018I feel better during the first treatment,\u2019 and so their chest pain goes away, their shortness of breath goes away, their fever breaks.\u201d", "In describing the success of one patient, he refers to the treatment as a \u201ccure.\u201d", "Mona Bafadhel, associate professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Oxford, told us in an email that \u201cthere is NO evidence to suggest that inhaled budesonide or any inhaled steroids (ICS) is a cure for COVID.\u201d (Emphasis is hers.)", "Bafadhel is currently conducting a randomized controlled clinical trial to examine the use of inhaled budesonide to treat patients with early COVID-19 infection.", "\u201cIf ICS were proven to be successful, as a treatment, this would NOT mean we don\u2019t need a vaccine,\u201d she said.", "(Update, Feb. 10, 2021: Unpublished results from Bafadhel\u2019s study,\u00a0posted\u00a0to the preprint server medRxiv, suggest that\u00a0giving\u00a0inhaled budesonide\u00a0soon after developing symptoms\u00a0can reduce\u00a0the need for urgent care or hospitalization and shorten recovery time.)", "Dr. Mitchell Grayson, a professor of pediatrics and chief of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital at Ohio State University College of Medicine, also said in a phone interview that \u201cthe jury is out\u201d on whether inhaled corticosteroids will help with treatment of COVID-19. Grayson briefly evaluated the dearth of evidence available on the issue for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.", "\u201cI don\u2019t see any strong signals that would make me think that inhaled steroids are going to be remarkably better,\u201d he said, but a clinical trial is the only way to know more definitively.", "Grayson said one possibility is that the steroid could help temper the immune system\u2019s overreaction to the disease, since that overreaction can lead people to getting seriously ill.", "Bartlett recently started a website, \u201ccovidsilverbullet.com,\u201d where he has published a case study of inhaled budesonide that involves two patients treated via telemedicine. The patients \u2014 a 63-year-old woman and 38-year-old man \u2014 both are reported to have preexisting conditions and use other medications, too.", "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to make any kinds of heads or tails out of\u201d the case study, Grayson said.", "A large, randomized clinical trial in the U.K. by the RECOVERY group found that 22.9% of COVID-19 patients allocated dexamethasone \u2014 another steroid \u2014 by mouth or intravenously died within 28 days, as opposed to 25.7% of patients allocated usual care. It was most effective among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.", "The study only looked at hospitalized patients and did not look at inhaled steroids. It also did not find a benefit for those not receiving respiratory support.", "In a July 30 commentary for The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Bafadhel and Dan Nicolau, a physician and mathematician at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, lay out the hypothesis that inhaled corticosteroids \u201ccould be a therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 for several reasons.\u201d", "\u201cWe would propose that ICS could have a dual role: first, reducing the inflammatory [acute respiratory distress syndrome-like] response affecting a minority of patients with COVID-19; and second, directly inhibiting viral replication,\u201d they note. They later add: \u201cWhether use of ICS protects against COVID-19 is still unknown, but to dismiss this hypothesis as nonsense is premature.\u201d", "In addition to Bafadehl\u2019s study, there are several other clinical trials also exploring inhaled corticosteroids and COVID-19.", "But in the viral video, Bartlett dubiously suggests the medication is already being used so widely as to keep COVID-19 fatalities low in Taiwan, Japan, Singapore and Iceland. \u201cThey\u2019re doing what I\u2019m doing \u2026 an inhaled steroid,\u201d he claims.", "The WHO, in a statement provided to FactCheck.org, said \u201cthere is no evidence suggesting that inhaled corticosteroid have reduced case fatality rate in Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, and Iceland.\u201d", "Taiwan, with a population of nearly 24 million, has reported only 475 COVID-19 cases and seven deaths \u2014 but it\u2019s not because of an inhaled steroid, said Tsung-Mei Cheng, a health policy research analyst at Princeton University who has written about Taiwan\u2019s health care system and closely follows the country\u2019s COVID-19 response.", "Cheng said in a phone interview that she had \u201cnever\u201d heard of such a treatment being responsible for low fatalities. Instead, she said the country prepared itself for such a crisis in the aftermath of the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. She said the country\u2019s leadership (including a central command system), a national policy, and \u201cvery, very strict, effective quarantine and contact tracing\u201d protocols helped to prevent the disease from spreading within the country.", "The WHO statement also said that \u201c[t]here is limited information on possible effect of inhaled steroids and there is no evidence there is any advantage to use this route of administration to improve patient outcomes.\u201d (Emphasis is theirs.)", "\u201cAvailable evidence from randomized clinical trials such as RECOVERY suggest that systemic corticosteroids\u201d \u2014 meaning, taken orally or through a shot \u2014 \u201cprovide benefits in reducing mortality in severe and critically ill patients requiring respiratory support,\u201d it noted. \u201cIn addition, data indicate that [there is] no benefit of systemic corticosteroids in patients who did not require supplemental oxygen.\u201d", "Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security who studies infectious diseases, also said in an email that \u201c[t]here is no definitive evidence to support the use of inhaled corticosteroids like budesonide in the treatment of COVID-19. While there is biological plausibility that such a treatment could have a beneficial role it can only be determined in a proper clinical trial.\u201d", "Adalja cautioned that \u201c[w]hen it comes to steroid treatments for COVID19 it is important to realize that, as was shown with systemic steroid treatment, there is an appropriate and inappropriate time to administer them.\u201d He also said \u201cinhaled corticosteroids are not benign and have a range of side effects that range from osteoporosis to making one more vulnerable to bacterial pneumonia so I would not advise the use of such treatments for COVID19 outside of a clinical trial or protocol (though those prescribed them for other reasons should continue taking them).\u201d", "In a subsequent interview, with the conservative outlet One America News Network, Bartlett said that a hospital in Texas south of San Antonio \u2014 Frio Regional Hospital \u2014 \u201cemptied\u201d its ICU of COVID-19 patients by using inhaled budesonide.", "The CEO of the hospital, John Hughson, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview that the hospital, which typically has a 25-bed capacity, did use inhaled budesonide on three patients in a room converted into an ICU \u2014 and that they improved several days later and were discharged. He said he believes the inhaled budesonide can be effective for some patients and that while some doctors at the hospital use it, others haven\u2019t adopted it.", "Hughson noted that \u201cit is a very, very small sample size and all those patients were on high-flow oxygen.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s up to the physician\u2019s discretion and their medical judgment \u2026 if they initiate the therapy at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI would also say that\u2019s not the only treatment we use.\u201d", "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say this is indicated for every patient, it is not the magic cure for everything, and it is not going to keep everyone from getting the disease,\u201d he added.", "On that point, Bartlett also suggested \u2014 in his earlier interview \u2014 that a vaccine isn\u2019t needed if inhaled budesonide is being widely used. For example, after advancing the baseless claim about Taiwan\u2019s wide adoption of the steroid, he says: \u201cTaiwan, 24 million people, they don\u2019t need to wait for a vaccine \u2014 they don\u2019t have a problem that you should vaccinate 24 million people for.\u201d", "Adalja, however, said that \u201cno treatment will obviate the need for a vaccine \u2014 a vaccine is the only way to remove this virus as a threat to human health.\u201d", "And Cheng, who said she has spoken recently with both Taiwan\u2019s former health minister and the current health minister, dismissed the suggestion that the country isn\u2019t in need of a vaccine. She said Taiwan is putting many resources into vaccine development and negotiating with vaccine manufacturers to ensure that, when one is ready, the country can procure enough doses to begin with protecting health care workers \u2014 followed by the rest of the population.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
