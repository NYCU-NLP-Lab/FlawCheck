Storm surge doesn\u2019t just mean there\u2019s an excess of water in one place; it also mean there\u2019s water missing from somewhere else. All that water didn\u2019t come from nowhere, after all.", "The Atlantic included the same video as the Huffington Post, but attributed it to Twitter user @Kaydi_K, even though it was posted two hours earlier by @Piznack. It's not clear who owns this particular video. \n\n\nI am in disbelief right now... This is Long Island, Bahamas and the ocean water is missing!!!
