["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on February 27, 2018", "The Republicans and Democrats on the House intelligence committee have now released competing memos on how the FBI and Department of Justice obtained court approval for surveillance of Carter Page, a former adviser to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.", "The GOP memo,\u00a0released Feb. 2, contends the FBI and Department of Justice abused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by omitting \u201cmaterial and relevant information\u201d in its FISA application. The Republicans maintain that\u00a0a series of reports\u00a0compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele \u201cformed an essential part of the Carter Page FISA application,\u201d but the government\u2019s application did not disclose that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for the so-called Steele dossier.", "The Democrats responded with a memo, released Feb. 24, that contends the \u201cFBI and DOJ officials did not \u2018abuse\u2019 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process,\u201d claiming that the DOJ \u201ccited multiple sources to support the case for surveilling Page\u201d and \u201cmade only narrow use\u201d of information from Steele. It maintains that the court knew Steele was hired to conduct political opposition research.", "On the day the Democratic memo was released, President Donald Trump\u00a0tweeted that it proves the \u201cFBI did not disclose who the clients were \u2014 the Clinton Campaign and the DNC\u201d in its application to the FISA court. That\u2019s misleading.", "The Clinton campaign and the DNC were not mentioned in the FISA application, because of the DOJ\u2019s \u201clongstanding practice\u201d of protecting the names of U.S. persons and organizations unless they are the subject of an investigation, the Democratic memo says. Even so,\u00a0the application describes the so-called Steele dossier as paid opposition research that would be likely used to \u201cdiscredit\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign.", "The FISA application,\u00a0dated Oct. 21, 2016, says a \u201cU.S. Person\u201d (Glenn Simpson, founder of Fusion GPS) told \u201csource #1\u201d (Steele) that a \u201cU.S.-based law firm\u201d (Perkins Coie) \u201chad hired\u201d Simpson \u201cto conduct research regarding Candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia,\u201d referring to Trump, according to the Democratic memo.", "FISA application, Oct. 21, 2016: The identified U.S. person hired Source #1 to conduct this research. The identified U.S. Person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into Candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia. The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign.", "Trump also claimed in a Feb. 24 interview on Fox News\u00a0that the Democratic memo \u201creally verifies the Nunes memo,\u201d referring to the Republican memo named after Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House intelligence committee. We asked the White House how so, and it responded with four examples \u2014 including the claim that the DOJ did not disclose that the Steele dossier was paid for by the Clinton campaign and the DNC. As we said, that\u2019s misleading.", "Below we review some of the competing claims made by the Republicans and Democrats in their memos, and the White House support for Trump\u2019s claim that the Democratic memo \u201creally verifies the Nunes memo.\u201d", "A key area of disagreement between the two parties is the extent of the role that the Steele dossier played in obtaining court-approved surveillance of Page, who joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 as member of its foreign policy team.\u00a0The dossier is a series of reports on supposed contacts between Russian officials and members of the Trump campaign, and it alleges the Kremlin has compromising information on Trump.", "The GOP memo says the FBI and DOJ abused the FISA process by relying heavily on the Steele dossier.", "\u201cThe \u2018dossier\u2019 compiled by Christopher Steele (Steele dossier) on behalf of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign formed an essential part of the Carter Page FISA application,\u201d according to the GOP memo. It also says that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had privately testified before the House intelligence committee in December \u201cthat no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.\u201d", "The Democratic memo does not verify any of that, despite what Trump suggests. In fact, the heavily redacted Democratic memo says the DOJ used multiple sources and had probable cause to conduct surveillance.", "The Democratic memo says: \u201cThe FBI had an independent basis for investigating Page\u2019s motivations and actions during the campaign, transition, and following the inauguration. As DOJ described in detail to the Court, Page had an extensive record as [redacted] prior to joining the Trump campaign. He resided in Moscow from 2004-2007 and pursued business deals with Russia\u2019s state-owned energy company Gazprom. [Redacted.] As early as [redacted], a Russian intelligence officer [redacted] targeted Page for recruitment. Page showed [redacted].\u201d", "It\u00a0also says, \u201cDOJ detailed Page\u2019s past relationships with Russian spies and interaction with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign, [redacted]. DOJ cited multiple sources to support the case for surveilling Page \u2014 but made only narrow use of information from Steele\u2019s sources about Page\u2019s specific activities in 2016, chiefly his suspected July 2016 meetings in Moscow with Russian officials. [Redacted.] In fact, the FBI interviewed Page in March 2016 about his contact with Russian intelligence, the very month candidate Donald Trump named him a foreign policy advisor.\u201d", "Under the law, the government can conduct surveillance on a U.S. person for 90 days and must produce \u201cnew findings\u201d in order to gain an extension.\u00a0The initial FISA application was approved in October 2016, and\u00a0three subsequent applications were approved\u00a0in January, April and June 2017. All four were\u00a0appointed by Republican presidents, the Democratic memo notes.", "As for McCabe\u2019s closed-door congressional testimony, the White House told us that the Democratic memo did not challenge the GOP memo\u2019s characterization of what McCabe said \u2014 that the FBI would not have sought FISA surveillance of Page without the Steele dossier. By not addressing that point, the Democratic memo is essentially \u201cconfirming\u201d it, the White House said.", "The Democratic memo does not address that particular part of McCabe\u2019s testimony. But the Democrats in a separate \u201cfact sheet\u201d released the same day say \u201cMcCabe did not, as the Majority claims, \u2018testif[y]\u2019 that \u2018no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele Dossier information\u2019 and did not accept the Majority\u2019s premise that the application relied on Steele\u2019s entire \u2018dossier.\u2019 Instead, he defended the FBI and DOJ\u2019s assessment that every component of the application \u2014 to include the specific reporting about Page \u2014 was necessary and appropriate to present to the Court.\u201d", "The Republican memo suggests that the FBI paid Steele for the dossier but did not disclose that fact to the FISA court.", "\u201cThe application does not mention \u2026 that the FBI had separately authorized payment to Steele for the same information\u201d he collected for the Clinton campaign and the DNC.", "The Democratic memo flatly states that Steele was not paid.", "\u201cDOJ never paid Steele for the \u2018dossier,\u2019\u201d the memo says. \u201cAs the FBI\u2019s records and Committee testimony confirms, although the FBI initially considered compensation \u2026 Steele ultimately never received payment from the FBI for any \u2018dossier\u2019-related information.\u201d", "The Republicans conceded this point in their response to the Democratic memo. In their response, the Republicans emphasized that their memo said the FBI \u201cauthorized payment to Steele\u201d without saying whether the FBI actually paid Steele.", "\u201cAs clearly stated in the GOP memo, FBI authorized payment to Steele for the dossier information \u2014 before he was terminated as an FBI source for making unauthorized disclosures to the media,\u201d the Republican response said. \u201cThis financial motivation was not disclosed to the Court.\u201d (Emphasis is in the Republican response.)", "The Republican memo says that Steele admitted to former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr in September 2016 that he \u201dwas desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.\u201d This information was not disclosed to the FISA court, the memo says.", "At the time, Ohr was\u00a0director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces in the Department of Justice. He was not assigned to the Russia counterintelligence investigation. As both memos note, Ohr had a prior professional relationship with Steele.", "In an email to us, the White House cited that September conversation as evidence that Steele was biased and the court was not aware of his bias. The White House claimed that the Democratic memo \u201cfailed to rebut\u201d the Republican memo\u2019s account of Steele\u2019s conversation with Ohr and the fact that the FISA application did not disclose that conversation.", "\u201cLaw enforcement officials knew that Steele adamantly opposed Donald Trump,\u201d but they \u201capparently did not include this information in its FISA applications,\u201d the White House told us.", "The Democratic memo does not address what Steele may have told Ohr about his feelings toward Trump. But\u00a0it does note that Ohr did not tell the FBI about Steele\u2019s information on the Trump campaign until late November 2016.", "\u201cThis occurred weeks after the election and more than a month after the Court approved the initial FISA application,\u201d the Democratic memo says. (Emphasis is in the memo.)", "Also, as we noted earlier, the court was aware that Steele was working for \u201ca U.S.-based law firm\u201d that had hired Fusion GPS to conduct research regarding Trump\u2019s \u201cties to Russia,\u201d as the FISA application said.", "The White House also noted that the Democratic memo did not address the fact that Ohr\u2019s wife worked for Fusion GPS and \u201cin that capacity helped perform opposition research on Donald Trump.\u201d The Democratic memo acknowledged that fact, but disputed the Republican memo\u2019s claim that it was relevant to the initial FISA application or subsequent renewals.", "\u201cIn late November 2016, Ohr informed the FBI of his prior professional relationship with Steele and information that Steele shared with him (including Steele\u2019s concern about Trump being compromised by Russia),\u201d the Democratic memo says. \u201cHe also described his wife\u2019s contract work with Fusion GPS, the firm that hired Steele separately.\u201d", "But, again, the FBI didn\u2019t learn of that fact until after the first FISA application was filed and approved on Oct. 21, 2016. And, as we noted, the subsequent FISA approvals required \u201cnew findings\u201d to justify extending the surveillance of Page.", "In their memo, the Republicans questioned why the FISA application mentioned\u00a0George Papadopoulos \u2014 who, like Page, was a Trump foreign policy adviser.", "\u201cThe Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos,\u201d the Republican memo says.", "The Democratic memo says it was relevant information because the FBI investigation into Russia\u2019s election meddling was triggered in late July when the FBI learned about contacts between Papadopoulos and \u201cindividuals linked to Russia.\u201d Papadopoulos would later plead guilty to making false statements to the FBI and, in doing so, admitted that he learned in April 2016 that Russia possessed \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton \u201cin the form of \u2018thousands of emails,\u2019\u201d according to\u00a0a statement from the Justice Department stipulating the facts of the case\u00a0against\u00a0Papadopoulos.", "\u201cIn claiming that there is \u2018no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos,\u2019 the Majority misstates the reason why DOJ specifically explained Russia\u2019s courting of Papadopoulos,\u201d the Democratic memo says. \u201cPapadopoulos\u2019s interaction with Russian agents, coupled with real-time evidence of Russian election interference, provided the Court with a broader context in which to evaluate Russia\u2019s clandestine activities and Page\u2019s history and alleged contact with Russian officials.\u201d", "In many instances, the Republican and Democratic memos present the same set of facts.\u00a0But the Republican and Democratic members present or interpret these facts differently.", "Both memos, for example, agree that the \u201cPapadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016,\u201d as the GOP memo says. But that means, as the Democratic memo notes, that the FBI investigation started \u201cmore than seven weeks\u201d before the FBI received Steele\u2019s intelligence reporting in mid-September.", "Both memos agree that the government did not disclose the names of the parties \u2014 the Clinton campaign and the DNC \u2014 that paid for Steele\u2019s information. But the Democratic memo quotes extensively from the initial FISA application to show the court was aware that Steele\u2019s information was paid political opposition research and likely to be used against Trump\u2019s campaign.", "The memos also agree that the FBI \u201csought and received a FISA probable cause order \u2026\u00a0authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page\u201d on Oct. 21, 2016, as the Republican memo says. And they\u00a0agree that there were three subsequent renewals of the initial surveillance request and \u201ceach renewal requires a separate finding of probable cause,\u201d as the GOP memo says.", "But the Republican memo accuses the FBI and DOJ of omitting \u201cmaterial and relevant\u00a0information\u201d that was \u201cpotentially favorable\u201d to Page on all four occasions. The FBI disagrees with that assessment, accusing the Republican memo of distorting the facts.", "In a statement issued two days before the Republican memo was released, the FBI said:\u00a0\u201cAs expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo\u2019s accuracy.\u201d", "The common set of facts contained in both reports leads the president to claim that\u00a0the Democratic memo \u201creally verifies the Nunes memo.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t. The memos represent a fundamental disagreement about the U.S. government\u2019s methods and motives as it investigates\u00a0Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential campaign and whether anyone associated with the Trump campaign was involved in those efforts.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please see \u201cTimeline of Russia Investigation\u201d for more information on key events in the investigation, and \u201cQ&A on the Nunes Memo\u201d for more about the Republican memo.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
