Referencing his Kenyan background, Obama purportedly said his African descent would not allow him to let \u201cwhite people kill Africans with their toxic vaccine\u201d.", "A search using CrowdTangle \u2013 a social media monitoring tool \u2013 \u00a0revealed the same claim was shared on Facebook here, here, here and here.", "Similar posts circulated in French on Facebook\u00a0(here and here for instance) as well as on Twitter (here, here and here).", "The online claim re-emerged after Western countries started rolling out \u00a0Covid-19 vaccines in December 2020, as AFP reported here.", "Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic a year ago, Obama has spoken on several occasions about the novel coronavirus which has caused the death of more than 1.84 million people including nearly 400,000 in the United States as of January 4, 2020.", "However, there is no official evidence that Obama encouraged Africans to refuse vaccination in any of his public speeches.", "His spokesperson, Katie Hill, also denied that he had made the comments, according to the American news agency Associated Press (AP) in April, 2020.", "\u201cWith COVID cases surging worse than ever, getting vaccinated is one of the most important things we can do,\u201d Obama also said on his Twitter account on December 21, 2020.", "With COVID cases surging worse than ever, getting vaccinated is one of the most important things we can do.

Bush and Bill Clinton said they were ready to be vaccinated publicly.
