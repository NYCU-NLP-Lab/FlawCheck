The Occupy movement is now less demonstrative, with more strategic protests against banks and other businesses for various practices.", "So what does Hougesen have to prove she\u2019s right about Nunn? She pointed to an op-ed that Nunn wrote in The Washington Post a few days before Christmas 2011 titled \"Millennials to business: Social responsibility isn\u2019t optional.\" It contained a few references to the Occupy movement.", "Here\u2019s what we know about Nunn. She is the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, a Democrat who is respected by many conservatives on national security issues. She is the chief executive officer of the Points of Light Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan volunteer organization inspired by then-President George H.W. Bush. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the foundation brought in $55 million in revenue in 2011 and mobilized 4 million volunteers worldwide for a range of causes last year. Neil Bush, son of the former president, is the board chairman.", "Being in charge of a nonpartisan volunteer organization requires skill in working with people of all political positions. As an elected official once told us \"I have friends on both sides of the issue and I always support my friends.\" One recent Nunn blog post on the Points of Light website had a picture of Republican strategist Karl Rove and Democratic Party organizer Donna Brazile dancing together at a conference.", "So what did Nunn write about it in her op-ed?", "\"The Occupy Wall Street movement is largely fueled by a relatively small set of young people who view the protests as a fight for their future,\" her op-ed began. \"The vast majority, however, are getting up and going to work every day \u2014 or wishing they could.

As consumers, employees and entrepreneurs, Millennials are shifting the norms of corporate America\u2019s conduct, ethical imperatives and purpose.\"", "Most of the article was about millennials, people typically born between 1980 and 2000.

Perhaps misrepresentation is the game of the day in DC but we have higher standards in Georgia,\" said Giffin, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada who now is a partner at the influential law firm McKenna Long & Aldridge.", "This was a tough call for us. To sum up, the NRSC claimed that Nunn praised the Occupy movement.
