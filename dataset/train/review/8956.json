Organizing for Action claimed Generation Opportunity used the campaign to \"bribe young folks out of getting health insurance.\"", "But Generation Opportunity\u2019s events were open to everyone, Pasch said. Attendees at the tailgates and happy hours didn\u2019t need to swear off the health care reform before snagging a free T-shirt or drink.", "Also, the campaign\u2019s goal is not to encourage young Americans to go without health care. It\u2019s to get them to look into alternative coverage options to the online marketplaces, such as private plans that still fit the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 10 essential benefit requirements. Those plans still fulfill the law\u2019s individual mandate, which requires everyone to have health insurance.", "\"We never have (and never will) advocate young people forgo health insurance,\" Pasch said.", "Our ruling", "Organizing for Action said Generation Opportunity is \"going to college campuses, giving away free booze to try to bribe young folks out of getting health insurance.\"", "The Koch brothers-backed group holds Opt-Out events to encourage young people to consider buying health insurance off the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.
