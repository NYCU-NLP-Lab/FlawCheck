["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 21, 2018", "Q: Did President Barack Obama in 2009 have a journalist named Brenda Lee removed from Air Force One?", "A: No. Lee, a newspaper contributor, was physically removed from a press area outside the aircraft in Los Angeles \u2014 before Obama arrived.", "Was journalist Brenda Lee from Georgia, physically removed from Air Force One in 2009 by Obama\u2019s order?", "After sparring with President Donald Trump during a press conference earlier this month, CNN reporter Jim Acosta was subsequently stripped of his White House press credentials.", "The action triggered an outcry from the journalism community, with many media organizations, including Fox News,\u00a0signaling support for CNN\u2019s legal challenge to the White House\u2019s decision. Days after a judge temporarily sided with CNN, the White House fully restored Acosta\u2019s press pass \u2014 and the cable network ended its lawsuit.", "But the episode also prompted some to share a now viral\u00a0meme that distorts an incident involving a newspaper contributor that happened during President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure \u2014 which many readers have asked us about.", "\u201cThis is Brenda Lee, a journalist from the Georgia Informer being physically removed from Air Force One in 2009 by Obama\u2019s order,\u201d the meme claims. \u201cShe didn\u2019t grab anyone like Jim Acosta did. Brenda was removed for being Pro-Life.\u201d", "That\u2019s not what happened.", "Posted by Lilith Samael on\u00a0Saturday, November 10, 2018", "While the photo in the meme is indeed of a woman named\u00a0Brenda Lee being carried out of a press area at Los Angeles International Airport, Lee was not aboard Air Force One (which can be seen in the background). And, according to the Associated Press\u2019 coverage of the incident at the time, Obama did not arrive at the airport to board Air Force One until about 10 minutes later.", "As the AP reported, Lee \u2014 who\u00a0identified as a Catholic priestess and wrote columns for a monthly publication then called the\u00a0Georgia Informer\u00a0\u2014 said she wanted to give Obama a letter urging him \u201cto take a stand for traditional marriage.\u201d", "After a Secret Service agent denied her request to give it to the president, the agent referred Lee to a White House staffer and Lee refused to give the letter to the staffer, according to Lee\u2019s account. Lee said she was escorted outside the gate and then briefly allowed back in before ultimately being told she had to leave. Despite her attempts to protest, video shows, security officers picked her up and carried her from the press area.", "Whether or not Lee had White House-issued press credentials \u2014 and had that access revoked, as the meme insinuates \u2014 isn\u2019t clear. At the time, Lee told the AP that she did have White House credentials; in another\u00a0interview\u00a0she said she had a press pass and was authorized to be there. Lee died last year.\u00a0Her obituary described her as a contributor to the Georgia Informer and Savannah Herald. The Trump White House did not respond to our inquiry, and the White House Correspondents Association said it would not have such a record.", "What we do know is that the assertion that Lee was \u201cremoved from Air Force One in 2009 by Obama\u2019s order\u201d is unsupported. There is no evidence that suggests she was on the plane, or that Obama had her removed.", "That\u2019s not to say Obama had no issues with journalists. We\u2019ve previously written about the Obama administration\u2019s battles with the press \u2014 including surveilling a Fox News reporter and a willingness to exclude the cable network from some interviews.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Hoag, Christina. \u201cKicking & Screaming: Journo Dragged From Near Air Force One.\u201d Associated Press. 13 Jul 2009.", "Kiely, Eugene. \u201cObama, Fox News and the Free Press.\u201d FactCheck.org. 13 Sep 2018.", "\u201cPriestess Brenda Slater Lee | 1950 \u2013 2017 | Obituary.\u201d Hart\u2019s Mortuary and Crematory.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
