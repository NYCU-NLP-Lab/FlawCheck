That announcement, compelled by court order, reversed a federal rule issued by the Trump administration on June 30, 2017, that removed those protections from the Yellowstone population.", "The court order is the result of a ruling out of the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana in the case \u201cCrow Indian Tribe et al. v.

Moreover, the Service's analysis of the threats faced by the Greater Yellowstone grizzly segment was arbitrary and capricious.", "In its own announcement about the relisting of grizzlies, the Fish and Wildlife Service made clear it was in response to the Montana court order, stating that \u201cthis action was taken to comply with a September 24, 2018, Montana District Court order.\u201d", "In response to the agency's announcement, U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., wrote a news release critical of the move. The release included an allegation that radicals were destroying the \u201cWestern way of life\u201d:", "The court-ordered relisting of the grizzly was not based on science or facts, but was rather the result of excessive litigation pursued by radical environmentalists intent on destroying our Western way of life.", "Prior to the ruling, NPR reported, \u201cWildlife agencies in Wyoming and Idaho planned to let hunters kill up to 23 grizzlies during its first hunting season for the bears in three decades.\u201d", "In their coverage of the grizzly announcement, Native News Online ran a story, shared heavily on social media, with the headline, \u201cRep.

However, because the people who won that legal battle were entirely made up of Native American tribes, organizations, or individuals, the inference that the \u201cradical environmentalists\u201d she was referring to were Native American tribes is supported by the history of the case.
