In its proper context, Chapter 1, Verse 14 of the Gospel of John reads:", "He came unto his own, and his own received him not.", "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:", "Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.", "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.", "John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.", "And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.", "The billboard is real, and the photographs of it shared on social media in early November are authentic.

We prayed that the facebook page would be a community for fellow Christians to be encouraged at what God is doing in the world and to find out how they could, like our president, be a part of being God\u2019s presence in making America great. But the hateful comments and mean spiritedness from liberals and atheists drowned out the voices of Christians in this country. These reflect the level of unfair deranged media attacks on the President in general and his supporters.", "Our billboard IS NOT equating Jesus with President Donald Trump.
