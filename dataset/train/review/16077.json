["\u201cBiden Fakes Interview, Green Screen Fails,\u201d says the title of a YouTube video uploaded on March 17, 2021 and viewed more than 500,000 times.", "The video shows the president walking toward reporters on the White House lawn, until one of his hands appears to go through a microphone, which some viewers interpreted as proof that reporters were not actually present.", "\u201cBiden is the most transparent president is history, he\u2019s so transparent that he can move through physical objects,\u201d one of them commented.", "The YouTube user who uploaded the video wrote in his description that the footage \u201cproves the reporters were not there.\u201d", "Speculation that the interaction between Biden and reporters was faked seems to have begun on Twitter on March 17, 2021\u00a0after users said that footage published by ABC News and The Hill appeared suspicious.", "\u201cJoe Biden is 100% standing in front of a green screen,\u201d one Twitter user wrote. Instagram and Facebook users have also shared the claim.", "However, the interpretation of the video is wrong.", "The interaction between Biden and reporters took place on the White House lawn on March 16, just before he boarded Marine One for a flight to Pennsylvania\u00a0to promote his Covid-19 relief plan.", "Steve Herman, the White House correspondent for Voice of America, was the one holding the large fuzzy gray microphone that Biden\u2019s hand appears to go through. On Twitter, he shut down the claims as \u201cnonsense.\u201d", "I was the one holding the lighter-colored fuzzy microphone and thus literally in front of @POTUS on the South Lawn. It's all real.

This absence has led to criticism from various media outlets as well as some conservatives, and prompted online conspiracy theories.", "He does take a small number of questions at daily events, and his Press Secretary Jen Psaki gives a lengthy briefing to the press each day.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
