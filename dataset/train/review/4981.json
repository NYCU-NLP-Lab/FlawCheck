["\u201cNO Fox News in Canada\u201d says one version of the post, shared more than 20,000 times in Canada across several accounts. It also claims: \u201cThe Radio Act makes it a crime to lie to the public via airwaves.\u201d", "Variations of the claim have been shared in the United States and Australia, some as early as 2011.", "The core claim that the Fox News Channel is not available in Canada is false.\n\n\tThe Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the distribution in Canada of the US-based Fox News Channel in 2004 and according to the Fox News website, the channel is currently available through 16 cable or satellite providers, with two also providing the Fox Business channel.", "The CRTC\u2019s website confirms this on its list of \u201cprogramming services and stations authorized for distribution.\u201d", "\u201cWe can confirm Shaw Cable and Shaw Direct do indeed carry the Fox News channel for customers in Canada,\u201d Chethan Lakshman, vice president for external affairs at Shaw Communications, Canada\u2019s second largest television provider, told AFP in an email.", "The CRTC had previously approved a license for a new Fox News Canada channel in 2003. Fox later chose not to launch the station, writing to the CRTC that \u201cFox News does not intend to implement this service and therefore will not meet the extended deadline to commence operations.\u201d", "\u2018Radio Act\u2019", "Hank Intven, Adjunct Professor of Law at the University of Victoria, said by email: \u201cThere is no \u2018Radio Act\u2019 in Canada. We have a \u2018Radiocommunication Act\u2019, but it deals mostly with the radio spectrum, not broadcasting content.\u201d", "However, Canada\u2019s Broadcasting Distribution Regulations of 1997 do state that broadcasters cannot distribute a programming service that contains any false or misleading news.", "\u201cFox could be subject to complaints, but it clearly meets whatever basic regulatory requirements are in place to be included within the available broadcast distribution services,\u201d Michael Geist, a law professor at the University of Ottawa told AFP via Twitter.", "\u201cClaims that they've been kept out due to the Radio Act are very old and were debunked many years ago,\u201d he said.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
