I\u2019ve talked before about a 2-cent wealth tax, but the whole idea behind it is we could do early childhood education and good quality child care, universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America, and we can stop exploiting the people \u2014 largely black and brown women \u2014 who do this work and raise the wages of every child care worker and preschool teacher in America.", "Maybe so, but it would cost those with more than $1 billion in net worth 6% of their wealth over that amount, not 2%.", "Biden and Sanders argued over the cost of Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan.
