["Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign wrongly suggested in the moments before the Iowa caucuses that Ben Carson would suspend his campaign. It wasn\u2019t true, and Carson supporters were furious.", "Cruz has apologized. But he said at the Feb. 6, 2016, Republican debate that the real culprit was CNN.", "\"Let me tell you the facts that occurred for those who are interested in knowing,\" Cruz said. \"On Monday night, about 6:30 p.m. CNN reported that Ben was not going from Iowa to New Hampshire or South Carolina. Rather he was \u2018taking a break from campaigning.\u2019 They reported that on television. CNN\u2019s political anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer said it was \u2018highly unusual\u2019 and \u2018highly significant.\u2019 My political team saw CNN\u2019s report, breaking news, and forwarded that news to our volunteers.\"", "According to CNN, what Cruz said \"is categorically false.\"", "We agree that Cruz's description is highly misleading.", "Here\u2019s how it all unfolded on caucus night.", "Between 6:41 p.m. and 6:43 p.m. central time, CNN\u2019s senior political reporter Chris Moody sent a series of tweets reporting that Carson \"won\u2019t go to NH/SC will head home to Florida for some R&R\" but \"Carson\u2019s campaign tells me he plans to stay in the race beyond Iowa no matter what the results are tonight.\"", "Two minutes later, CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and Jake Tapper report Carson\u2019s travel plans during a live broadcast of the caucuses. Bash and Tapper both say that this is \"very unusual\" and anchor Wolf Blitzer adds that it is \"very significant news.\" But CNN does not say Carson is suspending his campaign. Here\u2019s a transcript:", "Tapper: \"CNN has learned some news about the man who, at least according to polls, is in fourth place here in Iowa. Now, Dana, a week from tomorrow, we\u2019re all going to be doing this again for the New Hampshire primary. So almost every single candidate is going to be going directly from here to New Hampshire to campaign \u2014 except for the man in fourth place, who a few months ago was in first place here, Dr. Ben Carson. What have we learned?\"", "Bash: \"That\u2019s right. We should say that our Chris Moody is breaking this news, that Ben Carson is going to go back to Florida to his home, regardless of how he does tonight here in Iowa. He\u2019s going to go there for several days. And then afterwards, he\u2019s not going to go to South Carolina. He\u2019s not going to go to New Hampshire. He\u2019s going to come to Washington, D.C., and he\u2019s going to do that because the National Prayer Breakfast is on Thursday. And people who have been following Ben Carson\u2019s career know that that\u2019s really where he got himself on the political map, attending that prayer breakfast, and really giving it to President Obama at the time. And he became kind of a hero among conservatives, among evangelicals especially.\"", "Tapper: \"But it\u2019s very unusual...\"", "Bash: \"Very unusual.\"", "Tapper: \"...to be announcing that you\u2019re going to go home to rest for a few days, not going on to the next site. Plus, he\u2019s already announced that he\u2019s going to be coming out and speaking at 9:15 local and 10:15 Eastern, no matter whether or not we know the results, because he wants to get home and get ahead of the storm.\"", "Bash: \"Look, if you want to be president of the United States, you don\u2019t go home to Florida. I mean, that\u2019s bottom line. That\u2019s the end of the story. If you want to signal to your supporters that you want it, that you\u2019re hungry for it, that you want them to get out and and campaign, you\u2019ve got to be out there doing it too. And he\u2019s not doing it. It\u2019s very unusual.\"", "Tapper: \"Very unusual news that CNN has just learned. CNN\u2019s Chris Moody breaking the story. Wolf, back to you in Washington.\"", "Blitzer: \"Very significant news indeed, guys, thanks very much.\"", "During the discussion, CNN's lower-third graphic does say \"CAMPAIGN: CARSON TO TAKE A BREAK AFTER IOWA.\"", "At 6:53 p.m., Carson spokesman Jason Osborne tweets that the candidate \"will be going back to Florida to get fresh clothes b4 heading back out on the campaign trail. Not standing down.\"", "Three minutes later, according to Breitbart, the Cruz campaign sends an email telling supporters, \"The press is reporting that Dr. Ben Carson is taking time off from the campaign trail after Iowa and making a big announcement.\"", "Here\u2019s an image of the email via the Huffington Post:", "Things get worse at approximately 7 p.m., when the caucuses opened. Cruz supporters using the campaign\u2019s mobile app received a message informing them that Carson \"will stop campaigning after Iowa.\"", "At 7:07 p.m., Cruz surrogate \u00a0and Iowa Rep. Steve King retweets Moody, adding, \"#iacaucus Skipping NH & SC is the equivalent of suspending. Too bad this information won't get to all caucus goers.\" An hour later, King sends another Tweet to the same effect.", "For what it\u2019s worth, Cruz acknowledged earlier in the week that CNN\u2019s reporting that night was accurate.", "\"CNN got it correct. Miracles happen. But that is part of the democratic process to let Iowa causers know, here is the news that is breaking. And it is relevant,\" Cruz said Feb. 3.", "Our ruling", "Cruz said that it was CNN, not his campaign, that first reported that Carson \"taking a break from campaigning,\" and his campaign forwarded that news to his supporters.", "Cruz's campaign took a nugget of information from CNN and took it too far. CNN reported that Carson was \"to take a break after Iowa,\" while simultaneously noting that Carson would ultimately continue campaigning.", "The Cruz campaign sent messages on its app anyway, saying that Carson would \"stop\" his campaign. A key surrogate said that Carson was doing \"the equivalent of suspending.\" That\u2019s more than simply \"forwarding\" news.", "We rate Cruz\u2019s claim False.", "Update: This item was updated to include a description of CNN's lower-third graphic.", "IQ media clips", "Twitter, Matt Dornic, Feb. 6, 2016", "CNN, \"Ted Cruz's claims about CNN are 'false',\" Feb. 4, 2016", "Twitter, Chris Moody, Feb. 1, 2016", "Twitter, Jason Osborne, Feb. 1, 2016", "Breitbart, \"The Definitive Timeline: Cruz-Carson-CNN Controversy,\" Feb. 4, 2016", "Twitter, Steve King, Feb. 1, 2016", "CNN, \"Ted Cruz: 'CNN got it correct',\" Feb. 4, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
