However, the size is more than 22 meters with a width of four meters.", "This creature is far too large to be a squid of any type. According to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the giant squid has an estimated maximum length of thirteen meters, nearly ten meters shy of the animal that was found in Indonesia. The colossal squid, the precisely named world's largest squid, is also too small to be the pictured animal, as it only reaches an estimated maximum length of around fourteen meters, or 45 feet.", "So what is it?
