["\u201cGod have mercy, could this be rapture ohh?\u201d reads a Facebook post shared more than\u00a026,000 times since it was published in July 2019. It continues to be shared two years later.", "\u201cScary: Cemetery in Thailand dawned like this today, with all the graves open and without any corpse and so far no one can explain what he hears, mystery remains on the site. JESUS is coming soon,\u201d reads the rest of the caption.", "The video shows\u00a0rows of sunken, open graves.", "The same claim was shared here and here on Facebook.", "However, there is no truth to the claim that the footage offers evidence of the rapture, nor was the video filmed\u00a0in Thailand.", "A reverse image search of multiple keyframes from the video revealed that the scene was filmed in a cemetery in the Tajikistan village of Shurkurgan, near the city of Konibodom in Sughd province.", "This brief online report from June 3, 2019, attributed to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFERL) describes how the graves collapsed after a river on the outskirts of the village overflowed its banks the day before and flooded the area.", "The report included a photograph of the aftermath and a 10-second clip of the destruction, which was posted to YouTube by Ozodivideo, the Tajik service of RFERL. The caption reads: \u201cThe mudflow destroyed the Shurkurgan cemetery in Konibodom.\u201d", "Although not identical to the video posted on Facebook claiming to show a Thai cemetery, the short clip clearly comes from the same location. A longer version of it can be viewed here, along with detailed reporting of the rainfall that devastated parts of Tajikistan two years ago.", "AFP Fact Check found yet another video using the Yandex search engine. The translated caption on this video is titled \u201cSH.Konibodom after the flood\u201d and shows the aftermath of the destruction, seemingly filmed through the perimeter wall.", "A tall black mast is visible in this footage, matching part of a previous video where the base of this structure can be seen.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
