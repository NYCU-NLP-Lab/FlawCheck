Omar of Minnesota, a Muslim woman who came to the United States from Somalia as a child refugee.

He\u00a0tweeted\u00a0about the decision on April 17.", "\"Some folks are asking why I directed the return of Rep. Omar\u2019s donation. I did this weeks ago because I vigorously disagree with any anti-semitic comments. Since this time, dangerous and hateful attacks have started against her... \" McCready tweeted.", "\"I condemn in the strongest terms the hateful rhetoric against her, the Muslim community and people of color.

Omar has a long and well-documented history of anti-Semitic remarks,\" Proud said in an email, referencing the 2012 tweet. \"So (McCready) should have never taken a cent from her in the first place.\"", "McCready spokesman Matt Fried, contacted by PolitiFact Friday, said McCready would rather serve his community than wade into a hostile and unproductive debate.", "\"It\u2019s clear politicians in Washington have lost touch with the American values that define us as patriots and when they put hate \u2014 of any kind \u2014 above love for country, we damage this nation to its core,\" Fried said in an email. \"That\u2019s why on Wednesday Dan McCready was in Mint Hill announcing his\u00a0national service plan\u00a0and calling on more young Americans to serve their country, through the military like Dan did, or through civilian service like AmeriCorps.\"", "OUR RULING", "Bishop said McCready \"took money from Ilhan Omar.\" Omar did donate to McCready\u2019s campaign last fall.
