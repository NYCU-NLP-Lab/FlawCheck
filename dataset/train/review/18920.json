There was never any doubt about what the president was doing. He didn't need any bucking up.\"", "The same day, the Christian Science Monitor published: \"Margaret Thatcher: 'This is no time to go wobbly' and other memorable quotes.\" The New York Times mentioned the line in her obituary.", "Is the quote just \"an old wives\u2019 story\"?", "Bush and Thatcher", "We\u2019ve reviewed speeches, transcripts, books and more, and we can tell you: Bush and Thatcher agree that she said it.", "Bush himself publicly told the story in a 1991 speech as he awarded Thatcher the Medal of Freedom. He mentioned it in a 1998 book. She mentioned it in her 1993 memoirs and in a Frontline interview.", "But the popular account of her admonition that \"this is no time to go wobbly\" has taken on a life of its own \u2014 one doesn\u2019t match Bush and Thatcher\u2019s accounts.", "In Bush and Thatcher\u2019s versions, it happened during a phone call three weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait.", "The leaders disagreed about how to respond to ships leaving Iraq in defiance of U.N. sanctions.

Security Council \u2014 a historic collaboration Baker later said marked the true end of the Cold War.", "Thatcher, on the other hand, urged prompt action.", "Bush says in his 1998 book she warned him \"this is no time to go wobbly\" around Aug. 22 as he explained why they would delay using force until they got specific authorization from the U.N. on Aug. 25. Thatcher says in her 1993 memoir she warned \"this was no time to go wobbly\" as he explained on Aug. 26 why, even with new U.N. authorization to enforce sanctions, they would let a ship through.", "But some accounts place the quote earlier \u2014 on Aug. 2, the same day that Iraq invaded. That timing suggests Thatcher bolstered Bush\u2019s early response, such as his declaration Aug. 5 on the White House lawn that \"this will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.\"", "In one account, she made the remarks on Aug. 2 \u00a0in \"an aside at an Aspen Institute conference,\" as reported by the Christian Science Monitor.", "In another, she made the comment on that same trip to Aspen, Colo., but in the vacation home of diplomat Henry Catto, according the New York Times, which cited Catto\u2019s autobiography.", "But those accounts don\u2019t match the recollection of Philip Zelikow, a National Security Council staffer under Bush, or of Bush\u2019s national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, who spoke about it in 1996.
