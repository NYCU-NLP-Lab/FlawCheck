Cory Booker (D-NJ). \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be just like this president to choose Hitler to serve on the Supreme Court?\u201d", "This article was not \"literally\" true, of course. Not a single mainstream news source reported that any such demand was made by Democrats, nor that Sen. Cory Booker said it would be \"just like this president\" to choose Hitler. No such discussion can be found in C-SPAN video coverage of the hearings. And if Adolf Hitler were alive today, he would be 129 years old.", "In point of fact, the article was a work of satire making fun of Democrats' partisan reactions to the appointee's conservative record. This point becomes more and more obvious the further one reads:", "As the hearings started up Tuesday morning, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) claimed that Kavanaugh\u2019s judicial decisions \u201cput him on the same level as Hitler.\u201d He added: \u201cHow can we know he\u2019s not der F\u00fchrer until we have DNA proof?\u201d He then grilled Kavanaugh: \u201cAre you now or have you ever been ADOLF HITLER HIMSELF, GOOD SIR???\u201d", "The spoof originally appeared on the Babylon Bee website, whose disclaimer states that \u201cThe Babylon Bee Is Your Trusted Source for Christian News Satire.\u201d", "Cope, Kevin and Joshua Fischman. \u00a0 \"It's Hard to Find a Federal Judge More Conservative Than Brett Kavanaugh.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 5 September 2018.", "The Babylon Bee. \u00a0 \"Democrats Demand Kavanaugh Submit to DNA Test to Prove He\u2019s Not Actually Hitler.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 4 September 2018.", "C-SSPAN. \u00a0 \"Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh Confirmation Hearing.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 4 September 2018.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
