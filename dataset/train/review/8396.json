Any similarities between this site\u2019s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical.", "Although the Patriot Post labels its content as fiction, its stories \u2014 like many of its ilk \u2014 are frequently republished on web sites that carry no such disclaimers. This story, for instance, was presented as a genuine news article with no disclaimer to speak of on the web site Daily Flash News, Viral USA and Right Thing USA, making it less \"satire\" and more \"corrosive disinformation.\" But regardless of where this story was shared or whether or not it should be classified as fake news, satire, or worse, the claim that the Jacksonville Jaguars filed bankruptcy over \"kneeling thugs\" is false.", "The Jacksonville Jaguars have experienced relatively small crowds during the 2017 season, but the team did not announce that they were filing for bankruptcy.", "Heilman, Phillip. \u00a0 \"Smallest Home Crowd Since 2009 Sees Jaguars Lose to Rams.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Jacksonville.com. \u00a0 16 October 2017.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
