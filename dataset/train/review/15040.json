["Following reports that NASA's Perseverance rover touched down\u00a0on the surface of\u00a0Mars on Feb. 18, many false images\u00a0and videos claiming to depict the landing have surfaced on social media.", "One post now claims to show the first image of a sunset\u00a0on Mars.", "\"First ever pic of the sunset on Mars. 2021,\" reads a March 13 Facebook post with over 1,900 shares and over 100 reactions. Accompanying the text is\u00a0the purported Mars sunset image with\u00a0blue tones.", "Many users shared their reaction to the photo in the comments writing, \"Extraordinary!\" \"Spectacular!\" and \"Looks just like in the movies.\"", "The same claim\u00a0recently went viral on\u00a0Twitter, where it was shared in a\u00a0March 12\u00a0tweet that\u00a0had over 1,200 likes and over 300 retweets before apparently being deleted. In the replies, the user credited another\u00a0Facebook post with almost 3,000 shares as its source of the image.", "In a message to USA TODAY, that\u00a0Facebook user pointed to July 22 article\u00a0from Argoonautas.com. The article\u00a0features the photo and claims it is the most recent image of the sunset taken on Mars.", "USA TODAY reached out to the other Facebook user for comment.", "Fact check: Viral video doesn't reveal sights, sounds of Mars from Perseverance rover", "A reverse Google search of the image reveals that the photo included in the claim is actually\u00a0an illustration of a sunset on Mars created by Mark Garlick.\u00a0It is part of the Science Photo Library and available via Getty Images.", "\"Illustration of a sunset on Mars. Dust and small particles suspended in the Martian atmosphere scatter light in the direction of the Sun forward,\" the illustration's caption reads. \"This creates a blue halo around the setting Sun, rendering a Martian landscape quite different from its terrestrial equivalent. It's the same process as occurs on Earth, except that Mars' atmosphere is much thinner.\"", "On Earth,\u00a0blue light is scattered all over the sky during the day, while on Mars, the blue color is only apparent at sunset and sunrise due to the planet's thin atmosphere, according to the image's caption.", "The martian sunset\u00a0illustration is also available on other sites including Fine Art America\u00a0and Science Photo Library.", "Garlick,\u00a0a freelance illustrator, author and computer\u00a0animator\u00a0who specializes in earth sciences, technology, astronomy, space and science fiction,\u00a0shared his illustration along with other artwork of Mars to Twitter on Dec. 3, 2018.", "USA TODAY has previously debunked images claiming to come from space that are actually illustrations.", "Fact check:Viral photo of Earth, Venus and Jupiter from Mars isn't real", "According to Space.com, NASA officials said the Viking 1 lander was the first to capture the sun setting on the surface of Mars on Aug. 21, 1976.", "On June 14, 1978, Viking 2 captured a sunrise on Mars and since then, both sunrises and sunsets have been recorded by Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity rovers and other missions, per a 2019 statement from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.", "\"It's easier to see some details in the raw versions, but the latter more accurately show the images as the human eye would see them,\" the statement reads. \"Much farther from Mars than it is from Earth, the Sun appears only about two-thirds the size that it does when viewed from Earth.\"", "In the statement,\u00a0Justin Maki, InSight science team co-investigator and imaging lead at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said it is a \"tradition for Mars missions to capture sunrises and sunsets.\"", "The bluish hue\u00a0seen in the photos of the sunsets is\u00a0the result of the dust in Mars' atmosphere. Fine particles allow the blue light to push through the atmosphere more effectively than longer wavelength colors like yellow and red, according to Cincinnati.com.", "NASA's site states that sunset and twilight images are occasionally acquired by the science team to see how high into the atmosphere the dust extends and to look for ice or dust clouds.", "Fact check: Heavily edited viral image of sun's surface wasn't taken by NASA", "An image claiming to show the first sunset on Mars is FALSE, based on our research. The image used in the posts is an illustration created by a computer animator and illustrator that specializes in astronomy. The first image of the sunset on Mars was captured by Viking 1 in 1976.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
