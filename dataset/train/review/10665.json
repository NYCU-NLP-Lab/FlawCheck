But Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, the Republican who hopes to unseat Cooper in November, criticized the governor for picking pandemic \"winners and losers.\"", "On Monday, Forest said North Carolina is one of only a fraction of states keeping gyms closed.", "\"Now, 46 states have gyms/fitness centers open - North Carolina is one of four states that does not,\" Forest tweeted.", "Is that true?", "Generally speaking, yes. Some states are taking a regional approach to reopening gyms. In those states, gyms are allowed to open in some counties but not others.

Gretchen Whitmer allowed some gyms to open on June 10, while others remained closed because they didn\u2019t meet the state\u2019s qualifications to reopen.
