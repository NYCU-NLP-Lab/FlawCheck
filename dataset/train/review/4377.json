["About this rating", "On 27 May 2018, the web site Your News Wire published an item appearing to report that President Trump planned to sign a law legalizing medical marijuana in all 50 states:", "President Trump is set to sign legislation which will make medical marijuana federally legal for terminally ill patients. The bill, known as the \u201cRight to Try Act,\u201d will prohibit the FDA from banning natural cures, and allow patients to try medications that have not been approved by the FDA, but are currently under clinical trial.", "The claim had a single source: the cannabis industry site Herb.co. However, that site's 24 May 2018 article was markedly more reserved in its speculative premise:", "Trump To Sign Bill Which Could Make Cannabis Federally Legal For The Terminally Ill", "President Trump is set to sign legislation which could make medical marijuana federally legal for terminally ill patients. The bill, known as the \u201cRight to Try Act,\u201d would allow patients with potentially fatal conditions to try medications that have not yet been approved by the FDA, but are undergoing the approval process and have already passed the first phase of clinical studies.", "[...]", "What\u2019s not clear is what illnesses qualify as life-threatening. Post-traumatic stress disorder, for example, could be argued to be life-threatening given the high rates of suicide among those who are diagnosed, but it\u2019s up for debate. It\u2019s likely that those details will be hammered out on a state by state basis in jurisdictions that have already passed their own version of Right to Try. The full title of the bill suggests as much stating, \u201cin accordance with State law\u2026\u201d", "... Under the broad wording of the federal bill, no specific illnesses are mentioned. Instead, an \u2018eligible patient\u2019 is defined as, \u201cDiseases or conditions where the likelihood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted; and Diseases or conditions with potentially fatal outcomes, where the endpoint of clinical trial analysis is survival.\u201d", "While Your News Wire claimed that President Trump was to sign legislation \"which will make medical marijuana federally legal for terminally ill patients,\" Herb.co originally reported that the Right to Try act could have that effect. The actual bill, of course, made no mention of marijuana specifically. Introduced in February 2017, it read:", "SEC. 2. USE OF UNAPPROVED MEDICAL PRODUCTS BY PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH A\nTERMINAL ILLNESS.", "(a) In General.--Notwithstanding the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), and any other provision of Federal law, the Federal Government shall not take any action to prohibit or restrict--\n(1) the production, manufacture, distribution, prescribing, or dispensing of an experimental drug, biological product, or device that--\n(A) is intended to treat a patient who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness; and\n(B) is authorized by, and in accordance with, State law; and\n(2) the possession or use of an experimental drug, biological product, or device--\n(A) that is described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1); and\n(B) for which the patient has received a certification from a physician, who is in good standing with the physician's certifying organization or\nboard, that the patient has exhausted, or otherwise does not meet qualifying criteria to receive, any other available treatment options.", "As noted by Herb.co, broad language was used in the law's text regarding conditions qualifying as a \"terminal illness,\" substances or devices in its purview, and even the relationship between state and federal law. Critics of the law maintained that it allowed drug companies too wide a berth to market experimental treatments while weakening the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory ability. Proponents argued that legislation of its type enabled terminally ill patients with little left to lose a chance to outlive drug trial phases.", "We contacted NORML \u2014 the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws \u2014 for further clarification and interpretation on what effect, if any, the Right to Try Act of 2017 would have on the use of medical marijuana \"in all 50 states,\" but have not yet received a response. However, the claim as presented is false; the act itself was unrelated to medical marijuana, and solely pertained to those diagnosed with terminal illnesses. Even under the most flexible interpretations, there was no truth to the statement that President Donald Trump was signing a law legalizing medical marijuana at a federal level.", "Dmitry, Baxter. \u00a0 \"Trump Set To Legalize Medical Marijuana In All 50 States.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Your News Wire. \u00a0 27 May 2018.", "Karlin-Smith, Sarah. \u00a0 \"House Passes Right-To-Try On Second Try.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Politico. \u00a0 21 March 2018.", "Tomoski, Miroslav. \u00a0 \"Trump To Sign Bill Which Could Make Cannabis Federally Legal For The Terminally Ill.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Herb.co. \u00a0 24 May 2018.", "115th Congress. \u00a0 \"H.R. 878: Right To Try Act Of 2017.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 6 February 2017.", "RightToTry.org. \u00a0 \"FAQ.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 30 May 2018.", "Wikipedia. \u00a0 \"Right-To-Try Law.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 30 May 2018.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
