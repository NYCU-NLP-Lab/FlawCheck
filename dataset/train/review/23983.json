["About this rating", "On 17 July 2018, a Facebook user shared two dramatic videos of geological phenomena in a now-viral Facebook post accompanied by a not-at-all accurate description:", "This post's description of the videos was perplexing for several reasons. First, these videos did not capture events that occurred recently, did not document the same event, and did not offer visual recordings of \u201cthe moving of earth crust.\u201d", "The first video was of a landslide that took place in the southern Italian town of Maierato in February 2010. NASA\u2019s Earth Observatory provides an explanation for the event (and some impressive before and after satellite imagery of it), linking this landslide and several related ones to heavy rainfall in the region:", "Gravity constantly tugs downward on a slope, but only when gravity\u2019s force exceeds the strength of the rocks, soils, and sediments composing the slope does land begin to slide down hill. Landslides often occur in conjunction with other events, and rainfall in the Maierato region likely initiated this slide.", "The lower video was from Inner Mongolia (which is not the country of Mongolia but rather a semi-autonomous region of China) and captured a landslide occurring there on 10 September 2017. Wang Dejun, director of the Institute of Geological and Natural Disaster Prevention of the Gansu Academy of Sciences, told China\u2019s Science and Technology Daily that (roughly translated):", "This is an intermediate state between the debris flow and the landslide. It is a very normal natural phenomenon. After the frozen saturated soil layer and the weathered layer are thawed, this [phenomenon] occurs along the slope due to gravity, slowly flowing or creeping.", "Areas with melting permafrost, such as the high-altitude region of Inner Mongolia where this debris flow occurred, experience this kind of phenomenon frequently, making it highly unlikely this was the \u201cfirst time mankind has seen this happen,\u201d as Science and Technology Daily observed:", "The unique geographical environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau provides an excellent environment for the formation of frozen mudflows. For thousands of years, [such flows have been] like sunrise and sunset.", "When the soil layer is frozen in winter, the soil particles bulge along the slope. When the later melts in the summer, it will fall back in the vertical direction, so that the soil particles will be displaced downwards in the direction of the slope, and will be converted into muddy flow in the case of super-saturated water.", "The Italian landslide, though massive in scale, was similarly not a rare or unique kind of event unwitnessed by humanity until now. As described by NASA, the video captured was \u201cone of perhaps 100 landslides in the southern Italian region of Calabria\u201d attributed to a single rain event.", "Finally, what is being displayed in both videos is not \u201cmoving crust\u201d but merely surface debris unable to fight Earth\u2019s gravity. \u201cCrust,\u201d geologically speaking, refers to the layer of rock that surrounds our planet and rests on the more ductile mantle below. Discussion of the movement of crust generally occurs on either extremely long timescales or involves extremely short distances and is usually discussed in terms of interactions of the various tectonic plates that comprise Earth\u2019s crust. Therefore, \"moving crust\" is an incorrect description of what is depicted in these videos.", "Associated Press. \u00a0 \u201cRaw Video: Dramatic Mudslides in Italy.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 15 February 2010.", "NASA Earth Observatory. \u00a0 \u201cLandslide in Maierato, Italy.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 14 March 2010.", "Yun, Zhang. \u00a0 \"\u8f9f\u8c23\uff01\u5185\u8499\u53e4\u201c\u5730\u58f3\u63a8\u79fb\u201d\u89c6\u9891\u5b9e\u4e3a\u9752\u6d77\u878d\u51bb\u6ce5\u6d41\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u79d1\u6280\u65e5\u62a5. \u00a0 12 September 2017.", "Conte, Enrico et al. \u00a0 \"Kinematics of the Maierato Landslide (Calabria, Southern Italy).\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Procedia Engineering. \u00a0 10 September 2016.", "Beitler, Jane et al. \u00a0 \"Earth's Crust in Action.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NASA Earth Data. \u00a0 Accessed 27 July 2018.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
