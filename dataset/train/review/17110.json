Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration on May 31 in response to violence that broke out at protests in some parts of the state.", "The law highlighted in the post moved through the state\u2019s legislature as House Bill 1177 and it\u00a0 was authored by state Rep. Dade Phelan, a Republican from Beaumont.", "The bill does regulate firearm usage during a natural disaster, but it was passed with 2017\u2019s Hurricane Harvey front of mind, with lawmakers arguing that the measure was necessary to give survivors of natural disasters a way to protect themselves and their property.", "But does it apply to this situation?

After consulting with attorney Richard D. Hayes, II, of Houston-based law firm Walker & Taylor, Cox said he agreed that the law does not currently apply.", "\"The circumstances that would allow for the unlicensed carry of a handgun after a declared disaster are fairly limited,\" Hayes said in a blog post and video on the matter. \"It doesn\u2019t suspend 46.02 for all purposes.
