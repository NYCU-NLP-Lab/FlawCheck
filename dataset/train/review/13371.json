His office has also filed friend of the court briefs in several additional cases against the administration.", "But is California really \"winning\" in court as Becerra and Gov. Gavin Newsom have confidently claimed?", "\"We are winning. The vast majority of the lawsuits have been adjudicated in favor of California,\" Newsom said at a news conference on Sept. 16 at the state Capitol.", "Becerra has been equally self-assured:", "\"Every time we go to court, for the most part, we win,\" Becerra claimed at a late August news conference where he announced one of California\u2019s 14 lawsuits on immigration since the president took office.

In July, it prevailed in its effort to block the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the move and Trump abandoned his plan. The state also won a case against the administration\u2019s attempt in 2017 to cut off certain federal funds for \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions. A district court ruled the move was unconstitutional. California again sued the administration last year after it withheld money for similar reasons. The state was also victorious in several cases where it sued to ensure federal energy and environmental regulations were implemented.", "In February, the state was dealt one of its few defeats following its lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from waiving environmental laws to speed up border wall construction of in California. A federal district judge and later an appeals panel ruled in favor of Trump. The state also lost a case it joined opposing Trump\u2019s ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries.
