["About this rating", "On 18 June 2018, United States President Donald Trump announced his intention to create a Space Force, apparently a new branch of the United States Armed Forces that would deal with matters on the other side of the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line.", "Shortly after the announcement was made, a rumor started circulating that\u00a0 Trump had tapped Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, perhaps best known to lovers of both the History Channel and Internet memes as \"the Ancient Aliens guy,\" based on his work on the loved and derided show of that name (and which operates under the assumption that extraterrestrials are real and have been present on Earth for millions of years), to lead this new branch of the military:", "Choosing someone who is open to the idea of encountering aliens in space may be an asset to a burgeoning Space Force. However, rumors about Giorgio A. Tsoukalos landing the gig did not originate with a general news report. This rumor comes from a satirical article that was published by the web site \"A Science Enthusiast\" on 27 June 2018.", "The article was clearly tagged as satire at the top of the page. The web site also added a disclaimer at the bottom to reiterate the post's satirical intent:", "In case you need it explained, and didn't read the \"satire\" category at the top of this post, this is satire. That means its a joke. It's not real. Except the stuff about Ben Carson. That's completely and totally real.", "A Space Enthusiast. \u00a0 \"Trump Taps 'Ancient Aliens' Guy as Secretary of Space Force.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 18 June 2018.", "Klein, Betsy. \u00a0 \"Space Force and Air Force Will Be 'Separate But Equal' Branches, President Trump Says.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN. \u00a0 18 June 2018.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
