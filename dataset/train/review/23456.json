Bill Nelson.", "The lead-in text above the video offers a hint that the reference was to past statements by Scott (emphasis ours): \"Rick Scott vowed to implement racial profiling laws in Florida and wanted to exclude Dreamers from citizenship.\"", "But this attack amounts to cherry-picking. Scott softened his stance on illegal immigration years ago and does not have those positions anymore.", "This attack is misleading. The fine print shows it is in reference to a position Scott took during a GOP primary in 2010.", "The video cites a sentence from a 2010 TIME magazine article about the Florida 2010 governor\u2019s race. It says, \"Scott favors Arizona\u2019s draconian anti-illegal-immigration law.\"", "Scott did promise then to bring a law similar to Arizona\u2019s SB 1070 to Florida.", "The 2010 Arizona law made being an undocumented immigrant a state crime and required legal immigrants to carry papers to confirm their legal status.

It, too, ignores that his more recent position is more favorable to this group of immigrants.", "Dreamers are immigrants brought over to the U.S. illegally by their parents when they were children.", "Just weeks before he took office, Scott spoke against a DREAM Act bill in Congress.", "\"I'm against the Dream Act,\" he said in December 2010. \"Why? I don't believe in amnesty.\"", "In 2013, Scott vetoed a bill to let Dreamers get driver\u2019s licenses.

Scott called on Congress to \"do the right thing for these kids by removing the uncertainty hanging over their future goals and dreams.\"", "While an extension of deferred action is not the same as citizenship, it is clear that Scott moderated his view and became more open to Dreamers having a way to legally stay in the United States.", "A Facebook ad by Democratic groups said, \"If Rick Scott had his way he would encourage racially profiling immigrant communities here in Florida. He also opposed allowing Dreamers to remain in the U.S.\"", "This ad leaves viewers with the misleading impression that these are current Scott policies. Neither is true.", "Scott did promise in 2010 to bring Arizona\u2019s immigration law to Florida. Immigration advocates feared the law would lead to racial profiling. Once Scott was elected, he never pursued the idea.", "Scott was a bit more active in his earlier opposition to allowing Dreamers to stay in the country, but that has also changed. He publicly objected to Obama\u2019s deferred action program for people who came into the country illegally as children, saying Obama bypassed Congress. Scott also vetoed a bill to give Dreamers driver\u2019s licenses. But in 2014, Scott signed a bill to give Dreamers in-state tuition and in the past year he has spoken in favor of helping Dreamers.", "In total, the ad creates a misleading impression that Scott is anti-immigrant by only drawing on part of his record.
