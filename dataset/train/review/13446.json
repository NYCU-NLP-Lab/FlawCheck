["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "You\u2019ve probably heard of the earmark to build the bridge to nowhere in Alaska.\n\nBut what about tariff breaks for those who make snow globes? Or yard ornaments depicting school mascots? Or men\u2019s shoes?\n\nNot just any shoes, but to be precise: \"certain men's footwear covering the ankle, the height of which from the bottom of the outer sole to the top of the upper exceeds 19 cm, with waterproof molded soles, valued at more than $30 per pair.\u2019\u2019\n\nThose are all items that lawmakers in Washington sought to designate as worthy of a tariff break for companies in 2009-2010.\n\nU.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Plantation, was one of 65 freshmen Republicans who signed an April 20 letter calling for support of the \"miscellaneous tariff bill\u2019\u2019 which would reward these breaks. (Other Florida members who signed included Rep. David Rivera, R-Miami, and Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Panama City.)", "After POLITICO wrote about the tariffs and their similarity to earmarks, which are currently banned, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee blasted out an email:\n\n\"According to Politico, Representative Allen West (FL-22) has been caught \u2018begging\u2019 Republican leaders to bring back earmarks. West signed a letter in support of earmarks \u2018even though it runs counter to the earmark ban Republicans campaigned on in 2010 and instituted when they took power.' \"\n\nDoes West calling for the tariff breaks mean he wants to bring back earmarks?\n\nWhat\u2019s a miscellaneous tariff bill?\n\nTo begin at the beginning: American companies import materials to make everything from umbrellas to medicines to pianos. The importers of these raw materials have to pay federal tariffs. And every year, hundreds of American companies, often with the help of lobbyists, ask members of Congress to suspend those tariffs. Supporters say waivers allow them to keep prices lower and employ more Americans.\n\nMembers introduce the requests as individual bills, which go through committees and then are vetted by the International Trade Commission and other agencies. The bills must meet certain criteria, including a limit on the loss of tariff revenue to under $500,000 per year.\n\n(The Washington Post found that lawmakers circumvent that dollar limit by filing multiple bills. In 2005, a Massachusetts representative filed six different bills changing the wording slightly to cover leather basketballs, rubber basketballs, etc.)\n\nThe International Trade Commission posts the requests with explanations of the products. For example, here's an explanation about those snow globes, requested by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., on behalf of a company in Missoula: \"A snow globe is filled with plastic flakes (or metallic glitter) in an aqueous liquid. ... Shaking or inverting the snow globe stirs up the plastic flakes that settle slowly in the liquid when the globe is set upright, thus creating the effect of snow fall upon the figurine, object, or scenery inside.\"\n\nMembers had until April 30, 2012, to submit requests. The bills probably won\u2019t reach the chambers for votes until fall.\n\nWest didn\u2019t submit any requests, said his chief of staff Jonathan Blyth on the deadline day.\n\nAt least one South Florida lawmaker did, though. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton, filed one for certain coffee brewers with \"milk frothing capacity\" and another for electromechanical ice shavers.\n\nIs it an earmark?\n\nThe DCCC -- and some Republicans -- say tariff breaks are equivalent to bringing back earmarks.\n\nBack in 2010, the House Republican Conference adopted a rule stating members couldn\u2019t request earmarks or limited tariff benefits. A limited tariff benefit is defined as benefiting less than 10 companies.\n\nToday, lawmakers introducing miscellaneous tariff bills say they could apply to any company. But it\u2019s not clear that\u2019s always the case, since some of the bills seem quite specific.\n\nWest\u2019s office pointed us to this myths vs. facts page distributed by the House Ways and Means Committee. In the fact sheet, the Republicans argued that earmarks increase spending, but tariff bills reduce tariffs and are equivalent to a tax cut. They also said the tariff waivers could apply to any company and that the process is a \"model of transparency.\"\n\nThere is some feuding in the ranks about whether they are earmarks and about how they're handled.\n\nSen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., has teamed up with Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to propose changing the process so businesses go directly to the trade commission to seek the tariff break. Lawmakers would still have to vote on it, but they wouldn\u2019t have the chance to pick and choose which ones to forward to the commission. DeMint argues that would get rid of the \"pay-to-play racket.\"\n\n\"Some want to restart this part of the political favor factory and hope Americans don't notice Republicans breaking their own earmark ban, and others want to redefine earmarks to create a loophole for tariff suspensions,\" DeMint wrote in an op-ed for CNN.com.\n\nTaxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that monitors earmarking and other budget issues, has raised concerns about the tariff bills because of the \"potential pay-to-play and special interest giveaways that it perpetuates,\" said vice president Steve Ellis in a recent email.\n\n\"So call them earmarks, call them limited tariff benefits, call them whatever you like, we are still concerned with this legislation,\" he said.\n\nEllis said he will analyze this year's list to determine if some raise the same concerns as earmarks -- such as benefiting few people who are giving campaign donations to their members in Congress.\n\nSo would Ellis call them earmarks?\n\n\"I\u2019m going to wait and see,\" he said. \"I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some of them are.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe DCCC said that West\u2019s signature on a letter with dozens of House Republicans calling for a miscellaneous tariff bill means that he wants to bring earmarks back.", "Tariff breaks do raise some of the same concerns as earmarks. Business owners who can help fund candidates\u2019 campaigns seek the financial benefit from their own representatives.\u00a0 And some of the bills are written in such a way as to only benefit a select few.", "But the process and the particulars involved in earmarks vs. tariff breaks are very different. Earmarks direct spending; tariff bills are more like tax breaks. More importantly, the process for tariff breaks is transparent and relatively easy to track, unlike the earmarks of previous years.\n\nWe rate the DCCC's statement Mostly False.", "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee press release, Allen West Caught Seeking Earmark Despite Ban, April 24, 2012\n\nUnited States International Trade Commission, Congressional Bill reports, 105th-111th Congress\n\nCato Institute, \"Ban spending earmarks but not tariff cuts,\" Nov. 16, 2010\n\nHouse Committee on Ways and Means, Facts about the miscellaneous tariff bill, April 24, 2012 \u00a0\n\nHouse GOP Conference Rules, Earmark moratorium, 112th Congress\n\nSenate Committee on Finance, \"Baucus announces process for miscellaneous tariff bill,\" March 30, 2012\n\nU.S. Library of Congress, H.R. 5045 and H.R. 5046, April 27, 2012\n\nPOLITICO, \"House Freshmen: Bring back earmarks,\" April 23, 2012\n\nPOLITICO, \"Senate Democrats give in on earmark ban,\" Feb. 1, 2011\n\nPOLITICO, \"Tax breaks vs. earmarks stymie GOP,\" July 20, 2010\n\nAssociated Press, \"Conflicted GOP helps pass popular trade bill,\" July 21, 2010", "Sen.
