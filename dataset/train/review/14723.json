We\u2019ve dealt with COVID for many months,\u201d continued McEnany. \u201cBut it\u2019s Orwellian in a place like Oregon to say, \u2018If you gather in numbers more than six, we might come to your house and arrest you, and you get 30 days of jail time.\u2019 That\u2019s not the American way. We don\u2019t lose our freedom in this country. We make responsible health decisions as individuals.\u201d", "The term \u201cOrwellian\u201d refers to George Orwell\u2019s dystopian novel \"1984,\" which describes Big Brother, an oppressive government regime that watches and controls the public. Described by The New York Times as the \u201cmost widely used adjective derived from the name of a modern writer,\u201d \"Orwellian\" has been used to characterize overbearing governments and draconian policies characterized by propaganda and disinformation.", "The comment came a day after Oregon Gov. Kate Brown issued an executive order that described a statewide freeze that limited at-home and social gatherings, restricted restaurants to take-out only, and closed non-essential businesses like gyms and museums. Though the governor is encouraging voluntary compliance, the freeze measures are enforceable by law and could be punishable by 30 days in jail or a fine of $1,250 or both.", "\u201cI expect local law enforcement to continue to use an education first approach, but Oregonians need to understand that these rules are enforceable under law,\u201d said Brown in a news release. \u201cA large majority of Oregonians continue to do the right thing to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their neighbors. However, when Oregonians don\u2019t take COVID-19 seriously and don\u2019t take steps to reduce the spread of the disease, they put all of us at risk.\u201d", "Snopes contacted Brown's office and received the following statement from Press Secretary Elizabeth Merah:", "Since March, the Governor\u2019s executive orders have had the force of law \u2014 they have always been punishable, both through criminal penalties and civil penalties. That\u2019s not changing.", "What has changed, in a very urgent way, is the dangerous threat that COVID-19 poses to our communities, and the urgency every single Oregonian needs to take to help stop its spread. This virus spreads through individual contact \u2014 and individual behaviors can make a huge difference in stopping its spread. However, if people aren\u2019t going to take this virus seriously, we are prepared to offer consequences. The Governor\u2019s recent statement on partnering with law enforcement is a punctuation mark to hold people accountable in making smart choices that can save another\u2019s life.", "The Oregon State Police will be working with local law enforcement to enforce the Governor\u2019s orders, in the same way local law enforcement officers respond to noise complaints for loud parties, for example, and issue citations. If a violation is cited criminally, under ORS 401.990, it is a class C misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to 30 days in jail, a fine of up to $1,250, or both. A prosecutor can also opt to reduce the citation down to a class A violation, which has a lower fine. If a violation is pursued by the Oregon Health Authority under ORS 431A.010(d), it is a civil penalty, and the statutory maximum is $500 a day per violation.", "These measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 are a necessity to give Oregon a fighting chance to flatten the curve and save lives.", "In general, measures introduced by the Oregon governor were broadly sweeping and impacted businesses and faith-based institutions, whereas those issued by the CDC mainly spoke to how to \u201cmake Thanksgiving safer.\u201d For one, Oregon issued a \u201cfreeze period\u201d from Nov. 18 to Dec. 2 that limited at-home and social gatherings to a maximum of six people from no more than two households. On the other hand, the CDC did not restrict gatherings to a specific number of attendees but rather recommended that people \u201climit the number of guests.\u201d", "As many states experienced upticks in cases in the weeks leading up to the 2020 holiday season, Oregon reported more than 59,000 positive COVID-19 cases.", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
