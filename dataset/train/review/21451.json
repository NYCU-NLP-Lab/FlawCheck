Clarke Jr. have often clashed.", "Has tough-talking Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., who has apparently landed a post in the administration of President Donald Trump, actually slashed the number of his deputies by half or more?", "That\u2019s the attack from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, the millionaire son of the co-founder of the Boston Scientific medical device company and a political nemesis of Clarke\u2019s.", "On May 18, 2017, the day after after Clarke announced he would be joining the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as an assistant secretary, Abele was asked on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee what legacy Clarke would leave behind.", "(Clarke said he would take on his new post in June 2017, but the Trump administration has not confirmed Clarke\u2019s announcement. Two days after Abele\u2019s comments, CNN reported that Clarke plagiarized parts of his master\u2019s thesis. Clarke has denied that accusation, but has said the report could kill his appointment.)", "Abele, who was once accused by Clarke of having \"penis envy,\" said Clarke\u2019s legacies include reducing the number of deputies \"long before I was there from about 700 and something to 300 and something.\"", "Given that Clarke, who calls himself \"America\u2019s sheriff,\" has built a reputation on Fox News and elsewhere as being tough on crime, let\u2019s see if Abele\u2019s statement is on point.", "Sheriff\u2019s role on crime", "Clarke\u2019s national profile as a favorite of conservatives has risen largely because of his blunt comments on crime, among other topics. In a 2013 interview, he advised citizens, in the context of a home invasion, to \"point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger\" because \"911 is not our best option.\"", "But given that all of Milwaukee County is served by city and village police departments, the role of the Sheriff\u2019s Office isn\u2019t on the front line as much in fighting crime. In 2011, we rated Half True a claim by Abele that the sheriff\u2019s office \"plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency.\"", "We noted at the time that Abele had proposed with his county budget cutting 240 positions from the sheriff\u2019s office.", "That underscores an important point in weighing Abele\u2019s claim: It\u2019s the not the sheriff alone who determines how many deputies there will be.", "In the annual county budget process, the sheriff asks for a certain number of deputies; then the county executive recommends a number as part of an overall county budget proposal; and ultimately a number is authorized when the County Board of Supervisors approves the county budget.", "The numbers", "(Note: All of the deputy figures in this article are authorized positions, rather than an actual count of deputies, given that the number fluctuates with retirements, resignations, etc.)", "With the 2002 budget that Clarke inherited after he was elected, there were 649 deputy positions authorized for the sheriff\u2019s office. In the 2011 budget, the final one before Abele took over as county executive, there were 328 deputy positions. The executive during those years was Wisconsin\u2019s current governor, Republican Scott Walker.", "So, as far as the numbers go, Abele was high with the first part of his claim but on target with the second part.", "But the thrust of Abele\u2019s claim is that Clarke reduced the deputy positions.", "This chart shows the number of deputies Clarke sought with his budget request; the number that were recommended by Walker with his full county budget proposal; and the number that were ultimately authorized in the final budget approved by the County Board.

The change was not immediate; as deputies left the jail jobs, they were replaced by correctional officers. Over the next several years, the number of deputies steadily declined.", "In fact, Clarke requested fewer deputies than he did in the previous year in each year but one between 2006 and 2011 -- when he requested and was authorized 328 deputy positions.", "So, there were 649\u00a0authorized deputy positions when Clarke took office and only 328 by the time Abele took office. That\u2019s a reduction of 321 deputy positions. But the reduction in total force was less, given that 200 of the deputies were jailers who were replaced by correctional officers.", "Our rating", "Abele said that before he took over as county executive, Clarke reduced the number of sheriff\u2019s deputies from about 700 to about 300.", "The sheriff\u2019s office had 649 authorized deputy positions when Clarke took office in 2003 and 328 in 2011, the final county budget before Abele took over. That\u2019s a total reduction of 321.", "Incomplete county records don\u2019t indicate whether deputy reductions during first three years were requested by Clarke or were simply made by the County Board.
