["Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has been repeatedly mocked in the last few years by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and their followers for the infamous \u2018potato-gold\u2019 machine remark. A clipped video from Gandhi\u2019s address at a campaign rally in Gujarat during the 2017 assembly electio is used for the purpose. BJP leaders had again shared the video after Congress\u2019s opposition to the farm bills. \u201cWill install such a machine that if a potato is inserted from one end, gold will come out from the other end.

He told potato farmers that he procure a machine where if you insert a potato from one end, gold will come out from the other end. This is are not my words. These are Modiji\u2019s words.\u201d", "Interestingly, there is also no basis for Rahul Gandhi\u2019s statement because there is no public record of Prime Minister Narendra Modi claiming such a machine exits. In 2017, video of Gandhi\u2019s \u2018potato-gold\u2018 jibe was clipped and circulated by BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya.
