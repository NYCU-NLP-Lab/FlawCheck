["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 24, 2020", "A popular meme on Facebook falsely purports to show a photo of Joe \u201cBiden\u2019s Inaugural stage\u201d being built outside the White House. The photo shows the reviewing stand\u00a0for the inaugural parade\u00a0at Bill Clinton\u2019s inauguration in 1993.", "A viral meme takes a dig at President Donald Trump and his loss to President-elect Joe Biden, but it misrepresents an old photo to do so.", "\u201cIf you think you are having a bad day just remember, Trump is watching Biden\u2019s Inaugural stage being built on the White House North lawn,\u201d the meme reads. An accompanying aerial photo shows the White House and a red circle drawn around the purported stage for Biden\u2019s inauguration.", "But a reverse image search shows the meme is using a photo from 1993 \u2014 not 2020. The meme has been posted by popular Facebook pages, such as Occupy Democrats and Opposition Report, and has been shared by thousands of users.", "The stock photo website Alamy labels the same photo, \u201cAerial Photography, William J. Clinton Presidential Inauguration, aerial of White House.\u201d And the Smithsonian Institution Archives documents that it was taken in 1993 by Carl Hansen.", "Also, while the meme deems the structure shown an \u201cInaugural stage,\u201d the image is actually showing that year\u2019s reviewing stand, which is erected for every inauguration for the new president to watch the inaugural parade on Pennsylvania Avenue, following the swearing-in ceremony.", "National Park Service spokeswoman Katie Liming told us in an email that construction of the reviewing stand and media riser has begun for the Jan. 20 inauguration. So, the meme is not entirely wrong.", "The actual swearing-in ceremony takes place at the U.S. Capitol. Work on the inaugural platform outside the Capitol is also underway, as photos from the Washington Post show.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
