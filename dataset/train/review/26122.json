["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on February 9, 2017", "Q: Did Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch start a fascism club in high school?", "A: No. Gorsuch\u2019s senior yearbook jokingly says that he was the founder and president of the \u201cFascism Forever Club\u201d at Georgetown Preparatory School.", "Was Neil Gorsuch, the supreme court nominee, the president of a \u201cFascism Forever Club\u201d in high school?", "Despite what his 1985 yearbook says, Judge Neil Gorsuch did not start a \u201cFascism Forever Club\u201d at Georgetown Preparatory School. As a joke, the\u00a0Supreme Court nominee wrote that he founded\u00a0the nonexistent club,\u00a0according to his former student government adviser.", "\u201cThe club never existed,\u201dsaid Stephen Ochs, a history teacher who also advised Gorsuch as a member of the student government. Ochs\u00a0told us that Gorsuch listed the club\u00a0in his yearbook profile as \u201can inside joke\u201d between himself and some of his liberal classmates.", "Dozens of readers have asked us if Gorsuch, the\u00a0federal appellate judge whom President Donald Trump nominated to the Supreme Court\u00a0on Jan. 31, was indeed the leader of a fascist student group at the Jesuit high school in Bethesda, Maryland. He wasn\u2019t.", "In an email to FactCheck.org, Patrick Coyle, the school\u2019s marketing and communications director,\u00a0wrote that \u201cno such club ever existed on Georgetown Prep\u2019s campus.\u201d", "Yet\u00a0in an\u00a0\u201cexclusive,\u201d the U.K.\u2019s DailyMail.com reported on Feb. 1 that \u201cSupreme Court Justice nominee Neil Gorsuch founded and led a student group called the \u2018Fascism Forever Club\u2019 at his elite high school.\u201d The story was based on an entry in the yearbook in which\u00a0Gorsuch\u00a0listed \u201cFascism Forever Club (Founder and President)\u201d among his high school activities.", "But the club mention was not meant to be taken seriously, as\u00a0Michael O\u2019Loughlin reported for America,\u00a0a Jesuit magazine, a\u00a0day after the DailyMail.com story appeared online.", "America, Feb. 2:\u00a0Political differences aside, Mr. Gorsuch was popular and respected, excelling at debate and being elected student body president.", "When it came time to write his senior biography for the yearbook, he would make light of the divide between his conservative political beliefs and those of the more liberal faculty and students.", "He wrote that he founded and led the \u201cFascism Forever Club,\u201d though those with knowledge of the school back in the 1980s say there was no such club. The mention of it in the yearbook was a tongue-in-cheek attempt to poke fun at liberal peers who teased him about his fierce conservatism.", "It was \u201ca total joke,\u201d said Steve Ochs, a history teacher at Georgetown Prep who was the student government advisor during Mr. Gorsuch\u2019s junior and senior years at the Bethesda, Md., school.", "\u201cThere was no club at a Jesuit school about young fascists,\u201d he told America. \u201cThe students would create fictitious clubs; they would have fictitious activities. They were all inside jokes on their senior pages.\u201d", "We confirmed what Ochs told the magazine when we interviewed him by phone.", "Ochs recalled\u00a0that some classmates playfully called Gorsuch, whose mother worked in President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration,\u00a0a \u201cconservative fascist.\u201d That\u2019s what motivated\u00a0him to put\u00a0it\u00a0in the yearbook, Ochs explained. He said that\u00a0it was common at the time for students to make up clubs and activities for their senior pages.", "The yearbook, Ochs said, also included an introductory message before the section for seniors that\u00a0made another reference to the nonexistent fascism club. It reads, in part: \u201cIn political circles, our tireless President Gorsuch\u2019s \u2018Fascism Forever\u2019 forum happily jerked its knees against the increasingly \u2018left-wing\u2019 tendencies of the faculty.\u201d", "That,\u00a0too, was written in \u201cmock seriousness\u201d on behalf of the senior class, Ochs said.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Ochs, Stephen.
