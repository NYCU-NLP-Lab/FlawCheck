That study, published in the Lancet this month, was led by Alison Galvani, a professor of epidemiology and director of Yale\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis, who disclosed that she was an \u201cinformal unpaid adviser\u201d to Sanders\u2019 Senate office for his 2019 Medicare for All Act.", "The study estimated Medicare for All\u00a0could reduce national health care spending by more than $450 billion a year. On his campaign website, Sanders estimates that, based on the Yale study and projections of current national health care spending, he would only need to increase government spending by $17.5 trillion over 10 years to cover the cost of his universal health care proposal. And he puts forth several tax measures to meet that cost.", "But other studies have come up with different estimates for Medicare for All, a proposal that lacks many details, leaving researchers to make various assumptions. Sanders was wrong to say that \u201cevery study out there, conservative or progressive, says Medicare for All will save money.\u201d", "The Urban Institute estimated a plan like Sanders\u2019 would increase national health spending by $720 billion in 2020. \u201cFederal government spending would increase by $2.8 trillion in 2020, or $34.0 trillion over 10 years,\u201d the October 2019 report said.", "Federal government spending would increase, because nearly all health spending would shift to the federal government.", "One reason the Yale and Urban Institute estimates are so far apart is the assumption on what the government would pay health care providers under Medicare for All. The plan itself doesn\u2019t say. The Yale study assumed hospitals would be paid at Medicare rates, which are lower than private insurance payment rates, but the Urban Institute assumed the hospital rate would be 115% of Medicare rates in its \u201cbase case.\u201d", "The think tank notes that \u201cit may be politically challenging to bring all hospital payment rates down to the level assumed in the base case, given the much higher average commercial provider payment levels and the enormous variation in payment rates across hospitals and commercial payers.\u201d It gave estimates for a different scenario, under which hospitals were paid 140% of Medicare rates, which would raise national health spending by $951 billion in 2020 (see Figure 3).", "When Sanders said that\u00a0\u201cyour program,\u201d referring to the other candidates, \u201cwould cost some $50 trillion over a 10-year period,\u201d he was referring to the projected national health spending under current law.

In fact, the trend toward increased incarceration began in the early 1970s, and quadrupled in the ensuing four decades. A two-year\u00a0study\u00a0by the National Research Council concluded that the increase was historically unprecedented, that the U.S. far outpaced the incarceration rates elsewhere in the world, and that high incarceration rates disproportionately affected Hispanic and black communities.\u00a0The report cited policies enacted by officials at all levels \u2014 local, state and federal \u2014 that expanded the use of incarceration, largely in response to decades of rising crime.", "\u201cIn the 1970s, the numbers of arrests and court caseloads increased, and prosecutors and judges became harsher in their charging and sentencing,\u201d the report states. \u201cIn the 1980s, convicted defendants became more likely to serve prison time.\u201d", "But that doesn\u2019t mean the 1994 crime bill didn\u2019t have any effect. Experts told us the law exacerbated the trend. For example, the bill included a federal\u00a0\u201cthree-strikes\u201d provision,\u00a0which required mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole for those who commit federal violent felonies if they had two or more previous convictions for violent felonies or drug trafficking crimes.", "In a speech at an NAACP convention in Philadelphia in July 2015,\u00a0Bill Clinton, who signed the bill into law as president, acknowledged\u00a0that tougher incarceration provisions in the bill were a mistake. \u201cI signed a bill that made the problem worse,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I want to admit it.\u201d Although most people are in prison under state law, \u201cthe federal law set a trend,\u201d Clinton said.", "The bill also included incentives for states to build prisons and increase sentences. States that\u00a0adopted\u00a0\u201ctruth-in-sentencing\u201d laws requiring that people convicted of violent crimes serve at least 85% of their sentences were rewarded with federal dollars for prison construction.", "In his defense of the bill, Biden has\u00a0pointed out\u00a0that it was written in response to decades of rising violent crime, and was supported by a majority of Democrats in the\u00a0Senate\u00a0and\u00a0House.
