It wasn't\u00a0a \"tax\" levied by the government. The bill would have increased the cap by which people could charge some people over 50.", "Her claim mimics attacks we\u2019ve seen against Republicans, omitting the same caveats: This provision applied to people buying insurance on the individual and small-group markets. It didn\u2019t apply to seniors on Medicare, or to people 50 and older with coverage sponsored by large employers. Current law allows insurers to charge older adults three times what they charge younger adults.", "The American Health Care Act was part of an effort to repeal the 2010 health care law signed by President Barack Obama.
