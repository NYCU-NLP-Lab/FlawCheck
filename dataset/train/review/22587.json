["About this rating", "At least three teens have been arrested on suspicion of committing hate crimes for posting images apparently mimicking the death of George Floyd, and other similar images have made the rounds on Snapchat, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.", "Despite garnering much attention and condemnation, the phenomenon does not appear to be a widespread one.", "Some images tagged as part of the challenge have unknown origins, and the precise intent of those who participated in them cannot be established.", "A disturbing series of photographs connected to a so-called \"George Floyd Challenge\" have appeared on social media, and a few of them went viral across a range of platforms in late May and early June 2020. The pictures showed young men \u2014 most of whom appear to be white \u2014 kneeling on each other's necks in an apparent attempt to mimic and/or make light of the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer held him on the ground and knelt on his neck as Floyd said, \"I can't breathe.\"", "Outside of the United States, similar images have come from a range of social media accounts in different parts of the world, including the United Kingdom and Australia. In some instances, the posts have led to police investigations and arrests. News reports indicated that some posts appeared to have originated on Snapchat, and the images then spread to other social media platforms. The following example is from Facebook:", "Based on the arrests and some apologies and acknowledgments from individuals who took photographs or videos while engaging in the challenge, it is a real phenomenon -- although the number of people who have actually participated in the behavior seems to be relatively small.", "In the United Kingdom, Northumbria police arrested three teens for suspicion of committing a hate crime after they launched an investigation into an image allegedly showing those teens peforming the challenge. In Australia, two boys from the Brisbane private school St. Joseph\u2019s College Gregory Terrace were seen on TikTok appearing to imitate the video of Floyd\u2019s arrest. A spokesperson for the school confirmed that the boys in the video did indeed attend their school, although one report said the student lying on the ground was being bullied and was not voluntarily participating in the video.", "In the U.S., Facebook users identified the men seen in one particular photograph as being from East Bethel, Minnesota, where they appeared to be dressed in construction gear:", "Their post resulted in an apology from the owner of Shade Tree Construction, Inc., who admitted that his son and his employees were participating in the \"challenge\" and maintained that he fired them:", "Another image on Instagram, tagged in Chardon, Ohio, resulted in an ongoing investigation after it was alleged that two juveniles there were spotted participating in the challenge. In response, Chardon schools officials said that the stated location of social media posts could be manipulated, and in a Facebook post, Chardon police said they did not turn up a connection between the image and the city of Chardon:", "In an interview with Snopes, Scott Niehus, Chardon's police chief, said his agency is still trying to determine the origins of the photograph, with a computer forensics specialist and the FBI participating in the ongoing investigation. What the investigation determined was that the photograph did not originate in Chardon but could have been posted from Chardon using a geo-tag. According to Niehus, this could have occurred if someone screenshotted the image, then posted it again from a certain location.", "According to Business Insider, Facebook and Instagram appear to have cracked down on the challenge hashtag, removing posts related to it. Most searches for such hashtags on these social media platforms express outrage over the challenge, and the origins of the original images are generally unknown. Snopes reached out to Snapchat about the phenomenon and received the following statement in response:", "The inhumanity of George Floyd\u2019s death is a tragedy, not something to mock. Disgusting content like this is a clear violation of Snapchat\u2019s community guidelines, which prohibit glorifying and inciting racial violence, hate speech and discrimination of any kind. Our Trust and Safety team will review any violating content and take appropriate action \u2014 and we encourage Snapchatters to use our in-app reporting tools to flag this kind of content immediately.", "A spokesperson added that Snapchat does not make use of hashtags, and users cannot broadcast to the entire platform. Their community guidelines prohibit hate speech and the glorification of violence, and their team is reviewing reports and removing content related to the challenge.", "Facebook also responded to Snopes, stating that \"Posts that promote the George Floyd Challenge go against Facebook\u2019s Community Standards and Instagram\u2019s Community Guidelines.\" Facebook referred to their guidelines, emphasizing the rule against posting content that \"[encourages] participation in a high risk viral challenge.\"", "In Snopes' email exchange with TikTok, a spokesperson denied that some of the screenshots circulating on the internet originated from their platform, although Snopes identified for them at least one user who appeared to have participated in the challenge and subsequently apologized on the platform. Though the post has since been removed, a screenshot of the original video was shared on Twitter, and a report from Yahoo News! Australia identified another similar post from TikTok. TikTok did not directly respond to some of the examples we shared but instead issued this statement:", "TikTok is a community that cares for and supports each other. We value and celebrate inclusivity and are focused on promoting an environment free from hateful speech or harassment. As we make clear in our Community Guidelines, content that praises violent tragedies or disparages their victims is a direct violation of our guidelines and we will remove any such content from our platform.", "The Daily Beast reported that no George Floyd Challenge exists on TikTok, and that the hashtag has only been used on 28 videos there. (As noted above, we found one TikTok post in which a user apologized for participating in the challenge.)", "In a statement to Snopes, Twitter said, \"We\u2019re taking action on tweets encouraging or promoting this as well as tweets that condone or justify this behavior.\" If accounts are denouncing the challenge, Twitter is placing a sensitive media warning on the related images. Any account that shares the images without context will also have to delete them, according to the spokesperson. Twitter's rules on abusive behavior say \u201cyou may not promote or encourage self-harm\u201d or \u201cengage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so.\u201d", "The actions by law enforcement related to the \"George Floyd Challenge,\" the fact that at least one company has fired its employees for their participation in it, and the responses from social media organizations show that it is a real phenomenon. However, not all of the images connected with #GeorgeFloydChallenge or similar hashtags have been verified, and actual participation in the challenge does not appear to have been widespread. We therefore rate this claim as \"Mixture.\"", "Collman, Ashley. \u00a0 \"Social Media Sites Are Cracking Down on Users Doing a 'George Floyd Challenge' Where They Put a Knee on a Friend's Neck.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Business Insider. \u00a0 4 June 2020.", "Dutton, Josh. \u00a0\"'Appalled and Disgusted': Outrage Over 'George Floyd Challenge'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Yahoo News!. \u00a0 4 June 2020.", "Geauga County Maple Leaf. \u00a0 \"Chardon Schools Responds to Social Media Post.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 1 June 2020.", "Graham, Hannah. \u00a0 \"North East Teens Arrested in Hate Crime Investigation After 'Imitating George Floyd Death.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Chronicle. \u00a0 1 June 2020.", "Hitt, Tarpley. \u00a0 \"The \u2018George Floyd Challenge\u2019: How a Handful of Racist Idiots Went Viral.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Daily Beast. \u00a0 4 June 2020.", "Uren, Adam. \u00a0 \"East Bethel Construction Firm Fires Workers Who Mocked George Floyd's Death.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Bring Me the News. \u00a0 3 June 2020.", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
