We don't know at this time whether the flyer was on the level or whether it was intended as a spoof of the reckless attitudes of some protesters, but we can verify that at least a few such flyers were posted around Tottenville, a neighborhood on the South Shore of Staten Island, as reported by the Staten Island Advance:", "Fliers promoting an \u201cEnd the Lockdown Rally\u201d were spotted at the CVS on Page Avenue, and on the corner of Main Street and Amboy Road.", "The promotional material said the rally would take place Sunday morning at 11 a.m. on the Conference House lawn in Tottenville.", "\"No mask needed.
