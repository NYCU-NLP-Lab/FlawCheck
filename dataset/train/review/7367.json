Having money to start off a campaign can lead to better political consultants working on a campaign and likely even having wealthy friends willing to contribute large amounts, he said.", "The 2020 election is a good example of the escalating price, with seven campaigns bringing in $100 million or more in contributions -- more than ever before.", "Yablon also noted that the Senate tends to attract people who have seen success in their life, whether in business or celebrity, which was likely lucrative.", "\"There is a long history of very wealthy people in the Senate,\" he said. \"The phenomenon is not new.\"", "Nelson, a Democrat running for US.
