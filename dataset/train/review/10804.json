["An old Facebook post attributing a false quote to CNN host Brooke Baldwin is again making the rounds and now has more than 145,000 shares on the social media platform.", "\"CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin: \u2018Don\u2019t hire veterans! They\u2019re too damaged to be trusted with authority!\u2019\" the 2015 post says.", "It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "We reached out to CNN about the post and Liza Pluto, a spokesperson for Baldwin\u2019s show, told us it\u2019s not accurate.", "\"This is not true and Brooke did not say that,\" she said.", "Searching Nexis for news coverage of that quote, we found no results.", "We did find stories from 2015 about an apology from Baldwin over comments she made about veterans \u2014\u00a0just not what appears in this Facebook post.", "On April 28, 2015, Baldwin interviewed the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., on camera amid protests and violence in Baltimore in the wake of Freddie Gray\u2019s death in police custody. Speaking about police training, she said: \"I was talking to a city councilman here last week who was saying, \u2018Brooke, these people have to live in the communities. There\u2019s no emotional, or there\u2019s a lack of emotional investment,\u2019 and a lot of these young people \u2026 and I love our nation\u2019s veterans, but some of them are coming back from war, they don\u2019t know the communities and they\u2019re ready to do battle.\"", "She was quickly criticized, garnering headlines like this one from Breitbart: \"CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin blames military veterans for Baltimore riots.\"", "As the Washington Post\u2019s media critic documented, she tweeted that same day: \"Folks. Please don\u2019t misunderstand me. Dear friends/family of mine are veterans. I was repeating a concern vocalized to me lately. That\u2019s it.\"", "The next morning, though, she went on air to apologize.", "\"I made a mistake yesterday,\" she said. I was recounting a story, a conversation I had had recently just referring to police. And I absolutely misspoke, I inartfully chose my words 100% and I just wish speaking to all of you this morning: I wholeheartedly retract what I said.\"", "Later on air she said she \"gave credence to the idea that veterans returning from war who were police officers were furthering the problems in communities like these here in Baltimore and nationwide. And I just have to take a moment again today and say I was wrong. I was so wrong.\"", "Our ruling", "The Facebook post claims Baldwin said: \"Don\u2019t hire veterans! They\u2019re too damaged to be trusted with authority.\"", "We didn\u2019t find any credible evidence that she said that. The statement appears to be an\u00a0interpretation of comments she made involving veterans during an interview, but it goes too far by presenting incendiary words as if Baldwin herself said them.", "We rate this Facebook post False.", "Facebook post, May 4, 2015", "YouTube, CNN anchor on Baltimore riots: Some veterans are coming home \"ready to do battle,\" April 28, 2019", "New York Times, Scenes of chaos in Baltimore as thousands protest Freddie Gray\u2019s death, April 25, 2019", "Breitbart, CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin blames military veterans for Baltimore riots, April 28, 2019", "Washington Post, CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin shows rest of media how to apologize, April 29, 2015", "HuffPost, Brook Baldwin apologizes for veteran comment: \"I absolutely misspoke,\" April 29, 2019", "CNN, Brooke Baldwin to vets: \"I apologize,\" April 29, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
