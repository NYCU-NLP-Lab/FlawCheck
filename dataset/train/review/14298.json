["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on October 31, 2017", "Q: Did Hillary Clinton leave \u201cthe country as Mueller Indictment is announced\u201d?", "A: No. She was in the U.S. all weekend.", "Hillary Rodham Clinton spent her weekend in Washington, D.C., and New York City, not in Lviv, Ukraine, as was claimed in a story that circulated online over the weekend.", "A story with the headline \u201cUPDATE: Hillary Clinton Leaves The Country As Mueller Indictment Is Announced\u201d ran on several sites after it was first posted on Saturday on Freedum Junkshun, following the news that Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election would yield its first indictments on Monday.", "The story was flagged by Facebook users as potentially false. It is.", "It said \u2014 without offering any evidence \u2014 that the former presidential candidate was leaving the country amid \u201cspeculation\u00a0and rumors\u201d that she would be indicted in the Mueller investigation. However, the only people implicated in the charges made public on Monday morning were those associated with Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.", "Also, Clinton didn\u2019t leave the country at all.", "She delivered a speech at the Human Rights Campaign National Dinner in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night, where she joked about being on her doctor\u2019s order to rest her fractured foot.", "Then, she celebrated her birthday in New York City on Sunday night at Estela, which the restaurant confirmed to FactCheck.org.", "The picture that ran with the story, which claims that she left from Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., shows her walking through an airport with Bill Clinton and a crowd of onlookers. But that picture was actually taken in 2013 when the couple toured the airport in Little Rock, Arkansas, that was being renamed for them.", "The site that first ran the story calls itself satirical and has a disclaimer that says it \u201cuses facts that don\u2019t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth. In fact, there is likely no truth at all in what you will read here. All of our articles are basically a crock of doody and should be considered satirical whimsies for today\u2019s aging conservative.\u201d", "The name of the person who wrote the story also changed, which is a red flag for spotting fake news. The byline first appeared as Butch Mannington and was later changed to Arnold Hilter, but the bio for each is the same and credits them with only fake accomplishments. We wrote more about that in this recent story.", "Still, at least three other websites picked up the story and posted it, too, but none of them labeled it as satire.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "\u201cUPDATE: Hillary Clinton Leaves The Country As Mueller Indictment Is Announced.\u201d Freedumjunkshun.com. 28 Oct 2017.", "Brown, Pamela; Perez, Evan; Prokupecz, Shimon. \u201cFirst on CNN: First charges filed in Mueller investigation.\u201d CNN. 27 Oct 2017.", "Clinton, Hillary.
