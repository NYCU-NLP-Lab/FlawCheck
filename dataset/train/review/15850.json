The idea of storing up to 110,000 metric tons of highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants has few fans inside the state.", "President Donald Trump supports the plan and put $110 million into his proposed budget to move it forward. With broad bipartisan support, the House voted overwhelmingly May 10 to have the Energy Department plan and build out the storage site.", "Democrat Jacky Rosen\u2019s Senate campaign fired off a press release tying incumbent Sen.

The story said a House budget provision that would have revived the Yucca Mountain proposal had died in the Senate.", "There\u2019s a lot of history here. With the prospect of waste building up at nuclear power plants across the country, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. In 1987, it amended the act to make Yucca Mountain the only option for Energy Department planning.", "Jump forward to 2009. The site had met the safety requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but the Obama administration, citing broad opposition in Nevada, put things on hold.", "In 2011, House Republicans added a rider to their budget that barred the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from doing anything to close the Yucca Mountain site.", "The formal text was: \"No funds ... may be used by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct closure of adjudicatory functions, technical review, or support activities associated with the Yucca Mountain geologic repository license application.\"", "So, while the bill didn\u2019t specify any particular sum to open the site, this rider denied money to roll back the planning process.", "The rider was part of an\u00a0appropriations package that reached virtually every government agency. The bill funded defense, health and human services, agriculture, and more. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the total price tag was $1.3 trillion.", "Heller, then a House representative, voted for the bill, which passed pretty much down straight party lines. Every Democrat and only three Republicans voted against it.", "The Rosen press release singles out the element related to Yucca Mountain, but as is always the case with budget bills, they are about much more than just one issue.", "It\u2019s also true that Heller tried to remove the Yucca Mountain rider.

Heller floated an amendment that would have barred spending any money on the site at all.", "Offering an amendment is not the same as waging a knock-down, drag-out fight, but Heller\u2019s amendment would have stymied the intent of the Republican language. Back then and today, Heller\u2019s official policy is to oppose the Yucca Mountain plan.", "All of this took place in the context of a massive spending measure.
