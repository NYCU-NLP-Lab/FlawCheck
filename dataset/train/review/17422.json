But AForA's leader, Brigitte Gabriel, has argued that the Arab world is beset by \"barbarism\" and that people in those countries \"are dead-set on killing and destruction.\" The group also organized \"March Against Sharia\" events in 2017, seizing on the conservative claim that \"Sharia Law\" is growing in the U.S.", "The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has designated AForA as a hate group, arguing that \"it pushes wild anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, denigrates American Muslims and deliberately conflates mainstream and radical Islam.\"", "Hyatt's policy announcement came shortly after one of their hotels in Crystal City, Virginia, hosted AForA's annual conference, during which Gabriel bragged that she had a \"standing meeting once a week\" with President Donald Trump.", "AForA's choice of conference site was first reported in February 2018, and it prompted a campaign by activist groups such as MoveOn and Muslim Advocates urging Hyatt to turn Gabriel's group away.", "On 30 August 2018, the activist groups delivered what they said were 100,000 signatures on a petition calling for Hyatt not to host AForA's conference, but the event was held as scheduled nonetheless.", "Scott Simpson, public advocacy director for Muslim Advocates, called Hyatt's decision \"a breath of fresh air\" and rejected AForA's claims about a blanket ban on conservatives.", "\"I certainly don't want conservatives banned from places,\" Simpson said. \"I don't stand for that, and I know Muslim Advocates don't stand for that.\"", "Meanwhile, there has been no sign that Hyatt hotels are turning away conservative events in general.
