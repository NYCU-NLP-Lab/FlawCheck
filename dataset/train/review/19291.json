["By Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on October 31, 2019", "While the House has been conducting an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump and others in his administration have kept their focus on the White House-released memo on Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, claiming that simply reading the \u201ctranscript\u201d is all that\u2019s needed to evaluate the impeachment probe. But congressional testimony has revealed key pieces of information beyond that conversation.", "Trump questioned the need for any more testimony in an Oct. 29 tweet, saying, \u201cHow many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT!\u201d", "Vice President Mike Pence similarly twice said in an Oct. 28 \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d interview that if the American people \u201cread the transcript,\u201d they \u201cwill see the president did nothing wrong. There was no quid pro quo.\u201d", "Earlier this month, on Oct. 2, Trump said, \u201cThe whistleblower was wrong. The only thing that matters is the transcript of the actual conversation that I had with the president of Ukraine. It was perfect.\u201d (The transcript actually backed up the three main points the whistleblower made about the July phone call, as we\u2019ve written before.)", "The House Democrats\u2019 inquiry concerns Trump\u2019s decision to withhold appropriated security aid to Ukraine and whether he did so to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to investigate Democrats and former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 political rival.", "Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call was one of the events described in an\u00a0Aug. 12 whistleblower complaint. Trump, according to the White House memo on the call, told Zelensky the U.S. \u201chas been very very good to Ukraine\u201d and asked\u00a0for \u201ca favor,\u201d that Zelensky look into CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee after its computer network was hacked by Russian intelligence officers. That\u2019s an apparent reference to a debunked conspiracy theory.", "In his phone call, Trump also asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. As we\u2019ve written, Trump has distorted the facts when he has claimed\u00a0that Joe Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold \u201cbillions of dollars to Ukraine\u201d unless it removed the prosecutor general who \u201cwas prosecuting\u201d Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had served. There\u2019s no evidence Hunter Biden was ever being investigated or prosecuted.", "But the House impeachment probe has revealed that several government officials raised concerns about Trump\u2019s phone call and actions before and after the call.", "While the testimony so far has occurred behind closed doors, many of the prepared opening statements have been released, and some details of the sessions have been reported by the press. The House is set to vote on a resolution on Oct. 31 that would set the rules for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry.", "Here are several key moments we have learned regarding Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.", "Time after time, Trump has falsely claimed that the White House released an \u201cexact word-for-word transcript\u201d or \u201cverbatim transcript\u201d of his July 25 phone call with Zelensky.", "But as\u00a0we\u2019ve written before, the White House memo of the call includes a \u201ccaution\u201d note saying it \u201cis not a verbatim transcript.\u201d It is the \u201cnotes and recollections,\u201d it said, of staff \u201cassigned to listen and memorialize the conversation.\u201d", "Ellipses are used three times in the memo, seeming to indicate missing words.", "And we have now learned that there were certain parts of Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky that were not documented in the memo.", "The\u00a0New York Times, citing three unnamed sources, reported that, in private testimony before House impeachment investigators on Oct. 29, Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the White House\u2019s National Security Council who listened in on the July 25 call, testified that certain words and phrases were omitted and that his subsequent attempt to have them included was not successful.", "\u201cThe omissions, Colonel Vindman said, included Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. discussing Ukraine corruption, and an explicit mention by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter,\u201d the\u00a0Times\u00a0said. The newspaper also reported that Vindman \u201ctried to change the reconstructed transcript made by the White House staff to reflect the omissions. But while some of his edits appeared to have been successful, he said, those two corrections were not made.\u201d", "Vindman reportedly said that at the point in the memo where the third set of ellipses appears, Trump mentioned there being tapes of Biden \u2014 which the\u00a0Times\u00a0said was \u201can apparent reference\u201d to Biden\u2019s comments at a January 2018 event about his efforts as vice president to get Ukraine to force out Viktor Shokin as its prosecutor general.", "According to the memo, Trump said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d (As\u00a0we\u2019ve written, Biden didn\u2019t brag about stopping \u201cthe prosecution.\u201d)", "In\u00a0his opening statement to House investigators, Vindman said he was concerned by the call and reported those concerns to the NSC\u2019s legal counsel.", "\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine. I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security,\u201d he said.", "It was known long before the whistleblower\u2019s complaint that New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s private lawyer, was working in Ukraine on behalf of his client.\u00a0In May, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported that Giuliani planned to visit Ukraine to encourage Zelensky to \u201cpursue inquiries\u201d involving political matters that could help Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection: \u201cOne is the origin of the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. The other is the involvement of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s son in a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.\u201d", "But the impeachment inquiry has shed light on Giuliani\u2019s influence on U.S. policy toward Ukraine inside the administration.", "In his Oct. 22 opening statement to the House committees, William B. Taylor, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, said there were \u201ctwo channels of U.S. policy-making and implementation\u201d in Ukraine, which he called \u201cregular\u201d and \u201chighly irregular.\u201d", "\u201c[T]he irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Taylor said, and included Energy Secretary Rick Perry;\u00a0Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union; and Kurt Volker,\u00a0Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine at the time.", "Taylor, who spent his career in public service and had been ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, was tapped for his current job by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after Marie Yovanovitch\u2019s assignment as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was cut short in May.", "This is how Taylor described the U.S. policy toward Ukraine when he arrived in Kyiv in June:", "Taylor, Oct. 22:\u00a0There appeared to be two channels of U.S. policy-making and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular. As the Chief of Mission, I had authority over the regular, formal diplomatic processes, including the bulk of the U.S. effort to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion and to help it defeat corruption. This regular channel of U.S. policy-making has consistently had strong, bipartisan support both in Congress and in all administrations since Ukraine\u2019s independence from Russia in 1991.", "At the same time, however, there was an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making with respect to Ukraine, one which included then-Special Envoy Kurt Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, and as I subsequently learned, Mr. Giuliani. I was clearly in the regular channel, but I was also in the irregular one to the extent that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland included me in certain conversations. Although this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside of official State Department channels. This irregular channel began when Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Senator Ron Johnson briefed President Trump on May 23 upon their return from President Zelenskyy\u2019s inauguration.", "In particular, Taylor said the \u201cirregular channel\u201d was working with the president to pressure\u00a0Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine would investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals. That pressure included the withholding of U.S. security aid.", "\u201cI became increasingly concerned,\u201d Taylor testified, \u201cthat our relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons.\u201d", "In his testimony, Taylor described in detail how he came to believe that security aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting for Ukrainian President Zelensky were being tied to Ukraine\u2019s willingness to conduct investigations concerning Burisma and the 2016 election.", "Taylor said he first learned at a July 18 NSC meeting that the security aid was being held up at the direction of the president.\u00a0\u201cIn an instant, I realized that one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened. The irregular policy channel was running contrary to the goals of longstanding U.S. policy,\u201d he said.", "A day later, Volker put Giuliani in touch with Andrey Yermak, a close aide to Zelensky, according to Volker\u2019s\u00a0Oct. 3 prepared written testimony\u00a0and a\u00a0text message\u00a0posted to Twitter by Giuliani. In his opening remarks, Volker said Giuliani talked to Yermak about the need for Zelensky to issue a public statement that \u201cwould reference Burisma and 2016, in a wider context of rooting out corruption.\u201d", "On Aug. 16, Yermak showed Volker a draft of an anti-corruption statement that \u201cdid not mention Burisma or 2016 elections.\u201d Volker said he found it \u201cperfectly reasonable\u201d and Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, \u201cagreed it was an excellent statement.\u201d But Giuliani criticized it, saying \u201cthe statement should include specific reference to \u2018Burisma\u2019 and \u20182016,\u2019\u201d Volker said.", "The idea of putting out an anti-corruption statement was shelved at around that time, Volker told the House committees. But Taylor testified that it continued into September.", "On Sept. 1, Sondland told Taylor that military aid for Ukraine also was contingent on \u201csuch investigations.\u201d", "\u201c[T]he push to make President Zelenskyy publicly commit to investigations of Burisma and alleged interference in the 2016 election showed how the official foreign policy of the United States was undercut by the irregular efforts led by Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Taylor said.", "In his testimony, Taylor said that National Security Council aide\u00a0Tim Morrison\u00a0told him on Sept. 7 about a phone call earlier that day between Sondland and Trump. \u201cAccording to Mr. Morrison, President Trump told Ambassador Sondland that he was not asking for a \u2018quid pro quo.\u2019 But President Trump did insist that President Zelenskyy go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference, and that President Zelenskyy should want to do this himself,\u201d Taylor said.", "The next day, Sondland and Taylor spoke on the phone. Sondland told Taylor that Trump was \u201cadamant that President Zelenskyy, himself, had to \u2018clear things up and do it in public.'\u201d", "\u201cAmbassador Sondland said that he had talked to President Zelenskyy and Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelenskyy did not \u2018clear things up\u2019 in public, we would be at a \u2018stalemate.\u2019\u201d Taylor said.", "\u201cI understood a \u2018stalemate\u2019 to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAmbassador Sondland said that this conversation concluded with President Zelenskyy agreeing to make a public statement in an interview with CNN.\u201d", "According to Taylor, Sondland described the arrangement in business terms.", "\u201cWhen a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something,\u201d Taylor recalled Sondland telling him, \u201cthe businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.\u201d In his\u00a0testimony, Taylor said he told Sondland \u201cthe Ukrainians did not \u2018owe\u2019 President Trump anything, and holding up security assistance for domestic political gain was \u2018crazy.\u2019\u201d", "In a Sept. 9\u00a0text message, Taylor told Sondland: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d After receiving that text message, Sondland called Trump. \u201cI asked the President: \u2018What do you want from Ukraine?\u2019 The President responded, \u2018Nothing. There is no quid pro quo.\u2019 The President repeated: \u2018no quid pro quo\u2019 multiple times,\u201d Sondland said in his opening statement to the committees on Oct. 17. \u201cThis was a very short call. And I recall the President was in a bad mood.\u201d", "Sondland then sent this text to Taylor: \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text If you still have concerns I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or S a call to discuss them directly.\u201d", "On the same day, Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community,\u00a0notified\u00a0the House intelligence committee about the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. Two days later, the Trump administration released the security aid to Ukraine.", "At that point, Taylor said he \u201creminded Mr. Yermak of the high strategic value of bipartisan support for Ukraine and the importance of not getting involved in other countries\u2019 elections. My fear at the time was that since Ambassador Sondland had told me President Zelenskyy already agreed to do a CNN interview, President Zelenskyy would make a statement regarding \u2018investigations\u2019 that would have played into domestic U.S. politics.\u201d", "At Taylor\u2019s urging, he said, aides to Zelensky confirmed he would not do the CNN interview.", "One of the major revelations coming from the impeachment inquiry so far involves Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, John Bolton.", "Bolton\u00a0replaced\u00a0H.R. McMaster as national security adviser in April 2018, but left office abruptly in mid-September after a falling out with Trump. In a Sept. 10\u00a0tweet, Trump said, \u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration.\u201d Bolton disputed the president\u2019s version of events in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0that same day: \u201cI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow.\u2019\u201d", "One of the disagreements was over Ukraine policy, as described by at least two witnesses before the House committees overseeing the impeachment inquiry.", "In his\u00a0prepared opening statement, Taylor recalled being told by\u00a0Fiona Hill\u00a0and\u00a0Alexander Vindman, who were National Security Council officials at the time, that Bolton ended a July 10 meeting with Ukrainian officials over concern about the administration mixing politics with diplomacy. At that meeting, Sondland tied a possible Oval Office visit between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky with \u201cinvestigations\u201d \u2014 prompting Bolton to end the meeting, Taylor said.", "\u201cSpecifically, they told me that Ambassador Sondland had connected \u2018investigations\u2019 with an Oval Office meeting for President Zelenskyy, which so irritated Ambassador Bolton that he abruptly ended the meeting, telling Dr. Hill and Mr. Vindman that they should have nothing to do with domestic politics,\u201d Taylor said of a July 19 conversation he had with Hill and Vindman. Bolton \u201calso directed Dr. Hill to \u2018brief the lawyers.\u2019 Dr. Hill said that Ambassador Bolton referred to this as a \u2018drug deal\u2019 after the July 10 meeting. Ambassador Bolton opposed a call between President Zelenskyy and President Trump out of concern that it \u2018would be a disaster,\u2019\u201d Taylor said.", "In her Oct. 14 testimony, Hill corroborated Taylor\u2019s recollection of Bolton\u2019s response to the July 10 meeting. The\u00a0New York Times, in an\u00a0account\u00a0of Hill\u2019s testimony, quoted Bolton as telling her: \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.\u201d She also told congressional investigators that Bolton told her: \u201cGiuliani\u2019s a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d", "But Sondland disputed media reports of Hill\u2019s account. \u201cTo put it clearly: Neither she nor Ambassador Bolton shared any critical comments with me, even after our July 10, 2019 White House meeting,\u201d Sondland said in his\u00a0Oct. 17 prepared opening statement\u00a0to the House committees.", "However, a third witness, Christopher J. Anderson, who was Volker\u2019s special adviser for Ukraine negotiations from August 2017 until July 12, also told the House committees that Bolton had concerns about Giuliani\u2019s involvement in Ukraine policy.", "In his Oct. 30\u00a0prepared opening remarks, Anderson said he and Volker met with Bolton on June 13 to discuss improving relations with Ukraine. At that meeting, Anderson said Bolton \u201ccautioned [them] that Mr. Giuliani was a key voice with the President on Ukraine which could be an obstacle\u201d to their efforts in Ukraine.", "Trump has maintained that one of the reasons he withheld security aid to Ukraine was because of concerns about corruption in the country. He told reporters on Sept. 23, \u201cWe want to make sure that country is honest. It\u2019s very important to talk about corruption. If you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d His acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said in an Oct. 20 interview that Ukraine received the aid \u201c[o]nce we were able to satisfy ourselves that corruption was actually \u2014 they were doing better with it.\u201d", "But congressional testimony has shown that his top aides thought Zelensky was aggressively addressing corruption.", "Sondland said in his Oct. 17 prepared opening statement that the U.S. delegation to Zelensky\u2019s inauguration on May 20 \u201cdeveloped positive views of the new Ukraine President and his desire \u2026 to address Ukraine\u2019s well-known and longstanding corruption issues.\u201d", "Three days later, on May 23, Sondland and other members of that delegation met with Trump to share that view. Sondland said they asked Trump to call Zelensky and host a visit with him. \u201cHowever, President Trump was skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption, and he directed those of us present at the meeting to talk to Mr. Giuliani, his personal attorney, about his concerns,\u201d Sondland testified. \u201cIt was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the President\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani.\u201d", "Volker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine and another member of that delegation to Zelensky\u2019s inauguration, made similar remarks in his congressional testimony, saying that in the May 23 meeting with Trump, \u201cWe stressed our finding that President Zelenskyy represented the best chance for getting Ukraine out of the mire of corruption it had been in for over 20 years.\u201d Volker said that Trump was \u201cvery skeptical.\u201d The president said Ukraine was \u201cfull of \u2018terrible people\u2019\u201d who \u201c\u2019tried to take me down,\u2019\u201d Volker recalled, adding that Trump\u2019s \u201cnegative view\u201d was \u201crooted in the past,\u201d and that Trump was \u201cclearly receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani.\u201d", "Taylor also testified that he saw \u201cencouraging\u201d signs that Zelensky was serious about fighting corruption soon after Taylor assumed his post on June 17.", "Zelensky \u201chad appointed reformist ministers and supported long-stalled anti-corruption legislation. He took quick executive action, including opening Ukraine\u2019s High Anti-Corruption Court, which was established under the previous presidential administration but never allowed to operate,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWith his new parliamentary majority, President Zelenskyy changed the Ukrainian constitution to remove absolute immunity from Rada deputies, which had been the source of raw corruption for two decades. There was much excitement in Kyiv that this time things could be different \u2014 a new Ukraine might finally be breaking from its corrupt, post-Soviet past.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s Note: Click here for our full coverage on the impeachment inquiry.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
