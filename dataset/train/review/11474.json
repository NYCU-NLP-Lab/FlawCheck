It actually shows a group of students at Cairo's Al-Azhar University taking part in a \"die-in\" protest and was originally shared on the YouTube page of Al Badil, an Egyptian news outlet:", "Al Badil uploaded several other videos from this protest as well, such as the following:", "An English-language report published by Ahram in October 2013 provided more context about the protest:", "Students at Al-Azhar University in Cairo's Nasr City district staged what they called \"anti-coup\" demonstrations on campus as tensions rise between them and security forces.", "Groups of students have been protesting what they call a \"military coup\" that toppled Islamist president Mohamed Morsi.
