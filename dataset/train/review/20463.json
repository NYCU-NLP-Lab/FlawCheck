(New York Times)", "During an NBC forum that focused on the presidential candidates\u2019 national security chops, host Matt Lauer asked Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton why it isn\u2019t disqualifying that she dealt with highly sensitive material on a private, unclassified email system.", "Clinton said she made a mistake using the system, but she still took classification seriously.", "\"I have a lot of experience dealing with classified material, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee going into the four years as secretary of state,\" she said. \"Classified material has a header which says \u2018top secret, secret, confidential.\u2019 Nothing, and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice, none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header.\"", "Given that we\u2019ve found Clinton\u2019s email did contain some classified information, this statement intrigued us.", "Information isn\u2019t classified until a designated authority within the government declares it classified. The way that person shows their determination is by adding a header and footer to the relevant document, often tacking on a cover sheet, too \u2014 all to make it clear that the document contains classified information.", "Clinton is correct that the FBI did not find any such labels in her emails.", "Of the tens of thousands of emails the FBI reviewed, 81 email chains found on Clinton\u2019s private servers included classified information, as determined by various U.S. intelligence agencies, according to a FBI report released Sept. 2. Just three email chains included some sort of classification marking: At least one paragraph preceded by the marking \"(C),\" indicating that those paragraphs were \"confidential,\" the lowest level of classification. But none of the three had a header, footer or cover page further signaling that the emails contained confidential information.", "Even though there was a \"(C)\" preceding the paragraphs, this information was not properly marked confidential because it did not include the header, FBI Director James Comey said in a July 7 hearing before Congress. It\u2019s \"reasonable,\" he said, that Clinton may not have realized these were classified.", "For Clinton\u2019s part, she told the FBI that \"she did not know what the \"(C)\" meant at the beginning of the paragraphs and speculated it was referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical order,\" according to the bureau\u2019s report. She also disputed the need for these particular paragraphs to be classified at all.", "So that\u2019s three email chains out of 81 found to include classified information on Clinton\u2019s private email server. What about the other 78?", "Clinton, in her statement, said classified material has a header that says \"classified\" and that none her emails had that header. But that leaves out the possibility of what happened in this case \u2014 classified information is left unlabeled as a result of human error.", "All information determined to be classified should have a header in order to designate it properly. But if someone makes a mistake and forgets to include the label after that original determination, the information is still classified.", "\"In that case, the information was classified, but in the absence of markings, the person receiving the information may have no realistic way of knowing that fact,\" said Liza Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice.", "\"\u2018Classified\u2019 isn\u2019t an inherent or self-evident status. It\u2019s an act,\" she said. \"And that act is rather meaningless if not conveyed to others.\"", "Comey has said it\u2019s understandable that Clinton did not realize some of this unmarked information was classified. But he also has said she should have recognized by the topic of discussion that some of these emails did not belong on a nonclassified system, given that 36 of these email chains had \"secret\" information and eight had \"top secret\" information.", "\"There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,\" Comey said in a July 5 statement.", "For example, some of these email discussions touched on the CIA\u2019s drone program. Members of Clinton\u2019s staff told the FBI that some of this supposedly classified drone-related information had already been revealed to the public in news reports.", "Clinton regularly dealt with classified information as secretary of state. She has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office, and she used other secure channels when traveling. Some emails now made public actually show Clinton\u2019s team discussing how they couldn\u2019t email each other classified information over the private server and instead had to move the conversation to a more appropriate venue.", "In the end, Comey said the Justice Department shouldn\u2019t prosecute Clinton because there isn\u2019t enough evidence that she intentionally mishandled classified information, nor did investigators find vast quantities of exposed classified material.", "Many transparency experts say the government regularly overclassifies, such as classifying information that wouldn\u2019t actually damage national security if released. That\u2019s likely the case regarding Clinton\u2019s emails, said Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University, which favors less classification.", "\"The point is there's no objective standard for classification,\" Blanton said. \"Very little of what's classified would be deemed so by all experienced observers.\"", "Our ruling", "Clinton said, \"Classified material has a header which says \u2018top secret, secret, confidential.\u2019 Nothing, and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the reports by the Department of Justice, none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header.\"", "For information to be considered properly marked classified, it must contain a header. Clinton is correct that nothing in her email had a header signifying its classification status. Three email chains had a \"(C)\" indicating \"confidential\" information, but that is not enough to consider the emails properly marked classified.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t any classified information in her email. If someone has determined information to be classified, it is still technically classified even if someone neglects to label it down the line. The FBI found 81 email chains that contained information determined to be classified, though none of the information was appropriately labeled, so it wasn\u2019t necessarily obvious to the recipients.", "Clinton\u2019s carefully worded statement is accurate but needs additional information.\u00a0For that, we rate her claim Mostly True.", "Editor's note:\u00a0The original version of this fact-check ended with\u00a0the definition of Half True. The fact-check has been revised to include the definition of Mostly True.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/324a3685-89b0-4e34-b615-3f63b26d7168", "Washington Post, transcript of MSNBC forum, Sept. 7, 2016", "FBI, report on investigation into Clinton emails, released Sept. 2, 2016", "FBI, Statement by FBI Director James B.
