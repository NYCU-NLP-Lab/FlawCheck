A new program from the National Rifle Association, in partnership with Smith & Wesson, seeks to change that.", "Share the Safety is a revolutionary online store that will open its digital doors on July 4. Taking its cue from other \u201cbuy one, give one\u201d retailers, customers of ShareTheSafety.org will have the pleasure of knowing that for each handgun purchased, one will be donated to an at-risk American citizen in the urban center of their choice.", "\u201cWe know that the only protection from bad guys are good guys with guns,\u201d said Hensley Cocker, Program Director of Share the Safety. \"But tragically the people who need to protect themselves the most \u2014 the urban poor \u2014 are often unable to afford a lifesaving firearm.

For instance, all of the social media links on ShareTheSafety.org pointed to official NRA accounts, and the fake press release was published on a web site nearly identical to that of the National Rifle Association's lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA):", "One obvious difference between the two web sites to knowledgeable viewers was that the fake press release was published on\u00a0 NRApress.org\u00a0 (not affiliated with the NRA) while the NRA-ILA's web site resides at nraila.org.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
