In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1.", "It\u2019s a provocative claim that drew more the 130,000 likes on Twitter.", "Greenfield, a University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate, may be on the right track generally in contrasting how much gun violence there is in America compared to the rest of the world.", "But as for his specific claim, he leaves a misleading impression with the U.S. part and lacks evidence for the part about the rest of the world.", "U.S. school shootings", "On the U.S. part of his claim, Greenfield told us his 18 school shootings in 2018 comes from the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, as reported by ABC News.", "We found that in the immediate aftermath of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Politico, TIME, CNBC and other national media also reported on Everytown\u2019s 18 figure. In addition, the New York Daily News claimed 18 school shootings, listing the same incidents as Everytown, and HuffPost reported 18, too.", "But there are some major caveats to that figure.", "Indeed, when we asked Greenfield for information to back up his claim, he noted to us in his email that the Everytown group\u2019s count \"conflates very different incidents, from the harmless to the deadly.\"", "As PolitiFact National has reported, Everytown, an advocacy group co-founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that seeks to prevent gun violence, uses a broad definition of school shooting -- that is, any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building, or on a school campus or grounds. Its database includes incidents when no one was injured; attempted or completed suicide, with no intent to injure others; and cases when a gun was fired unintentionally, resulting in injury or death.
