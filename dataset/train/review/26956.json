One Facebook user\u00a0posted the image, with a comment,\u00a0\"Election fraud is real. President Trump is right.\"", "The image was circulated\u00a0two days after the Nov. 3 presidential election amid baseless charges by President Donald Trump of voter fraud and vote rigging.", "More:Fact check: Trump ballots were not thrown out as claimed by fake poll worker", "Among the more dramatic allegations from the lawsuit is\u00a0that registration rolls listed more than 2,500 dead people, including one person purportedly born in 1823, and duplicate names.", "The lawsuit, according to the image, had been filed by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, an\u00a0Indiana-based conservative, nonprofit, public interest law firm that specializes\u00a0in civil litigation\u00a0in high-profile political cases.", "The image of the TV news\u00a0report of a lawsuit is accurate, but it aired in December, not during the 2020 presidential election.
