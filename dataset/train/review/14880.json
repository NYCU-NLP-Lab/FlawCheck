["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on July 19, 2019", "A viral post falsely\u00a0asserts that Republicans are responsible for \u201cpassing laws making it legal to run over protesters with your car.\u201d That distorts proposed, but not enacted, legislation in several states offering some protections for drivers who unintentionally injure demonstrators blocking streets.", "Is it \u201clegal to run over protesters with your car\u201d?", "No, but that\u2019s what a\u00a0viral meme shared on Facebook claims. The popular post blames Republicans for passing such laws in the aftermath of the deadly attack on protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.", "\u201cNever forget,\u201d the meme reads. \u201cWhen a white supremacist murdered a protester by running her over with his car, Republicans responded by passing laws making it legal to run over protesters with your car.\u201d", "That\u2019s wrong.", "Republican lawmakers in a handful of states \u2014 and with the help of Democratic legislators in one case \u2014 did introduce bills that would have afforded some protections to drivers who injure demonstrators blocking traffic.\u00a0But those measures would have applied to drivers exercising \u201creasonable care\u201d or \u201cunintentionally\u201d injuring someone who was obstructing traffic, and some were specific to civil charges.\u00a0All but one that we found were proposed prior to the Charlottesville attack \u2014 not after it \u2014 and none were ultimately enacted.", "The proposals came amid a flurry of various\u00a0legislative attempts by states to control protests in early 2017.", "A bill considered in\u00a0North Dakota, for example, was introduced in January 2017, following prominent protests against an oil pipeline. That was months before a neo-Nazi plowed his car into protesters demonstrating against white nationalists in Charlottesville on Aug. 12, 2017, killing one woman and injuring others. The driver, James Fields, was\u00a0convicted\u00a0in 2018 of killing Heather Heyer and has received two life sentences in prison.", "The bill proposed in North Dakota\u2019s House of Representatives said that \u201ca driver of a motor vehicle who, while exercising reasonable care, causes injury or death to an individual who is intentionally obstructing vehicular traffic on a public road, street, or highway may not be held liable for any damages.\u201d It also said a driver who \u201cunintentionally causes injury or death to an individual who is intentionally obstructing\u201d traffic \u201cis not guilty of an offense.\u201d", "The measure\u00a0failed on its second read in February 2017.", "States that considered similar proposals include: Tennessee (introduced in February 2017),\u00a0Florida (introduced in February 2017),\u00a0North Carolina (introduced in March 2017),\u00a0Rhode Island\u00a0(introduced in March 2017),\u00a0Texas (introduced in July 2017)\u00a0and Kentucky (introduced in January 2018).", "None of them became law.", "In at least one case, the move had bipartisan support:\u00a0Two Democrats were among the five lawmakers who introduced the legislation in Rhode Island.", "Some of the bills used very similar language, and the wording applied specifically to unintentional cases. The measures would not have simply made it\u00a0\u201clegal to run over protesters with your car,\u201d as the meme says.", "The North Carolina, Rhode Island and Tennessee bills all applied to a driver \u201cexercising due care\u201d who \u201cinjures another person who is participating in a protest or demonstration and is blocking traffic\u201d in a public street. Those measures would\u2019ve protected the driver from only \u201ccivil liability\u201d (not criminal charges), but not if the \u201cactions\u201d of the driver \u201cleading to the injury were willful or wanton.\u201d", "In Texas, the legislation also protected against civil liability and would not have protected against drivers\u2019 \u201cgrossly negligent conduct.\u201d The Florida bill, meanwhile, called for punishing (with a second-degree misdemeanor) protesters who \u201cobstruct or interfere with the regular flow of traffic\u201d without a permit \u2014 and proposed liability protection for a driver \u201cwho unintentionally causes injury or death\u201d to such unauthorized protesters obstructing traffic.", "Kentucky\u2019s bill, the only one we found that was introduced after Charlottesville, proposed that a driver \u201cmay not be held criminally or civilly liable for causing\u00a0injury or death to a person who is obstructing or interfering with\u201d traffic during a protest without a permit \u2014 \u201cunless the infliction of the injury or death was intentional.\u201d", "The suite of related bills came under fire after the attack in Virginia, with some\u00a0questioning the need for such legislation and claiming such efforts could provide cover for would-be attackers. Those who had pushed for the bills tried to distance the legislation from the events in Charlottesville.", "\u201cIt is intellectually dishonest and a gross mischaracterization to portray North Carolina House Bill 330 as a protection measure for the act of violence that occurred in Charlottesville this past weekend,\u201d the Republican sponsors of that bill, Reps. Justin Burr and Chris Millis, said in an August 2017 statement. \u201cAny individual who committed a deliberate or willful act, such as what happened this weekend in Charlottesville, would face appropriately severe criminal and civil liabilities.\u201d", "So, while the Charlottesville attack did renew focus\u00a0on the legislation, it was not the impetus for the proposals, as the post indicated, and those proposals did not go on to become \u201claws.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
