["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on January 22, 2021", "Social media posts point out that the web address antifa.com now redirects to the White House website. That\u2019s true, but in need of some important context: Whoever owns a domain name can instruct it to reroute to whichever website they\u2019d like.", "After President Joe Biden was sworn into office, social media users and websites drew attention to the curious fact that the URL \u201cantifa.com\u201d is set up to automatically take users to the official White House website.", "That\u2019s true, but many of the posts spreading that information stand to mislead users because they omit an important bit of context: Anyone who owns a domain name can create such a redirect. In other words, the owner of antifa.com can set up the redirect to whitehouse.gov without the White House\u2019s permission.", "\u201cSomeone just told me to go to antifa.com because it goes to WH,\u201d read a popular Jan. 20 tweet from a conservative commentator. \u201cThis is so weird.\u201d", "The website 100percentfedup.com raised eyebrows, too.

And \u201cthe owner of a domain name is free to write whatever IP address they want in their entry.\u201d", "Angel said, in this case, the White House wouldn\u2019t have to authorize the redirect \u2014 or be a part of that decision in any way. Whoever owns \u201cantifa.com\u201d can do this \u201cunilaterally without any help or coordination,\u201d he said.", "Who, exactly, owns antifa.com isn\u2019t clear.
