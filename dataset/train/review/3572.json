The first set was sent to a limited number of public health labs and had no reported issues. The problem came with the second batch, which the CDC intended to manufacture for the first wave of testing \u2014 at least until commercial labs and diagnostic companies were able to mass-produce their own.", "\"One of the three reagents in this initial batch of manufactured test kits was likely contaminated. These tests are so sensitive that this contamination could have been caused by a single person walking through an area with positive control material and then later entering an area where tests reagents were being manipulated,\" the report stated.", "The public health labs attempted to validate the test kits before using them on swabs from people, but a negative control gave a positive result, and the kits were scrapped.", "Scientists eventually redesigned the test to be run without the reagent and in February began to distribute the approved kits.", "The CDC also confirmed that there was no live virus in the test. And Dr. Benjamin Pinsky, medical director of the Clinical Virology Lab at Stanford Medicine, told PolitiFact that infectious live viruses are not used to produce tests.", "\"The HHS investigation indicates that there was likely contamination of the N3 reagents with the positive control material,\" Pinsky wrote in an email. \"No infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus is part of the kit, nor is it used in any step of its manufacture.\"", "A Facebook post claimed that the CDC \"sent states tainted lab test kits\" in February that \"were themselves seeded with the virus.\"", "This is inaccurate.
