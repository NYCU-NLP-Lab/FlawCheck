At the outset, each side attempted to curry favor through economic aid and other soft power measures, said Benjamin Hopkins, a professor of history and international affairs at George Washington University.", "But over the following decades the rivalry grew more tense as Afghan politics frayed.", "The Soviet Union viewed Afghanistan as part of its natural sphere of influence, while the United States saw it as the Soviet regime\u2019s \"soft underbelly,\" in the words of former U.S. diplomat Graham Fuller.", "\"The United States saw this as an area of competition precisely because of Afghanistan\u2019s proximity to the Soviet Union,\" said Benjamin Hopkins, a professor of history and international affairs at George Washington University. \"They saw this as an easier way in to undermine the Soviet Union.\"", "In his political history of Afghanistan, In the Graveyard of Empires, Jones, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, relied on declassified Soviet documents that give a window into Moscow\u2019s thinking at the time.", "In fall 1979, Soviet leadership grew increasingly worried that a new Afghan leader, Hafizullah Amin, was too amenable to Western influence.
