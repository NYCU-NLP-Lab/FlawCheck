["By Robert Farley", "Posted on May 6, 2016 | Updated on June 17, 2016", "Donald Trump continues to make the puffed-up assertion that Russian President Vladimir Putin called him a \u201cgenius.\u201d Russian language experts tell us that Putin described Trump as \u201ccolorful\u201d or maybe \u201cbright,\u201d depending on how one translates Putin\u2019s words, but he never called Trump a genius.", "Glenn Kessler of the Washington Post Fact Checker wrote on May 3 that Trump\u2019s repeated claim that Putin called him a genius was\u00a0based on a mistranslation of Putin\u2019s words. Nonetheless, Trump continued to mischaracterize Putin\u2019s praise the following day in an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer.", "\u201cSo far, we\u2019re off to a good start,\u201d Trump said of his relationship with Putin. \u201cHe said \u2018Trump is a genius,\u2019 OK?\u201d", "Trump frequently claims that Putin called him a genius. He said it in an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox News on April 28. And in an April 29 radio interview with Michael Savage. And during a town hall interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on April 4. And during a campaign event in South Carolina in February.", "Trump is basing his claim on comments Putin made during a press scrum in December, when Putin was asked what he thought about Trump.", "According to a translation by Russia Insider, which uploaded the video, Putin responded, \u201cHe\u2019s a very colorful person. Talented, without any doubt. But it\u2019s not our affair to determine his worthiness \u2014 that\u2019s up to the United States voters. But he is absolutely the leader in the presidential race. He wants to move to a different level of relations, to more solid, deeper relations with Russia. And how can Russia not welcome that \u2014 we welcome that. As for his internal political issues and the turn of speech which he uses to raise his popularity, I repeat, it\u2019s not our affair to evaluate them.\u201d", "It\u2019s the word \u201ccolorful\u201d in the first sentence of that translation that is at issue here.", "The Washington Post\u2018s Kessler found various media outlets provided slightly different translations of it. Some said Putin called Trump \u201ccolorful,\u201d others \u201clively\u201d or \u201cflamboyant.\u201d One outlet, the Hill, translated Putin\u2019s praise of Trump as \u201creally brilliant.\u201d", "The Guardian newspaper initially wrote that Putin called Trump \u201cbright,\u201d but then revised its item with this explanation: \u201cAn earlier version quoted Putin as saying \u2018bright and talented.\u2019 To clarify: The word he used was \u2018yarkii\u2019 (\u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0439), which can mean bright or brilliant, but not in the sense of intelligent; it can also be translated as colorful, vivid or flamboyant.\u201d", "Of note, none of those news reports say Putin called Trump a \u201cgenius.\u201d", "We reached out to several Russian language experts, and they all agreed that Trump was inflating Putin\u2019s rather guarded praise. But there is some disagreement about the precise meaning of Putin\u2019s phrase.", "\u201cThe adjective \u201c\u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0439\u201d in this context is a carefully selected word and it means here \u2018not ordinary\u2019 or \u2018impressive,\u2019 \u201d Constantine Muravnik, a professor in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Yale, told us via email. \u201d \u2018Extraordinary,\u2019 \u2018remarkable,\u2019\u00a0 or \u2018outstanding\u2019 would be too positive, \u2018colorful\u2019 or \u2018eccentric\u2019 \u2013 too negative, \u2018brilliant\u2019 or \u2018bright\u2019 \u2014 \u00a0simply wrong. This is why Putin added a phrase, \u2018talented beyond any doubt,\u2019 just to push the otherwise neutral and ambiguous word in a slightly more positive direction. He also compensated this ambiguity with his overall positive and respectful intonation.\u201d", "\u201cTrump is slightly twisting his words by adding the connotation of admiration always associated with the word \u2018genius,\u2019 \u201d Muravnik added. \u201cThere\u2019s no admiration in Putin\u2019s words, just a respectful acknowledgement of some of his \u2018impressive\u2019 traits. Also, Putin emphatically, even if a bit slyly, refrained from any comments on the internal US affairs.\u201d", "Edna Andrews, professor of linguistics and cultural anthropology at Duke University, told us Putin definitely did not call Trump a genius.", "\u201cI believe \u2018colorful\u2019 is a very good translation of the use of this term in the given context,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cPutin also clearly stated that it was not his business to get involved in the choice of a U.S. elected official, but he did welcome a deepening of US/Russian relations.\u201d", "\u201cPutin called Trump \u2018bright,\u2019 \u201d Ilya Vinitsky, chair of the Department of Slavic Languages and Literature at the University of Pennsylvania, told us via email. \u201cGenius in Russian is \u2018genii.\u2019 Putin didn\u2019t use this word.\u201d", "And finally, Boris Gasparov, a professor of Russian and East European studies at Columbia University, told us that \u201cif he [Putin] said \u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0439 it means, applied to a politician, definitively a compliment, although by far not such ravishing as that of the \u2018genius.\u2019 It does not mean \u2018colorful\u2019 (that is, it is by no means tinged with ambiguity), but it is not entirely unqualified either. The meaning lingers somewhere between \u2018standing out,\u2019 \u2018unusual,\u2019 \u2018bold,\u2019 \u2018unpredictable, but hopefully for the better.\u2019 \u201d", "So there is a bit of disagreement among Russian language experts about the precise translation of Putin\u2019s words. But not one of them agreed with Trump\u2019s translation of \u201cgenius.\u201d", "Update, June 17, 2016: In a speech in St. Petersburg, Russia, on June 17, Putin clarified that he had only described Trump as \u201cflamboyant.\u201d According to Reuters, Putin added, with a smile, \u201cHe is, isn\u2019t he? I did not give any other assessment of him.\u201d", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3885c8ff-7435-4a01-b64f-8fdb66bd66d1", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
