I have never killed any one, but I have read some obituary notices with great satisfaction.\"", "Here's Darrow's quote in a more shareable meme form:", "Twain is truly a highly quotable author, which is probably why he is also credited with many things he didn't actually write. For example, Twain did not say \"The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco,\" or \"If voting made a difference, they wouldn't let us do it.\"", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
