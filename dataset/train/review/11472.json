The first, which the post says is from 1977, shows a penguin in snow and the headline: \"How To Survive The Coming Ice Age.\" The second, which the post says is from 2008, is an illustration that shows the men from the iconic Iwo Jima photograph lifting a Redwood tree instead of the American flag in the original image from 1945. The cover story from that issue? \"How to Win The War on Global Warming.\"", "This post, which had been shared more than 8,400 times by May 22, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
