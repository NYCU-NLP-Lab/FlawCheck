No attorney, whether just starting out as a new lawyer or serving as the country\u2019s top law enforcement officer, should lie under oath. The Alabama bar must investigate this wrong fully and fairly.\u201d", "Alabama State Bar rules state that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cengage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.\u201d Sessions has been a member of the bar since 1973.", "The disbarment process can be a lengthy one, according to coverage by the Washington Post. If the five-member disciplinary committee finds that the complaints have merit, copies will sent to Sessions for his written response.
