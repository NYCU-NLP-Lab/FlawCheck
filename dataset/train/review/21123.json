It seems like I really should share, because this original film seems to have taken on a somewhat classic-movie nostalgia and I get it\u2014 it\u2019s a really cool, great movie. Also people seem to love RDJ more than ever; I get that too- he\u2019s very talented, and quite un-ugly. I had a blast working on it, one of my favorite career experiences ever. This prosthetic makeup was built by Stan Winston Studio, supervised by Shane Mahan, and applied by 3 of us\u2014 my boss, makeup department head Deborah La Mia Denaver, and by Richie Alonzo, and by me. I made a subsequent new sculpture and appliance for when it is more healed up and less ragged (previously posted). But this piece was made by the legendary artists of the late great Stan Winston\u2019s Studio. Fun Fact: These pix are from the VERY first day of filming the first IRON MAN, they are dated March 12, 2007. The very first shot of principal photography was Tony Stark waking up in the cave, with the RT device wired to his chest to keep him alive, courtesy of character Yinsen (actor Shaun Toub) #marvel #ironman #makeup #makeupartist #fxmakeup #makeupfx #prosthetics #charactermakeup #promua #prostheticmakeup #specialmakeupeffects #setlife #specialmakeupfx #sfxmakeup #comicbookmovies #sws #stanwinstonstudio #moviemakeup #rdj #tonystark #shanemahan #richiealonzo #robertdowneyjr #excelsior", "A post shared by  Jamie Kelman (@jkelmakeup) on Mar 11, 2018 at 6:34pm PDT", "Its caption states in part: \u00a0\u201cThis prosthetic makeup was built by Stan Winston Studio, supervised by Shane Mahan, and applied by 3 of us\u2014 my boss, makeup department head Deborah La Mia Denaver, and by Richie Alonzo, and by me.\u201d", "It adds: \u201cThese pix are from the VERY first day of filming the first IRON MAN, they are dated March 12, 2007.\u201d", "Jamie Kelman told AFP by email that the images in the misleading Facebook post showed fake make up from Iron Man.", "\"Yes it is absolutely fake makeup - I was the Key Makeup Artist on the original IRON MAN, and I personally took those photos of the makeup work that I had applied on actor Robert Downey Jr. as a wounded Tony Stark.\"", "\"Those pictures are from a dozen years ago in the makeup trailer and on-set during filming the first IRON MAN movie in 2007, here in Los Angeles, California.\"", "\"Yes the images are just makeup for telling the story of IRON MAN.
