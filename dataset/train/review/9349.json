(AP)", "Trump said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d when mocking Mike Bloomberg in February in an effort to suggest that the Democratic candidate choked during a debate.", "Trump also said, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d in 2016 to mock Mitt Romney.", "Videos being posted in June 2020 on Facebook show President Donald Trump sarcastically saying \"I can\u2019t breathe,\" but he wasn\u2019t mocking George Floyd \u2014 he was poking fun of political rivals in the past.", "The videos we saw omitted the date of Trump speaking and the context of his remarks, which could leave viewers with the false impression that Trump was ridiculing Floyd\u2019s dying words. But more complete footage of Trump\u2019s \"I can\u2019t breathe\" remarks show he was mocking Democrats\u2019 debate performance in February.", "These posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "Trump\u2019s comments are from his Feb. 20th campaign rally in Colorado Springs, Colo., the night after a Democratic primary debate where candidate Mike Bloomberg got battered by his opponents.", "\"Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked!...\" Trump said while grabbing his own neck and pretending to gag. \"\u2019I can\u2019t breathe! I can\u2019t breathe! Don\u2019t ask me the question please!\"", "At the same rally, Trump also mocked then candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.", "\"How about Klobuchar. Did you see her? She choked. She choked,\" he said. \"She couldn't breathe.\"", "Trump has used the phrase before and accused political rivals of choking, including while mocking Mitt Romney on April 12, 2016, in a speech in Rome, N.Y.", "\"The RNC hasn't won an important election in a long time. We've had (Barack) Obama far too long. The last election should have been won, except Romney choked like a dog. He choked. He went, \u2018I can't breathe, I can't breathe,\u2019\" he said, referring to Romney\u2019s loss in the 2012 presidential race. \"Romney choked \u2026. Romney can't recover from a choke.\" (Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, won his race in 2018 for U.S. Senate in Utah.)", "In 2015, Trump also derided U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as a \"lightweight choker.\"", "Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after a white police officer in Minneapolis pinned Floyd\u2019s neck under his knee. Floyd can be heard repeatedly telling the officers, \"I can\u2019t breathe.\" After a few minutes, Floyd becomes silent, but Officer Derek Chauvin keeps his knee in place.", "The phrase \"I can\u2019t breathe\" became a rallying cry among demonstrators protesting against police brutality after the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who died in New York after an officer put him in a chokehold. Garner could be heard on a bystander\u2019s video saying \"I can\u2019t breathe\" multiple times as he was dying.", "But there is no evidence that Trump was mimicking Garner when he used the phrase years later.", "Video being posted on social media shows Trump saying \"I can\u2019t breathe.\" The video is authentic, but it\u2019s being shared in June 2020 (months after the comments were made), and is being edited in a way that loses the context of Trump\u2019s remarks. Trump was mocking political rivals, not Eric Garner or George Floyd.", "We rate these posts False.", "Facebook posts, June 2020", "Factbase, Donald Trump rally in Rome, New York, April 12, 2016", "Factbase, President Donald Trump rally in Colorado Springs, Feb. 20, 2020", "Reuters, Fact check: Trump was mocking Bloomberg, not Floyd, in \"I can\u2019t breathe\" clip, June 3, 2020", "Factcheck.org, Video of Trump\u2019s \u2018Choke\u2019 Quote Refers to Political Rivals, June 8, 2020", "AP, Police officer in \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 death won\u2019t be charged, July 16, 2019", "Donald Trump, Tweet, Nov. 9, 2015", "PolitiFact, Bloomberg on the defensive, fact-checking the Las Vegas Democratic debate, Feb. 19, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
