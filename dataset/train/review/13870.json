Follow our post-election coverage here.", "One of the many election fraud claims made by President Donald Trump in a desperate attempt to deny the results of the election he lost to Democratic challenger Joe Biden in 2020 was that he (Trump) won the state of Michigan (which he actually lost to Biden by 150,000 votes) -- but voter fraud in the state was rampant, as supposedly evidenced by the city of Detroit's recording a number of voters greater than the number of eligible voters living in that city:", "\"This election was rigged,\" Trump told a group of Republican legislators from Pennsylvania by phone on [Nov 25]. \"This election has to be turned around.
