The article noted Wisconsin and Pennsylvania led the nation, but took the same one-year approach from August 2018 to August 2019.", "Using raw numbers, the two states did indeed have the biggest loss of manufacturing jobs from August 2018 to August 2019, according to a state employment survey released by the Labor Department. Wisconsin lost about 5,200 seasonally adjusted jobs, while Pennsylvania lost around 7,700.", "The Wisconsin State Journal reported in an Oct. 10, 2019, article that Wisconsin\u2019s manufacturing job loss was the largest year-over-year decline since the last recession.", "Case closed?", "Not exactly.", "First, on a percentage basis, other states had larger losses.", "Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Maryland all lost a larger share of manufacturing jobs from August 2018 to August 2019. (Though, we should note, those states combined have fewer manufacturing jobs than either Wisconsin or Pennsylvania.)", "More importantly, in arguing Trump is not fulfilling his promise as it relates to manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the DNC is using a narrow set of numbers -- a single year\u2019s worth. But the president has been in office for nearly three years.", "So, the DNC went cherry-picking and, not surprisingly, found a cherry.", "The longer-range jobs picture is more complex.", "Consider: The government\u2019s latest jobs report showed 2,000 manufacturing jobs were lost nationally in September 2019, compared to 18,000 jobs added in September 2018.", "Meanwhile, for all of 2018, there was an average increase of about 22,000 jobs per month. Through the first nine months of 2019, the increase has been about 5,000 jobs per month.", "In short, there\u2019s been an uptick of manufacturing jobs under Trump -- an increase of about 373,000 jobs -- despite the current slowdown.", "All told, Wisconsin has about 472,000 manufacturing jobs while Pennsylvania has about 562,000.", "From January 2017, when Trump took office, until August 2019, Wisconsin went from about 465,000 manufacturing jobs to 472,000 -- an increase of 1.5%.", "Pennsylvania had about 561,000 manufacturing jobs when Trump took office. As of August 2019, the state sat at slightly over 562,000 jobs, a 0.2% increase.", "So both states have actually seen an increases in these jobs, albeit modest ones.", "Michael Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University, said manufacturing jobs have been in decline over the Midwest for most of the past year due to the ongoing trade war with China.", "\"The trade war is both directly contributing to this by increasing the costs of production and by causing supply chain disruptions which reduce demand for exported goods,\" Hicks said.", "Hicks said that leads to factory job losses.", "Sometimes, where you end up depends on where you begin.", "Consider Barack Obama\u2019s tenure, when manufacturing jobs faced an ebb and flow largely due to the turbulent economy.", "When Obama took office in January 2009, the nation had 12.6 million manufacturing jobs. This was in the midst of the Great Recession, which led to a low point of 11.5 million manufacturing jobs -- a loss of some 900,000 -- roughly a year later, in February 2010.", "So, if you measured just that window, you\u2019d get a worse picture than if you looked at Obama\u2019s full term.", "But from February 2010 until Obama left office in January 2017, there was an increase of more than 900,000 manufacturing jobs, hitting a total of 12.4 million.", "It was an overall loss, as PolitiFact National has noted, of about 192,000 manufacturing jobs. But much smaller than if you pulled out a single year.", "The DNC claims Trump is breaking a campaign pledge to bring manufacturing jobs back to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania since the two states \"have lost the most manufacturing jobs in the past year.\"", "We found data from the Labor Department showing Wisconsin and Pennsylvania lost the most jobs over the last year compared to the rest of the country, at least in raw numbers.", "But they weren\u2019t the worst on a percentage basis. And the two states have seen a modest uptick in manufacturing jobs since Trump took office.
