Fighter jets and endorsements from veterans and firefighters symbolized Trump.", "\"Joe Biden endorsed by Osama bin Laden\" was the line about Biden.", "Here, we examine whether there\u2019s any truth to that.", "Here\u2019s the accurate part of that exchange. During the years bin Laden was holed up in his compound in Pakistan, he still sought to cripple American power in the Middle East.", "When American special operations forces raided bin Laden\u2019s compound in 2011, on Obama\u2019s orders, they found a trove of computer files.

This, too, is the antithesis of an endorsement by any standard.\"", "Through a political-science lens, bin Laden\u2019s words don\u2019t constitute an endorsement.", "\"To be persuasive, endorsements need to come from endorsers who are both knowledgeable and trustworthy,\" Hofstra University political scientist Craig Burnett said. \"I strongly suspect that, for most people, bin Laden fails on both counts.\"", "Trump Jr.\u2019s statement, reinforced by the campaign ad, makes the further stretch that bin Laden was somehow weighing in on the choice between Trump and Biden. Bin Laden has been dead for nine years. If creating a crisis in the U.S. was his goal, we can\u2019t know which candidate in 2020 he would prefer.", "Trump Jr. said bin Laden endorsed Biden.
