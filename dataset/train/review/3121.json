It is well-known that site selectors who decide where businesses expand or relocate shun closed shop states like Wisconsin in favor of Right to Work states like Iowa, Indiana and Michigan.\"", "Iowa\u2019s right to work law dates to 1947. Indiana and Michigan approved the change in 2012.", "One four-letter word caught our attention in Bauer\u2019s piece: \"shun.\"", "Is Wisconsin getting shut out of business expansion because it allows private employers to sign contracts with unions that require all covered employees to join the union?", "A closer look", "We started by asking Bauer about the term \"site selectors.\" Bauer told us it refers to CEOs and consulting firms who help companies search for new locations.", "He pointed to a 2012 survey of U.S. corporate executives regarding factors they consider when choosing sites for expansion or relocation. In that survey by Area Development magazine, 72 percent said it was important or very important that a state has passed \"right-to-work\" legislation.", "Bauer noted that in a November 2012 article in the magazine, one consultant estimated that three-fourths of his firm\u2019s clients want only locations that are in right-to-work states.", "That kind of anecdotal evidence was mentioned repeatedly by site-search consultants quoted in the magazine, as well as in another publication, Site Selection.", "Estimates vary on the strength of the preference.", "States will be eliminated at the first stage in \"about half\" of projects, one consultant told Site Selection. After Michigan passed right to work, another consultant told the publication that \"it will get Michigan a few more looks on site searches, mostly industrial ones. It\u2019s hard to know what percentage.\"", "Some consultants say manufacturing companies are more likely to steer clear of unions when compared to firms in other sectors. Wisconsin is a manufacturing-rich state.", "Area Development magazine framed the right to work debate this way: Businesses tend to support right-to-work because it makes unionization less likely and in turn often means lower labor costs. Unions oppose them because right to work weakens union membership and wages.", "\"In a right-to-work state, any worker choosing not to join the union or pay for the services still gets the benefits,\" the magazine noted. \"Unions often refer to those workers as \u2018free riders,\u2019 and because wages tend to be lower in right-to-work states, unions famously refer to the concept as \u2018right-to-work for less.\u2019", "While \"shun\" suggests Wisconsin simply loses out when businesses are deciding where to build, even a quick peek at the state jobs agency\u2019s website yields examples to the contrary.
