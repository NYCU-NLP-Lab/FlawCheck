["About this rating", "A graphic purportedly showing the messages penned by President Trump and President Obama during their respective visits to Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, appeared on social media in May 2017:", "It is a great honor to be here with all of my friends - so amazing + will never forget.", "Donald Trump", "I am grateful to Yad Vashem and all of those responsible for this remarkable institution. At a time of great peril and promise, war and strife, we are blessed to have such a powerful reminder of man's potential for great evil, but also our own capacity to rise up from tragedy and remake our world. Let our children come here, and know their history, so that they can add their voices to proclaim 'never again.' And may we remember those who perished, not only as victims, but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed like us, and who have become symbols of the human spirit.", "Barack Obama", "This image accurately shows what Trump and Obama wrote in the Yad Vashem guest book.", "President Trump visited Yad Vashem on 23 May 2017.

The Washington Post noted that Trump's tight schedule may have contributed to the brevity and oddly cheerful tone of his message:", "The brevity and tone of the note may have been a function of the hurry the president was in during his time at the site, known as Yad Vashem, which he visited Tuesday. Packing so much into just 27 hours in Israel left only half an hour for the memorial, a customary stop on U.S. presidential visits, which precluded him from getting a full tour of the museum. Trump already had come under fire for that perceived slight to the memorial before his one-sentence missive started raising eyebrows and making headlines.", "In 2008, George W.
