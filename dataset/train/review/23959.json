We learned that at the moment no such announcement had been made.", "In a video posted on the association website, Jim Richerson, president of PGA of America made the following statement:", "It\u2019s become clear that conducting the PGA Championship at Trump Bedminster, would be detrimental to the PGA of America brand, it would put at risk the PGA\u2019s ability to deliver our many programs and sustain the longevity of our mission. Our board has thus made the decision to exercise our right to terminate the contract to hold the 2022 PGA Championship at Trump Bedminster. It was a decision made to ensure that PGA of America and the PGA professionals can continue to lead and grow our great game for decades to come.", "A new venue has not been announced yet.

We\u2019re fiduciaries for our members, for the game, for our mission and for our brand. And how do we best protect that? Our feeling was given the tragic events of Wednesday that we could no longer hold it at Bedminster. The damage could have been irreparable. The only real course of action was to leave.\u201d", "The Trump Organization also released a statement in response to the decision:", "This is a breach of a binding contract and they have no right to terminate the agreement [...] As an organization we have invested many, many millions of dollars in the 2022 PGA Championship at Trump National Golf Club, Bedminster. We will continue to promote the game of golf on every level and remain focused on operating the finest golf courses anywhere in the world.", "This isn\u2019t, however, the first time the PGA of America has pulled an event from a Trump-owned venue.
