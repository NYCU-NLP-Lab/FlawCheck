SOMEONE WAS AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH A CAMERA. IT WAS REPORTED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS FURIOUS THAT HE WAS CAUGHT ON CAMERA AND IT WAS PUBLISHED AND TRIED TO BLOCK IT. The name of the book Obama is holding is called: The Post-American World, and it was written by a fellow Muslim.\u00a0 (Fareed Zakaria) \"Post\" America means: The World \"After\" America!

It is about the great transformation taking place around the world, a transformation that, though often discussed, remains poorly understood.\"", "A Publishers Weekly review of the book called it \"a stimulating, largely optimistic forecast of where the 21st century is heading,\" saying that Zakaria \"predicts that despite its record of recent blunders at home and abroad, America will stay strong, buoyed by a stellar educational system and the influx of young immigrants, who give the U.S. a more youthful demographic than Europe and much of Asia whose workers support an increasing population of unproductive elderly.\"", "The New York Times Sunday Book Review said the book is \"a relentlessly intelligent book that eschews simple-minded projections from crisis to collapse \u2026 Zakaria\u2019s is not another exercise in declinism.
