The coalition wants legislation passed that would require background checks on all gun sales. It claims more than 1,000 members across political party lines. Georgia mayors in the organization include Atlanta\u2019s Kasim Reed, Roswell\u2019s Jere Wood and Earnestine Pittman of East Point.", "The coalition has been pressuring senators such as Chambliss who\u2019ve either been on the fence or against gun bills it supports. Chambliss voted against a gun-control measure earlier this year. That amendment \u00a0would have allowed a vote on a measure to require nearly all gun buyers to undergo background checks.", "The coalition said it based its claim on data from the Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also noted that other organizations, such as the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, have touted similar numbers.", "In July, the Children\u2019s Defense Fund released a report that found 2,694 children and teens were killed by guns in 2010. That\u2019s an average of 7.4 deaths a day. Raymonde Charles, a spokeswoman for the CDF, said it began compiling such data on its own 20 years ago and noted it refers to this age group as \"children and teens\" to reflect that its data include 18- and 19-year-olds.", "Here\u2019s a chart the mayors coalition shared with PolitiFact:", "Year", "Gun homicides 0-20", "Gun deaths 0-20", "2006", "2,813", "4,064", "2007", "2,725", "3,871", "2008", "2,597", "3,777", "2009", "2,352", "3,539", "2010", "2,308", "3,459", "Average", "2,559", "3,742", "Per day", "7.0", "10.3", "We looked at the CDC site and did a search for how many people 18 and under were killed in homicides by guns in each of those years.

Some may not consider anyone older than 16 a child, since that\u2019s the age most states allow someone to get a driver\u2019s license or get married (with parental consent).
