This is what Democrats wanted...\"", "Stanton-King did not respond to an Instagram message seeking comment on her post.", "More:Fact check: What's true and what's false about coronavirus?", "The website Distributed News routinely publishes false information. A media bias site ranked Distributed News as \"tin foil hat\" on its conspiracy level scale.", "Distributed News does not have a way to contact its authors or the page in general, so\u00a0seeking comment for this article wasn't possible.", "The website's post incorrectly says that Dr. Luciana Borio, an infectious disease doctor who is part of Biden's task force, wants to bar people who refuse the vaccine from receiving food stamps and rent assistant.", "More:Fact check: Dr. Anthony Fauci did not say masks contributed to Spanish flu deaths", "\"A prominent member of Biden's Covid-19 taskforce, a CIA-linked operative named Luciana Borio, says that people who refuse to be vaccinated should be deprived of food stamps and rent assistance,\" Distributed News wrote.", "Although Borio is vice president of a nonprofit called\u00a0In-Q-Tel that equips the CIA and other intelligence agencies with the latest information technology, she isn't employed by\u00a0the CIA.", "Borio and 20 other members of a working group met in July to discuss the virus and authored a 47-page paper on the public's role in COVID-19 vaccination.\u00a0Monica Schoch-Spana and\u00a0Emily K. Brunson were the co-chairs for the group.", "The working group was not affiliated with Biden's campaign; it\u00a0was a collaboration between Texas State and Johns Hopkins universities.", "The paper doesn't mention withholding needed aid at all.", "It recommends public health agencies partnering with organizations already offering services to vulnerable populations, like\u00a0the WIC nutrition program, clinic services or free food programs.", "\"Bundling services (eg, food security, rent assistance, free clinic services) that are already being provided to particularly vulnerable populations in the context of COVID (eg, older adults, low-income adults, Black and minority communities) could be a way to build trust and streamline vaccine provision,\" the recommendation says.", "This approach is aligned with what some health agencies have done as they battle the pandemic.", "The Metro Nashville Health Department went to public housing complexes in late spring to offer coronavirus tests to residents.
