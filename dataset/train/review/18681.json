It could also deal a blow to the U.S. economy, said MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who argued on his primetime TV show that the policy has \"no upside.\"", "\"Higher education is one of America's strongest export sectors,\" Hayes said, while displaying a chart on U.S. education exports. \"Over 1 million international students studied at American universities, (in the) 2018-19 school year. They contributed over $40 billion to the economy.\"", "Hayes\u2019 statistics are accurate. In 2019, U.S. service exports from education totaled roughly $44 billion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That made education the sixth largest service export for the year, behind services such as personal travel and professional and management consulting, a spokesperson for the International Trade Administration said.", "Academic experts and representatives from nonprofits focused on international education also backed Hayes\u2019 claims.

Experts said higher education can be considered an export because international students pay their tuition and living expenses to colleges and universities using money from abroad.", "\"International students are buying an American education,\" Startz said. \"Hence it\u2019s an export.\"", "Exports from education amounted to roughly $44 billion in 2019, up from about $42.6 billion in 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That\u2019s more than the U.S. made from exporting many other goods and services in the same timeframe.", "Education ranked sixth among service exports in 2019, the International Trade Administration spokesperson told us. It was fifth in 2018.", "Those numbers make sense when you factor in the cost of college, said Judith Scott-Clayton, professor of economics and education at Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College.", "\"If there are 1.1 million international students in the country, and each of them spends about $40,000 on U.S. tuition and living expenses, that gets you to $44 billion,\" she said.", "In an email to PolitiFact, Hayes also cited the International Trade Administration and an article in the New York Times Magazine in which an Institute of International Education adviser was quoted saying \"higher education is one of America\u2019s biggest exports.\"", "But the article said U.S. schools were losing their international appeal for a number of reasons, including rising tuition costs and various policies enacted under President Donald Trump.", "Rachel Banks, NAFSA\u2019s senior director for public policy and legislative strategy, said in a statement that new international student enrollment is down over 10% since the fall of 2016, a trend NAFSA estimates has cost the U.S. economy $11.8 billion.", "\"That\u2019s before the impacts of a global pandemic and related travel restrictions, several presidential proclamations targeting immigrants and nonimmigrants, and this guidance,\" Banks said. \"Therefore, we don\u2019t anticipate this downward trajectory to reverse itself anytime soon.\"", "Hayes said, \"Higher education is one of America's strongest export sectors. Over 1 million international students studied at American universities, 2018-19 school year. They contributed over $40 billion to the economy.\"", "Government agencies, academic experts and nonprofit organizations said Hayes\u2019 statistics are correct.
