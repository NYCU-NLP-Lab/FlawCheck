["About this rating", "On 25 April 2015, the web site\u00a0The Studio Exec published an article reporting that the hobby of cosplay was to be outlatwed in five states (an article which for indeterminate reasons began circulating widely in January 2016):", "SAN DIEGO \u2014 The increasingly popular hobby of Cosplay \u2014 short for 'costume play' and involving adults gathering to wear costumes inspired by their favorite films and TV shows \u2014 has been made illegal in five states: Colorado, Ohio, Delaware, Kansas and New Mexico.", "Although the motivations given for the cosplay bans have been varied and include issues of public health and decency, the main argument seems to be that \u2014 in the words of New Mexico's governor Susana Martinez \u2014 'grown adults dressing up as Captain Jack Sparrow and Padme from the Phantom Menace is f**king retarded'.", "Cosplay enthusiasts have responded with anger. Mark Jerkins of the Cosplay Association of America commented:", "We are adults who enjoy dressing up in fancy dress-like costume and immersing ourselves in a fictional world, often with a kinky slant. And we demand respect.", "The tone of the article was something of\u00a0a giveaway to its satirical\u00a0nature, especially\u00a0the \"quote\" attributed to New Mexico's governor. Skeptical readers might also have noticed that\u00a0there is no \"Cosplay Association of America\" (nor, therefore a chairperson of such named \"Mark Jerkins\").", "Readers who scrolled to the bottom of the page could find a\u00a0(very\u00a0tiny)\u00a0\"About\" link in which the\u00a0Studio Exec explained their satirical nature:", "Established in 2012, the Studio Exec is a satirical movie based website, publishing spoof news, reviews and comedy masterpieces.", "Our work has been reported internationally and we have been directly responsible for three marital breakups, the sacking of fifteen copy editors and the devaluation of the word 'satire.'", "We do use profanity so if you\u2019re under 18 go away.", "If you wish to advertise with us or give us free money the email address is [address]\u00a0and\u00a0if you wish to contribute ideas, articles or give us free money the email address is [address]\u00a0but if you wish to sue us or otherwise try to hurt us then the email address is shialabeouf@gmail.com", "Although\u00a0the Studio Exec bears a profile lower than that of other known satirical sites (such as\u00a0The Onion for straight news,\u00a0Duffel Blog for military satire, and GOMER Blog for humorous takes on medicine), it focuses on poking fun at the entertainment industry at large rather than deliberately attempting to dupe its readers. The large interval between the piece's publication and its viral popularity further suggests that the item was intended to be an in-joke which eventually escaped its humorous context\u00a0through\u00a0social media.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
