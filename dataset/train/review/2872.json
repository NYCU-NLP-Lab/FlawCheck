["\u201cYour reminder that a president cannot spend taxpayer dollars by executive order,\u201d UC Berkeley professor and former US Secretary of Labor Robert Reich tweeted on August 8, 2020, the same day Trump signed a memorandum authorizing financial assistance.", "A screenshot of the tweet was shared on Reich\u2019s Facebook page the next day, August 9, with the caption \u201cThat\u2019s not how this works.\u201d", "The executive memorandum provides for an additional $300 per week in federal contributions to Americans' unemployment benefits. A second memorandum\u00a0orders a deferral in payroll taxes; while another extends\u00a0relief on student loan payments and interest. An executive order talked of measures to protect against evictions and foreclosures.", "Trump intervened after his Republican party and White House team failed to agree with opposition Democrats in Congress on a new stimulus package aimed at stopping vulnerable Americans from falling through the cracks of a pandemic-stricken economy.", "Republicans and Democrats alike criticized Trump\u2019s attempt to skirt legislation using presidential action.", "Political historian Matt Dallek, of George Washington University\u2019s Graduate School of Political Management, told AFP via email that \u201cvirtually all executive orders involve some form of federal spending,\u201d citing Barack Obama\u2019s executive order to close the prison at Guantanamo and George W Bush\u2019s order to limit federal spending on stem cell research -- later revoked by Obama -- as examples.", "\u201cTheir very actions involve the spending of federal funds, or, at least, the movement of funds from one activity to another. Presidents set regulatory and social justice priorities routinely by using executive orders to direct the federal agencies to focus on one activity rather than another, which involves the use of funds.\u201d", "What makes Trump\u2019s recent move different is that he is attempting to \u201cappropriate funds and change tax laws unilaterally\u2026 Only Congress has the power to appropriate funds, and the president can not change tax law with a stroke of the pen,\u201d Dallek said.", "Law professor Daniel Hemel of the University of Chicago weighed in: \u201cThe statement that the president does not have the power to spend money through executive order is in some sense true and in some sense false. There needs to be a congressional authorization and appropriation. But here, according to the Trump administration's not-implausible interpretation, there *is* congressional authorization and appropriation,\u201d he said in an email.", "John Hudak, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, also addressed the claim that US presidents cannot spend taxpayer money with executive orders.", "\u201cA blanket statement like that is incorrect,\u201d he told AFP over the phone.", "\u201cIt is not typically common that funds are spent at the direction of an executive order,\u201d but \u201cthere is not a blanket prohibition on that behavior.\u201d", "Many federal funds connected to disaster relief offer some executive discretion on how they can be used, so \u201cjust because the president has not used executive authority in a given way before does not mean that that is an improper use of executive authority,\u201d he said.", "Hudak agreed with Dallek that Trump\u2019s unusual exertion of power could result in legal problems.", "In particular, Hudak said deferring student loan interest \u201cseems like a pretty significant stretch in terms of what the law allows the president to do.\u201d The extension on unemployment insurance, however, to him seems constitutionally viable, he said.", "Whereas some aspects of government are explicitly spelled out, the constitutional framework for executive action is fuzzy, he explained. The power to issue executive orders is implied in the \u201cTake Care\u201d clause of the Constitution, which states: \u201che shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d", "The rules for executive actions are not \u201cclear or hardwired,\u201d Hudak said, and courts have both held up and struck down presidents\u2019 orders in the past.", "\u201cI think it depends on how the actions play out,\u201d he said.", "Faced with legislative hurdles, Trump has often turned to executive action, such as declaring an emergency on the southern border where he wanted to build a wall, or on policing standards following Black Lives Matter protests against racism and police brutality.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
