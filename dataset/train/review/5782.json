["About this rating", "A photograph purportedly showing the perfectly preserved right front forearm of a small Therapod dinosaur called a Troodon has been circulating online several years. Although the image\u00a0is real, it it is not a troodon claw. The photograph\u00a0was taken by Ryan Baumann and actually shows a preserved Moa foot\u00a0on display at the Natural History Museum of London:", "Getty Images has another image of the fossilized moa foot:", "The moa was a large flightless bird that went extinct about 600 years ago, shortly after humans arrived in New Zealand in the 13th century:", "For millions of years, nine species of large, flightless birds known as moas (Dinornithiformes) thrived in New Zealand. Then, about 600 years ago, they abruptly went extinct. Their die-off coincided with the arrival of the first humans on the islands in the late 13th century, and scientists have long wondered what role hunting by Homo sapiens played in the moas\u2019 decline. Did we alone drive the giant birds over the brink, or were they already on their way out thanks to disease and volcanic eruptions? Now, a new genetic study of moa fossils points to humankind as the sole perpetrator of the birds\u2019 extinction. The study adds to an ongoing debate about whether past peoples lived and hunted animals in a sustainable manner or were largely to blame for the extermination of numerous species.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
