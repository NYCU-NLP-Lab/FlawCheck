["About this rating", "In March 2021, a photograph started circulating on social media that supposedly showed an octopus with an abnormal number of tentacles:", "This is a genuine photograph of a 96-armed octopus and is on display at Shima Marineland in Japan.

It was brought to Shima Marineland but died a few months after arrival. Since then, this unusual specimen has been on display at the aquarium.", "In November 2020, after a nine-armed octopus was found by a fisherman in Japan, the Shima Marineland flexed its tentacle muscle and noted that it had a specimen that topped the recent discovery by more than 80 arms.", "Shima Marineland wrote on Twitter (translated via Google):", "The news is the nine-armed octopus found in Miyagi prefecture.
