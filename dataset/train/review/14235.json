His latest move was demanding that this Admiral not hand out Bibles, but this Admiral had other plans.", "He talks about the tight \"box\" Obama has put Americans in, in an attempt to restrict their expression of religious faith.", "The article referenced a Family Research Council video clip in which Coast Guard Rear Admiral William D. Lee was described as defiantly proclaiming that he would \"Share the Bible, no matter what\":", "This issue wasn't news, however, nor did it have anything to do with President Obama.  It was a resurrection of a three-year-old story about a controversy over \"aggressive\u00a0proselytizing\" in the military: actively campaigning to change the faith of another person or pushing religion upon a person who is not receptive to it (which is not permitted in the military) versus preaching to the faithful (which is). \u00a0In other words, simply discussing faith or offering up religious texts (such as the Bible) for someone's edification is permitted, but \"Leaders at all levels must avoid the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious beliefs to their subordinates or to [promote] preferential treatment for any religion.\u201d", "This edict against proselytizing was not put into place by President Obama or his administration.

Cmdr. Nate Christensen said in a statement. \"The Department makes reasonable accommodations for all religions and celebrates the religious diversity of our service members.\"", "\"Service members can share their faith (evangelize), but must not force unwanted, intrusive attempts to convert others of any faith or no faith to one's beliefs (proselytization),\" Christensen added.", "In short, distribution of Bibles (and other religious texts) had not been banned in the U.S. military.", "The American News claim was one of many published by the site that involved\u00a0outdated, inaccurate, or otherwise misleading information.\u00a0Prior items from that web site included claims that\u00a0Duck Dynasty's Sadie Robertson was gravely injured (in what turned out to by a minor car accident), that President Obama forged his birth certificate, and a separate (old)\u00a0birther claim sourced from a fake news site.", "Brooke Binkowski is a former editor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
