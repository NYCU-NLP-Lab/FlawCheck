Neither rumor is true.", "Police departments across that state have pleaded with residents to disregard the unfounded claims, and the FBI\u2019s office in Portland issued a statement explaining that agents had investigated several such reports \u201cand found them to be untrue.\u201d", "The FBI statement went on to warn, \u201cConspiracy theories and misinformation take valuable resources away [from] local fire and police agencies working around the clock to bring these fires under control. Please help our entire community by only sharing validated information from official sources.\u201d", "Despite that, some residents of Molalla \u2014 a city\u00a0under a\u00a0mandatory evacuation\u00a0order due to its proximity to the Riverside fire, which has burned more than 130,000 acres so far \u2014 refused to leave. \u201cThere\u2019s already reports that antifa\u2019s in town, going down the streets looting,\u201d one man reportedly said.", "But it\u2019s not true.", "The Molalla Police Department took to Facebook to address the \u201coverwhelming\u201d number of questions it had received regarding similar rumors.", "\u201cTo help ease the fears of everyone we are going to list some of those questions here and answer them,\u201d the department wrote on its Facebook page.

Romero Jr., who came in second in a four-way Republican primary race for the Senate in May, tweeted from his campaign account on Sept. 9: \u201cOregon is on fire!

THIS IS NOT TRUE!\u201d", "Romero didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment and the tweet is still posted.", "As for the claim regarding the Proud Boys\u2019 supposed role in the fires, the Medford Police Department acted quickly to stop the rumor. A phony graphic that was made to look like a post from the Medford Police had been circulating online. The department slapped a \u201cfalse\u201d stamp on the picture and explained: \u201cThis is a made up graphic and story. We did not arrest this person for arson, nor anyone affiliated with Antifa or \u2018Proud Boys\u2019 as we\u2019ve heard throughout the day. Also, no confirmed gatherings of Antifa which has also been reported.\u201d", "While the causes of the fires may vary, NASA explained in a recent post that the scale of the fires is due to \u201can unprecedented and historically rare windstorm that\u00a0 swept through the Cascade foothills in the afternoon of Monday Sep. 7 through the morning of Tuesday Sep. 8.\u201d", "Windstorms of that magnitude don\u2019t usually happen until winter, the NASA post said, explaining, \u201cIn addition to the heat, it is another example of the changing weather patterns that are being seen.\u201d", "Increasingly hot, dry conditions contribute to the spread of wildfires, but rumors \u2014 like the ones seen in Oregon \u2014 often overshadow that issue on social media.
