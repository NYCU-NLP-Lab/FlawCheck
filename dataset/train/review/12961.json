["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on April 7, 2020", "Online posts falsely claim that the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts donated $5 million to Democrats after it was allocated $25 million in the COVID-19 stimulus package. The center has not given any political contributions; it\u2019s prohibited by law.", "The stimulus package that passed with bipartisan support in March to ease COVID-19\u2019s crippling effect on the economy included $25 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.", "Shortly after that bill \u2014 the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \u2014 became law, rumors started circulating online that the Washington D.C.-based arts center had given a $5 million contribution to Democrats.", "One popular version of the rumor started on Twitter and later migrated to Facebook as a screenshot meme, framing the bogus claim this way:", "Like a lot of misinformation that gets traction online, this tweet surrounded the falsehood with facts.", "It\u2019s true that the Kennedy Center finished a $250 million expansion in 2019 and that it got $41 million in federal funding for fiscal year 2019. That was the center\u2019s annual\u00a0 appropriation for operations, maintenance and repairs, which it gets since it serves as a memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Most of the center\u2019s budget comes from its programming income and philanthropic donations, as well as some other sources, such as gift shop sales. Those brought in a combined $216 million in fiscal year 2019.", "It\u2019s also true, as we said, that the Kennedy Center has been allotted $25 million in the stimulus package. That money is \u201cto prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally,\u201d according to the law, which specifies \u201cdeep cleaning\u201d and \u201cinformation technology to improve telework capability\u201d as uses for the funds.", "President Donald Trump, who signed the act on March 27, defended the inclusion of the Kennedy Center in the stimulus package at a press briefing a few days before that, saying, \u201c[T]hey\u2019ve been essentially closed.\u00a0 They have tremendous deficits that are built up. I mean, this thing has been devastating to it.\u201d", "But the primary claim made in the tweet is not true. The Kennedy Center didn\u2019t give $5 million to the Democratic National Committee, nor is it true that it \u201claunders taxpayer money for the Democrats.\u201d", "The Kennedy Center is registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the Internal Revenue Service and, according to the IRS, those tax-exempt charitable organizations are barred from making political contributions.", "Just to be sure, we searched the Federal Election Commission database for political contributions and found no record for political spending of any kind from the Kennedy Center going back as far as online records are available, which is 1980.", "Employees of the center are, of course, eligible to make political donations. But any such individual contributions would come from their own money, not the center\u2019s funds.", "The writer of the original tweet, conservative content creator Cari Kelemen, later added a clarification that said: \u201c[M]y original tweet should have said: *Tomorrow* donates $5 M to the DNC. It was meant as a next-step hypothetical.\u201d", "But that hasn\u2019t stopped others from taking the original claim and repeating it in new posts.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
