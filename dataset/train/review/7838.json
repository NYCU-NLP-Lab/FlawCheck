David Perdue, R-Ga., speaks during a campaign rally on Nov. 13, 2020, in Cumming, Ga. (AP)", "Perdue argues that Ossoff holds positions so liberal that he is a socialist.", "Perdue is wrong about most of the positions that he says Ossoff holds.", "Even if Perdue\u2019s evidence were accurate, it doesn\u2019t square with what socialism is.", "In one of the two Georgia runoffs that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate, GOP incumbent David Perdue used the S word \u2014 socialism \u2014 to brand his opponent, Democrat Jon Ossoff.", "Perdue\u2019s attack came in an interview on a TV show hosted by Mike Huckabee, the Republican former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate.", "\"Philosophically, where do you and (Ossoff) differ significantly? What\u2019s the main difference between you?\" Huckabee asked.", "\"Well, it\u2019s very simple,\" Perdue replied. \"He\u2019s a socialist.\"", "Perdue has used the term repeatedly about Ossoff, although more often he refers to what he claims is the documentary filmmaker\u2019s support of a socialist agenda. President Donald Trump labeled Joe Biden a socialist \u2014 a claim we rated False, but one that some believe helped Trump win Florida in the Nov. 3 election.", "Much of the evidence Perdue cites about Ossoff\u2019s policy positions is inaccurate. And even if what he cited were correct, it doesn\u2019t amount to Ossoff being a socialist.", "Socialism has support among a significant number of Americans, particularly those who see it as promoting equality and more social services. A September 2020 Hill-HarrisX poll found that slightly more Democratic voters view socialism more favorably than capitalism.", "Strictly speaking, however, the most narrow definition of socialism refers to \"governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods.\"", "Ossoff has not stated support for such government control.", "When Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speak of socialism,\u00a0 they are referring to expanding the social programs already available, along with potentially higher tax rates to pay for them. But Ossoff opposes Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal.", "RELATED: PolitiFact fact-checks and articles about the Georgia runoffs", "Perdue\u2019s campaign said Ossoff\u2019s \"socialist agenda\" includes support for defunding the police, \"government-controlled health care,\" the Green New Deal and \"no borders.\"", "Leaving aside whether any of those positions amounts to socialism, Ossoff has said he opposes defunding the police; opposes Medicare for All and supports private insurance; opposes the Green New Deal; and opposes abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while supporting \"strong border security.\"", "Perdue\u2019s campaign also said Ossoff supports sanctuary cities, higher taxes and changing the makeup of the Senate to \"favor Democrats.\"", "None of those positions is socialism.", "Ossoff has said, \"I don't think it's the role of local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration law,\" but has not stated support for sanctuary cities. He \"supports lower taxes for all but the wealthiest Americans.\" Ossoff does support statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, which are seen as more likely to elect Democratic senators.", "Perdue\u2019s campaign also said Ossoff is a socialist because of support from Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez and \"California liberals.\" But Ossoff doesn\u2019t support Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All, under which a single, national health insurance program would cover everyone who lives in the United States; or Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, which is centered on climate change, but incorporates everything from racial justice to labor union policy.", "\"It\u2019s somewhat difficult to classify Ossoff ideologically, as he has never held elective office and has a relatively brief history in the public spotlight,\" said Zachary Peskowitz, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. \"With that caveat in mind, his campaign statements and debate performances are consistent with a middle-of-the-road Democrat.\"", "Jeffrey Lazarus, a political science professor at Georgia State University, also described Ossoff as mainstream.", "\"Forget for a moment the massive levels of misunderstanding that pervade discourse around the word socialism. Looking just at Ossoff\u2019s policy positions, they\u2019re pretty mainstream Democratic policy positions,\" Lazarus said. \"As far as I can tell, Ossoff isn\u2019t calling for any policy that is particularly left-wing.\"", "Perdue said Ossoff is a socialist. As evidence, Purdue said Ossoff supports policies that Ossoff actually does not support, such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Those policies don\u2019t constitute socialism.
