["Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid was arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or UAPA for his alleged role in Delhi riots. After 11 hours of questioning, Delhi Police\u2019s Special Cell charged the activist with \u201csedition and 18 other sections of the Indian Penal Code, including murder and attempt to murder,\u201d reported Scroll. A court in Delhi remanded him to 10 days of police custody. \u201cThere was nothing objectionable in his speeches,\u201d said Khalid\u2019s lawyer Trideep Pais. \u201cBeing opposed to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is not a crime.\u201d", "A day after his arrest, Times Now trended the hashtag #UmarLobbySecretTape on the daily show \u2018India Upfront\u2019 where the channel claimed, \u201cChat exposes \u2018radicals\u2019 allegedly linked to Umar Khalid.\u201d Anchor Rahul Shivshankar said that the \u201cactivist lobby\u201d admitted in a \u201cprivate chat\u201d that Khalid is aligned with a \u201cdangerous\u201d organisation. The group that he refers to is the Popular Front of India (PFI) which has been accused of allegedly inciting and funding the riots. Shivshankar accused Khalid of \u201cradicalising Muslims\u201d. The channel then played a video of a conference call on Zoom which it claimed was a \u201cleaked private chat\u201d between Left-wing activists.

I am sure you all must be very concerned about what is happening in Bangalore and the narrative that is being set due to the unfortunate incidents. But what we are missing is the Right-wing rise of the SDPI (Social Democratic Party of India) and the PFI\u2026Now we might have differences and we can debate on whether these organisations should be banned or not, but yes they should definitely be prosecuted for the radicalisation of youth\u2026Now Prashant Bhushan is a founder of Swaraj India and he was wrongly punished for contempt. But that doesn\u2019t mean that I talk about torching the Supreme Court. SDPI says if things are not happening [in your way], take matters in your own hands through violent measures\u2026SDPI and PFI need to be countered.\u201d SDPI is the political outfit of the PFI.", "Activist and journalist Teesta Setalvad responds to Nomani saying, \u201cI admire your honesty and integrity but I only want to add two points\u2026Whenever there is such a tendency developing among Muslims, we can\u2019t [counter it] with bitterness\u2026I will only say this much for now that SDPI and PFI remain problematic for people like us \u2013 Communalism Combats, CJP, Sabrang India \u2013 we have taken a public stand not to share a platform with them. People who consider themselves Left, should also stand against them.\u201d", "The rest of the conversation continues to address the dangers of the said organisations.", "\u201cViewers, if SDPI and PFI need to be countered then why defend someone who is allegedly linked to SDPI and PFI\u2026Today Umar Khalid is accused of collaborating with PFI to burn Delhi, that\u2019s what the police is saying and Swaraj India and every other activist from the Left is defending Umar Khalid. Can you believe this?\u201d \u2013 questioned Shivshankar.", "The chat that Times Now claims was accessed by the channel after it was \u201cleaked\u201d by intelligence agencies is nothing but a webinar held on August 16 by civil rights activists.
