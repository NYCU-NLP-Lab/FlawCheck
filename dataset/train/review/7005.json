She'll thrive at Yale.\"", "The piece concluded by stating:", "At first blush, Stanford's decision would seem to jeopardize its fund-raising. The thousands of rejected applicants included hundreds of children of alumni who'd donated lavishly over the years, their expectations obvious in the fact that they affixed their $50,000 checks to photographs of Emma playing an obscure woodwind in an Umbrian chamber orchestra or Scott donning the traditional dress of an indigenous people for whom he tailored a special social-media network while on spring break.", "In fact just 12 hours after the university's rejection of all comers, an alumnus stepped forward with a financial gift prodigious enough for Stanford to begin construction on its long-planned Center for Social Justice, a first-ever collaboration of Renzo Piano and Santiago Calatrava, who also designed the pedestrian bridge that will connect it to the student napping meadows.", "While many readers immediately picked up on the column's satirical nature, others didn't spot the joke despite the article's heavy-handed absurdity. \"College Admissions Shocker\" quickly appeared on the list of top Twitter trends:", "For anyone planning to apply to Stanford: be warned. https://t.co/iLHflaLAbj", "\u2014 Victoria Huggler (@HugglerVictoria) March 30, 2016", "Shocking college admissions decision out of Stanford: https://t.co/lGGgKbzTdR #sachat #EMchat #studentaffairs \u2014 Stacy OliverSikorski (@StacyLOliver) March 30, 2016", "WTF, seriously, @Stanford? via @nytimes https://t.co/qtJkiwf1HR pic.twitter.com/U8gfCQXvQV \u2014 Davide Soleil (@Rex_Soleil) March 30, 2016", "The Times did little to clarify\u00a0the ambiguity, tweeting from their verified Op-Ed account:", ".@FrankBruni on Stanford's acceptance rates reaching a new low https://t.co/ABb9PdrEwe \u2014 NYT Opinion (@nytopinion) March 30, 2016", "Frank Bruni: Elite schools mortified by acceptance rates still north of 6% attempt to out-do Stanford. https://t.co/veWktcb1pk \u2014 NYT Opinion (@nytopinion) March 30, 2016", "The piece\u00a0was also shared to their Facebook page\u00a0as though it were a\u00a0straightforward news story:", "Stanford's acceptance rates have reached a new low, writes Frank Bruni.", "Posted by The New York Times Opinion Section on\u00a0Wednesday, March 30, 2016", "Bruni didn't tweet anything directly about the nature of his column, but he did retweet a mention that referred to it as a \"lampoon\":", "At Penn we're just happy to be mentioned in @FrankBruni's elite college admissions lampoon.https://t.co/n6FnVgU15Y pic.twitter.com/t85qn9Z6hA", "\u2014 Ian Petrie (@icpetrie) March 30, 2016", "The column was contradicted by content published to Stanford University's own Facebook page on 25 March 2016 noting that they had accepted 2,063 students for the upcoming academic year:", "Congratulations to the 2,063 students \u2014 from 50 states and 76 countries \u2014 offered undergraduate admission to the Class of 2020.", "Posted by Stanford University on\u00a0Friday, March 25, 2016", "While social media users poked fun at those who didn't immediately get Frank Bruni's \"College Admissions Shocker!\" joke, the New York Times' presentation of the piece didn't\u00a0explicitly state it was satire. \u00a0Some readers might have believed the column to be on the level because the ins-and-outs of elite college admissions remain an arcane subject, the paper published it to social media channels without qualification (and using a standard Times-branded graphic), and both the column and the posts were dated 30 March 2016 (not 1 April, a date that people associate with tomfoolery).", "Bruni, Frank. \u00a0 \"College Admissions Shocker!\"\r\nNew York Times. \u00a0 30 March 2015.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
