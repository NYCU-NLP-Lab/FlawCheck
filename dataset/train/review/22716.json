But it took more than an hour to get formal approval for their deployment, and then nearly three more hours for the first guard reinforcements to arrive.", "The D.C. National Guard reports to the president.", "In a recorded video the following day, President Donald Trump claimed that he \u201cimmediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.\u201d But Trump\u2019s claim that he acted quickly is contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say the president initially resisted efforts to bring in the National Guard at the outset of the Capitol riot.", "The New York Times, citing unnamed Defense Department officials, said it was Vice President Mike Pence, not Trump, who approved deployment of the D.C. National Guard that afternoon. The Times also cited a \u201cperson with knowledge of the events\u201d who said Trump \u201cinitially rebuffed and resisted requests to mobilize the National Guard \u201cand that the \u201cmobilization was initiated with the help of Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, among other officials.\u201d", "CNN also reported that Trump \u201cinitially resisted\u201d deploying the guard, according to an unnamed \u201csource familiar\u201d with the decision to call in the National Guard. Neither report says how long Trump may have resisted the call \u2014 minutes, hours? \u2014 whether that led to any appreciable delay in activating the guard, or whether an earlier deployment could have averted the worst of the violence.", "Defense Department officials stress that Capitol Police did not request National Guard troops for the Capitol prior to the event \u2014 despite repeated offers from the military. The guard is \u201cnot designed to be an emergency response force,\u201d one defense official told the Wall Street Journal.", "So why weren\u2019t National Guard troops included in the plans leading up to the rally to guard the Capitol that day? Why did it take so long for the guard to arrive that afternoon? And what was Trump\u2019s role? The answers to those questions are likely to emerge as investigations about the response unfold.", "Here, we present a timeline about the efforts to deploy National Guard troops. We\u2019ll supplement this report as we learn more.", "Dec. 31: Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser and Dr. Christopher Rodriguez, the D.C. director of homeland security and emergency management agency, deliver a written request for D.C.

Maxine Waters has an hourlong phone conversation with Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund to express her \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about proposed security for the rally, given that several right-wing extremist groups were expected to be in attendance. Waters says Sund \u2014 who did not request National Guard backup prior to the day of the riot \u2014 assured her the Capitol plaza would be \u201cabsolutely secured\u201d and that rally attendees \u201cwould not be able to get inside or on top of the Capitol building.\u201d", "The Capitol Police has jurisdiction over the federal Capitol building and grounds, while the D.C. police force has jurisdiction over city streets and property.", "Jan. 3: The Department of Defense confirms with Capitol Police that there is no request for DoD support, according to the Pentagon.", "Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller meets with \u201cselect Cabinet Members to discuss DoD support to law enforcement agencies and potential requirements for DoD support,\u201d the Pentagon says.", "Miller and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, meet with Trump, according to the Department of Defense. Trump agrees to activate the D.C. National Guard to support D.C. police (not Capitol Police) with crowd and traffic control. The Pentagon later tells Pro Publica, \u201cThe President had no role in tactical matters as the capabilities deployed and location were dictated solely by the request from D.C. government.\u201d", "D.C.

Miller, in consultation with Milley, McCarthy and DoD general counsel, \u201creviews the Department\u2019s plan to be prepared to provide support to civil authorities, if asked, and approves activation of 340 members of the DCNG to support Mayor Bowser\u2019s request.\u201d The support is mostly for traffic control, crowd control at subway stations and logistics support. Miller also authorizes McCarthy to deploy a \u201cQuick Reaction Force\u201d of 40 National Guard members staged at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland \u201cif additional support is requested by civil authorities.\u201d", "Capitol Police Chief Sund asks the House and Senate sergeant-at-arms about the possibility of placing the D.C. National Guard on standby, in case the Capitol Police needed quick backup. In an interview with the Washington Post published on Jan. 10, Sund says they were hesitant to agree. According to the article, \u201cHouse Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving said he wasn\u2019t comfortable with the \u2018optics\u2019 of formally declaring an emergency ahead of the demonstration, Sund said. Meanwhile, Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger suggested that Sund should informally seek out his Guard contacts, asking them to \u2018lean forward\u2019 and be on alert in case Capitol Police needed their help.\u201d All three officials \u2014 Sund, Irving and Stenger \u2014 have since resigned.", "Update, Jan. 28: In\u00a0prepared testimony\u00a0for her Jan. 26 appearance before a closed session of the House Appropriations Committee \u2013 which\u00a0was\u00a0obtained by the New York Times \u2014\u00a0the\u00a0acting chief of the Capitol Police, Yogananda D. Pittman, confirmed that on Jan. 4 \u2013 two days before the riot \u2013 \u201cSund requested that the Capitol Police Board declare a state of emergency and authorize a request to secure National Guard support. The Board denied the request, but encouraged Chief Sund to contact the DC National Guard to determine how many Guardsman could be sent to the Capitol on short notice, which he did.\u201d The Capitol Police Board has three voting members: the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms and the architect of the Capitol. As we noted in our initial report, the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms have since resigned.", "Jan. 5: According to the Pentagon, Mayor Bowser delivers a letter addressed to the U.S. acting attorney general, Miller and McCarthy confirming that there are no additional support requests from the D.C. National Guard. Bowser later says that she already had the support she requested from the National Guard and that any decision to request guard forces to protect the Capitol is not hers. \u201cThe Capitol Police and the leadership at the Capitol, they did not make the decision to call in guard support,\u201d Bowser later says in a press conference on Jan. 7. \u201cI cannot order the Army, the National Guard, to the United States Capitol grounds. I can, in the district, with the approval of the secretary of the Army.\u201d", "According to an internal document reviewed by the Washington Post, an FBI office in Virginia issues a warning that extremists are preparing to commit violence in Washington on Jan. 6.

Gen. William J. Walker, the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, so that he could not deploy the quick reaction force without approval from higher-ups. In an interview published in the Washington Post on Jan. 26, Walker said those required authorizations contributed to delays in the National Guard response the following day. According to the Washington Post, Walker \u201cneeded to wait for approval from [former Army secretary Ryan] McCarthy and acting defense secretary Christopher C. Miller before dispatching troops, even though some 40 soldiers were on standby as a quick reaction force. That standby force had been assembled in case the few hundred Guard members deployed that day on the District\u2019s streets to assist police with traffic control and crowd management needed help, Walker said. \u2026 Had he not been restricted, Walker said he could have dispatched members of the D.C.
