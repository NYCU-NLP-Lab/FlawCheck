["About this rating", "The night of Jan. 16, 2018, was an odd one in Michigan. Not only did a meteor flash across the sky, causing a small earthquake, but a garage went up in flames, and over the border in Ohio, an oil refinery conducted a controlled burn \u2014 all at the same time. As images of these three events started to make their way around the Internet, conspiracy theorists concocted a bizarre explanation that tied them all together: the government (or possibly aliens, or maybe both) had unleashed a direct energy weapon on the world:", "The website\u00a0Before It's News\u00a0collected some of the most compelling images and summarized the theory:", "The Rod of God. A Directed Energy Weapon. Main stream presstituts will have you believe this was a meteor, a meteor that fell at a perfect 90* angle. SMH.. This just happened a few hours ago in Taylor, Michigan. 01/16/18. This energy blast was seen and heard in 4 US states and Canada.", "The United States Geological Survey reports a 2.0 magnitude earthquake at 8:09 p.m. January 16, 2018 \u2013 exactly the same time a meteor flashed through the sky in Michigan.", "The earthquake was a very weak earthquake having what is called a \"local magnitude\" (Ml) of 2.0. This USGS map shows a \"meteorite\" notation for the quake. A 2.0 magnitude earthquake would not be felt by humans.", "This is confusing because all the Meteor videos I can find for this day on YouTube show something else entirely than these photographs. The videos show like a regular ole meteor going thru the air. But these pictures show a percise ray of energy beamed down lighting the ground on fire. Could this be the same tech causing the wildfires all over the USA aka California etc? I don't know. That is why I am sharing this for discussion.", "A meteor really was visible over Michigan on Jan. 16, 2018. This was confirmed by the United States Geologic Society, NASA, the National Weather Service, astronomy experts, and a number of eyewitness videos:", "It's also true that the videos of the meteor passing over Michigan do not resemble the photographs that appeared to show a ray of light. But that's because those photographs don't actually show the meteor.", "The center photograph in the collage above was most likely taken near a garage fire in the city of Taylor, Michigan. As news of the fire spread, so did rumors that the blaze was caused by a meteor crashing into the garage. Michigan news outlet\u00a0MLive\u00a0published a story about the phenomena, informing worried readers that the blaze was not actually started by a meteor crashing into it:", "A fire that destroyed a pickup truck inside a garage in the metro Detroit community of Taylor was not started by a piece of falling meteor fragment.", "Fire crews were called to a garage fire at about 8:24 p.m., Jan. 16, on Merrick Road after the homeowner noticed smoke coming from the engine compartment of a pickup he was working on inside the garage, according to the Taylor Fire Department.", "Images showing a bright streak of light soaring up into the sky likely show an oil refinery in Ohio conducting a controlled burn which caused\u00a0\"light pillars\"\u00a0(a visual effect that can occur in very cold winter weather) to appear in the sky. A number of people\u00a0captured images of this refinery fire and the resulting light pillars:", "Local news outlets such as Click On Detroit, Cleveland 19, and Fox 2 Detroit all published articles in January 2018 about these light pillars' forming:", "They look like lights from an alien spaceship, but they are actually light pillars,\u00a0a spectacular sight most commonly seen during the colder winter months.", "The phenomenon's name describes narrow rods that appear to extend from the sky to the ground.", "Although the images do show something that resembles alien weapons used in movies such as\u00a0Independence Day,\u00a0these particular photographs do not document the deployment of such a device. Rather, the light pillars just happened to appear around the same time that a meteor was spotted streaking across the sky in Michigan, creating the perfect conditions for conspiracy theorists to spread rumors about otherworldly weaponry.", "See also: Were 2023 Maui Fires Caused by a 'Direct Energy Weapon'?", "Nace, Trevor. \u00a0 \"Rare Display of Light Pillars Dazzle Across North America.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Forbes. \u00a0 17 January 2018.", "Domeck, Ann. \u00a0 \"Canton Marathon Oil Refinery Conducts Controlled Burn.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 WJW-TV. \u00a0 16 January 2018.", "Atmospheric Optics. \u00a0 \"Light Pillars.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 18 January 2018.", "Haddad, Ken. \u00a0 \"Garage Fire in Taylor Unrelated to Possible Meteor Spotted Over Michigan.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Click on Detroit. \u00a0 16 January 2018.", "Clark, Nathan. \u00a0 \"Meteor Did Not Hit a Garage in Taylor and Catch It on Fire, Officials Say.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 MLive. \u00a0 17 January 2018.", "Allen, Robert. \u00a0 \"Michigan Meteor: Here's Everything We Know.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Detroit Free Press. \u00a0 17 January 2018.", "Ramirez, Charles. \u00a0 \"Hunt on for Spec of Space Rock That Shook Michigan.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Detroit News. \u00a0 16 January 2018.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
