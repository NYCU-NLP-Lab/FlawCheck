["By D'Angelo Gore and Robert Farley", "Posted on July 14, 2017", "President Donald Trump emphasized that an attorney who met with his eldest son during the 2016 presidential campaign was a \u201cRussian lawyer\u201d and \u201cnot a [Russian] government lawyer.\u201d That may be true, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Donald Trump Jr. agreed to sit down with a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d as \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump,\u201d according to an email exchange setting up the\u00a0meeting.", "Trump defended his son during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron on July 13 in Paris. The U.S. president was responding to a reporter who asked if Trump Jr. \u2014 who met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016 under the promise of getting damaging information about Hillary Clinton \u2014 should have told the FBI about a Russian attempt to provide the Trump campaign with information rather than accepting the meeting.", "\u201cAs far as my son is concerned, my son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer,\u201d Trump said.", "His point may be technically correct, but it\u2019s misleading.", "Veselnitskaya is the founder and managing partner of Kamerton Consulting, which specializes in corporate and property law, according to U.S. court documents filed in January 2016. After graduating from the Moscow State Legal Academy in 1998, she worked for the Moscow regional prosecutor\u2019s office for three years. And in 2003, she started her private legal consulting firm in the Moscow Oblast, a region outside of the Russian capital.", "But the New York Times, which first reported that Veselnitskaya met with the junior Trump, identified her as \u201ca Russian lawyer who has connections to the Kremlin\u201d whose \u201cclients include state-owned businesses and a senior government official\u2019s son, whose company was under investigation in the United States at the time of the meeting.\u201d Other news outlets have said that she \u201chad ties to Russian government,\u201d as well.", "Veselnitskaya has \u201ca history of pushing the Kremlin\u2019s agenda,\u201d the Times said, including lobbying against the Magnitsky Act, \u201cwhich provoked a Cold War-style, tit-for-tat row with the Kremlin when President Barack Obama signed it into law in 2012.\u201d It was named for Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in prison after uncovering evidence of corruption in the Russian government. The law, which denies entrance to the U.S. to Russian human rights abusers, prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt American adoption of Russian children.", "Veselnitskaya was also \u201cdeeply involved in the making of an anti-Magnitsky film that premiered just weeks before the Trump Tower meeting,\u201d the Times said. \u201cThe film echoes the Kremlin line that the widely accepted version of Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s life and death is wrong. The film claims that he was not assaulted and alleges that he never testified that government officials conspired to steal $230 million in fraudulent tax rebates.\u201d", "In addition, the Times reported that Veselnitskaya \u201chired a team of political and legal operatives that has worked unsuccessfully in Washington to repeal the Magnitsky Act.\u201d That team included \u201cRinat Akhmetshin, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 to the United States who once served as a Soviet military officer and who has been called a Russian political gun for hire.\u201d", "According to multiple reports on July 14, Akhmetshin, a Russian American lobbyist, confirmed that he also attended the June 2016 meeting with Trump Jr. at Veselnitskaya\u2019s request.\u00a0Paul Manafort, then-Trump campaign chairman, and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and now senior adviser, also were at the meeting. (And CNN reported on July 14: \u201cA source familiar with the circumstances told CNN there were at least two other people in the room as well, a translator and a representative of the Russian family who had asked [music publicist Rob] Goldstone to set up the meeting.\u201d)", "Akhmetshin told the Washington Post that he was not affiliated with the Kremlin, which has denied knowing both Akhmetshin and Veselnitskaya.", "\u201cI never worked for the Russian government. I served as a soldier, for two years, like tens of millions of Russian young men who were drafted. I am proud of my military service. At no time have I ever worked for Russian government or any of its agencies. I was not an intelligence officer,\u201d Akhmetshin said, according to the Post.", "For her part, Veselnitskaya also has denied working for the Russian government. \u201cI\u2019m just an ordinary person. A regional prosecutor is not the Kremlin,\u201d she said in her own July 11 interview with the Washington Post. \u201cI did not have an assignment from the Kremlin, there were no orders from the government.\u201d", "Akhmetshin, according to the Associated Press, said that Veselnitskaya had brought with her to the meeting a file with papers that she believed to show an illegal transfer of money to the Democratic National Committee. \u201cVeselnitskaya presented the contents of the documents to the Trump associates and suggested that making the information public could help the Trump campaign, he said,\u201d the AP reported.", "But Veselnitskaya told NBC News on July 11 that she \u201cnever had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that.\u201d She said she came to the meeting to discuss the Magnitsky Act.", "Still, emails released by Donald Trump Jr. show that he was expecting to talk with a representative of the Russian government who was going to provide dirt on his father\u2019s Democratic opponent in the presidential race.", "A June 3, 2016, email from music publicist Rob Goldstone said that Russian pop star Emin Agalarov had asked Goldstone to contact Trump Jr. on behalf of his father,\u00a0Aras Agalarov, a Russian real estate developer who has ties to Donald Trump Sr., including his 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. \u201cThe Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,\u201d Goldstone wrote. \u201cThis is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump \u2014\u00a0helped along by Aras and Emin.\u201d", "Trump Jr. responded minutes later, saying that \u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d", "Four days later, Goldstone\u00a0emailed again to \u201cschedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.\u201d About an hour went by before Trump Jr. responded, saying, \u201cHow about 3 at our offices? Thanks rob appreciate you helping set it up.\u201d", "Two days after that, on June 9, Trump Jr., Manafort and Kushner met with Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York.", "\u201cThe meeting lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes,\u201d\u00a0according to a statement Trump Jr. released to the media on July 9. He said it \u201cquickly became clear that she had no meaningful information\u201d about Clinton, and that \u201cdiscussing the adoption of Russian children and \u2026 the Magnitsky Act \u2026 was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.\u201d", "President Trump said that his son \u201ctook a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer.\u201d Veselnitskaya may not have been working on behalf of the Kremlin, but Trump Jr. didn\u2019t know that when he agreed to meet with her. The emails he released clearly show that he was fully expecting to discuss \u201cinformation that would incriminate\u201d Clinton with a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d as \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support\u201d for his father.", "During the joint press conference in France on July 13, Trump also said that Veselnitskaya\u2019s visa was approved by former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, adding \u201cmaybe that\u2019s wrong\u201d but then saying \u201cshe was here because of Lynch.\u201d", "It turns out that is wrong. Press reports at the time of the press conference indicated the Department of Justice approved entry. It\u2019s true that Veselnitskaya was granted short-term \u201cparole\u201d status by the Department of Homeland Security in 2015 and early 2016 to come to the U.S. to provide legal services to a Russian firm that faced civil charges of money laundering and fraud.", "But as BuzzFeed subsequently reported, when Veselnitskaya came to the U.S. in June 2016, it was under a standard visitor\u2019s visa issued by the State Department, according to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security. BuzzFeed noted that a week after that meeting, Veselnitskaya \u201ctraveled to Washington, DC, to push members of Congress into repealing the Magnitsky Act.\u201d", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
