["For several years, a viral passage comparing gun\u00a0and abortion regulations has circulated on social media with credit to\u00a0feminist icon Gloria Steinem. While Steinem may have agreed with the post\u2019s criticism of legislative red tape surrounding abortion, the attribution to the activist is incorrect.", "\u201cHow about we treat every young man who wants to buy a gun like every women who wants to get an abortion \u2014\u00a0mandatory 48-hour waiting period, parental permission, a note from his doctor proving he understands what he\u2019s about to do, a video he has to watch about the effects of gun violence,\u201d a July 29, 2019, Facebook post quotes Steinem.", "\u201cLet\u2019s close down all but one gun shop in every state and make him travel hundreds of miles, take time off work, and stay overnight in a strange town to get a gun,\u201d the post continues. \u201cMake him walk through a gauntlet of people holding photos of loved ones who were shot to death, people who call him a murderer and beg him not to buy a gun.\u201d", "More:Fact check: Conspiracy theory about military control of Washington is false", "The nearly 2-year-old post received an abundance of online attention in early February, furthering the\u00a0old misconception.", "Versions of this post have been circulating\u00a0with Steinem\u2019s name attached since October 2017, when a gunman opened fire at a Las Vegas music festival, marking the deadliest mass shooting in recent American history.", "Steinem did not author this post, although she has said she agreed with it.", "The Facebook user who posted the quote did not respond to USA TODAY\u2019s request for comment.", "More:Fact check: Fake quote about right to bear arms attributed to George Washington", "Steinem posted a version of the piece\u00a0to\u00a0Facebook on Dec. 8, 2015, as part of her \u201cTop Ten Things I want for Christmas\u201d list.

Think about it: a mandatory 48-hours waiting period, written permission from a parent or a judge, a note from a doctor proving that he understands what he is about to do, time spent watching a video on individual and mass murders, traveling hundreds of miles at his own expense to the nearest gun shop, and walking through protestors holding photos of loved ones killed by guns, protestor who call him a murderer,\u201d read Steinem\u2019s post. \u201cAfter all, it makes more sense to do this for young men seeking guns than for young women seeking an abortion.\u00a0No young woman needing reproductive freedom has ever murdered a roomful of strangers.\u201d", "More:Fact check: Decades-old quote misattributed to Rep.
