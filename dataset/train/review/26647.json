(In the resulting Republican uproar, she gave up her bid to be the next secretary of state.)", "Early drafts of the CIA talking points made references to terrorist groups, saying \"we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qaida participated in the attack.\" But in 12 rounds of edits of the talking points, that reference disappeared.", "Instead, Rice told CBS\u2019 Face the Nation on Sept. 16, 2012:", "\"I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence. Whether they were al-Qaida affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al-Qaida itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine.\"", "Republicans argued this was evidence the White House interfered, attempting to downplay a terrorist attack before the election.", "The White House said the gap between early and late versions of the talking points could be chalked up entirely to the best assessment of the \"intelligence community\" \u2014 in other words, political concerns of the State Department or White House had nothing to do with it.", "White House press secretary Jay Carney went so far as to claim in November that the \"single adjustment\" by the White House and State Department was to change the word \"consulate\" to \"diplomatic facility.\"", "Republican Sens.

ABC News, for example, used a direct quote from a White House adviser that differed from the actual email text.", "The difference mattered: In the early reports, it looked like the White House was piping up in support of the State Department, which better served Republicans\u2019 arguments that the White House was involved in a political coverup.
