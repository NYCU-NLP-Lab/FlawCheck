We then placed the zoomed-out satellite images, which were shown in the Zee News broadcast in a side-by-side comparison below.", "In the collage above, the image on the left was taken from Google Maps whereas on the right one was taken from Zoom Earth.

We were able to confirm this by the dated imagery available on Google Earth application.", "In order to figure out how old the images are, we juxtaposed pictures of buildings near the site that Zee News alleged as the bombsite to see the changes that the buildings have gone through over the years. The image shown below is the latest satellite image of the area around the site of interest and has been taken from Google Earth and is dated April 25, 2018.", "This is the Zoom Earth satellite image of the same site, which doesn\u2019t have a specified date.

The first image, from the left, with a plain rooftop, is dated April 27, 2014. Moving on to the year 2016, we could see an imprinted Pakistani flag and text, \u201cGHS-JABA\u201d, on the rooftop. Similarly, the latest image available on April 25, 2018, also has the imprinted flag and text as it is. These three images have been juxtaposed and posted below for comparison.", "However, the image that Zee News broadcasted and claims to be taken after the recent air strike has a plain rooftop sans the imprinted flag and text. The fact that the image has a plain rooftop in the above satellite image from Zoom Earth, suggests that it belongs to a period (2013-2014) when the alleged site was under construction.", "Paul Neave, who created the Zoom Earth application, also put out a series of tweets where he reiterated that images available on the website are several years old.", "The second image is from https://t.co/N7X3j7NHVr (which I created) and it uses Bing Maps for high resolutions, not daily imagery.
