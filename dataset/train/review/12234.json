People often know the name of a disease, such as measles, but not the name of the virus that causes it (rubeola).\"", "During the pandemic of 2020, most everyone was familiar with the name of the coronavirus disease that was sweeping across multiple countries (COVID-19), but less so with the name of the virus that caused it (SARS-CoV-2). In either case, many people weren't aware of the derivations of those names, leading some to take japes like the following seriously:", "The claim in the above meme is false. The true origins of the names of the coronavirus behind the 2020 pandemic and the disease stemming from it are rather straightforward, however.", "The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) announced \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\u201d as the name of the newly discovered virus on Feb. 11, 2020.

While related, the two viruses are different.\"", "On the same day, the WHO announced \u201cCOVID-19\u201d as the name of the new disease caused by that virus. The first part of that name is a shortening of the phrase \"coronavirus disease,\" and the latter part reflects that the disease was first reported in the year 2019.", "Although the strange new pneumonia of unknown cause first appeared in a cluster in Wuhan, China, nothing about the name of that illness or the virus that causes it reflects a geographical origin. The notion that the name COVID-19 stands for \"Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease\" and reflects that it is caused by the \"19th virus to come out of China\" is nothing more than a bad joke.", "World Health Organization. \u00a0 \"Naming the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and the Virus That Causes It.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 26 March 2020.", "Vergnaud, Sophie. \u00a0 \"What Does COVID-19 Stand For?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 GoodRx. \u00a0 17 March 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
