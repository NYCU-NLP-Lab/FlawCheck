However...", "Screenshots of vessel tracking images show regular traffic around the Cape, not an increase attributable to the blockage.", "On March 23, 2021, one of the world's largest shipping vessels got stuck in the Suez Canal, a critical maritime artery that handles about 12% of global trade annually. Five days later, at the time of this reporting, the blockage remains \u2014 and it is forcing shipping companies to consider the cost versus benefit of either waiting an indeterminate amount of time for the canal to reopen or rerouting their operation around Africa\u2019s Cape of Good Hope.", "The southern route adds about 10 to 15 days to a vessel's journey, increases its risk of piracy, and brings it to an area historically referred to, due to turbulent seas, as \"The Graveyard of Ships.\" While many boats, about 300 on both sides of the canal at the time of this reporting, are waiting it out, shipping companies have diverted some vessels to take the old-fashioned way around Africa.", "On March 26, for example, the shipping behemoth MSC announced it was rerouting 11 container ships around the Cape.

For all its historical lore, the southern route around Africa is still widely used for shipping. The map below, for example, shows the relative density of maritime traffic, by route, for the year 2019.
