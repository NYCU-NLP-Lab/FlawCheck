["About this rating", "A photograph of a seemingly surreal cottage in Poland is frequently circulated on social media:", "While this cottage may resemble something out of J.R.R. Tolkien's Shire, this is a genuine building that was built by architect Sebastian Piton in the Polish village of Bukowina Tatrzanska.", "Piton talked about his unique architectural style in an interview with Fachowy Dekarz & Cie\u015bla, a bi-monthly roofing publication out of Poland. Here's an excerpt from that interview (translated via Google):", "I was inspired by the works of the Catalan architect Antoni Guadi. I admire its soft lines of roofs, balconies, fairy-tale chimneys. I believe architecture was at its peak while it was operating. Currently, mainly buildings are erected to be useful. They lack harmony, beauty or imagination. The entire development of architecture, which lasted several thousand years, was negated and abandoned. And people want beautiful architecture. This is evidenced by the fact that they visit the old parts of the city, not modern office buildings.", "Fachowy Dekarz & Cie\u015bla shared another picture of this house to its Instagram page:", "Additional photographs of this whimsical cottage can be viewed on Piton's website. The Polish architect has also shared a few videos showing the construction of these fairy tale cottages.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
