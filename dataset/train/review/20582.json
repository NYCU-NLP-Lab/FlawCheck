["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "A fake story purporting to be from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s website got thousands of workers at the state\u2019s Department of Corrections buzzing.\n\nAnd then re-buzzing.\n\nSome 10,000 employees of the state agency that oversees prisons received an email on Sept. 6, 2011, that included a \"story\" with the byline of Jason Stein, a reporter in the newspaper\u2019s Madison Bureau. It looked like a JSOnline story, down to the same font and similar layout.\n\nThe headline: \"Dept. of Corrections considering yearly physical fitness testing.\"\n\nThe item went on to say the department was considering new testing for \"security staff\" beyond what\u2019s administered when they are hired. It even included a fake quotes from the department\u2019s actual spokeswoman, Linda Eggert.\n\nAll of this would no doubt come as a surprise for state employees.\n\nMany are already anxious about their jobs in the wake of a new state law pushed by Gov. Scott Walker greatly limiting collective bargaining for most public workers. And there are fitness tests at the time someone is hired. An applicant must clear a number of hurdles -- including a fitness test that consists of push-ups, sit-ups and a run. The standards vary depending on the age and gender of the applicant.\n\nSo, an authentic-looking story could well get them wondering: Are regular push-up tests coming for prison guards already on the job?\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem.\n\nThe story wasn\u2019t published by JSOnline.com and the Corrections Department says the claims in it aren\u2019t true. It\u2019s another email hoax.\n\nBecause so many people receive chain emails, PolitiFact checks them out.\n\nPolitiFact\u2019s national site has evaluated 100 chain emails. Of the claims, 28 were rated False and 51 were rated Pants on Fire. Some of them are items such as one claiming the federal government is going to make you get rid of your light bulbs next year (Pants on Fire). Or that members of Congress and their families are exempt from repaying student loans (likewise).\n\nAt PolitiFact Wisconsin, we looked at a chain email that -- also using a fake JSOnline story -- said Walker had hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system to help balance the state budget. That email wound up, briefly, on a teachers union website in Little Chute before the hoax was revealed.\n\nWe rated it Pants on Fire. Anyone sensing a trend?\n\nAs for the new email, the agency first heard about it the morning of Sept. 6, 2011, when an employee from the Prairie du Chien prison contacted administrators in Madison, said Department of Corrections spokesman Tim Le Monds.\n\nThat afternoon, the agency sent an email to all employees trying to set the record straight.\n\n\"Enclosed is a \u2018report\u2019 that some of you may have received or seen. I want you to know that this report is false and has no merit or truth to it whatsoever,\" wrote corrections secretary Gary Hamblin. \"No one from the Secretary\u2019s Office had a discussion about this topic with any reporter nor is the issue of physical fitness testing being considered.\"\n\nHamblin tried to close the door on this issue. But the fake story was pasted into his email which suggested it had actually been published.\n\nOn Sept. 7, 2011, the secretary\u2019s office tried again.\n\n\"To further clarify, neither the Journal Sentinel nor any of its reporter/s was involved in any way in the creation of the \u2018report\u2019 enclosed in the message,\" wrote Eggert.\n\nThe department does not know where the fake email originated and there are no plans to track down the source of the email. \"It\u2019s a waste of time,\" Le Monds said.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nA fake JSOnline.com was emailed around the Department of Corrections saying that prison guards could face fitness testing. The story was never published. And the department says there are no plans for such tests.
