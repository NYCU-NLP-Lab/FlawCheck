Trump beat Hillary Clinton in a similarly close battle for the state four years ago, and Biden\u2019s win will undoubtedly shape the outcome of the national race.", "But an influx of absentee ballots cast in Wisconsin because of the coronavirus pandemic meant results took longer than usual to come in \u2014 allowing rumors and false information to fill in the gaps.", "\"Wisconsin took a break, and when they returned, Biden coincidentally came back ahead by 100k,\" stated a tweet posted early on Nov. 4, 2020.", "The tweet was cited in a viral Facebook post that claimed several key states with Democratic governors took a break from counting votes on election night.", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Other municipalities in the state count absentee ballots at the precinct level, so they are tallied along with in-person votes.", "The late boost for Biden from Milwaukee was expected, especially because mail-in ballots tend to skew toward Democrats and Milwaukee is a Democratic stronghold.", "After Milwaukee reported those returns, Biden jumped ahead of Trump by about 8,000 votes. His lead widened to around 20,000 after Green Bay reported in-person and absentee results and Kenosha finished its tally.", "So, two things: Biden was never up by 100,000 votes, and he will certainly not win Wisconsin by that much.
