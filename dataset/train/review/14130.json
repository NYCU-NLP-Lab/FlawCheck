Gwen Moore, D-Wis., and 119 other members of Congress signed a letter calling on House leaders to hold a vote on re-authorizing the Violence Against Women Act.", "Moore was among the lead writers of the letter, which declared that since the federal law was adopted in 1994, \"cases of domestic violence have fallen by 67 percent.\"", "Nearly two decades have passed, but a two-thirds drop is sizable.", "Is Moore correct on the number?
