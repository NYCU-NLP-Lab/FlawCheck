["By Robert Farley", "Posted on April 11, 2019", "Asked whether he believes federal law requires him to give Congress his tax returns, President Donald Trump responded, \u201cThere\u2019s no law whatsoever.\u201d He\u2019s wrong about that.", "There is, in fact, a federal tax law that specifically states if the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee makes a written request for an individual\u2019s tax returns \u2014 as Rep. Richard Neal has done seeking Trump\u2019s \u2014 the Treasury secretary \u201cshall furnish\u201d those returns. The law says those returns would be reviewed confidentially in an executive session.", "Some Republicans have argued that Neal needs to demonstrate a legitimate legislative purpose in order to review the president\u2019s returns, and there is disagreement about whether he has. That is a debate that seems likely to end up in federal court.", "That legal dispute led a reporter to ask\u00a0Trump on April 10, \u201cDo you believe federal law requires you to give Congress your tax returns?\u201d", "Trump responded, \u201cNo, there is no law. As you know, I got elected last time with this same issue. And while I\u2019m under audit, I won\u2019t do it. If I\u2019m not under audit, I would do it. I had no problem with it. But while I\u2019m under audit, I would not give my taxes. There\u2019s no law whatsoever.\u201d", "As we have written, there is no law that compels presidential candidates or presidents to publicly release their tax returns, though it has been a custom for them to do so for more than 30 years. Trump was the first major party presidential nominee not to release any tax returns, dating back to 1976, when President Gerald Ford released a summary of his tax returns, rather than the complete returns. Every major party nominee since then has released complete tax returns.", "But the reporter\u2019s question wasn\u2019t whether Trump was legally obligated to release his tax returns publicly, it was whether federal law required they be turned over to Congress.", "According to Joseph J. Thorndike, a historian at Tax Analysts, \u201cDespite what the president said, there is a law.\u201d", "In his April 3 letter to the IRS commissioner requesting Trump\u2019s returns for the tax years 2013 through 2018, Neal cited the authority granted to him through an arcane provision in the IRS Code section 6103(f).", "IRS law generally requires that tax returns be kept confidential. But the section cited by Neal states, \u201cUpon written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the chairman of the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or the chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Secretary shall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request, except that any return or return information which can be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer shall be furnished to such committee only when sitting in closed executive session unless such taxpayer otherwise consents in writing to such disclosure.\u201d", "\u201cThere is a law directly on point,\u201d Edward Kleinbard, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law and chief of staff for Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation from 2007 to 2009, told us via email.", "Some legal scholars, including Kleinbard, believe that Neal needs to demonstrate a legitimate legislative purpose for requesting the president\u2019s returns. In his letter, Neal notes that the Ways and Means Committee is tasked with ensuring the IRS \u201cis enforcing the laws in a fair and impartial manner.\u201d Neal explains that he has requested the president\u2019s returns to make sure the IRS is doing a good job in its mandated review of the president\u2019s tax returns.", "Neal letter, April 3: Consistent with its authority, the Committee is considering legislative proposals and conducting oversight related to our Federal tax laws, including, but not limited to, the extent to which the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a President. Under the Internal Revenue Manual, individual income tax returns of a President are subject to mandatory examination, but this practice is IRS policy and not codified in the Federal tax laws. It is necessary for the Committee to determine the scope of any such examination and whether it includes a review of underlying business activities required to be reported on the individual income tax return.", "Kleinbard believes that meets the threshold of proving a bona fide purpose for the request.", "\u201cThe Chairman\u2019s request here was carefully written to explain his reasons, which include, wearing his oversight hat, ensuring that the IRS is doing its job auditing the President,\u201d Kleinbard said. \u201cFurther, the President is the Taxpayer in Chief. We have a tax system in which we each assess tax against ourselves \u2013 that\u2019s what you do when you file a return. The Taxpayer in Chief needs to set a standard of compliance to which we all should aspire. For him to abdicate that responsibility threatens the integrity of the income tax system, which surely is something that should concern W&M [the Ways and Means committee]. So there\u2019s no doubt that W&M has more than met any standard that might be read into the statute.\u201d", "In a phone interview, Thorndike agreed that Neal appears to have framed a legitimate request within the scope of his committee\u2019s oversight responsibilities.", "The last time Congress looked into the IRS audit of a president\u2019s returns was during the Richard Nixon administration. In that case, Nixon voluntarily provided his returns. A congressional committee concluded there were several items incorrectly reported on Nixon\u2019s returns, finding he owed about $477,000 in additional taxes.", "\u201cSo there is good historical reason to be concerned\u201d that the IRS is doing its job properly with review of presidential returns, Thorndike said.", "Thorndike said that while it seems Neal\u2019s request is on solid legal footing, \u201cit remains to be seen\u201d how a court might rule.", "Treasury missed Neal\u2019s deadline to produce the returns by April 10. In a letter sent to Neal that day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the request \u201craises serious issues concerning the constitutional scope of Congressional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose, and the constitutional rights of American citizens.\u201d", "\u201cGiven the seriousness of these issues, Mnuchin said Treasury has consulted with the Department of Justice \u201cto ensure that our response is fully consistent with the law and the Constitution.\u201d", "Mnuchin noted that Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has the same authority as Neal from IRS Code section 6103 (f), blasted Neal\u2019s efforts as politically motivated. Grassley said the request was \u201ca pretext to bring this president down.\u201d", "The IRS statute states that if the returns were provided to Neal, they would be viewed confidentially in \u201cclosed executive session\u201d of the Ways and Means Committee. But legal scholars said depending on what lawmakers find, it is possible the committee could conclude it has a constitutional responsibility to release the returns publicly.", "In a speech from the Senate floor, Grassley said the IRS is only required to turn over tax records under the law if the request is tied to \u201ca legitimate legislative purpose in asking for them.\u201d", "Although Neal said the aim is to make sure the IRS review of the president\u2019s tax returns is being done fully, appropriately and impartially, Grassley contended, \u201cThere is no reason to believe the IRS is doing any less due diligence in its review of President Trump\u2019s taxes than it has for any other president in our memory.\u201d", "Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Trump, made similar arguments in an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on April 7. Sekulow questioned what legitimate legislative purpose the request served.", "\u201cThis idea that you can use the IRS as a political weapon, which is what is happening here, is incorrect both as a matter of statutory law and constitutionally,\u201d Sekulow said.", "As for Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cthere is no law,\u201d George K. Yin, a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia School of Law, who served as chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation from 2003 to 2005, suspects Trump was referring to the custom \u2014 but not the law \u2014 that has been followed by presidents for the last four decades to release copies of their tax returns to the public.", "\u201cI doubt that [Trump] has even heard of the law now being invoked by Chairman Neal,\u201d Yin told us via email. \u201cSince the question focused on giving Congress his returns, his answer is wrong but not egregiously wrong because of his likely confusion.\u201d", "The IRS statute cited by Neal \u201ccontains no limits,\u201d Yin said. \u201cThe chairman can request anyone\u2019s returns and the Treasury Secretary is directed to furnish them.\u201d Yin said there may be \u201can implicit condition\u201d that Neal\u2019s request have a \u201clegitimate legislative purpose\u201d such as oversight of the IRS. \u201cBut there is no specific precedent on this point because to my knowledge, the authority Mr. Neal is invoking has never been challenged,\u201d Yin said.", "\u201cNeal\u2019s request stated two purposes that would qualify as legitimate legislative purposes,\u201d Yin said, adding that Sekulow\u2019s counterargument is that \u201cthe stated purposes are not the real purpose, and that the real purpose is simply to make a political attack.\u201d", "Again, those are questions that would need to be settled in federal court. And that\u2019s where the issue seems likely to be headed. \u201cIf it has to be litigated, it will be litigated,\u201d Sekulow said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
