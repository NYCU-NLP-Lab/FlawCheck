It was an unavoidable topic during the first vice presidential debate on Oct. 7.", "President Donald Trump has officially nominated 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a noted conservative, to the Supreme Court, USA TODAY reported.

Kamala Harris and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden would increase\u00a0the number of justices, if they win the election.", "Harris responded with a story about President Abraham Lincoln's decision to delay a court\u00a0nomination until after his 1864 campaign.", "\"Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection, and it was 27 days before the election, and a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln's party was in charge, not only in the White House, but the Senate,\" Harris said.\u00a0\"But Honest Abe said, it's not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States, and then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land.\"", "It was a statement some disagreed with, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.", "\"Kamala Harris\u2019 use of Lincoln to justify not nominating a Supreme Court Justice was totally false. The Senate was not in session and the minute it came into session Lincoln nominated a Justice. She is either really ignorant or just lied,\" Gingrich tweeted on Oct. 8.", "A screenshot of the tweet was posted to Facebook that evening. The user who posted the screenshot did not respond to a request comment from USA TODAY.", "Other social media posts similarly claimed Harris' story was wrong.", "Indeed, Harris' history lesson on Lincoln\u00a0missed key details.", "Presidential historian Michael Beschloss tweeted on the night of the debate that Harris was right.", "\"Harris is correct that when Roger Taney died in October 1864, Abraham Lincoln deferred a Supreme Court appointment until after election so that next President, with a new mandate, could do it, Beschloss said.", "Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, most famous for\u00a0his majority opinion\u00a0in the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford case, in which he wrote Black people were \"so far inferior, that they had no rights that the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his own benefit,\" died on Oct. 12, 1864, 27 days before the Nov. 8 election, as Harris cited.", "More:Mitt Romney reprimands Trump, Democrats for 'vile' and 'hate-filled' politics", "But other evidence points to Lincoln being a savvy politician\u00a0instead of a populist\u00a0by deciding to delay a nomination for Taney's replacement before a major election.", "The Lincoln administration considered options before the chronically ill chief justice's death, but the Civil War and a historic election factored into the timing of naming a successor, according to \"Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Appointments to the Supreme Court: A Master Politician at his Craft\"\u00a0by Michael A. Kahn. An excerpt is posted to the website for the President Lincoln's Cottage museum.", "Lincoln was also willing to consider \"expressions of public opinion from the country\u201d about the future nominee, according to historian Michael Burlingame, as\u00a0reported\u00a0in The Washington Post.", "But of Harris' claim that Lincoln delayed the nomination to give Americans a say in the decision, Burlingame told PolitiFact,\u00a0\"I've never seen anything like that quote in all my 36 years of Lincoln research.\"", "Candidates vying for Taney's position\u00a0included ambitious climbers on both sides of the political aisle. Rather than alienate potential supporters,\u00a0Lincoln used the Supreme Court vacancy as political leverage during his campaign, Kahn wrote.

Chase campaigned for Lincoln.", "Congress and the Supreme Court went into recess in July 1864 and was not scheduled to reconvene\u00a0until\u00a0Dec. 5, according to the U.S. Senate\u00a0website.", "Though he won reelection, Lincoln \u00a0did not put forth a nomination to replace Taney until lawmakers returned to Washington.", "Gingrich correctly stated Lincoln submitted a Supreme Court nomination \"the minute\" it came into session. The president ultimately nominated Chase, his ardent supporter, on Dec. 6, 1864, apparently without telling any of his advisers.", "\"Lincoln could have announced his choice (after Taney's death),\" Kahn told USA TODAY.\u00a0\"Whether he could have physically delivered it to the Senate is irrelevant.\"", "Lincoln also wanted to avoid endangering his chances for reelection, according to Burlingame.", "\"Lincoln doubtless thought that it was inadvisable to summon a special session in the midst of a presidential campaign when his chances of reelection looked very good. Besides, members of Congress were busy stumping for their own candidacies,\" Burlingame told PolitiFact.", "Ultimately, Kahn said, Lincoln and Trump were both faced with a choice of announcing their selection to the Supreme Court in an attempt to use it as a political advantage.", "\"Trump chose to announce a nominee to improve his political chances of being reelected. Lincoln had the same choice, but chose not to,\" Kahn stated.", "We rate this claim TRUE,\u00a0based on our research.\u00a0Lincoln delayed filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court that arose 27 days before the election of 1864.
