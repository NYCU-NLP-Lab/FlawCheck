["Facebook posts\u00a0here and here\u00a0contain the text: \u201cPelosi says if impeachment fails she will resign,\" followed by the opening words of a prayer.", "But when asked if Pelosi said she could resign in connection with the impeachment proceedings, Drew Hammill, her deputy chief of staff, told AFP by email: \u201cNo.\u201d", "US President Donald Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on December 18, 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He is now on trial in the Senate, where members of his Republican party hold enough seats that he is all but certain to be acquitted.", "Other posts -- such as this one -- link to an article that makes the same claim about Pelosi\u2019s possible resignation.", "The article cites an interview Pelosi allegedly gave to a Belgian magazine called \u201cL\u0435 Mensonge,\u201d and quotes her as saying: \u201cIf this impeachment fails, my time is probably up. I won't wait around. If it doesn't go through, I'll resign.\u201d", "But \u201cLe Mensonge\u201d is a\u00a0fictitious publication with a name that means \u201cThe Lie\u201d in French.", "And the text of the article appears to have been copied\u00a0from one that appeared on bustatroll.org with the label \"Impeachment Satire.\"", "Bustatroll.org is part of the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u201d network of websites, which was founded by Christopher Blair, a resident of the US state of Maine.", "Articles on Blair\u2019s sites make outrageous claims written as fact, albeit with clear indications they are not real.", "The articles are nonetheless\u00a0shared in droves by people who apparently believe they are true amid a hyper-partisan American political environment.", "The resignation claim is also repeated in a YouTube video that has been viewed more than 200,000 times, and which has been shared here on Facebook.", "The video cites a different article -- apparently this one, which also seems to have been taken from bustatroll.org\u00a0-- that quotes the same alleged \u201cLe Mensonge\u201d interview as the source of its information.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
