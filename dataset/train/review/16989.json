Evers, a Democrat, is a candidate for governor in 2018. (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)", "The day after word surfaced that state schools superintendent Tony Evers would announce a campaign for governor, the Wisconsin Republican Party attacked.", "Unveiling a digital ad campaign on Aug. 21, 2017, the GOP claimed Evers \"allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students.\"", "The Madison-area teacher was fired for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker. But he got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. And that decision was upheld by two courts.", "The Republicans contend, in effect, that even though the legal system returned the teacher to his job, Evers had the power to stop him from teaching at all -- anywhere in the state -- by revoking his teaching license.", "They made essentially the same attack in a radio ad released Sept. 6, 2017.", "As we\u2019ll see, this fact check turns largely on what state law said at the time about revoking a teacher\u2019s license for \"immoral behavior\" -- a law that was changed, in part, because of this case.", "The governor\u2019s race", "Republican Gov. Scott Walker has all but announced he will seek a third term in 2018.", "Evers, a Democrat, has won three statewide elections for state superintendent, a nonpartisan office, since 2009.", "The other leading Democrats with gubernatorial campaigns up and running are Andy Gronik, a businessman who lives in the Milwaukee suburb of Fox Point, and state Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire.", "The case of Andy Harris", "The Republican attack centers on Andy Harris, who started teaching in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison, in 1993. He had no disciplinary history before his December 2010 firing. At the time, Harris taught seventh-grade science at one of the district\u2019s two middle schools; now he has the same job at the other middle school.", "Here are the major events in the case, based on news reports, the arbitrator\u2019s decision and a state appeals court decision:", "Dec. 2009", "School district announces Harris had been placed on leave because he received from his sister 23 emails containing pornography and other adult content. Many were jokes that showed images of nude or partially nude women, one of which Harris shared with a co-worker who complained to the principal. None were seen by students.", "An investigation by the school district finds that more than 30 teachers and administrators had accessed inappropriate jokes or sexually explicit materials on their school computers. Seven educators in addition to Harris were disciplined: five teachers received unpaid suspensions, one substitute teacher was dismissed and an administrator resigned.", "May 2010", "School board fires Harris. The district notifies the state Department of Public Instruction, per a state law requiring school districts to report dismissals that are based on immoral conduct.", "Feb. 2012", "Acting on a grievance filed by the teachers union, arbitrator Karen Mawhinney, a Burlington attorney, overturns Harris\u2019 firing and reduces his penalty to 15 days of unpaid suspension.", "Harris\u2019 behavior did not meet the state law\u2019s definition of immoral conduct because \"there was no endangerment of the health, safety, welfare or education of any pupil,\" she wrote. She also said \"his worst offense is forwarding one inappropriate e-mail to two friends and not exercising the good judgment to discourage his sister from sending these types of e-mails to him.\" She added: \"The fact that he was discharged while others were suspended or received written reprimands or nothing at all, the discharge cannot stand.\"", "Aug. 2013", "State Court of Appeals upholds a decision made by a circuit court, which had upheld the arbitrator\u2019s decision.", "Jan. 2014", "After state Supreme Court announces it will not review the appeals court decision, Harris returns to the classroom.

But the department decided against it after concluding, separately from the arbitrator\u2019s decision, that his behavior didn\u2019t endanger kids as defined by the law at that time, spokesman Tom McCarthy told us. In other words, he said, in the department\u2019s view there was no legal basis to take away Harris\u2019 license.", "That position appears to be supported by the fact that in November 2011, nearly a year after Harris\u2019 firing, Walker signed a measure that redefined immoral conduct to include \"the intentional use of an educational agency\u2019s equipment to download, view, solicit, seek, display, or distribute pornographic material.\"", "That is, the new law, which Evers supported and which was prompted partly by the Harris case, specifies that what Harris did is legal cause for license revocation -- and that there doesn\u2019t have to be any endangerment of kids. The old law didn\u2019t.", "Finally, the GOP argues that there was one important fact Evers had that the arbitrator didn\u2019t: After there was outcry from parents about Harris\u2019 return, the school district allowed students to attend a study hall if they didn\u2019t feel comfortable in Harris\u2019 class. The GOP says that endangered students\u2019 education, since they were missing valuable instruction time.", "In response, McCarthy told us that the law allows the state to revoke a teacher\u2019s license only based on the teacher\u2019s conduct -- not based on parents\u2019 objections to a teacher or a district\u2019s decision to provide an accommodation like the study hall.", "Our rating", "The state Republican Party says Evers \"allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students.\"", "The teacher was not found guilty of, or even charged with, any crime. Rather, he was fired for viewing pornographic material on his school computer. He got his job back, however, after an arbitrator ruled that the firing was not justified, in part because the arbitrator concluded that the behavior did not endanger any students.", "Evers, as the state schools superintendent, had the discretion to initiate license revocation proceedings. But state law at the time required the endangerment of kids in order to revoke a teacher\u2019s license and, like the arbitrator, Evers concluded that the teacher\u2019s conduct didn\u2019t endanger kids.", "For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.", "Wisconsin Republican Party, news release, Aug. 21, 2017", "Interview, Wisconsin Republican Party spokesman Alec Zimmerman and attorney Chaz Nichols, Aug. 30, 2017", "Email, Tony Evers campaign spokeswoman Maggie Gau, Aug. 28, 2017", "Wisconsin State Journal, \"Scott Walker asks DPI to begin license revocation proceedings for teacher who viewed porn at school,\" Jan. 29, 2014", "Gov.
