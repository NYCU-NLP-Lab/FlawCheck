News and ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. Is he one of them now?", "\"It\u2019s not a matter of being accepted, it\u2019s about success,\" O\u2019Reilly explained. \"And I bring ratings to those shows.

That's why they have me on.\"", "Because we were curious, we wondered about O\u2019Reilly\u2019s rating power when he appears on other shows.

Nielsen provided average viewers for the calendar year, excluding specials and repeats. The show is on five nights a week, including repeats, so we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge matter.", "Also, some ratings for 2014 are not available because Nielsen is still re-evaluating its data following a reporting error for broadcast networks from the last seven months.", "In the chart below, we shaded appearances\u00a0in which O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ratings outnumbered either the weekday average for the season or the annual average.
