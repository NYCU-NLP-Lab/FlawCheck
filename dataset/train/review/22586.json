["\u201cA Lagos High Court has sentenced notorious kidnap kingpin, Chikwudubem Onwuamadike, also known as Evans, to death,\u201d reads an Instagram post published by popular Nigerian entertainer Samuel Oguachuba, otherwise known as Samklef. \u201cThe court gave this judgement on Monday (sic).\u201d", "The viral post was shared alongside a video clip showing a screengrab of the same claim published on Samklef\u2019s blog. It has been viewed more than 22,000 times on Instagram since August 19, 2020.", "The claim has circulated on several social media platforms in Nigeria, including on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as\u00a0on several news sites such as Jamyco and GistMania -- both known for spreading misinformation. AFP Fact Check recently debunked false articles from the websites here and here.", "The rumour about Onwuamadike\u2019s death sentence also emerged amid reports that Nigeria has\u00a0reintegrated 601 \u201crepentant\u201d Boko Haram fighters into society.\u00a0Critics demanded justification from the government for pardoning ex-insurgents, despite repeated killings, while purportedly sentencing\u00a0kidnappers to death.", "Nigerian police arrested Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike -- also known as \u201cEvans\u201d\u00a0-- on June 10, 2017, at his Lagos home. He faces multiple counts in three courts and five separate\u00a0trials.", "AFP Fact Check attended one of the trials in Lagos on August 27, 2020, where\u00a0Onwuamadike appeared with alleged accomplices Joseph Emeka, Chiemeka Arinze and Udeme Upong.", "They have been charged with attempting to kidnap prominent Nigerian transporter Vincent Obianodo;\u00a0murders of his police aide and driver;\u00a0attempted murder;\u00a0conspiracy to commit a felony, namely kidnapping;\u00a0and sale\u00a0and transfer of firearms, according to the court registrar\u2019s office. They have pleaded not guilty and the trial was postponed to September 17, 2020, after a day of witness cross-examination.", "Details obtained by AFP Fact Check show that in the\u00a0second of his five trials sitting in the same court, Onwuamadike stands accused alongside Victor Aduba, a dismissed Nigerian military officer, of the alleged kidnapping and unlawful possession of firearms. Both have pleaded not guilty and the case has also been postponed to September 17, 2020.", "In fact, all criminal cases involving Onwuamadike are ongoing -- none have proceeded yet to judgement and sentencing, said Y.A Sule, a member of the prosecuting team who spoke to\u00a0AFP Fact Check.", "The director of public affairs for the Lagos justice ministry, Kayode Oyekanmi, also dismissed the rumour of Onwuamadike\u2019s death sentence as untrue.", "\u201cThe news about Evans is FAKE,\u201d Oyekanmi wrote in a text message to AFP Fact Check. \u201cNo truth to it at all.\u201d", "Furthermore, no credible news outlet in Nigeria has reported on Onwuamadike being sentenced to death.", "Fresh posts repeating the false claims were published in November 2021. However, as this report\u00a0from November 29, 2021, shows, the trial remains ongoing.", "Using the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP Fact Check found that the false article was first published on August 17, 2020, on a website called Observer Times.", "It ran with a click-bait headline, which reads: \u201cBreaking: \u202aBillionaire Kidnappers, Evans To Die by Hanging\u201d, but the body of the article does not actually go on to say that he was sentenced to death.", "Rather, the text says the suspected kidnapper \u201cmay get life imprisonment or death penalty sentence\u201d because the law in Lagos prescribes this punishment for offences involving\u00a0kidnapping and forceful extortion.", "While the referenced law indeed exists in Lagos state, the article\u2019s author did not cite any source reporting that Onwuamadike had been\u00a0convicted, let alone sentenced to death.", "The Kidnapping Prohibition Law of 2017, under which Onwuamadike is being tried, imposes a penalty of life imprisonment for suspects found guilty of kidnapping, and the death penalty when their victim dies in the course of a kidnapping.", "In other social media posts (archived here and here), an image of five people who appear to be crying accompanies a claim that it shows Evans\u2019 family members weeping following the word of his purported death sentence.", "However, this is false. The image has been circulating online since at least June 17, 2017, in articles reporting that\u00a0Onwuamadike\u2019s wife had asked Nigerians for forgiveness on behalf of her husband.", "The story was widely published by Nigerian daily newspapers, including Vanguard and Daily Trust.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
