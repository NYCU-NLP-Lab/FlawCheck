["The post, shared more than 20,000 times in English on Facebook in May 2020, lists 26 substances, claiming: \u201cIn the first six years of life your child receives the following\u201d. The list is posted alongside a picture of a baby doll with 20 medical syringes injected into it. The claim also circulated in French and Dutch.", "Contrary to what is claimed in the post, the listed substances are not toxic, lethal or carcinogenic when used in small doses. Health Canada points out that vaccines may contain \u201cminute amounts of chemicals that are used during the production process, such as for the growth or purification of specific antigens or the inactivation of toxins.\u201d", "Here are some specific examples where specialists examined the individual ingredients and found the doses are too small to be toxic.", "The post questions the use of \u201c801.6 mcg (micrograms) formaldehyde (carcinogen, embalming agent)\u201d in vaccines.", "According to Health Canada, formaldehyde is \u201cused to inactivate viruses and protein toxins\u201d in the production stage of the vaccine.", "Although the dosage in the post is roughly correct, the implication of its risks is misleading.", "\u201cChildren are exposed to many of these ingredients at a far higher dose through other natural sources,\u201d Dr Natasha Crawcroft, Director of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto told AFP via email. \u201cFor example, pears include 50 times more formaldehyde than any vaccine.\u201d", "This is confirmed by the University of Oxford\u2019s Vaccine Knowledge Project: \u201cThe amount of natural formaldehyde in a two-month-old infant\u2019s blood (around 1.1 milligrams in total) is 10 times greater than the amount found in any vaccine (less than 0.1 milligrams).\u201d", "It is also incorrect to describe the dosage of formaldehyde in vaccines as an \u201cembalming agent.\u201d", "\u201cTo embalm a body you need something like 6-10 liter of formaldehyde \u2013 it\u2019s nothing at all like the tiny amounts in vaccines,\u201d Crawford said.", "The post also claims that a vaccinated child receives \u201c116 mcg potassium chloride (used in a lethal injection)\u201d. Potassium chloride is a potassium salt.", "\u201cOne aspect that is not made clear is the importance of dose. Everything including water can be lethal if given in too large a dose, but can at the same time be essential for life at the right dose. This is true of potassium and sodium chloride, for example,\u201d Crawcroft said.", "Professor Francois Chast, Honorary President of France\u2019s National Academy of Pharmacy told AFP: \u201cA dangerous dose would be over 1 to 2 grams; 116 mcg is a dose 10,000 times smaller than that.\u201d", "Chast also explained that lethal injections are administered intravenously. \u201cVaccines are not injected into a vein.\u201d", "The use of \u201cpotassium phosphate\u201d and \u201csodium bicarbonate\u201d are also questioned by the post. Additives such as potassium or sodium salts are used in vaccines and medication to \u201chelp control product acidity (pH) and maintain the quality of vaccine antigens,\u201d according to Health Canada.", "The post also condemns the use of \u201cantibiotics\u201d in vaccines.", "These antibiotics are used at the production stage of the vaccine \u201cto prevent contamination during viral cell culture,\u201d according to Health Canada.", "These products are excipients, or inactive ingredients used to help preserve medications and vaccines and to facilitate their administration.", "These excipients are very quickly eliminated by the body and do not accumulate in a child\u2019s body over time.", "The University of Oxford\u2019s Vaccine Knowledge Project adds that \u201cantibiotics which commonly cause allergic reactions (such as penicillins, cephalosporins and sulphonamides) are not used in vaccines.\u201d", "The post criticises the use of \u201c5,700 mcg aluminum\u201d which it describes as \u201cneurotoxin.\u201d", "This substance is used as an adjuvant. According to Health Canada, these allow a \u201creduction in the amount of antigen per dose or the total number of doses needed to achieve immunity,\u201d meaning that without them, patients might require much larger or more doses for the vaccines to be effective.", "The University of Oxford adds: \u201cthe amount of aluminium present in vaccines is small -- less than 2 milligrams of the salts, and less than a milligram of actual aluminium.\u201d", "This Health Canada study concluded that a toddler between the ages of six months and fouryears ingests over 1.5 milligrams of aluminum through normal consumption of drinking water, food, beverages, air and soil in the space of three days.", "The post lists \u201c23,250 mcg gelatin (ground up animal carcass)\u201d and \u201cOver 560 mcg polysorbate 80 (carcinogen)\u201d as being present in the vaccines.", "The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0in the United States states that gelatin is used \u201cto keep the vaccine effective\u201d after it is manufactured.", "Gelatin\u00a0is commonly consumed by \u201ceating food such as Jell-O\u201d and it \u201cresides in the body naturally\u201d.", "Polysorbate 80\u00a0is \u201ca common food additive used in several vaccines as an emulsifier (to hold other ingredients together),\u201d according to the University of Oxford. \u201cCompared to its use in foods, there is very little polysorbate 80 in vaccines.\u201d", "The list is posted with a picture of a doll being injected with 20 medical syringes. These are alleged to represent \u201chow many vaccines a child receives by age two\u201d.", "This is misleading. Canada does not have national mandatory vaccination, with Ontario and New Brunswick being the only provinces requiring them for a child to attend school.", "Following the recommended vaccination schedule,\u00a0a two year old child in Canada\u00a0would have received eight vaccines, spread across 17 or 18 doses.", "In the United States they would receive 10, spread across 33 or 34 doses, up to the age of two.", "The total number of doses will vary as some vaccines can be administered through a single injection or multiple shots.", "Vaccine ingredients are a regular source of misinformation.
