["Boris Johnson said his party has \u201cwiped out the national debt\u201d.", "There is no evidence he said this.", "The Conservatives nearly doubled the debt from \u00a3950 billion to \u00a31.8 trillion.", "Broadly correct. Government debt currently stands at just below \u00a31.8 trillion, which is 81% of GDP. In May 2010 when the Conservatives came to office, it was worth just over \u00a31 trillion or 64% of GDP.", "A Facebook post shared an image of a tweet, which claims that Boris Johnson \u201cjust said\u201d that his party had \u201cwiped out the national debt\u201d. The tweet comments that \u201cthey nearly doubled it from \u00a3950b to \u00a31.8tr\u201d. Both the Facebook post and the tweet were from 2 October. The Facebook post has been shared over 650 times and the tweet several thousand times.", "The figures about the size of the UK\u2019s debt are roughly correct. It stands at \u00a31.8 trillion (81% of GDP) today compared to just over \u00a31 trillion (64% of GDP) in May 2010.", "However, there\u2019s no evidence that Mr Johnson actually said his party had wiped out the national debt.", "The tweet was posted after Boris Johnson\u2019s speech at Conservative party conference last week. We also saw other very similar claims emerge on Twitter on the same day.", "The supposed quote about having \u201cwiped out the national debt\u201d is not in the\u00a0pre-released draft\u00a0of Mr Johnson\u2019s conference speech. And we\u2019ve reviewed subtitles of the speech itself, using\u00a0Full Fact\u2019s internal technology, which also show no mention of this claim.", "Boris Johnson\u00a0did say\u00a0\u201cit was this Conservative government that tackled the debt and the deficit left by the last Labour government\u201d. But this is not the same thing as saying the Conservatives have \u201cwiped out the national debt\u201d.", "In theory it\u2019s possible that Mr Johnson made the claim somewhere other than during his keynote conference speech. But we\u2019ve seen no evidence for that either.", "There are only a\u00a0handful of tweets\u00a0which report Mr Johnson as saying his party has \u201cwiped out the national debt\u201d, and none are from journalists who were at the conference.", "Additionally,\u00a0Googling\u00a0the phrase \u201cwiped out the national debt\u201d returns the same few tweets and no evidence Mr Johnson has ever used those words. The quote has also been attributed to Mr Johnson in a\u00a0Daily Express article, and we\u2019ve asked the Express to amend this.", "Honesty in public debate matters", "You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email", "I\u2019m in", "Although the claim attributed to Mr Johnson seems to have been fabricated, it\u2019s worth examining what he did say in more detail.", "He stated that \u201cit was this Conservative government that tackled the debt and the deficit\u201d. Government\u00a0debt\u00a0is the\u00a0total amount\u00a0of money the government owes from its borrowing over the years plus interest payments.", "The\u00a0deficit\u00a0is effectively how much the government has borrowed\u00a0each year.", "Since 2010/11 (when the Conservatives came back into office as part of the Coalition government) the deficit has\u00a0fallen in all but one year, which in turn means that the national debt has continued to grow, but at a slower rate. Whether you consider this to mean the government has \u201ctackled the debt and deficit\u201d is a matter of interpretation.", "We\u2019ve looked at the numbers is more detail here.", "Full Fact fights for good, reliable information in the media, online, and in politics.", "Bad information ruins lives.
