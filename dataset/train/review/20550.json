["About this rating", "In September 2017, there was renewed interest in a 1990 comic strip by the artist Peter Kuper, which appeared to preempt current events by featuring the construction of a large, controversial wall by Donald Trump, as well as a populist \"rise to power\" by the future United States President.", "Peter Kuper did a comic about nationalist Trump coming to power on a build-a-wall platform. This was 27 years ago in Heavy Metal in 1990. pic.twitter.com/1cEZe5Hxnj", "\u2014 Steve Lieber (@steve_lieber) September 20, 2017", "The artist Peter Kuper confirmed to us that the comic strip, titled \"The Wall,\" is authentic, and was published in Volume 14 Number 3 of Heavy Metal magazine in July 1990. Its existence has gained new interest because Trump began his 2016 presidential election campaign partially on the basis of a pledge to build a wall along the southern border of the United States.", "After his election in November 2016, Heavy Metal magazine ran a feature article on the then 26-year-old comic strip, offering this summary:", "\u201cThe Wall\u201d begins with a disavowal of well-known lines of \u201cThe New Colossus,\u201d the poem associated with the Statue of Liberty. In this story, we\u2019re living in a divided city [New York] where the haves and have nots can barely relate to each other. In fact, the cultural and economic divide has been made real in the form of a wall to \u201ckeep the peasants at arm\u2019s length.\u201d", "Law enforcement had been overwhelmed; the cops were running for their lives. So, a wall: The brainchild of Trump and [real estate mogul Harry Helmsley]. But the relationship between these two egomaniacs can\u2019t last, and in a fit of rage Helmsley carries out a purge called the \u201cNight of the Long Skates.\u201d All Trump\u2019s associates are wiped out, and Trump himself escapes into the NYC sewer. But Trump plots his revenge.", "...In this story, [a pro-Trump group called the Guardian Demons] band together in their hats, led by a Messianic Trump who convinces his followers that Helmsley is the reason for the unemployment and poverty they face. The mob carries Trump to a humiliating victory over Helmsley, a feat Trump promises to commemorate with a monument...", "The \"People's Monument\" promised by Trump is yet another wall. The final panels of the comic strip show a graffiti artist spraying \"Dump Trump\" on the wall - a slogan popular in 2017 among the President's critics.", "The article goes on:", "Ok, so Trump isn\u2019t president in this 26-year-old story, but the man depicted is fully recognizable as the current President-elect. The tactics used to motivate followers, the faith in the power of walls, the goddamn hats \u2014 it was all there.", "Peter Kuper explained the origins of the comic strip to us:", "The idea came to me after a visit to Berlin in 1987 before their wall came down. Trump was a well known real estate mogul at that time. So was Helmsley.
