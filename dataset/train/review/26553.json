About a third of the city\u2019s residents, roughly 3.5 million people, had no running water. Leaks and water theft were literally draining the pipes. Water pressure could drop at any moment, leaving many with a completely unpredictable water supply. Cholera and infection-related diarrhea were on the rise.", "The Philippine government turned to the World Bank, which brought in the International Finance Corporation to devise a privatization plan.

In 2007, an article in Economics and Management in Developing Countries reported that by 2002, the fraction of people with service had gone from about 60 percent to over 80 percent. Unlike before 1997, the water moving through the pipes met government drinking water standards. Leaks were repaired twice as quickly and while service might drop out, the average went from taps running 17 hours a day before the change to 21 hours a day afterward.", "As the authors of the journal article put it, \"If one goes by the numbers for water coverage, availability and quality, water privatization in Metro Manila seemed to have worked. However, water rates had risen dramatically during the same period.\"", "Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the International Finance Corporation, said the benefits have been widely shared.", "\"While tariffs have increased for some residents of Manila, many of the people not previously connected to water services were poor families, who were forced to pay $3 a cubic meter for bottled water on the open market,\" Jones said. \"Today, the average tariff in Manila is $1.30, but this tariff is helping subsidize the poorest families, who now only pay 18 cents per cubic meter.\"", "Two ways to look at price hikes", "Moore couched her claim in terms of the percentage rise in the cost of water.

The source cited by Moore\u2019s staff undermines that number.", "The International Finance Corporation bought its stake in 2004. Between 2004 and 2012, rates rose about 170 percent. Moore incorrectly used a figure that would apply to the period from 1997 to 2012.", "However, the IFC crafted the plan for privatization in the first place. All parties knew that important capital investments would follow, and that rates would go up. It is also true that in terms of the actual size of a family\u2019s water bill, rates rose faster each year after the IFC bought its share than before.", "Moore wrongly pegged the rate increase to the date of IFC\u2019s equity position, but the development corporation played a key role from the start.
