["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on July 26, 2019 | Updated on July 27, 2019", "Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler selectively cited former special counsel Robert S. Mueller\u2019s testimony to misleadingly claim that Mueller said he didn\u2019t indict President Donald Trump only because he couldn\u2019t indict a sitting president.", "Mueller clarified in his July 24 congressional testimony that \u201cwe did not make any determination with regard to culpability.\u201d", "During a press conference\u00a0on July 26,\u00a0Nadler said that Mueller \u201ctold us in a remarkable exchange with\u00a0[Democratic Rep. Ted] Lieu that but for the Department of Justice policy prohibiting [him] from doing so, he would have indicted President Trump. Indeed it is clear that any other citizen of this country who behaved as the president has would have been charged with multiple crimes. Notably, my Republican colleagues were unable to refute a single one of these facts.\u201d", "But Nadler, chairman of the judiciary committee, ignores some of the facts.", "During Mueller\u2019s testimony, in response to a question from Lieu, Mueller provided an eyebrow-raising answer that seemed to suggest that it was an Office of Legal Counsel decision \u2014 which found that a sitting president cannot be indicted \u2014 that alone prevented him from charging Trump.\u00a0But soon after, Mueller explicitly corrected himself \u2014 twice.", "Lieu:\u00a0Thank you. So to recap what we\u2019ve heard, we have heard today that the president ordered former White House Counsel, Don McGahn, to fire you. The president ordered Don McGahn to then cover that up and create a false paper trail. And now we\u2019ve heard the president ordered Corey Lewandowski to tell Jeff Sessions to limit your investigation so that he \u2014 you stop investigating the president. I believe any reasonable person looking at these facts could conclude that all three elements of the crime of obstruction of justice have been met. And I\u2019d like to ask you the reason, again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?", "Mueller:\u00a0That is correct.", "That suggestion\u00a0would have gone much further than what Mueller said in his final report on the investigation.", "Mueller\u2019s\u00a0448-page report noted that his team \u201cdetermined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment\u201d regarding potential obstruction of justice and therefore \u201cdid not draw ultimate conclusions about the President\u2019s conduct.\u201d Factoring into that decision to not consider prosecution, Mueller wrote, was the OLC opinion regarding the indictment of a sitting president. (Attorney General William P. Barr later told Congress in a\u00a0letter that there would be no charges, saying that\u00a0\u201cthe evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\u201d)", "At the start of the following congressional hearing, before the House intelligence committee, Mueller in his opening remarks corrected his earlier response to Lieu \u2014 again citing his report\u2019s explanation.", "Mueller: Now, before we go to questions, I want to add one correction to my testimony this morning. I want to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. Lieu, who said, and I quote, \u201cYou didn\u2019t charge the president because of the OLC opinion.\u201d That is not the correct way to say it.\u00a0As we say in the report and as I said at the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime.", "And he later did so again when asked about the matter by Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas.", "Ratcliffe:\u00a0So to that point, you addressed one of the issues that I needed to, which was from your testimony this morning, which some construed as a change to the written report. You talked about the exchange that you had with Congressman Lieu. I wrote it down a little bit different. I want to ask you about it so that the record\u2019s perfectly clear. I recorded that he asked you, quote, \u201cThe reason you did not indict Donald Trump is because of the OLC opinion stating you cannot indict a sitting president,\u201d to which you responded, \u201cThat is correct.\u201d That response is inconsistent, I think you\u2019ll agree, with your written report. I want to be clear that it is not your intent to change your written report. It is your intent to clarify the record today.", "Mueller: Well, as I started today, this afternoon, and added either a footnote or an endnote, what I wanted to clarify is the fact that we did not make any determination with regard to culpability in any way. We did not start that process down \u2014 down the road.", "Nadler is not the only one to misrepresent Mueller\u2019s testimony regarding the OLC decision.", "The cherry-picking has surfaced on social media, as well. A viral meme\u00a0shared by a page called the Trump Resistance Movement, for example, cites a limited portion of the Mueller-Lieu exchange to also suggest that the OLC decision is the only thing that stood in the way of Trump\u2019s prosecution.", "As we said, Mueller made clear that that was not what he meant.", "Update, July 27: A spokesman for Nadler, Daniel Schwarz, director of strategic communications for the House Judiciary Committee, told us he \u201cdidn\u2019t take [Mueller] to be changing a stance on any of his responses to Lieu. He just came back to it to reaffirm that he did not [reach] a declination decision.\u201d", "But Mueller said he wanted \u201cto add one correction to my testimony.\u201d He quoted Lieu as saying, \u201cYou didn\u2019t charge the president because of the OLC opinion,\u201d and Mueller said, \u201cThat is not the correct way to say it.\u201d He said that \u201cwe did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime.\u201d Not reaching a determination on whether a crime was committed isn\u2019t the same as saying, in Nadler\u2019s words, \u201che would have indicted\u201d the president \u201cbut for\u201d the OLC opinion.", "In a CNN interview, Lieu acknowledged Mueller had \u201cwalked it back,\u201d but said, \u201cI believe he fully understood my question. It was a logical extension of me getting him to establish the three elements of obstruction of justice were met and I think it\u2019s what he actually believes.\u201d That\u2019s Lieu\u2019s opinion.", "But the record shows Mueller did make a \u201ccorrection\u201d to his response to Lieu.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
