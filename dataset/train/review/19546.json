Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 in exchange for a border wall \u2014 \u201cdemands welfare\u201d for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.

There are some exceptions, such as emergency medical care; short-term, non-cash emergency disaster relief; limited housing or community development assistance to those who were already receiving it in 1996;\u00a0public health assistance for communicable diseases; and programs such as soup kitchens.", "The story also contains a number of falsehoods about the congresswoman. Ocasio-Cortez is not on the conference committee tasked with reaching a deal, and she was born in the Bronx, New York, not \u201cillegally brought \u2026 across the border [by her parents] when she was a baby,\u201d as the story states.", "We have been\u00a0debunking\u00a0false claims about\u00a0immigrants living in the country illegally\u00a0for years.
