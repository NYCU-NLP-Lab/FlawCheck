It drew widespread scrutiny as the Trump administration, and Trump himself, have been criticized for failing to follow the guidance of scientists and experts when responding to the pandemic.", "During the rally, Trump said (emphasis added):", "\"If you vote for Biden, he will surrender your jobs to China.
