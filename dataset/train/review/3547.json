["Diabetes is a growing concern for Nigeria, a drug multinational executive said ahead of a recent summit on the chronic disease in Lagos.", "\u201cAbout three years ago South Africa and Ethiopia tended to have more diabetes than Nigeria,\u201d said\u00a0Dr Philip Ikeme, the medical director of the Nigeria, Ghana and eastern African arm of pharmaceutical giant Sanofi. Among Sanofi\u2019s products are the insulin shots used to manage diabetes.", "\u201cNow Nigeria has the highest incidence of diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d (Note: Incidence refers to the number of new cases in a given period, say a month or a year, while prevalence is the total number of people in a population with a disease in a specific time period.)", "\u201cIn terms of actual numbers we are looking at five million people whom we know have diabetes,\u201d Ikeme said, adding that the actual number was \u201cmuch more\u201d.", "Does the data support Ikeme\u2019s claim?", "We examined the numbers.", "\"Nigeria has the highest incidence of diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa.\"", "In support of his claims, Ikeme directed Africa Check to two studies on diabetes in Nigeria. One, a 2008 study, cited WHO estimates that 1.7 million Nigerians were living with diabetes while the other put the number at 4 million in 2014. \u201cI fear the [media] reports may be slightly overrepresented as the publications indicate that about 4 million are suggested to have diabetes and 70%-80% of these remain undiagnosed. The prevalence of known diabetes is suggested at 1.7 million Nigerians.\u201dIkeme specifically spoke of new cases of diabetes in Nigeria (incidence) at the media briefing. But the World Health Organisation\u2019s most recent report on diabetes does not include specific data on new cases in Nigeria or sub-Saharan Africa, saying that data is \u201cgenerally lacking.\u201d There isn\u2019t any such diabetes data from the global health agency or any other source, Dr Gojka Roglic, who is with the WHO\u2019s department for non-communicable diseases, told Africa Check.WHO noted that in 2015, only 17% of countries in sub-Saharan Africa had a diabetes registry.\u201cHowever, no data is available on incidence for any country in Africa, so the claim is unsubstantiated,\u201d Roglic added.", "\"Over five million Nigerians are living with either the type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\"", "The World Health Organisation\u2019s most recent data on Nigeria estimates a prevalence of 4.3% in adults (18 years and older) for the years 1980 to 2014, the health agency\u2019s Dr Gojka Roglic told Africa Check. \u201cGiven that there are about 90 million adults in Nigeria by United Nations 2015 estimates, the number of adults with diabetes comes to around 3.9 million,\u201d he said. The prevalence in Nigerian children isn\u2019t known, but it wouldn\u2019t \"substantially change the total\", Gojka added.According to the International Diabetes Federation, an estimated two thirds of people with diabetes in Africa are undiagnosed. In Nigeria the last nationwide survey on the burden of diabetes was in 1997.\"Because we have poor routine health data collation in Nigeria those [IDF and WHO] estimates are not really reflective of what is happening in the country,\u201d Dr Davies Adeloye, who is with the department of demography and social statistics at the Covenant University in Ogun State told Africa Check. This informed an analysis of 42 studies done on diabetes in Nigeria between 1985 and 2016 in which Adeloye is a co-author. The research, published in October 2017, found that about 4.7 million Nigerians aged between 20 and 79 years had type 2 diabetes. It would thus be correct to say more than five million Nigerians have the two common types of diabetes, said Adeloye.\u201cEven from the IDF and WHO estimate, 80% of that estimate goes for type 2 diabetes. That means there could be an interval of 20% for other types of diabetes,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo if 4.7 million is 80%, and if we want to model, we could say more than 5 million Nigerians are living with diabetes.\"", "Please complete this form to receive the HTML sharing code.", "We examine three claims in a Cape Talk interview with the National Sea Rescue Institute on world drowning prevention day.", "Covid has trained a spotlight on causes of death and how deaths are recorded across the world.
