["By Eugene Kiely and Jessica McDonald", "Posted on October 5, 2020", "Since President Donald Trump announced on Oct. 2 that he had tested positive for COVID-19, White House staff and the president\u2019s physicians have provided confusing and at times contradictory information about the president\u2019s health.", "Trump\u2019s medical team has portrayed his illness as relatively mild and improving, but also has shared details that would suggest the president may be sicker than they have described.", "Here, we share what was said when and highlight instances in which information was not relayed with full accuracy or transparency.", "Evening", "Between 9 and 10 p.m. \u2014 Trump tells Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity: \u201cI\u2019ll get my test back either tonight or tomorrow morning. But, you know, I spend a lot of time with Hope, and so does the first lady,\u201d in confirming that White House counselor Hope Hicks had tested positive. But before the Hannity interview, Trump had tested positive for COVID-19 using a rapid-results test, the Wall Street Journal later reported. He was awaiting the results on a more accurate test.", "Morning", "12:54 a.m. \u2014 In a tweet, the president announces he has tested positive for COVID-19. \u201cTonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!\u201d", "1:06 a.m. \u2014 Shortly after Trump\u2019s announcement, the White House releases\u00a0a memo dated Oct. 1 from the president\u2019s doctor, Navy physician Sean P. Conley. \u201cThis evening I received confirmation that both President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus,\u201d Conley says. He also says, \u201cThe President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.\u201d But those plans changed later in the day.", "Afternoon", "About 1:45 p.m. \u2014 In remarks to reporters, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany says\u00a0the president is \u201chard at work despite the mild symptoms.\u201d", "About 4 p.m \u2014 In a late afternoon memo, Conley provides a second update on the president\u2019s condition and treatment. \u201cAs of this afternoon, the President remains fatigued but in good spirits.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cas a precautionary measure he received a single 8 gram dose of Regeneron\u2019s polyclonal antibody cocktail.\u201d", "\u201cIn addition to the polyclonal antibodies, the President has been taking zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and a daily aspirin,\u201d Conley says. There was no mention of the president receiving supplemental oxygen, which the public did not learn about until Sunday.", "About 5 p.m. \u2014 Trump is taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In a statement, the press secretary describes the president as being in \u201cgood spirits\u201d with \u201cmild symptoms.\u201d McEnany says, \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the President will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.\u201d", "Evening", "11:34 p.m. \u2014 The White House issues\u00a0a third medical update from Conley. In the memo, Conley says that as of \u201cthis evening\u201d Trump is \u201cdoing very well\u201d but he had recommended that the president be moved to Walter Reed \u201cfor further monitoring.\u201d Conley adds, \u201cHe is not requiring any supplemental oxygen, but in consultation with specialists we have elected to initiate Remdesivir therapy. He has completed his first dose and is resting comfortably.\u201d In fact, Trump did receive supplemental oxygen that day.", "Morning", "At a late morning press briefing, Dr. Sean Dooley, a pulmonologist at Walter Reed, says that \u201cthe President this morning is not on oxygen, not having difficulty breathing or walking around the White House Medical Unit upstairs.\u201d Asked if that meant the president did not receive any supplemental oxygen, Conley responds, \u201cHe\u2019s not on oxygen right now.\u201d Pressed again, Conley falsely says, \u201cYesterday and today, he was not on oxygen.\u201d", "As for other medical treatments, Dr. Brian Garibaldi says, \u201cAbout 48 hours ago, the president received a special antibody therapy directed against the coronavirus, and we\u2019re working very closely with the company to monitor him in terms of that outcome. Yesterday evening, he received his first dose of IV remdesivir. And our plan is to continue a five-day treatment course for remdesivir.\u201d Garibaldi\u2019s statement on when the antibody therapy treatment started seems to contradict Conley\u2019s Friday evening memo.", "Conley also causes confusion when he says that Trump was \u201c72 hours into the diagnosis,\u201d raising questions about when Trump was first diagnosed. A reporter asks Conley, \u201cYou said 72 hours. That would put it that Wednesday.\u201d He responds, \u201cSo Thursday afternoon, following the news of a close contact is when we repeated testing. And given clinical indications, I had a little bit more concern. And that\u2019s when, late that night, we got the PCR confirmation that he was.\u201d", "As for the president\u2019s fever, Conley says, \u201cIt\u2019s important to note the president\u2019s been fever free for over 24 hours.\u201d He gives a generally upbeat assessment, describing the president as \u201cdoing great\u201d \u2014 although that would almost immediately be contradicted by a top White House staffer.", "After describing Trump\u2019s vitals in good shape and his blood pressure in particular as \u201cgreat,\u201d Conley is asked why the president had been transferred to the hospital, to which Conley replies, \u201cBecause he\u2019s the president of the United States.\u201d", "Afternoon", "About 12 noon \u2014 In an email sent to reporters, the White House pool reporter traveling with the president passes along a statement that is attributed to \u201ca source familiar with the president\u2019s health\u201d that says: \u201cThe president\u2019s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care. We\u2019re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.\u201d It was later disclosed that the anonymous source was White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.", "About 1:50 p.m. \u2014 The White House releases a statement from Conley that seeks to address the confusion about when the president was diagnosed and when treatment began.", "\u201cThis morning while summarizing the President\u2019s health, I incorrectly used the term \u2018seventy-two hours\u2019 instead of \u2018day three\u2019 and \u2018forty eight hours\u2019 instead of \u2018day two\u2019 with regard to his diagnosis and the administration of the polyclonal antibody therapy,\u201d he says. \u201cThe President was first diagnosed with COVID-19 on the evening of Thursday, October 1st and had received Regeneron\u2019s antibody cocktail on Friday, October 2nd.\u201d", "Evening", "6:51 p.m. \u2014 Trump speaks to the public for the first time since being hospitalized in a four-minute video that he posts on Twitter. \u201cI came here, wasn\u2019t feeling so well. I feel much better now,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to get me all the way back.\u201d", "9:08 p.m. \u2014 The White House releases\u00a0a statement from Conley that says the president had made \u201csubstantial progress.\u201d", "\u201cThis evening he completed his second dose of Remdesivir without complication,\u201d Conley says. \u201cHe remains fever-free and off supplemental oxygen with a saturation level between 96 and 98% all day.\u201d Conley\u2019s statement does not clarify if the president had been on oxygen.", "Morning", "Shortly before noon \u2014 Conley and other doctors treating Trump give a press briefing. Conley says that \u201cthe president has experienced two episodes of transient drops in his oxygen saturation,\u201d indicating Trump\u2019s lungs may be compromised. As a result, the president began to take dexamethasone, a steroid drug.", "Conley also discloses for the first time that the president had received supplemental oxygen on Friday, for about an hour. \u201cLate Friday morning, when I returned to the bedside, president had a high fever and his oxygen saturation was transiently dipping below 94%. Given these two developments, I was concerned for possible rapid progression of the illness,\u201d Conley says. \u201cI recommended the president we try some supplemental oxygen, see how he\u2019d respond.\u201d", "Asked why he failed to disclose earlier that the president had received supplemental oxygen, Conley says: \u201cI was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the president, that his course of illness has had. I didn\u2019t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction and in doing so, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn\u2019t necessarily true.\u201d", "When asked if Trump had received oxygen a second time, Conley suggests that the answer is no, but he isn\u2019t definitive. \u201cI\u2019d have to check with the nursing staff. If he did, it was very, very limited,\u201d he says, emphasizing that Trump was not on oxygen then and the only oxygen that Conley ordered had been on Friday morning.", "The addition of dexamethasone to the president\u2019s regimen is\u00a0particularly\u00a0curious, as the drug is\u00a0not recommended\u00a0for patients who are not on supplemental oxygen.", "The RECOVERY trial in the U.K., which\u00a0established\u00a0the drug had a mortality benefit in hospitalized patients who were ventilated or on supplemental oxygen, did not find a benefit \u2014 and identified\u00a0possible harm\u00a0\u2014 in providing the drug to those who were not on oxygen at the time of randomization.", "This had led\u00a0some\u00a0physicians\u00a0to speculate that Trump\u2019s condition might be worse than what has been shared with the public, or that Trump might be receiving very aggressive treatment, which may not necessarily benefit him.", "Conley also refuses to provide specifics on other information that would get at Trump\u2019s medical condition.", "When asked about what X-rays or CT scans show, and whether there are signs of pneumonia or lung damage, Conley responds vaguely, \u201cWe\u2019re tracking all of that. There\u2019s some expected findings, but nothing of any major clinical concern.\u201d", "\u201cExpected findings,\u201d some doctors say, likely means some signs of lung damage \u2014 or at least enough concern to initiate the dexamethasone. As Vanderbilt University infectious disease expert Dr.\u00a0William Schaffner told\u00a0ABC News, Trump\u2019s oxygen levels and CT scan results are \u201cundoubtedly what targeted physicians\u2019 decision to add dexamethasone.\u201d", "Afternoon", "5:16 p.m. \u2014 Trump posts a short video on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re getting great reports from the doctors,\u201d he says.", "About 5:20 p.m. \u2014 Trump briefly leaves Walter Reed in a presidential motorcade to visit and wave to supporters outside before returning to the hospital. At least two Secret Service members,\u00a0wearing\u00a0what appeared to be N95 masks, were inside the enclosed vehicle with the president, who wore a mask. While the White House\u00a0said\u00a0the trip had been \u201ccleared\u201d by the medical team, some\u00a0experts, including a\u00a0physician\u00a0at Walter Reed, considered the excursion unnecessarily risky for his security detail.", "Afternoon", "2:37 p.m. \u2014 Trump tweets: \u201cI will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6:30 P.M. Feeling really good! Don\u2019t be afraid of Covid. Don\u2019t let it dominate your life. \u2026 I feel better than I did 20 years ago!\u201d", "About 3:10 p.m. \u2014 Conley, the president\u2019s physician, and others on the president\u2019s medical team give an update on Trump\u2019s health and his scheduled return to the White House. \u201cThough he may not entirely be out of the woods yet, the team and I agree that all our evaluations \u2014 and most importantly his clinical status \u2014 support the president\u2019s safe return home,\u201d Conley says.", "Dooley says the president\u2019s temperature on the morning of Oct. 5 was 98.1 degrees. Conley says the president has not received fever reducing medication for the last 72 hours.", "Conley declines to discuss some details, such as the date of the president\u2019s last negative test. Conley also would not share any information on the president\u2019s viral load or possible lung damage. He would only say that the supplemental oxygen wasn\u2019t required and the president wasn\u2019t short of breath when it was administered, which happened twice. \u201cIt was more of us trying to anticipate needs and see how he\u2019d respond,\u201d he says, adding it was given for a short period of time.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
