["Multiple Facebook posts shared hundreds of times claim that a late\u00a0US oil magnate, John D Rockefeller, coined the term \u201cfossil fuels\u201d in order to \u201cinduce the idea of scarcity, allowing for the increase on the price of oil.\u201d The posts go on to claim that hydrocarbons do not come from \u201cfrom fossils, nor from the transformed remains of long dead organisms\u201d. The claims are false; experts credit 18th century German scientist Caspar Neumann for coining the term \u201cfossil fuel\u201d and say they do in fact originate from ancient dead organisms.", "The claims were published by a New Zealand-based Facebook user here. The post has been shared more than 170\u00a0times.", "The post shows an image of an oil rig and a photo of John D. Rockefeller.", "The text superimposed on the image claims fossil fuels \u201cdo not in fact come from fossils, nor from the transformed remains of long dead organisms\u201d.", "The text adds: \u201cThe term 'fossil fuels' was made up in 1892 by John D. Rockefeller, owner of Standard Oil Company, in order to induce the idea of scarcity, allowing for the increase on the price of oil. If everyone knew that oil was self-replenishing at a rate faster than we can use it, and is the second most prevalent liquid on earth next to water, we would not pay the amount we pay for it today.\"", "Similar claims were also\u00a0shared hundreds of other times by other Facebook users, including here, here and here.", "The claims, however, are false, according to experts.", "Fossil fuel origins", "Fossil fuels refer to \u201cany of a class of hydrocarbon-containing materials of biological origin occurring within Earth\u2019s crust that can be used as a source of energy\u201d, according to the Brtiannica Encyclopedia.", "Colloquially, fossil fuels refer\u00a0to coal, crude oil and natural gas, which scientists say\u00a0are major contributors to global warming.", "Fossil fuels are not derived from the\u00a0fossilized\u00a0remains or impressions of prehistoric plants or animals.", "But contrary to the claim\u00a0in the Facebook post, fossil fuels\u00a0do \u201ccome from dead plants and animals buried in sediment,\u201d according to Rupert Sutherland, a geophysics professor at\u00a0Victoria University of Wellington.", "\u201cUnder most circumstances the dead plants and animals are \u2018recycled\u2019 back into the atmosphere, ocean, or biosphere and do not become fossil fuels; but in special cases they are preserved and become \u2018kerogen\u2019,\u201d Sutherland told AFP in an email on November 11.", "\u201cIf buried to sufficient depths this \u2018kerogen\u2019 becomes converted to petroleum and can migrate through the pore spaces,\" he added. \"Certain key times in our geological history account for most of the known petroleum reserves, so they are fossils in the sense that they are derived from plants and animals that are many millions of years old\".", "The American oil magnate John D. Rockefeller is not credited with coining the term \u201cfossil fuels\u201d.", "A University of Queensland Centre for Natural Gas spokesperson told AFP in an email the term was first used by German chemist Caspar Neumann in the English translation of his 1759 book The Chemical Works of Caspar Neumann. The term is noted in the book\u2019s index here.", "The term \u201cwas subsequently used widely in the early 1900s\u201d, the University of Queensland spokesperson added.", "Google NGram results for \"fossil fuels\"\u00a0also show the word being used periodically between 1700 and 1900. Its usage spiked after 1940.", "Dongke Zhang, a chemical engineering professor at the\u00a0University of Western Australia,\u00a0told AFP in an email on November 10 that\u00a0oil and natural gas aren\u2019t replenishing \u201cover one\u2019s lifetime\u201d.", "\u201cThe coal we exploit today was formed from plant matter that once lived some 50 to 600 million years ago and oil and natural gas were also formed some 100 million years ago,\u201d he added.", "Professor Sutherland also said it is unlikely fossil fuels are replenishing faster than they can be used because scientists \"do not see evidence in cores of relatively young sediment with large enough amounts of carbon being preserved\u201d.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
