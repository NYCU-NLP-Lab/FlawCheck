The narrator starts off: \"The Austin newspaper says Congressman Edwards' attacks on Bill Flores are false.\" Just in case viewers miss that declaration on first pass, the narrator continues: \"Edwards is not telling the truth about Bill Flores.\"", "Flores makes nearly the same claim in a radio ad posted on his website: \"The Austin newspaper investigated Edwards' attack ads and found them to be false.\"", "We didn't know we'd done that.", "To date, Edwards has criticized Flores on a number of fronts, including his views on veterans health care, his voting record and his position on earmarks, most of which we haven't dug into.", "In April, we rated an Edwards statement to be True \u2014 that Flores has never voted in a general election in the House district. In September, we gave a False rating to Edwards' claim that an oil company Flores \"helped run laid off over 3,000 workers and then paid off its top executives with millions.\"", "To our inquiry \u2014 what the hey? \u2014 Flores' campaign manager, Matt Mackowiak, counseled against being too picky about the wording of the ads.
