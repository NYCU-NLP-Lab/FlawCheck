["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on June 18, 2020 | Updated on June 19, 2020", "Headlines on social media misleadingly suggest that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi violated a military tradition when she gave a folded flag to the brother of George Floyd. A folded flag is not \u201cReserved Only For Fallen Veterans,\u201d as one headline claims. Members of Congress routinely present flags that have flown over the U.S. Capitol as gifts.", "Philonise Floyd \u2014 the brother of George Floyd, who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis in late May \u2014 testified before the House Judiciary Committee on June 10 during a hearing on police practices and law enforcement accountability.", "During Philonise Floyd\u2019s visit to the Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gifted him a folded, encased U.S. flag \u2014 as a photo posted on her official Facebook and Twitter accounts shows.", "\u201cPhilonise Floyd\u2019s heart-wrenching testimony to the House Judiciary Committee left its mark on us all. May this flag, which flew over the Capitol on the day of his brother\u2019s murder, serve as a symbol of our shared commitment to securing justice for George and all victims of police violence,\u201d her Facebook post said.", "Headlines that circulated on social media in the days after, however, misleadingly suggested that Pelosi\u2019s act trampled on a tradition that reserved the gifting of a folded flag only for military families.", "The conspiracy theory website InfoWars, in a June 15 story that was republished\u00a0by teaparty.org, declared: \u201cPelosi Gifts George Floyd\u2019s Brother Folded American Flag Reserved Only For Fallen Veterans.\u201d", "A headline on NeonNettle.com on June 16 echoed the claim: \u201cPelosi Gifts George Floyd\u2019s Brother Folded American Flag Meant for Fallen Military.\u201d The website later\u00a0corrected\u00a0its story.", "The InfoWars story goes on to claim that \u201c[f]olded American flags are traditionally presented by the U.S. government to families of fallen veterans during military funerals\u201d and cites \u201cspecific criteria necessary to receive a folded American flag\u201d from the U.S. Veterans Affairs website. It claims Floyd\u2019s family \u201cdoes not fall into the listed criteria of eligible recipients.\u201d", "There are indeed criteria for those eligible to receive burial flags from Veterans Affairs; the flags are provided at no cost for the funeral of veterans and typically are given to the next-of-kin as a keepsake afterward.", "But there\u2019s nothing that precludes Pelosi, or any other American citizen, from gifting a flag \u2014 or folding it.", "\u201cThere are no prescriptive rules saying you can\u2019t give a flag to anyone,\u201d said\u00a0Scot Guenter, senior director of the Flag Research Center and professor emeritus of American Studies at San Jose State University. \u201cThe whole point of the American flag is that we don\u2019t live in a society that says you can\u2019t use the flag.\u201d", "Guenter, who wrote the book, \u201cThe American Flag, 1777-1924: Cultural Shifts from Creation to Codification,\u201d also told us in a phone interview that folding a flag is a sign of respect for it.", "There is also no mention in the U.S. \u201cFlag Code,\u201d whose provisions Guenter said are \u201crules of etiquette,\u201d of who is allowed to gift a flag.", "\u201cWhile the Department of Veterans Affairs provides a casket flag for all honorable veterans and the military service provides them for active-duty service members upon their death, the U.S. Flag Code does not prohibit or limit a flag draping the coffin to any specific group,\u201d John Raughter, a spokesman for the American Legion, a veterans association, told us in an email. \u201cTraditionally though, as the flag is provided for veterans and active-duty service members, it has come to represent a veteran funeral rite.\u201d", "Raughter added that \u201cthere is no rule about who may receive a flag as a gift. We encourage the display of the flag of the United States by all citizens of the United States. Now while there is no rule for it, traditionally a flag is folded into a triangle when it is not flown and may be stored in a presentation case if a particular flag has special meaning.\u201d", "\u201cSo presenting someone with a flag, folded into a triangle and placed into a display case is an honorable way of presenting and maintaining the flag of the United States,\u201d he said.", "Flags that are flown over the Capitol \u2014 as was the case with the one given to Philonise Floyd \u2014 are, in fact, routinely requested by the offices of members of Congress through the Capitol Flag Program, which started in the 1930s.", "The program, under the Architect of the Capitol, allows members of the public to purchase such flags through House and Senate offices; many members of Congress have instructions on their websites for ordering a flag for any occasion. The Architect of the Capitol \u201cfulfills on average more than 100,000 flag requests from Members of Congress annually, with the number of requests and the popularity of the Capitol Flag Program growing steadily each year,\u201d according to the program\u2019s website.", "And, according to the House Members\u2019 Congressional Handbook, members can use such flags as official gifts.", "\u201cU.S. flags flown over the Capitol for official presentation as a gift, including the flag flying fee, are reimbursable,\u201d the handbook says. \u201cSuch flags must be for the personal use of or display by the recipient (examples may include, but are not limited to: flags presented at a building dedication for which the Member secured official funding, a flag presented to the family of a fallen soldier, flags presented for exceptional public distinction, etc,).\u201d", "So nothing in the handbook, either, limits members\u2019 gifting of flags flown over the Capitol only to military families.", "In December 2016, former Rep. Dennis Ross, a Republican from Florida, gave a folded, framed flag that had flown over the Capitol to a new school in Davenport, Florida. And the next year, Republican Rep. Roger Williams of Texas gifted two folded, encased flags from the Capitol to two new schools in his district.", "Update, June 19: We updated this article to reflect that NeonNettle.com\u00a0has\u00a0corrected its story.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
