In simplest terms, there are two\u00a0schools of thought, one holding that the Second Amendment protects a collective right for the purpose of providing for the common defense (emphasis on the \"well-regulated militia\" clause), and the other holding that it protects an individual right irrespective of any such collective purpose.", "One finds both readings anticipated in individual state constitutions adopted prior to the ratification of the Second Amendment. While North Carolina's\u00a01776\u00a0constitution limited the purpose of the right to bear arms to defending the state, for example (\"...the people have a right to bear arms, for the defense of the state\"), as did the Massachusetts constitution of\u00a01780\u00a0(\"The people have a right to keep and bear arms for the common defense\"), the 1776\u00a0and\u00a01777\u00a0constitutions of Pennsylvania and Vermont specified that \"...the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the state.\"", "Historically, the U.S. Supreme Court has swung both ways in interpreting the Second Amendment, favoring the \"common defense\" reading for the better part of the twentieth century before veering sharply to an individual \"self-defense\" interpretation with its landmark District of Columbia v. Heller\u00a0decision of 2008.", "Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's majority opinion in that decision, which overturned a law prohibiting handgun possession in Washington, D.C., hinged mainly on a careful parsing of the language of the amendment that reveals, Scalia argued, an intent on the part of the framers to protect an individual right completely independent of the militia clause. Interestingly, however, he went on to make the tangential case that, anyway, the framers understood \"militia\" to mean a \"people's militia\" made up of private citizens whose right to bear arms could not be abrogated by their own government, thus providing a \"safeguard against tyranny\":", "It was understood across the political spectrum that the right helped to secure the ideal of a citizen militia, which might be necessary to oppose an oppressive military force if the constitutional order broke down.", "It is therefore entirely sensible that the Second Amendment's prefatory clause announces the purpose for which the right was codified: to prevent elimination of the militia. The prefatory clause does not suggest that preserving the militia was the only reason Americans valued the ancient right; most undoubtedly thought it even more important for self-defense and hunting. But the threat that the new Federal Government would destroy the citizens' militia by taking away their arms was the reason that right \u2014 unlike some other English rights \u2014 was codified in a written Constitution.", "The dissenting justices in the case (the more liberal contingent: Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer) argued that the established interpretation of the Second Amendment upheld by previous Supreme Courts (namely that the \"well-regulated militia\" clause was meant to restrict the scope of the protected right to a collective, not an individual one) ought to stand, with Breyer adding that even granting an individual-right interpretation of the amendment, restrictions such as handgun bans and trigger-lock requirements would still be constitutional.", "In any case, the\u00a0Heller decision was music to the ears of pro-firearms groups such as the National Rifle Association (NRA), and not just because it went in their favor. For decades, the premise that private gun ownership is synonymous with freedom and resisting tyranny had been a cornerstone of the NRA's lobbying and recruitment efforts. For example, a full-page newspaper ad for the group in 1989 read:", "America's founding fathers understood that an armed people are a free people. Free to rise up against tyranny. That's why the individual armed citizen remains one of democracy's strongest symbols.", "It's but a short step from there to the more extreme assertion that any effort to restrict the right to bear arms is itself a prelude to (if not an instance of) tyranny\u00a0\u2014 which is in fact the tack taken in the Internet text before us. Relying on absolutist language that does not distinguish between regulation and confiscation, the text trumpets the conclusion that 56 million people were rounded up and exterminated during the twentieth century \"because of gun control.\"", "Tempting as it is to dismiss that kind of language as mere rhetoric, bear in mind that a sizable portion of the American public buys into the \"slippery slope\" mentality that undergirds it, with 52 percent of Republican Party voters agreeing in a 2015 public opinion\u00a0poll, for example, that it is somewhat-to-very likely that \"stricter gun laws will eventually lead to the federal government trying to take away guns from Americans who legally own them.\" This is the text's target audience.", "The term \"gun control\" is not, in fact, synonymous with \"gun confiscation,\" \"gun prohibition,\" or \"gun registration\" (although gun control can take any of those forms). Nor is the \"gun control debate\"\u00a0about whether or not gun control laws ought to exist in the United States at all \u2014 they already do on both the federal and state levels, because the right to bear arms must be balanced against the safety and well-being of the populace as a whole. In practical terms, gun control boils down to addressing issues such as how to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of criminals and the mentally deranged, how to regulate their manufacture and sale, and what types of firearms and ammunition are appropriate for private citizens to own and use.", "Besides leaving the term undefined and implying it means taking away people's weapons, the text fallaciously asserts a causal link between \"gun control\" and mass exterminations. The argument fails to take into account other determining factors \u2014 most notably, what sorts of political regimes committed all these atrocities (hint: they weren't democracies). It also fails to take into account counter-examples of\u00a0nations\u00a0(including the United States) with longstanding gun control laws on the books where no mass exterminations have occurred. Consider, too, that, in several of the cited instances the gun control laws in effect when the genocides took place were enacted years or even decades earlier.", "It's further implied that unrestricted private gun ownership would have prevented the genocides from occurring. Although a greater availability of weapons would have put targeted populations in a better position to defend themselves, however, it's not a given that they would have prevailed over the better-equipped, better-trained government forces sent to annihilate them.", "As best we can determine, most of the facts and figures cited in the text are very loosely based on research published in two (now out-of-print) books,\u00a0Death by 'Gun Control'\u00a0by Aaron Zelman and Richard W.

From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\"", "The time period cited, 1929 to 1953, roughly coincides with dictatorship of Joseph Stalin, whose regime was responsible for the deaths of many millions of people, though historians disagree on the total. For a long time, 20 million was the generally accepted number, but since the fall of the Soviet Union more documentation has become available.", "\"Exact numbers may never be known with complete certainty, but the total of deaths caused by the whole range of the Soviet regime's terrors can hardly be lower than some 15 million,\"\u00a0wrote\u00a0historian Robert Conquest in his 2008 book\u00a0The Great Terror: A Reassessment, to cite one example. In 2011, Yale historian Timothy Snyder cited a significantly lower number, 6 million, as \"the total figure of civilians deliberately killed under Stalinism.\" Either way, it's not strictly accurate to say that all of Stalin's victims were \"rounded up and exterminated.\" More than 3 million died of forced starvation.", "Gun control regulations, including a requirement to register all weapons with the government, were in force during that period.\u00a0\"Policemen were responsible for gun control,\" writes Katherine Bliss Eaton in Daily Life in the Soviet Union (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004):", "Private citizens and institutions could own hunting weapons if they had police permission and registered their guns at the local station house. The militia could confiscate weapons and ammunition from people who showed signs of dangerously irresponsible behavior.", "Large-scale gun confiscations were aimed at subpopulations deemed to be subversive or dissident. For example, Robert Conquest reports in\u00a0The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine (Oxford University Press, 1987) that rural peasants were disarmed en masse for purposes of enforcing the social policy of \"agricultural collectivization,\" which the peasants resisted:", "In 1929-30 a great effort had been made to prevent the peasantry possessing arms. Registration of hunting weapons had become compulsory in decrees of 1926, 1928, and 1929, and rules were also established to ensure that \"criminal and socially dangerous elements\" should not be sold guns, this to be \"checked by the GPU [Soviet secret police] authorities.\" In August 1930, when various minor insurrections and individual acts of resistance had made it clear that this was not being obeyed, a massive arms search was ordered. By this time, however, few arms were left.", "Gun registration and targeted confiscations therefore played an essential role in Stalin's genocidal activities.", "Claim: \"In 1911, Turkey established gun control.

After suffering military losses early on in that war, the government blamed the Armenians, whom they accused of treachery and subversion, and on that pretext embarked on a program of disarming and eradicating the Armenian population as a whole.", "New York Times foreign correspondent John Kifner wrote:", "The Young Turks, who called themselves the Committee of Unity and Progress, launched a set of measures against the Armenians, including a law authorizing the military and government to deport anyone they \"sensed\" was a security threat.", "A later law allowed the confiscation of abandoned Armenian property. Armenians were ordered to turn in any weapons that they owned to the authorities. Those in the army were disarmed and transferred into labor battalions where they were either killed or worked to death.", "There were executions into mass graves, and death marches of men, women and children across the Syrian desert to concentration camps with many dying along the way of exhaustion, exposure and starvation.", "The Armenians had been officially prohibited from owning firearms for hundreds of years in the Ottoman Empire; what weapons they did have were confiscated in the interests of eradicating that part of the population.", "Claim: \"Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated.\"", "This is misleading. Jews were prohibited from owning guns and disarmed. Overall, however, gun control laws passed by the Nazis in 1938 actually\u00a0loosened firearms restrictions that had been in force since the end of World War I.", "Gun ownership was banned outright for all German citizens in 1919. A 1928 revision of the law lifted the ban, while still requiring individuals to obtain permits to own, sell, carry, or manufacture firearms. According to Stephen Halbrook, author of\u00a0Gun Control in the Third Reich: Disarming the Jews and 'Enemies of the State' (Independence Institute, 2013), the Nazis used the extant law when they came to power in 1933 to revoke the permits of communists, Jews, and other \"undesirables,\" and disarm them.\u00a0The first gun law actually enacted under Nazi rule, the German Weapons Act of 1938, eased some of the permit requirements (those on rifles and ammunition, though not on handguns), and lowered the legal age for the possession of firearms, but also forbade Jews, specifically, from manufacturing or selling arms.", "The Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons, enacted later that year, prohibited Jews from possessing or carrying any kind of weapon at all.", "So, while the Nazis ultimately favored loosening gun restrictions on the German population as a whole, the disarmament of Jews and other targeted minority populations was an essential feature of Hitler's genocidal program, which included the murder of six million Jews (and millions of others deemed unworthy to live under the Third Reich) between 1938 and the end of World War II.", "Claim: \"China established gun control in 1935.

Other sources place the death toll at closer to one million.", "The claim that China \"established gun control in 1935\" appears to have been plucked from mid-air. According to Lethal Laws, a 1912 law made it illegal to possess or import rifles, cannons, or explosives without a permit.\u00a0The Security Administration Punishment Act of 1957 took the additional step of making it illegal to make, purchase, or possess firearms or ammunition without the government's permission\u00a0\u2014 though by that time at least a million \"class enemies\" had already died in the name of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution.", "Claim: \"Guatemala established gun control in 1964.

It should be noted, however, Guatemala's stringent gun control laws, which required expensive, hard-to-obtain permits for carrying firearms, predated the 1960s by some forty years. For the most part it would have been unnecessary for the government to confiscate weapons from their intended victims, however, given that (as Kopel points out) firearms were too costly for Mayan peasants to obtain in the first place.", "Claim: \"Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\"", "Ugandan dictator Idi Amin is indeed considered responsible for the massacre of at least 300,000 civilians in his own country, most of them members of Christian tribes loyal to his predecessor, Milton Obote. Rather than being rounded up for extermination, Amin's victims were typically murdered on the spot by roving bands of soldiers.", "Before Obote, Uganda's gun control laws (dating from 1955) allowed the private ownership of weapons by permit only, and applicants were required to prove their \"fitness\" to carry firearms. Obote's government rewrote the law in 1969, instituting a total, nationwide ban on the ownership and possession of weapons except for government officials and individuals who were granted special exemptions. Kopel reports\u00a0that the law changed again in 1970, under Amin, essentially reverting to a version of the 1955 law requiring permits and proof of fitness for gun ownership, but by that time, presumably, a large percentage of the guns in private hands had already been confiscated.", "Claim: \"Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million educated people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\"", "The actual estimates are that between 1.5 and 3 million Cambodians, including about a half-million members of ethnic minority groups, were slaughtered by the communist Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979. Although the dictatorship enacted no gun laws itself, there were gun control measures on the books dating from 1920 and 1938 that required the licensing of firearms and limited their ownership to hunters.", "According to the Small Arms Survey of the\u00a0Graduate Institute of International Studies, the Khmer Rouge went about\u00a0disarming the Cambodian public\u00a0\u2014 and arming itself\u00a0\u2014 via a program of gun confiscation:", "The Khmer Rouge regime eliminated the previous elite, and in the process effectively ended private gun ownership. Memoirs of the time provide accounts of how Khmer Rouge cadres confiscated firearms along with watches, motorbikes, and foreign currencies during the first days of the takeover of power in Phnom Penh (Simkin and Rice, 1994, supra note 2, p. 306; referred to in Kopel,1995).", "During the rule of the Khmer Rouge, all private firearms were moved from private ownership into the stockpiles of the regime.", "Claim: \"Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century because of gun control: 56 million.\"", "This simply isn't true, and not just because historians still quibble over the exact numbers of those killed. Tens of millions of people became victims of genocide in the twentieth century because they were members of groups targeted for eradication for reasons of ethnicity, religion, or ideology by ruthless military dictatorships. More often than not, these massacres were preceded by (or concurrent with) concerted efforts to disarm the targeted populations, a task obviously made easier by the existence of gun registration requirements. But to say those millions died because of gun control is an abuse of the facts and logic.", "Claim: \"It has now been 12 months since gun owners in Australia were forced by new law to surrender 640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed by their own Government, a program costing Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars. ...\u00a0Australia-wide, homicides are up 3.2 percent.\u00a0Australia-wide, assaults are up 8.6 percent.
