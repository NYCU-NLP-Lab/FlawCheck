His attacks come despite a U.S. intelligence bulletin issued to law enforcement agencies on Sept. 3 warning that Russia wants \u201cto undermine public trust in the electoral process\u201d by \u201camplifying criticisms of vote-by-mail,\u201d as first reported by ABC News.", "At a Sept. 17 hearing, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that \u201cthe steady drumbeat of misinformation \u2026 will contribute over time to a lack of confidence of American voters and citizens in the validity of their vote.\u201d", "Here we recap the many stories we have done this year on the president\u2019s false, misleading and unsupported statements about the potential for voter fraud.", "We also reviewed his statements about mail-in ballots this month and found he has been repeatedly spreading misinformation in particular about foreign governments making up \u201ccounterfeit ballots\u201d and Democrats sending out \u201cunsolicited ballots\u201d to rig the election. He also has been repeatedly spreading false information about Nevada, saying he will \u201cwin this state easily,\u201d if not for mail-in ballots \u2014 even though Trump lost Nevada in 2016 and is trailing in the polls there again this election.", "In June, we wrote about Trump\u2019s unfounded\u00a0claim\u00a0that \u201cMILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES,\u201d resulting in a \u201cRIGGED\u201d election.", "At the time, experts told us there are numerous logistical hurdles, such as reproducing ballots in multiple jurisdictions, and security safeguards, such as bar codes and signature checks, that would prevent a foreign government from slipping large numbers of fraudulent ballots past election officials.
