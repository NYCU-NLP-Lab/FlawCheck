["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on April 27, 2018", "West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, voted for Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention in 2016. He voted for Trump in the Electoral College, too.", "Still, a TV ad attacking Morrisey falsely says that he \u201cbetrayed Donald Trump,\u201d \u201cdenying\u201d West Virginians \u201cour choice for president,\u201d and \u201crefused to support Trump over Hillary.\u201d", "Morrisey has admitted that Trump was not his first choice to be the Republican nominee for president. He also went into the convention as one of three delegates from West Virginia who were not committed to any of the Republican candidates. In the end, Morrisey cast his vote for Trump to be the nominee, as did the rest of the state\u2019s delegation.", "Also, contrary to what the ad claims, Morrisey did back Trump in the general election against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. In at least one radio interview, he said he was \u201cvery comfortable\u201d choosing Trump \u201cbecause I think Hillary Clinton would mean bad things for the country, disastrous things for West Virginia.\u201d", "The 15-second attack ad is sponsored by the U.S. Senate campaign of Rep. Evan Jenkins. He and Morrisey are competing against four other Republicans in the May 8 primary. The victor will face the winner of the Democratic primary, where Paula Jean Swearengin is challenging incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin.", "The ad\u2019s narrator starts by saying \u201cPat Morrisey betrayed Donald Trump, scheming against Trump\u2019s campaign in West Virginia\u201d and \u201cdenying our choice for president.\u201d", "A graphic shown on the screen says this about Morrisey: \u201cSaid he would not \u2026 support the Republican \u2026 candidate who gets the most votes.\u201d That\u2019s attributed to an April 14, 2016, article by West Virginia\u2019s MetroNews.", "The quote is not accurate, though. What the article really said was: \u201cIf elected, Morrisey said he \u2014 as a delegate \u2014 would not necessarily support the Republican presidential candidate who gets the most votes in West Virginia automatically.\u201d", "The MetroNews then quoted Morrisey saying that both Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, who also competed for the GOP nomination, had messages that appealed to voters in West Virginia.", "And the same article noted that Morrisey said: \u201cWhen you run unaffiliated, you have the ability to make a seasoned judgment choice. \u2026 But I certainly care deeply about how West Virginians think about these issues.\u201d", "Those statements were all made before Trump won West Virginia\u2019s GOP primary on May 10, 2016, with 77 percent of the vote.", "The Jenkins campaign has emphasized that Morrisey neglected to publicly support Trump by name before casting his vote at the convention in July 2016.", "\u201cMorrisey repeatedly and explicitly reiterated that if elected as an RNC delegate, he would make his own \u2018judgment choice\u2019 about whom to vote for at the convention, rather than vote for the candidate who won West Virginia\u2019s primary,\u201d Jenkins spokesman Andre Ser\u00e9 wrote in an email to FactCheck.org.", "\u201cHe said this as late as mid-April when Trump was considered a shoo-in to win West Virginia\u2019s primary,\u201d\u00a0Ser\u00e9 said. \u201cThis was a clear denial of the will of WV primary voters.\u201d", "Morrisey may not have pledged his support to Trump before the convention, but he cast his vote for him to be the nominee nonetheless. That means that West Virginia Republicans weren\u2019t denied their choice.", "The ad is also wrong when it says \u201cMorrisey refused to support Trump over Hillary.\u201d", "Graphics that appear on screen say that \u201cMorrisey chose not to endorse Trump,\u201d and \u201copposed Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201d But neither quote refers to the general election.", "The first quote is attributed to a March 5, 2017, Washington Examiner article that refers to the primary election, and the second quote comes from a \u201cfact check\u201d on a website paid for by the campaign of former coal executive Don Blakenship, who is also running against Morrisey and Jenkins in West Virginia\u2019s Republican Senate primary. The post on that site claims that Morrisey \u201copposed Trump\u2019s candidacy\u201d because he \u201crefused to endorse Trump\u201d during the run-up to the GOP convention.", "In addition, the ad\u2019s image of Morrisey and Clinton seemingly shaking hands appears to be a fake. We couldn\u2019t find it by doing an internet search, and Ser\u00e9, the Jenkins campaign spokesman, said that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t confirm the original sources\u201d of the image, either.", "\u201c[J]ust as Morrisey\u2019s campaign and his super PAC do in each of their ads portraying Evan with Hillary, Obama, Pelosi, etc., we sometimes take creative license while arranging images in order to help make a substantive point,\u201d he admitted. The Morrisey campaign has used side-by-side images of high-profile Democrats and Jenkins in digital ads.", "But the reality is that Morrisey said prior to Election Day that he was committed to supporting Trump against Clinton.", "At the start of the Republican convention, a July 17, 2017, article in The Journal of Martinsburg, West Virginia, quoted Morrisey saying: \u201cI intend to support the nominee, because electing Hillary Clinton would be devastating for West Virginia. I look forward to supporting the team to defeat Hillary Clinton in November.\u201d", "And on the next-to-last day of the convention, a July 20, 2016, MetroNews article quoted Morrisey saying that he would back Trump over Clinton and could not understand \u201chow any public official in West Virginia can strongly get behind Hillary Clinton if they care about the West Virginia economy.\u201d", "\u201c[Trump] was not my first choice in the primary,\u201d Morrisey told MetroNews. \u201cBut I am very comfortable with that choice between Hillary Clinton and Trump because I think Hillary Clinton would mean bad things for the country, disastrous things for West Virginia.\u201d", "Furthermore, Morrisey told the Associated Press in December 2016 that he voted for Trump in the general election. He was also one of West Virginia\u2019s five electors who voted for Trump in the Electoral College, as well.", "As Morrisey said, Trump was not his first choice in the Republican presidential primary \u2014 so Jenkins is fair to pursue that line of attack. But it\u2019s inaccurate to say that Morrisey\u00a0\u201crefused to support Trump over Hillary.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
