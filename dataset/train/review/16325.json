Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, was one of several Texas Republicans casting blame for the state's blackouts this month as millions of Texans huddled in their frigid homes.", "As with\u00a0many other Republicans and conservative pundits, Crenshaw pointed his finger at wind energy as the primary culprit. But in a Feb. 16 tweet thread, Crenshaw expanded criticism beyond frozen wind turbines to include the federal subsidies for the wind industry\u00a0and \"force the grid to rely in part on wind as a power source.\"", "\"Why don\u2019t we have extra gas power when we need it most?\" Crenshaw tweeted. \"Because years of federal subsidies for wind has caused an over reliance on wind and an under-investment in new gas and nuclear plants.\"", "\"Subsidizing investment in wind has pushed gas and nuclear out,\" he said.", "There\u2019s no doubt that wind energy now plays a major role in supplying Texas and the U.S.\u00a0with power. In Texas, wind has grown from supplying 11% of\u00a0the state\u2019s\u00a0energy demand to 23% over the last five years. It\u00a0is now the state\u2019s second-largest energy resource after natural gas.", "In the U.S., wind accounted for 7% of all energy generation and\u00a0was the nation's fourth-largest energy resource in 2019 after natural gas, coal and nuclear, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.", "It\u2019s accurate to say\u00a0that renewable energy subsidies over the last two decades have stoked investments in wind energy,\u00a0said\u00a0Bernadette Johnson, an energy economist with\u00a0Enverus.", "\"Those underpin every major renewable investment in the country,\" Johnson said.", "But is it true that gas and nuclear energy sources across the U.S. have been \"pushed\"\u00a0out, and that\u00a0federal\u00a0wind\u00a0subsidies\u00a0are to blame?", "For nearly 200 years, federal subsidies have supported\u00a0energy generation and infrastructure for\u00a0all resources, according to a 2018\u00a0report from the University of Texas Energy Institute. For instance,\u00a0in the 1800s\u00a0the\u00a0federal government leased timber stands and coal deposits\u00a0to energy companies at generously low rates. In the 20th\u00a0century,\u00a0various\u00a0tax policies sought to\u00a0promote domestic oil and gas production. And in the 1950s,\u00a0former President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s\u00a0Atoms for Peace program funneled billions of dollars into nuclear\u00a0energy\u00a0development.", "Before the turn of the century, fossil fuel industries\u00a0accounted for up to 70% of the total cost of energy tax\u00a0breaks.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t until around 2008 that renewable energy sources became the primary benefactor of federal support.", "\"Where once the government targeted energy production generally,\u00a0it has shifted its spending focus towards cleaner, lower-carbon sources,\" Energy Institute researchers wrote.", "Generally, subsidies\u00a0are defined as\u00a0direct payments\u00a0from the government\u00a0to energy producers\u00a0and\u00a0measures like\u00a0tax abatements.", "The most popular subsidy program from which wind energy producers benefit is the production tax credit, which was initially introduced in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.\u00a0Production tax credits reduce a wind producer\u2019s tax burden by\u00a0a certain amount\u00a0for every megawatt-hour of energy produced. In 2016, compensation was set at $23 per megawatt hour, although that amount ratchets down over a 10-year period.", "Wind energy producers also benefited\u00a0from another federal program\u00a0that reimbursed developers 30% of their capital costs in lieu of a tax credit.\u00a0Known as Section 1603 cash grants, the program was introduced in 2009\u00a0and distributed $25.7 billion to\u00a0green energy\u00a0projects before it expired\u00a0three years later.", "Between 2010 and 2013, Energy Institute researchers found that\u00a0federal\u00a0wind energy subsidies jumped from $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion\u00a0annually\u00a0thanks\u00a0to the Section 1603 grants. Following\u00a0the program's expiration, however, federal wind subsidies dropped to $2.7 billion in 2016\u00a0then were projected to climb back up to $4.6 billion by 2019.", "Meanwhile, hydrocarbon-based energy producers, mostly including natural gas, also\u00a0have\u00a0enjoyed their share of\u00a0federal\u00a0subsidies\u00a0\u2014 from $3.1 billion in 2010 to a projected $6.2 billion in 2019, mostly through production tax abatements.\u00a0Subsidies for nuclear sources over the last decade have remained relatively steady at around $1.3 billion\u00a0annually.", "The amount of energy produced by\u00a0wind and natural gas\u00a0sources across the country\u00a0have both\u00a0increased.\u00a0Energy produced by wind turbines has tripled over the last decade, while the energy produced by natural gas-fired plants\u00a0has increased by 60%\u00a0over the same period,\u00a0according to federal data.", "Nuclear energy, on the other hand, has remained relatively steady\u00a0over the last\u00a010 years\u00a0at around 800,000 megawatts\u00a0per year.", "Nuclear technology\u00a0hasn\u2019t attracted significant investment in years, since before wind power gained a foothold in the energy market.", "According to federal data,\u00a0no\u00a0new nuclear generation units have been added in the last two decades\u00a0\u2014 hence\u00a0nuclear\u00a0energy\u2019s\u00a0relatively\u00a0flat\u00a0generation output since 2001.\u00a0Eight nuclear generation units have been retired since 2013, federal data shows.", "But\u00a0nuclear\u2019s\u00a0flattened\u00a0investment\u00a0curve\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0primarily\u00a0due to\u00a0the growing prevalence of\u00a0renewable technologies.\u00a0Rather, a 2017 U.S. Department of Energy Staff Report issued under former Secretary Rick Perry lists\u00a0cheap\u00a0natural gas\u00a0as the\u00a0\"biggest contributor\"\u00a0to nuclear\u00a0and coal\u00a0plant\u00a0retirements.", "\"Production costs of coal and nuclear plants remained somewhat flat, while\u00a0the new and existing, more flexible, and relatively lower-operating cost natural gas plants drove\u00a0down wholesale market prices to the point that some formerly profitable nuclear and coal\u00a0facilities began operating at a loss,\" the 2017 report says.", "The\u00a0\"lower variable operating\u00a0costs\"\u00a0of renewable resources\u00a0is listed as one of\u00a0three other\u00a0factors\u00a0adding pressure to\u00a0the\u00a0nuclear energy sector.
