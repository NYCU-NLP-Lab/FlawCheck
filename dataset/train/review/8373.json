As a solution, writers began using \"uu\" (or \"vv\" as u and v referred to the same character in the classical Latin alphabet) to represent the sound /w/. The character we now know as \"W\" did not see widespread use until the 1500s, well after Latin-speaking humans were creating new words in that language.", "All of this is to say that \"krowemoh\" is not a word and it certainly does not mean \"child abuse\" in Latin or any other language we are aware of.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
