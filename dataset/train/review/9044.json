["By D'Angelo Gore, Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson and Robert Farley", "Posted on March 25, 2021", "In his first press conference since being inaugurated 64 days ago, President Joe Biden got some facts wrong:", "Biden took questions from reporters on March 25.", "Biden falsely claimed that his predecessor \u201celiminated\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t use\u201d more than $700 million in funding to address migration from Central American countries that Biden helped secure when he was vice president.", "\u201cThey\u2019re coming because of the circumstances in country, in country,\u201d Biden said of the thousands of people who are illegally entering the U.S. through Mexico. \u201cThe way to deal with this problem, and I started to deal with it back when I was \u2026 vice president, putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to do the root causes of why people are leaving. What did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn\u2019t use it. He didn\u2019t do it.\u201d", "Biden appeared to be referring to funding for the \u201cU.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America,\u201d which was as high as $750 million during the Obama administration in fiscal year 2016.", "It\u2019s true that the annual budget for that initiative declined significantly during Trump\u2019s presidency, but it wasn\u2019t completely \u201celiminated\u201d or unspent, as Biden said.\u00a0According to\u00a0the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, appropriations for the program declined to $685 million in FY 2017, $615 million in FY 2018, $528 million in FY 2019, $533 million in FY 2020 and $506 million in FY 2021.", "Biden may have been referencing money that Congress authorized for use in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador that the Trump administration either reallocated to other initiatives or temporarily suspended in 2019.", "As a\u00a0January CRS report\u00a0said: \u201cFrom FY2016 to FY2020, Congress appropriated more than $3.1 billion to improve security, governance, and socioeconomic conditions in Central America as part of a whole-of-government initiative to address the drivers of irregular migration. However, in March 2019 \u2014 less than two years into the initiative\u2019s on-the-ground implementation \u2014 the Trump Administration suspended most foreign aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The Administration proceeded to reprogram approximately $396 million of aid appropriated for the Northern Triangle countries in FY2018, reallocating the funds to other foreign policy priorities within, and outside of, the Latin American and Caribbean region.\u201d", "The report indicated that the Trump administration \u201cwithheld most of the assistance Congress appropriated for Central America in FY2019 while it negotiated a series of agreements intended to stem the flow of migrants and asylum-seekers from the Northern Triangle to the United States.\u201d As a result, the report said, the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development were forced to close down or cancel some projects and planned activities.", "But CRS also said that \u2014 amid criticism from members of Congress who argued the funding freeze was counterproductive \u2014 aid to the Northern Triangle countries that was previously held back began to be released late in 2019, and \u201call of the previously suspended assistance for the region\u201d had been \u201cprogrammed\u201d by June 2020.", "Biden used the wrong statistics when saying that \u201cnothing has changed\u201d regarding \u201cchildren\u201d trying to enter the U.S. at the southern border. To be sure, there have been spikes before in unaccompanied children arriving at the border, but the uptick in Biden\u2019s first full month in office was significant.", "Biden:\u00a0Truth of the matter is nothing has changed. As many people came, 28% increase in children to the border in my administration. 31% in the last year of \u2013 in 2019, before the pandemic, in the Trump administration. It happens every single solitary year. There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March.", "Biden\u2019s figures don\u2019t pertain to an \u201cincrease in children to the border,\u201d as he said. Instead, they pertain to the total number of apprehensions at the border \u2014 including single adults and family units. Those figures were cited in a Washington Post opinion piece by immigration experts who, similar to the president, said the rise in total apprehensions reflected \u201ca pattern of seasonal changes,\u201d in which immigrant apprehensions increase in the cooler months of the year.", "We get slightly different figures using Customs and Border Protection data. There was a 29% increase in total apprehensions from January to February, when the level reached 96,974. In 2019, the January-to-February bump was 39%.", "As we\u2019ve written, the recent increase in border apprehensions did begin prior to the election under then-President Donald Trump. But the spike in unaccompanied children in the first full month of Biden\u2019s administration is noteworthy \u2014 and, with a backlog of processing those children out of border custody facilities, it\u2019s the main aspect of border immigration that has garnered media and political attention.", "The number of unaccompanied children being apprehended at the border also began rising in October, before the election, but it spiked 63% from January to February, reaching 9,297 kids.", "The Washington Post opinion piece noted that the apprehensions of unaccompanied children \u201cappears to be more than just a seasonal pattern.\u201d", "CBP data show the fiscal year 2021 numbers of unaccompanied children apprehended are on track to rival or surpass a spike that occurred in 2019.", "The president went on to say the \u201cvast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back,\u201d mentioning \u201csingle people.\u201d That\u2019s correct. But then he added, \u201cWe\u2019re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming.\u201d That\u2019s not the case for the month of February, the most recent data from CBP.", "The administration expelled 41% of family units in February. (See the figures for Title 42 expulsions.)", "Single adults, who make up the vast majority of those apprehended on the border, have been largely expelled under Title 42, a public health law.", "We asked the White House about Biden\u2019s claim, but we haven\u2019t received a response.", "When told Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Biden has gone too far left, the president responded by saying \u201cover 50%\u201d of Republican voters supported the American Rescue Plan Act.", "But public polling offers a more mixed reaction among Republicans to the new law than the president lets on.", "Biden:\u00a0I would like Republican, elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is, I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I\u2019m doing. And so unless Mitch says the last thing I did, the last piece of legislation I did was so far left, well, then he ought to take a look at his party. Over 50% of them must be over that edge, as well because they support what I did.", "This has become a talking point for the president. He stated\u00a0something similar\u00a0on March 19, when he said \u201cwe didn\u2019t get any help in the Senate or the House, but you have 55% of the Republicans in America supporting it,\u201d referring to the COVID-19 relief bill.", "For sure, there are polls that show more than 50% of Republicans supported the bill earlier this month when it was before Congress.", "A\u00a0Morning Consult/Politico poll\u00a0conducted from March 6 to March 8 found 59% of Republicans surveyed said they \u201cstrongly support\u201d (29%) or \u201csomewhat support\u201d (30%) the COVID-19 aid package.", "Similarly, a\u00a0Data for Progress\u00a0poll conducted from March 5 to 7 found 54% of Republicans supported the bill.", "However, other polls found Republican support below 50% \u2014 not \u201cover 50%,\u201d as Biden said.", "A\u00a0CNN poll\u00a0from March 3 to 8 found only 26% of Republicans supported the bill (see Table 031).", "A\u00a0Pew Research Center survey\u00a0from March 1 to 7 found that 41% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they supported the bill. That poll showed a pronounced partisan divide in particular on the cost of the legislation \u2014 which was the primary reason for Republican opposition in Congress.", "Sixty-one percent of Republicans told Pew that the $1.9 trillion bill, which Biden\u00a0signed\u00a0into law on March 11, spends too much.", "Lastly, we found a\u00a0CBS News/YouGov poll\u00a0taken from March 9 to 10 found 46% of Republicans supported the American Rescue Plan Act. \u201cAmong Republicans, there is more support for it among those with lower household incomes than among those with higher incomes,\u201d CBS News wrote.", "Comparing his tax priorities to those of Republicans, Biden\u00a0revived\u00a0two talking points from the campaign: the misleading claim that 83% of the tax cuts in the Republican tax law championed by Trump went to the top 1%; and the false claim that middle-income families pay a higher tax rate than \u201cthe average person making $1 billion a year.\u201d", "Biden said he found it \u201ckind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried\u201d about \u201cthe cost\u201d of tax cuts and relief checks in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act. The law, he said, \u201cputs money in people\u2019s pockets. Ordinary people.\u201d", "The law provides an average tax cut to middle-income earners of $3,720 this year, according to\u00a0an analysis\u00a0by the Tax Policy Center. The law also includes stimulus payments for most Americans, and extends unemployment compensation.", "Biden said he didn\u2019t remember hearing Republicans express similar concerns about the cost of the Republican-backed\u00a0Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is\u00a0projected\u00a0to add nearly $2 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.", "\u201cDid you hear them complain when they passed a close to $2 trillion Trump tax cut, 83% going to the top 1%?\u201d Biden said.", "This is a\u00a0well-worn\u00a0but misleading claim. As we have written, in order for the legislation to be passed via reconciliation, most of the individual income tax provisions are set to expire by 2027, while the corporate tax cuts would remain, making the tax benefit distribution more lopsided for the top 1% than in earlier years.", "So, while the top 1% got 20.5% of the total tax benefits in 2018, and 25.3% of the tax benefits in 2025, the share of the total tax savings that accrues to the top 1% in 2027 is 82.8%, according to\u00a0an analysis\u00a0by the Tax Policy Center.", "Republicans\u00a0say\u00a0they expect a future Congress will extend the individual tax cuts, rather than allowing taxes for many to increase, but of course there is no assurance that will happen.", "Biden went on to claim Republicans \u201creduc[ed] taxes to a point that people who are making, you know if you are a husband and wife, school teacher and a cop, you\u2019re paying at a higher rate than the average person making $1 billion a year is. Something\u2019s wrong.\u201d", "Actually, that claim is wrong.", "It is another version of\u00a0a claim\u00a0Biden made during the campaign, that the top 1% of taxpayers, on average, pay a lower effective tax rate than middle-income people.", "In general, people in higher-income categories pay a higher tax rate.", "According to\u00a0an analysis\u00a0by the Tax Policy Center, the top 0.1% \u2014 those making over $3,452,300 a year \u2014 paid an average federal tax rate of 31.3% in 2019. That\u2019s a higher rate than any other income category below it. By comparison, for example, those in the middle 20% of earners \u2014 with an expanded cash income of $50,001 to $87,300 \u2014 paid an average federal tax rate of 12.4%, according to the TPC analysis.", "The Tax Policy Center did not break down its analysis for billionaires, but they would obviously be a fraction of those in the top 0.1%.", "\u201cOn average the top 0.1 percent of income pays more,\u201d\u00a0Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told us via email. \u201cAre there outliers? Sure. But would be very rare.\u201d", "As Gleckman\u00a0told us\u00a0back in 2019, \u201cYou can invest all your money in tax-exempt bonds and pay no federal income tax on the interest. Investors can avoid paying tax on capital gains by simply not selling the assets (but they\u2019d also have no income). But in general, the federal tax system is very progressive. The more you make, the more you pay.\u201d", "William McBride, vice president of federal tax and economic policy at the Tax Foundation, told us Biden may be referring to an analysis by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley that concluded the average effective tax rate (for federal, state and local taxes) paid by the richest 400 families in the U.S. was 23%, slightly lower than the 24.2% rate paid by the bottom half of American households.", "McBride notes, however, that the Saez/Zucman data \u201cexcludes refundable tax credits so that the tax burden is overstated at the lower end of the income spectrum. When they are included, average effective tax rates for federal taxes go from 3.3% for the lowest quintile up to 30.3% for the top 0.1% (about 120,000 households).\u201d", "McBride said the Saez/Zucman estimates for the top 400 households \u201crely on their assumptions about returns imputed from underlying wealth and income shares, which have been challenged by other economists like Gerald Auten and David Splinter. They find that the top 0.01 percent (a bit more than the top 400) paid an average combined tax rate of nearly 50 percent in 2018.\u201d", "In a post challenging some of the methodology of the Saez/Zucman report, Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center said that while it is true that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u201ccut the taxes of high earners by more on average than for low- and moderate-income households, as a share of after-tax income,\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean, as a Washington Post headline put it, that \u201cbillionaires paid a lower tax rate than the working class.\u201d", "Even though he pulled a card out of his pocket to read aloud statistics on the rise in cloture motions, Biden got the numbers wrong.", "Biden:\u00a0That it used to be that from between 1917 and 1971, the filibuster existed, there were a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster, that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it\u2019s being abused in a gigantic way.", "Cloture motions are filed to set a time limit on debate and bring a bill to the floor for a vote. The motion must receive 60 votes to pass \u2014 not a simple majority.", "The\u00a0Senate website\u00a0lists all cloture motions since 1917, when the Senate\u00a0first adopted\u00a0the cloture rule. We counted a total of 58 from 1917 through 1970, the figure Biden cited. But last year alone there were 118 \u2014 which is more than double 58, not five times greater.", "It appears that the president meant to say in the last Congress \u2014 not \u201clast year alone.\u201d In 2019 and 2020, which was the 116th Congress, there were 328 cloture motions filed \u2014 which is more than five times the motions filed from 1917 through 1970.", "But cloture motions aren\u2019t necessarily filed \u201cto break a filibuster,\u201d as Biden said. That used to be the primary use, but not in modern times \u2014 a fact noted in a\u00a0Congressional Research Service\u00a0report\u00a0on filibusters and cloture motions.", "\u201cIn recent times, by contrast, Senate leadership has increasingly made use of cloture as a normal tool for managing the flow of business on the floor, even when no evident filibuster has yet occurred,\u201d the CRS report said. \u201cIt would be erroneous to assume the presence or absence of cloture attempts is a reliable guide to the presence or absence of filibusters.\u201d", "Also, both parties are responsible for the escalating use of cloture motions. There were 504 filed in six years (2009-2014) when the Democrats were in control, and 657 in six years (2015-2020) when the Republicans were in charge.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
