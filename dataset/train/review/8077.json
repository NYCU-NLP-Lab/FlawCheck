They are not more dangerous than the virus, which has killed over 300,000 Americans and more than 1.6 million people worldwide.", "A lengthy and popular Facebook post attributed to an alternative medical doctor makes several misleading claims about the new coronavirus vaccines.", "Among them: that the new mRNA vaccines can alter human DNA (that\u2019s Pants on Fire); that we don\u2019t need a vaccine because we\u2019ve reached significant herd immunity (we haven\u2019t); and that anyone who has had COVID-19 would not benefit from the vaccine (not true).", "The post also erroneously claims that the vaccine contains toxic ingredients like aluminum, mercury \"and possibly formaldehyde,\" and then concludes that, ultimately, receiving the shot is more harmful than contracting the disease itself.", "\"Here\u2019s my bottom line: I would much rather get a COVID infection than get a COVID vaccine,\" reads the post, which accompanies an image of a man wearing a white physician\u2019s coat. \"That would be safer and more effective.\"", "Two problems: The list of ingredients cited in the post appears to be pulled from thin air. And a mountain of evidence shows that getting infected with the virus is far more dangerous than the vaccines. The vaccines have been studied for months and have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people. COVID-19, by contrast, has killed over 1.6 million people around the world.", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "When the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Dec. 11, its ingredient list was published online in a fact sheet for recipients and caregivers. The list includes mRNA, lipids, salts, sugar and saline solution.", "None of the supposedly toxic ingredients listed in the Facebook post appears in the list.", "The mRNA used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines represent a new vaccine technology, but the research behind it has been underway for some time.", "\"It's not a novel strategy,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \"This particular notion of using messenger RNA in a vaccine has been around for 20 years. This is just the first product to get above the water to become a commercial project.\"", "Traditional vaccines introduce an inactivated or weakened version of a virus for the body to fight against. By contrast, Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines use messenger RNA, which is a fragment of the virus\u2019 genetic material.", "It works by giving the body instructions to produce copies of the protein present on the surface of the coronavirus, without causing sickness from the disease. The immune system then learns to recognize the protein and produce antibodies against it.", "As for the rest of the ingredients, the lipids are nanoparticles used to encase the RNA, the salts help keep the pH, or acidity, of the vaccine close to that of a person\u2019s body; and the sugar safeguards the nanoparticles when they\u2019re frozen and stops them from sticking together, according to MIT\u2019s Technology Review, which spoke with experts to help decode the contents.", "Before injection, the vaccine is mixed with the saline solution, just as many intravenously delivered medicines are, the report said.", "Moderna also released a similar list of ingredients through the FDA, with a slight difference that may explain the different storage needs for each. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius, while the Moderna vaccine can be shipped at minus 20 degrees Celsius and can be stored in a refrigerator for up to 30 days after that.", "K. \"Vish\" Viswanath, a professor of health communication at Harvard\u2019s School of Public Health, told PolitiFact that the post uses common anti-vaccine tactics, such as using what he calls \"scientistic\" language, as he calls it, and claiming it comes from someone credible.", "\"This kind of tactic to list ingredients that may or may not be there is not new. Anti-vaccine groups have always used a list of ingredients even after ingredients have been eliminated from vaccines,\" Viswanath said. \"They misinterpret and distort scientific data to advance their agenda.\"", "Some people who get vaccinated may develop mild or moderate symptoms as their immune system responds, including headache, soreness or fever, but these side effects are short-lived and not considered serious or life-threatening.", "Some skeptics of the vaccine have pointed to the high survival rates for some groups of people who contract COVID-19. But the vaccine isn\u2019t intended just to prevent deaths, health experts note. It\u2019s also about preventing the spread of the virus and infections that could lead to significant long-term health issues.", "While the vaccines were developed in record time, they went through rigorous review processes before they were deemed suitable for public use.", "For example, the vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech has been studied in clinical trials involving about 44,000 people, with half receiving the vaccine, and the other half receiving a placebo. To receive emergency use authorization from the FDA, the manufacturers had to follow at least half of the participants for at least two months after their vaccinations, and the vaccine had to be proven safe and effective in that population.", "An FDA analysis of that vaccine\u2019s data found \"no specific safety concerns\" that would rule out using it for people aged 16 and older.", "For Moderna, 30,000 participants have been studied in its trial, with half receiving the vaccine and half receiving a placebo. An interim review of the data found that the vaccine was safe and well-tolerated, with an efficacy rate of 94.5%.", "Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, called the post irresponsible.", "\"Where is the data?
