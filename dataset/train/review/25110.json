["About this rating", "Easily the most-watched annual sporting event in the United States, the Super Bowl has grown, from\u00a0its inception as a championship football game in 1967, into an all-day, nationwide entertainment extravaganza. Today's Super Bowl viewer is as likely to tune in for a glimpse of\u00a0the most expensive TV advertising on Earth, or to catch the glitzy halftime show featuring top entertainers of the day, as to follow the game itself.", "The\u00a0roster of pop stars headlining\u00a0the Super Bowl has included the likes of Beyonce,\u00a0Paul McCartney, Katy Perry, Bruce Springsteen, and Madonna. Some of the shows have attained\u00a0legendary status. When Michael Jackson was booked in 1993, his three-song\u00a0set garnered higher ratings than the first half of the football game. Eleven years later, when his sister, Janet Jackson,\u00a0performed a duet with Justin Timberlake between halves of\u00a0Super Bowl XXXVIII, her breast was exposed on live television, earning the CBS network\u00a0an FCC fine\u00a0for indecency and introducing the euphemism \"wardrobe malfunction\" to the English lexicon.", "When\u00a0the flamboyant, outspoken\u00a0Lady Gaga was hired to perform at the 2017 Super Bowl\u00a0not long after President Donald Trump was inaugurated,\u00a0there was speculation that she might use her stage time\u00a0to make a political statement. Gaga, who supported Hillary Clinton in the election and has made many a public statement in support of\u00a0LGBTQ rights and against bullying, once described\u00a0Trump as \"one of the most notorious bullies we've ever seen.\"", "For less coherent reasons, it was also\u00a0speculated that Gaga was planning to\u00a0conduct some sort of\u00a0grotesque Satanic ritual at\u00a0halftime. Conspiracy theorist and Trump enthusiast\u00a0Alex Jones issued a video\u00a0in which he worked himself into a lather detailing\u00a0alleged\u00a0connections between Lady Gaga, the \"pizzagate\" scandal, \"spirit cooking,\" meat suits, Satanic rituals, and \"the rise of the robots\":", "... now we hear about Lady Gaga, who admittedly was part of the whole pizzagate situation, with the spirit cooking lady, the Aleister Crowley events, she admits she has someone sleep in her room at night because she believes a demon's going to attack her. Whether you believe in demons or not, when she wears meat suits and does all these rituals, and Madonna does it, too, the organizers of the Super Bowl are deciding to defile America and break our will by having us bow down to this. And she's reportedly going to be on top of the Super Bowl (they're saying she may cancel doing this), on top of the stadium, ruling over everyone with drones everywhere surveilling them in a big swarm, to just condition them that \"I am the goddess of Satan ruling over you with the rise of the robots,\" in a ritual of lesser magic.", "By way of clarification (to the extent that's even possible), the \"pizzagate situation\"\nJones refers to is a thoroughly discredited conspiracy theory (which Jones and his followers nevertheless cling to) holding that former First Lady, U.S. Senator, Secretary of State, and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton runs a child sex\u00a0ring out of a Washington, D.C. pizzeria.", "\"Spirit Cooking\" refers to a conceptual\u00a0art project by performance artist Marina Abramovic which has been misrepresented by Jones and others as an actual \"Satanic\" or \"occult\" ritual in which\u00a0leaders of the Democratic Party, most notably\u00a0former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, supposedly participated.", "The only piece of evidence\u00a0allegedly implicating Lady Gaga in these supposed \"scandals\"\u00a0is a viral image people say\u00a0shows her attending\u00a0a \"spirit cooking ritual\" led by\u00a0Abramovic:", "However, the photograph depicts no such event. It was taken at the 20th Annual Watermill Center Summer Benefit, an art auction\u00a0supporting residency programs at the renowned arts facility located near Southampton, New York. Along with more than 1,000\u00a0other attendees, including many well-known artists and celebrities, Gaga and Abramovic were both\u00a0guests\u00a0at the 27 July 2013 event, which, although its stated theme was \"Devil's Heaven\" and it featured purposely shocking\u00a0avant-garde installations such as the one seen above, had no connection with\u00a0Abramovic's \"Spirit Cooking\" oeuvre.", "Based on her own statements and actions, Gaga's spiritual inclinations\u00a0might\u00a0best be described as eclectic, inclusive, or, least charitably, confused. Born and raised a Catholic, she says\u00a0that although she has had disagreements with the Church she is \"very religious,\" believes in Jesus, and prays. But she also finds religion \"bogus,\" she says, in the sense that most, if not all religions, historically, have persecuted minorities. \"I dream of and envision a future where we have a more peaceful religion, or a more peaceful world, a more peaceful state of mind for the younger generation,\" Gaga told Larry King in a 2010 television interview.\u00a0She\u00a0has also promoted the teachings of\u00a0the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist leader, and studied\u00a0meditation with celebrity spiritualist Deepak Chopra, whom she reportedly sought out for counsel after experiencing dreams\u00a0of being \"haunted\"\u00a0by the devil.", "Dreaming that one is being chased by devils is not the same as worshiping Satan, we submit, despite\u00a0what rumor-mongers\u00a0like Alex Jones would have us believe. Nevertheless, in a classic instance\u00a0of confirmation bias (defined as the tendency to interpret new evidence as proof of what one already believes), Lady Gaga's actual halftime show, which\u00a0Variety\u00a0described as unprovocative and\u00a0\"overall a little weak,\" was condemned\u00a0by more excitable observers\u00a0as a \"Satanic performance\" replete with \"ritualistic Illuminati references\" such\u00a0as \"pentagrams lining the stage, flames, black clothing, and 666 hand symbols over the eyes.\"", "Others source claimed Gaga's show contained allusions to\u00a09/11, Freemasonry, and the biblical story of the fall of Lucifer:", "A 6 February 2017 Facebook post\u00a0shared by close to 60,000 people elaborated on the \"fall of Lucifer\" theme, claiming \"We just saw Satan's fall in theatric [sic] form\":", "Let me get this straight:", "So Gaga is standing above all. On the highest point, above all creation in that stadium. Can't get any higher. Stars are lighting up behind her and as the stars are illuminating in the sky she sings about \u201cgod\u201d and this nation is made for \u201cyou and me\u201d... THEN ...", "She falls from the highest point, from the stars, to the second high point... with the first words out of\u00a0her mouth being,", "\u201cI'm on the Edge of Glory\u201d...", "Does any of that sound familiar? What scene was just played out?

Lucifer. He twist the words of God ALWAYS and makes himself look good and God bad.", "Did the Lord not tell us \u201cFor even Lucifer disguises himself as an angel of light\u201d -2 Corinthians 11:14", "Lucifer is the god of this world. He creates all the time reminders about his presence and control over you very frequently. Because most don\u2019t know Gods word they do not recognize it.", "Lady Gaga is not a Christian. She practices many satanic things and because of that her thoughts and ideas come from the fallen kingdom \u2026 not the Lord's. We just saw Satan's fall in theatric form and the entire world clapped and for him and his blasphemy\u2026 READ THE BOOK AND OPEN YOUR KINGDOM EYES.", "As is obvious from the examples above, anyone can represent themselves as an expert on\u00a0\"Satanism\" and accuse\u00a0others of\u00a0practicing it, but that doesn't mean they know what they're talking about. If you shed such\u00a0preconceived notions before watching Gaga's actual performance, which opens with her perched\u00a0on the roof of Houston's NRG Stadium in an acrobatic harness, belting out refrains from \"God Bless America\" and \"This Land Is Your Land\" until\u00a0she leaps (not falls) to the stage below, you'll wonder how anyone could\u00a0seriously interpret it as\u00a0a re-enactment of Lucifer\u00a0being tossed out of heaven. And those\u00a0allegedly Satanic \"flashing pentagrams\" adorning the stage? They make much more thematic sense interpreted\u00a0as five-pointed stars from the American flag.", "Alex Jones' version of \"Satanism,\" if you recall, was Lady Gaga peering down from the top of the stadium, surrounded by flying drones, as if to say, \"I am the goddess of Satan ruling over you with the rise of the robots.\" For what it's worth, we scoured both the old and new testaments of the Bible for references to Satanic robots, and came up empty-handed.", "So, what was the meaning of Gaga's halftime performance? During preparation for the event, she\u00a0expressed the hope that it\u00a0would have a unifying effect on the country. When asked at a press conference a few days before the Super Bowl if she still hoped to do that, and whether she would be making any other kind of statements, she said:", "Well, I don\u2019t know if I will succeed in unifying America. You\u2019ll have to ask America when it\u2019s over. But the only statements that I\u2019ll be making during the halftime show are the ones that I\u2019ve been consistently making throughout my career.", "I believe in a passion for inclusion. I believe in the spirit of equality, and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. So my performance will have both those philosophies.", "...\u00a0Essentially, that kid that couldn\u2019t get a seat at the cool kids table and that kid who was kicked out of the house because his mom and dad didn\u2019t accept him for who he was?
