Gore said \u201cpromising to re-create the 19th century is not a visionary strategy.\u201d", "Todd, June 4: Is he right that you guys are making a false promise, though, to some of these fossil-fuel industries?", "Pruitt:\u00a0Dead wrong. Because the numbers show exactly the opposite in fact since the fourth quarter of last year to most recently added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In the month of May alone, almost 7,000 jobs.", "We asked the EPA where Pruitt got his data, but we did not receive a response.", "We did find, however, that the Bureau of Labor Statistics had somewhat similar figures for all mining jobs in its June 2 press release for May employment data:", "BLS, June 2: Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 138,000 in May, compared with an average monthly gain of 181,000 over the prior 12 months. In May, job gains occurred in health care and mining. (See table B-1.)", "Employment in health care rose by 24,000 in May. Hospitals added 7,000 jobs over the month, and employment in ambulatory health care services continued to trend up (+13,000).", "Job growth in health care has averaged 22,000 per month thus far in 2017, compared with an average monthly gain of 32,000 in 2016.

It also includes jobs created in a category called \u201csupport activities for mining.\u201d", "As for coal mining jobs, BLS says there were 51,000 jobs in May, up 400 from 50,600 jobs in April. Since December 2016, the number of coal jobs has increased by 1,300, according to the BLS.", "The biggest increase in mining jobs was in the category of\u00a0\u201csupport activities for mining.\u201d There were 292,400 such support jobs in May, up 7,900 jobs from April. BLS could not tell us how many of those jobs were related to coal mining, as opposed to gas, oil, metal ores and nonmetallic minerals. We do know, however, that most of those jobs support the gas and oil industries. There were 211,700 support jobs for oil and gas operations in April, according to the BLS.", "The American Coal Council, an industry trade group, estimates that there are \u201cover 80,000 coal jobs\u201d in the U.S., including support jobs. In an email, Terry Headley, a spokesman for the council,\u00a0provided us a link to a report by the National Mining Association that showed there were\u00a081,842 coal jobs in 2016. He said that figure includes support jobs, such as truck drivers,\u00a0electricians, surveyors, mechanics and service technicians \u2014 explaining why it is higher than the BLS figure of 51,000.", "We don\u2019t know where Pruitt got his figures, but BLS data do not support his claim that the coal sector added 7,000 jobs in May and almost 50,000\u00a0since the fourth quarter of last year.", "Update, June 6: In a June 6 interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Pruitt said (at the 1:57 mark): \u201c[W]e\u2019ve had a growing job market in the mining sector, including coal.
