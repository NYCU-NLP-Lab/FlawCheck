["The letter posted on Facebook (here\u2019s an archived version) on September 27, 2018 gives a timeline of events that led the inmate to death row, using a series of thefts committed as a child to explain how his mother dismissed his misdemeanours until he grew into a criminal being executed for robbery and murder. The letter, accompanied by a bible verse, is intended to encourage parents to discipline their children before it is too late.", "To those who saw the headlines at the time, Meeks is instantly recognisable as the man who entered the public eye in 2014 when he was arrested in California. His photogenic mugshot, released by police, quickly went viral, earning him his \u2018hot felon\u2019 nickname.", "A reverse image search shows that the photo of Meeks in the orange jumpsuit was taken during a July 2014 court appearance. It can be found here\u00a0on the website of photographic agency Getty.", "In January 2015, Meeks was convicted of one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and given a 27-month prison sentence, not execution.", "And as seen on his April 4 post on Instagram, where he has 1.6 million followers, the convict-turned-model is now very much alive and free, describing himself as \u201cready to hit the town\u201d in Beverly Hills.", "I\u2019m ready to hit the town in my @fashionnovamen", "A post shared by  JEREMY MEEKS (@jmeeksofficial) on Apr 3, 2019 at 4:25pm PDT", "As for the death row letter, the Facebook post doesn\u2019t name the supposed author or even say if it is\u00a0a real letter. US fact-checking website Snopes looked into the letter as early as 2015 when a previous version of the post, which also included Meeks\u2019 photo, was doing the rounds.", "In a comment on the more recent version, the user who posted it -- self-described \"entrepreneur, founder and preacher\" Geofrey Lubulwa -- wrote: \"True it is an illusion but do you get the message in the story??\"", "While the letter may be meant as a cautionary tale, linking it to a clearly identifiable person could mislead readers to think that Meeks was the author of the letter. For this reason, media publications often use generic stock images as illustrations when original images are not available. To avoid trouble, it\u2019s best to refrain from\u00a0using photos simply as an illustration if there\u2019s a risk that it might mislead readers.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
