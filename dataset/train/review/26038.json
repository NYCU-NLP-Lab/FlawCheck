["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on December 15, 2020", "A video circulating on social media falsely claims that vaccines for COVID-19 have a microchip that \u201ctracks the location of the patient.\u201d The chip, which is not currently in use, would be attached to the end of a plastic vial and provide information only about the vaccine dose. It cannot track people.", "COVID-19 vaccines have begun rolling out, but so has misinformation about them.", "A video claiming that the vials containing the vaccines have a microchip that \u201ctracks the location of the patient\u201d has been viewed more than 225,000 times on Facebook, according to data from CrowdTangle.", "That\u2019s false.", "The claim is based on a misrepresentation of an interview with Jay Walker, an executive for a medical device company called ApiJect.", "That interview was posted in May on the website for the Christian Broadcasting Network, a nonprofit founded by conservative televangelist Pat Robertson. In the interview, Walker explained that his company had received a federal contract to ramp up production of its prefilled syringes so that they would be available for use in administering either vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19.", "The ApiJect syringes work like an eyedropper, Walker explained, with a plastic pouch as the vial. The syringes can also be made with an optional chip that could be attached to the end of the plastic vial to store information about its contents. The chip is an RFID tag, which is short for radio frequency identification, and requires a device to scan and read the data.", "\u201cWhat that chip does is it has the unique serial number for each dose,\u201d Walker said in the original interview. \u201cIt is designed so that there is no counterfeiting. It is designed so that we\u2019ll know exactly that the right dose hasn\u2019t expired. However, that chip only refers to the dose \u2014 there\u2019s no personal information, no patient information. It\u2019s simply like a barcode, only we know instantaneously where and when that dose has been used.\u201d", "That portion of the interview wasn\u2019t included in the video that\u2019s currently circulating. Instead, the video includes the falsehood that the chips would be used to track the location of individual patients.", "It\u2019s unclear how that would even work, though, since the RFID tag is attached to the vial and can\u2019t be injected into a patient. Steven Hofman, spokesman for ApiJect, told us in an interview that the idea of the RFID tags being used to track individuals is \u201cbeyond fantasy.\u201d", "In reality, the chip would allow those administering the vaccine to check that the dose hasn\u2019t expired and isn\u2019t counterfeit, Hofman said. \u201cIt\u2019s incapable of collecting any personal information,\u201d he said.", "Also, it\u2019s worth noting that ApiJect\u2019s syringes aren\u2019t being used for either the currently available vaccine developed by Pfizer and the German biotech company BioNTech or the next one up for emergency use authorization, which was developed by Moderna.", "\u201cNeither Moderna or Pfizer are using our syringe at this point,\u201d Hofman said.", "Despite the fact that the syringes aren\u2019t currently being used for COVID-19 vaccines and the optional chips they use can\u2019t track individuals, many Facebook users left comments on the video expressing a misunderstanding.", "\u201cNope, never had flu shot, won\u2019t take this either! Especially one with a tracking device. What a crock,\u201d wrote one user.", "The misconception that vaccines may be used as a vehicle to implant tracking devices isn\u2019t new, though. At the beginning of the pandemic we wrote about a similar claim that anticipated Bill Gates would use a COVID-19 vaccine to track people with microchips. That was bogus, too.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
