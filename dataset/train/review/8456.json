He answers another question about COVID-19 vaccines and then walks on.", "The moment is unremarkable, unless you\u2019ve been misled to believe the whole thing is a fraud \u2014\u00a0that the interview was fake and the president was acting in front of a green screen.", "A YouTube video that has been viewed more than half a million times is among the many social media posts to spread this false claim.", "Titled \"Biden fakes interview, green screen fails,\" the post alleges that \"the reporters were not there\" because of how Biden\u2019s hands appear in relation to the microphones.", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "The YouTube video uses two clips of Biden talking to reporters. One clip is from The Hill and the other is from the Washington Post.", "Around the 9-second mark in The Hill\u2019s video, Biden\u2019s hands appear to move in front of the microphones as if they weren\u2019t there. There\u2019s no denying that it looks strange. But it doesn\u2019t prove he\u2019s talking in front of a green screen.", "Steve Herman, a Voice of America reporter who was holding one of the microphones, tweeted about the rumors on March 17.", "\"I was the one holding the lighter-colored fuzzy microphone and thus literally in front of @POTUS on the South Lawn,\" Herman wrote. \"It\u2019s all real.\"", "Herman also shared a video created by Mick West, who writes about conspiracy theories. In the video, West explains that because the microphones were on long booms, which enable reporters to maintain physical distance from the president amid the coronavirus pandemic, they give the illusion that something is amiss.", "He recreated a similar scenario in his own yard and filmed it from different angles. The effect is the same.", "\"It does look weird, but once you understand what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s pretty obvious,\" he says in the video.", "Herman noted in an email to PolitiFact that, even when there's not a pandemic,\u00a0the booms are regularly used during outdoor helicopter talks due to challenging acoustics.", "Other images from that day show the president, microphones and reporters from other angles.", "In this Reuters image, taken by photographer Tom Brenner, Biden can be seen from the side talking to reporters who are standing several feet away with their microphones extended forward. This Getty Images shot, by photographer Drew Angerer, shows Biden standing behind the microphones from below. This Washington Post video shows the interview from a different angle than the Hill video.", "And this clip, shared by FiveThirtyEight reporter Kaleigh Rogers, shows the different videos side by side.", "While the clip that\u2019s being shared on social media may look odd, it\u2019s not a hoax. It\u2019s an optical illusion.", "We rate the claim that Biden faked this interview with reporters in front of a green screen Pants on Fire!", "YouTube video, March 17, 2021", "The Washington Post, Biden does not plan to travel to border amid migrant surge, March 16, 2021", "The Hill tweet, March 16, 2021", "Steve Herman tweet, March 17, 2021", "YouTube video, March 17, 2021", "The Peninsula, Biden to hold first news conference on March 25 - White House, March 17, 2021", "Politico, Biden to hold first news conference March 25, March 26, 2021", "Mashable, Conspiracy theorists think Joe Biden used a green screen to fake a recent appearance.
