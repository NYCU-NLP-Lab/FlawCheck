Is Obama right on the statistics? And is Obama\u2019s attempt to link Reagan to a policy of maintaining a generous minimum wage an accurate historical portrayal?", "We should start by noting that the minimum wage, as written into law, is higher now than it was\u00a0 when Reagan took office in 1981 -- since 2009, it\u2019s been $7.25 an hour, compared to $3.35 in 1981.", "However, Obama was clearly referring to the inflation-adjusted minimum-wage rate.

Over Reagan\u2019s entire tenure, the minimum wage slowly eroded. In Reagan\u2019s fifth year in office, it was almost identical to what it is today in terms of purchasing power. By Reagan\u2019s sixth year as president, it dropped below today\u2019s rate when adjusted for inflation. And by the time he left office, the minimum wage had fallen a full 13 percent below its level today.", "There\u2019s a reason for this: Reagan never presided over a minimum wage increase during his term in office.

Roosevelt.", "Democratic presidents weren\u2019t the only ones to back minimum-wage increases.
