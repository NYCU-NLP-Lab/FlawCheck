These were the same images that sparked a deadly attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo when they were originally published five years ago.", "Following his murder, France\u2019s president promised to intensify a clampdown on Islamist extremism in the country. Paty was posthumously awarded the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur, which is the country\u2019s highest civilian award.", "The claim about Pogba\u2019s resignation was also published by Nigerian television station Arise TV, which shared it on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, while LegitNG -- the country\u2019s most visited domestic news site according to Alexa website traffic rankings -- published the claim on its Hausa blog.", "The claim about Pogba also circulated on social media in other African countries, including in South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, Cameroon, Zimbabwe and Egypt.

Neither he nor his representatives made any public statements to this effect.", "The Manchester United star himself dismissed the claim on his social media accounts.", "On Instagram, he posted a screenshot of The Sun\u2019s headline, with the stamp \u201cunacceptable fake news\u201d plastered over it.", "\u201cI am appalled, angry, shocked and frustrated some 'media' sources use me to make total fake headlines in the sensible subject of French current events and adding my religion and the French National Team to the pot,\u201d\u00a0Pogba wrote in the post.", "So The Sun did it again... absolutely 100% unfounded news about me are going around, stating things I have never said or thought. I am appalled, angry, shocked and frustrated some \u201cmedia\u201d sources use me to make total fake headlines in the sensible subject of French current events and adding my religion and the French National Team to the pot. I am against any and all forms of terror and violence. My religion is one of peace and love and must be respected. Unfortunately, some press people don\u2019t act responsibly when writing the news, abusing their press freedom, not verifying if what they write/reproduce is true, creating a gossip chain without caring it affects people\u2019s lives and my life. I am taking legal action against the publishers and spreaders of these 100% Fake News. In a quick shout out to The Sun, who normally could not care less: some of you guys probably went to school and will remember how your teacher said to always check your sources, don\u2019t write without making sure. But hey, seems you did it again and on a very serious topic this time, shame on you! #fakenews #AllezLesBleus @equipedefrance", "A post shared by  Paul Labile Pogba (@paulpogba) on Oct 26, 2020 at 5:20am PDT", "\u201cI am taking legal action against the publishers and spreaders of these 100% Fake News,\u201d\u00a0he added.", "Using the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP Fact Check traced the first instance of the claim to a report on 195sports.com.", "Although both the Egyptian site\u2019s article and The Sun\u2019s article have now been amended here and here following the footballer\u2019s reaction, the original versions are still accessible as archives here and here.", "195sports\u2019s original report did not mention the source of the claim but later attributed it to unnamed \u201csources\u201d.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
