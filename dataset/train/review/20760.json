["The release of final year school exam results in South Africa is frequently met with a dismissive chorus of \u201cyou only need 30% to pass matric\u201d. This year was no different, helped along by Twitter and Facebook.", "The claim is not a new one. And it has been given credence by academics like Professor Jonathan Jansen - the vice-chancellor of the University of the Free State and a prominent education commentator \u2013 who was quoted saying in 2013 that \u201c[i]t\u2019s an absolute disgrace that you can pass matric with a mark of 30 percent\u201d.", "But is it correct?", "\u201cThis idea that you only need a 30% average to pass matric is simply not true,\u201d said Nicholas Spaull, an education researcher from Stellenbosch University.", "Pupils are required to take a minimum of seven subjects. These include three compulsory subjects - usually a first language, a first additional language, mathematics or mathematical literacy and life orientation.", "\u201cYou need 40% in three subjects (one of which must be your home language), and 30% in 3 other subjects,\u201d Spaull said. If a pupil meets that bare minimum, they will pass even if they fail their seventh subject.", "Basil Manuel, president of the National Professional Teachers\u2019 Organisation of South Africa, echoed Spaull\u2019s comments. \u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s a nice story and the public grasps [at] it but you can\u2019t pass matric with 30%,\u201d he said.", "Leketi Makalela, an associate professor at Wits University\u2019s School of Education, said references to a 30% pass \u201ccomes from a lack of understanding of the pass requirements for matric\u201d.", "Higher Education South Africa has stated that only a \u201cminiscule number\u201d of pupils pass at the lowest possible level. In 2014 this amounted to 411 pupils or 0.1% of those who wrote matric exams.", "\u201cIf the learner does not satisfy the minimum subject requirements, he will not be awarded with the [National Senior Certificate], even though he may have attained an exceptionally high mark in one or two of the other subjects,\u201d explained Elijah Mhlanga, a spokesman for the Department of Basic Education.", "Mhlanga said that averages don\u2019t determine whether a pupil passes matric. \u201cThere is no averaging of marks in the [National Senior Certificate exams]\u2026 No learner will be awarded a [National Senior Certificate] if he attains 30%.\u201d", "Technically speaking, if a pupil met the minimum requirements and obtained 40% for three subjects (one being a home language), 30% for three subjects and 0% for a seventh subject, then they would pass with a 30% average.", "But Manuel said that this was impossible. \u201cA pupil can\u2019t get 0% for a subject because they have to complete a school-based assessment and the exam. I have never heard of a youngster getting 0% as a final mark,\u201d he said.", "While it is theoretically possible for a pupil to obtain a 30% average and pass, it is extremely unlikely \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 in reality.", "And a matric pass at the lowest possible level won\u2019t get you into a technical college, university or any other tertiary institution.", "One of the most pressing challenges facing South Africa\u2019s education system isn\u2019t who passes or fails the final exams but the large numbers of pupils who drop out long before they get to matric.", "Edited by Julian Rademeyer", "Please complete this form to receive the HTML sharing code.", "Africa Check values your trust and is committed to the responsible management, use and protection of personal information.
