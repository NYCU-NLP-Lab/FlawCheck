That meme claimed BLM had raised \"over a billion dollars\" but had not used that money to provide necessities such as food, housing, or schooling; instead, they had expended it on buying \"huge charter busses to transport members to riots\":", "As for the first part of the meme, BLM is a \"decentralized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against African-American people\"; it isn't a centrally organized group that was founded for the purpose of feeding the hungry, providing housing, or funding schooling, nor does it raise money on that basis.", "Moreover, the photograph accompanying this meme does not show any buses purchased by BLM \"to transport members to riots,\" or for any other purpose. The vehicles pictured here belong to the Toronto Raptors professional basketball team, who wrapped their buses with the Black Lives Matter name as a show of support for the movement, as documented on the Raptors' Twitter account:", "The same photograph was used to accompany a CBC article about the Raptors' arrival at the protected \"NBA bubble\" training facility at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, where the picture was captioned as follows: \"The reigning NBA champion Toronto Raptors arrived at the Disney campus after a two-hour drive from Naples, Fla., where the team has trained for roughly two weeks. The team's buses were wrapped with its logo and the words 'Black Lives Matter' displayed.\"", "Reynolds, Tim. \u00a0 \"Raptors Arrive at Disney Campus in BLM buses, Teams Begin Restart Routines.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CBC. \u00a0 9 July 2020.", "Buchanan, Larry. \u00a0 \"Black Lives Matter May Be the Largest Movement in U.S. History.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 3 July 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
