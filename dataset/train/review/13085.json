(We used Google Translate to understand the key sections.) Nearly 4,000 Danes work under the Golden Arches, almost all, about 3,500, are hourly employees, and very few are full-time.", "In its report, the company bundled those part-time hours and converted them into full-time equivalents. In 2011, it paid wages of 530 million Danish kroner to what would be equal to 2,040 full-time workers. That\u2019s different from talking about what the typical worker actually got. Still, when you do the math, the company paid the mathematically average full-time worker about $46,700 that year.", "Statistics Denmark is the government agency that tracks labor information. For the category of food service counter attendants, the annual pay in 2012 was over $41,000. That is for all companies, not just McDonald\u2019s. On an hourly basis, that translates to about $20 an hour.", "This lines up with a survey run by two economists, Orley Ashenfelter at Princeton University and Stepan Jurajda at CERGE-EI, an economic research center in Prague. Since 1998, they have tracked hourly wages of McDonald\u2019s workers worldwide. (They use the price of a Big Mac as a way to compare worker pay to the cost of living, as in, how many Big Macs does a person get paid an hour.)", "Jurajda told PunditFact that their most recent survey found Danish McDonald\u2019s workers make about $20 an hour.", "The catch here is that those hourly wages only deliver an annual income of $41,000 or more if a person works full-time, and we know that most people are part-timers. We asked the McDonald\u2019s corporation, both in Denmark and America, for the median yearly earnings. A company spokesman sent us the statement, \"Our hourly rates of pay depend on the role the employee is doing and their age\"", "Lars Esbjerg, a professor at Aarhus University in Denmark, studies low-wage jobs in his country. Esbjerg said the median earnings are not publicly available, but he sent us a copy of the latest McDonald\u2019s union contract. The lowest hourly rate is 115 DKK, or $20.70.

That\u2019s accurate, but while wages are more than double what they are in the United States, taxes are not.", "According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American fast food worker makes about $9 an hour. Compare that to the $20.70 paid in Denmark. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average tax burden in Denmark is 38.2 percent, while in America, it is 31.3 percent. So taxes are about a fifth higher. Most people, if given the choice, would accept a 20 percent hike in taxes in exchange for making twice as much.", "That still doesn\u2019t quite make it an apples-to-apples comparison because the cost of living is higher in Denmark. Both Jurajda and Esbjerg said that this also cuts into the wage advantage that Danish McDonald\u2019s workers enjoy over their American counterparts.", "But at the end of the day, according to Princeton economist Orley Ashenfelter, they still come out ahead.", "\"I'm sure that the Danish McWorkers are pretty happy,\" Ashenfelter said.", "Ashenfelter added that as a fraction of the workforce, Denmark has far fewer McDonald\u2019s employees than does the United States.

The union membership is totally accurate. The matter of pay is true for some workers, but certainly the majority work too few hours to make that much. Still, the average numbers provided by McDonald\u2019s Denmark, government statistics, and data analyzed by economists who have studied the earnings of Danish McDonald\u2019s workers, generally support that figure.
