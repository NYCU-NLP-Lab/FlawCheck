["By Jessica McDonald, D'Angelo Gore and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on February 3, 2021", "A video from conservative commentator Liz Wheeler falsely claims the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, repeatedly \u201clied\u201d to the American public about the COVID-19 pandemic. She also misleads about COVID-19 vaccination prioritization and distorts the findings of a scientific paper to argue that face masks do not need to be worn by healthy people.", "Multiple lines of evidence back the use of face masks to protect against the coronavirus, although some uncertainty remains as to how effective mask interventions are in preventing spread in the community.", "Lab tests, for example, show that certain masks and N95 respirators can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets or aerosols, which are thought to be the primary ways the virus spreads.", "Observational studies, while limited, have generally found mask-wearing to be associated with a\u00a0reduced\u00a0risk\u00a0of contracting the virus or\u00a0fewer\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0cases\u00a0in a community.", "A\u00a0few\u00a0randomized controlled\u00a0trials have found that providing free masks and encouraging people to wear them results in a small to moderate reduction in transmission, although these results have\u00a0not always\u00a0been statistically significant.", "Masks should not be viewed as foolproof, as no mask is thought to offer complete protection to the wearer or to others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wear the most protective mask that fits well and can be worn consistently. Loosely woven cloth masks are the least protective. Layered, tightly woven cloth masks offer more protection, while well-fitting surgical masks and KN95 respirators provide even more protection and N95 respirators are the most protective.", "Link to this", "In a video titled \u201cFauci lied to you AGAIN,\u201d conservative commentator Liz Wheeler makes a series of false claims about Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the government\u2019s most prominent experts on the coronavirus.", "The Fauci-focused video, which runs nearly four minutes long and has accumulated more than 1.7 million views on Facebook since being posted in early January, also features Wheeler posing several questions about COVID-19 vaccination or mask use. As we\u2019ll explain, her responses are misleading and contain inaccurate information.", "Wheeler is a former television host on the One America News Network, a conservative cable channel known for being a favorite of former President Donald Trump and for spreading false information.", "The video starts with Wheeler falsely claiming that Fauci \u201clied\u201d about the COVID-19 case fatality rate.", "\u201cFirst, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that the COVID-19 case fatality rates was 3.6%. That turned out to be a lie,\u201d she said. \u201cThe actual fatality rate of the virus is probably less than 1%.\u201d", "We could find no instance of Fauci misrepresenting the case fatality rate, or ratio, which is the percentage of those with confirmed cases who have died. In fact, we found the opposite.", "Before the U.S. had even reported its first COVID-19 death, Fauci co-authored a\u00a0Feb. 28\u00a0editorial in the\u00a0New England Journal of Medicine that said the case fatality rate is probably \u201cconsiderably less than 1%.\u201d At the time, the rate was about 2%.", "\u201cIf one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%,\u201d according to the editorial co-authored by Fauci and two others federal health officials, including the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "Less than a month later, Fauci noted at a House committee hearing on March 11 that the case fatality rate then was up from 2% to 3% \u2014 but he still maintained that the true rate was much lower than that. Again, he stated that the case fatality rate misses \u201call the cases of minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic infection.\u201d", "Fauci, March 11: Probably for the practical understanding of the American people, the seasonal flu that we deal with every year has a mortality of 0.1%. The stated mortality overall of this [the novel coronavirus], when you look at all the data, including China, is about 3%. It first started off as 2 and now 3. I think if you count all the cases of minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic infection, that probably brings the mortality rate down to somewhere around 1%, which means it is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu. I think that\u2019s something that people can get their arms around and understand.", "It is important to note that the case fatality rate is a simplistic measure that merely divides COVID-19 deaths by confirmed cases. \u201cThe true severity of a disease can be described by the Infection Fatality Ratio,\u201d which accounts for COVID-19 deaths \u201camong all infected individuals,\u201d as explained by the World Health Organization. It\u2019s not lying when someone states the case fatality rate, whether it was 2%, 3% or 3.6%, and then explains why it is not an accurate measure of the severity of a disease.", "Wheeler\u2019s second purported Fauci \u201clie\u201d concerns lockdowns.", "\u201cFauci said lockdowns work. This was obviously false,\u201d she said. \u201cThe places with the harshest lockdowns like Los Angeles and New York City have had the worst outcomes. And no, it\u2019s not because they didn\u2019t lock down soon enough. There is literally zero scientific evidence. And now, nine months into COVID-19, zero empirical evidence that lockdowns work to stop the virus.\u201d", "Certainly, there have been debates about whether and when to implement a lockdown \u2014 a nebulous term that has various meanings, but usually refers to movement restrictions and stay-at-home orders. Public health experts, including those at the World Health Organization, recognize that lockdowns impose high costs to society, and should be avoided whenever possible. But to claim there is zero scientific evidence that the measure works is inaccurate.", "\u201cLockdowns are a very extreme form of the measures that we have seen have the desired effect throughout this pandemic. And there is scientific evidence that they work,\u201d said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s COVID-19 modeling consortium, in a phone interview.", "As one example, she pointed to a study her group published in Emerging Infectious Diseases that looked at data from 58 different cities in China early on in the pandemic. \u201cWe found a very strong data-driven statistical correlation between how quickly a city acted and how quickly they were able to bring the outbreak under control,\u201d she said.", "Laura Matrajt, a research associate at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who has modeled the effects of social distancing interventions, also told us Wheeler\u2019s claim was \u201cobviously \u2026 false.\u201d", "She pointed us to several studies to support the notion that lockdowns can be effective, including a rapid review of 11 European countries, which found that lockdown implementation was associated with a 82% drop in the effective reproduction number, or Rt. The measure refers to how many people on average each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time; a number above one indicates a growing epidemic, whereas a number below one means disease transmission is slowing and will eventually peter out.", "According to the paper, the findings \u201csuggest a positive effect of the containment measures on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, with a major effect in countries where lockdown started early and was more restrictive.\u201d", "A study analyzing data from Europe and the U.S. also concluded that lockdowns likely played \u201ca key role\u201d in bringing epidemics under control in many places by late April. \u201cNo state had an estimated Rt below 1.0 before lockdown,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cbut 29 states reached an Rt below 1.0 after lockdown.\u201d", "A paper published in June in the journal Nature likewise found that \u201cmajor non-pharmaceutical interventions \u2014 and lockdowns in particular \u2014 have had a large effect on reducing transmission\u201d of the coronavirus.", "A string of other studies have found similar results and other fact-checkers have debunked claims about lockdowns being ineffective.", "Meyers also batted down the notion that lockdowns don\u2019t work just because some places with bad outbreaks have implemented stricter measures.", "\u201cIf we look back at what happened in the spring wave and in New York, it was the growing threat to the hospitals, the growing numbers of cases that led New York to enact its spring 2020 stay home order,\u201d she said, noting that in many places governmental restrictions are not full lockdowns. \u201cThat initial wave did subside after people started taking precautions and staying home.\u201d", "The same pattern repeated, she said, with the surge of COVID-19 cases in the Sun Belt and in Texas over the summer and with the spike in cases and hospitalizations this winter.", "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing all over the country that as risks start increasing, policies and communication are put in place to encourage these behavioral measures,\u201d she said, \u201cand when they\u2019re enacted and people adhere to those recommendations, the virus starts slowing.\u201d", "Wheeler falsely claims that Fauci admitted to lying when he initially said early last year that widespread use of face masks was not necessary.", "She says: \u201cFauci also said, \u2018masks don\u2019t work, so please don\u2019t buy them,\u2019 he told us. This is actually probably true of cloth masks, but Fauci later admitted he lied to us to manipulate us into not buying masks so that there wouldn\u2019t be a shortage for health care workers.\u201d", "First, Fauci did not say \u201cmasks don\u2019t work.\u201d", "During an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in March 2020, Fauci actually said that \u201cmasks are important for someone who\u2019s infected to prevent them from infecting someone else.\u201d But he added that face masks generally do not provide the \u201cperfect protection\u201d from getting infected \u201cthat people think\u201d and so \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to be walking around with a mask.\u201d", "Fauci still said he was \u201cnot against\u201d anyone wearing a mask \u201cif you want to do it.\u201d Although, he warned that if everyone wore them it \u201ccould lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it,\u201d particularly health care providers and people who were ill.", "His comments were in line with CDC guidance at the time to conserve face masks for health care workers and those who had COVID-19 and had symptoms.", "Then, in April, after health officials learned more about how much the virus was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, the CDC reversed course and began recommending that everyone wear face coverings in public. At that point, Fauci, too, began encouraging universal mask use.", "Fauci later explained the reversal in a June interview with TheStreet, in which he acknowledged that concern for medical workers was a major factor in the early guidance for the public not to wear masks.", "Fauci, June 12: The reason for that is that we were concerned the public health community, and many people were saying this, were concerned that it was at a time when personal protective equipment, including the N95 masks and the surgical masks, were in very short supply. And we wanted to make sure that the people, namely the health care workers, who were brave enough to put themselves in a harm way, to take care of people who you know were infected with the coronavirus and the danger of them getting infected. We did not want them to be without the equipment that they needed. So there was not enthusiasm about going out and everybody buying a mask or getting a mask.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean Fauci \u201clied to us,\u201d as Wheeler claims.", "During a virtual event with the Washington Post in July, Fauci said that, in addition to wanting to preserve face masks for those most in need, health officials truly did not realize the degree to which infected people without symptoms were spreading the virus.", "\u201cI mean, back then, the critical issue was to save the masks for the people who really needed them because it was felt that there was a shortage of masks,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, we didn\u2019t realize at all the extent of asymptomatic spread and that a person who could be without symptoms at all could inadvertently and innocently spread it to someone who was uninfected.\u201d", "Fauci added: \u201cBut what happened is that as the weeks and months came by, two things became clear: one, that there wasn\u2019t a shortage of masks. We had plenty of masks and covering that you could put on that, plain cloth covering. That took care of that problem. Secondly, we fully realized that there were a lot of people who were asymptomatic who were spreading infection. So it became clear that we absolutely should be wearing masks consistently.\u201d", "Wheeler proceeds to question why people who have previously had COVID-19 are being vaccinated \u2014 and in the process, misleadingly claims that natural infection is \u201cbetter\u201d than immunization.", "\u201cWhy are people who\u2019ve already had COVID-19 and recovered from it getting the vaccine?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou might say, well, to protect against reinfection. But nope, according to a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which followed 12,541 health care workers for 31 weeks after they\u2019d had COVID, six months into the study they found natural immunization was solid. They found only two cases of asymptomatic reinfections. So why are we vaccinating people who\u2019ve already recovered from COVID? They don\u2019t seem to be at risk of reinfection and natural immunization is better than artificial immunization. It makes no sense.\u201d", "As we\u2019ve written, many vaccines don\u2019t provide quite as good immunity as that triggered by an infection, but that hardly means going that route is better, as contracting the disease is inherently risky. And there are numerous vaccines, such as those that protect against tetanus and human papillomavirus, or HPV, that produce superior immunity than natural infection. (For more, see our SciCheck story \u201cPaul Misleads on Natural Infection and COVID-19 Vaccines.\u201d)", "For the coronavirus, it\u2019s not yet known how immunity from vaccination compares with that from infection. Some initial signs suggest that the vaccines produce higher levels of infection-blocking neutralizing antibodies than those seen in patients recovering from COVID-19, but the strength and duration of immunity from both natural infection and immunization remain an area of investigation. Regardless, getting vaccinated is far safer than contracting the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2.", "It\u2019s true that people who have previously had COVID-19 likely have some immunity for a certain amount of time and therefore aren\u2019t at high risk of becoming reinfected soon. For this reason, some experts have proposed that people who have had COVID-19 should not be prioritized for immunization.", "But there\u2019s no way to know for certain whether a person is immune \u2014 the so-called correlates of immunity have yet to be worked out for COVID-19 \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear how long immunity might last.", "As a result, the CDC website states, \u201cDue to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection with COVID-19 is possible, vaccine should be offered to you regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 infection.\u201d", "Elsewhere, the agency recognizes the lower risk to individuals who have previously had COVID-19, adding that it\u2019s reasonable for people with infections in the last three months to choose to delay vaccination, at least while vaccines remain in short supply.", "The CDC also advises that people with active coronavirus infections wait until they\u2019ve recovered to receive a shot and for anyone who has received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma to delay vaccination for at least 90 days, as those therapies might prevent the vaccine from working.", "It\u2019s worth noting that even though the study Wheeler cited does suggest reinfection is rare, she botched some of the details. While 12,541 health care workers were included, not all of them had COVID-19. Instead, only 1,265 tested positive on a particular antibody test, suggesting they probably had been previously infected. Two of those individuals then went on to test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus with a PCR test.", "Millions of health care workers have direct contact with patients and are at high risk of being exposed to the virus or becoming infected and then spreading it to others. But Wheeler suggests health care workers have been among the first to be offered the vaccine only because they tend to be \u201cmore racially diverse\u201d than other populations.", "\u201cWhy are young and otherwise healthy health care workers getting the vaccine before it\u2019s offered to elderly people in nursing homes,\u201d she asks. \u201cIt\u2019s not because health care workers are at higher risk; they\u2019re not. Elderly people are at the highest risk hands down. The only reason health care workers are being vaccinated first is because, as a University of Pennsylvania professor explained, health care workers are more racially diverse while nursing home residents tend to be white. So, in other words, the vaccine is being distributed according to critical race theory, not according to science.\u201d", "It\u2019s true older individuals are at greater risk of being hospitalized or dying from COVID-19, and residents of long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes and assisted-living residences, have been hit especially hard by the pandemic.", "But Wheeler simply ignores that the approximately 21 million U.S. health care workers \u2014 who work in settings such as hospitals, outpatient clinics and home health care \u2014 are a vulnerable group as well. More than 15 million medical workers \u2014 of whom 59% are white \u2014 are estimated to have direct contact with patients.", "\u201cHealth care personnel\u2019s race and ethnicity, underlying health conditions, occupation type, and job setting can contribute to their risk of acquiring COVID-19 and experiencing severe outcomes, including death,\u201d the CDC explains. \u201cBy providing critical care to those who are or might be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, health care personnel have a high risk of being exposed to and getting sick with COVID-19.\u201d", "The CDC further notes that because those workers cannot \u201cprovide key services for patients or clients\u201d if they contract the virus and become ill, \u201ccontinued protection of them at work, at home, and in the community remains a national priority.\u201d It also warns that workers who get COVID-19 can spread it to their colleagues, as well as those they are caring for, who may well have \u201cunderlying health conditions that put them at risk for severe COVID-19 illness.\u201d", "That being the case, the CDC, following guidance from the independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, recommended in December that, in the first phase of the vaccine program, state and local officials prioritize giving the first doses available to both health care workers and those living in long-term care facilities. (According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, all 50 states and the District of Columbia are vaccinating health care workers and long-term care residents and staff in Phase 1a. But 16 states depart from the recommendation in some way, primarily by including other groups to be immunized.)", "The CDC and ACIP say the recommendations are based on \u201cevidence-based information\u201d about the coronavirus vaccines, with the goal of decreasing death and serious disease, preserving the function of society and reducing the burden COVID-19 is having on people already facing disparities.", "As of Feb. 2, there had been over 391,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,343 deaths among health care workers, according to the CDC. But that may be an undercount.", "In December, Kaiser Health News said its joint investigation with the Guardian found that \u201cmore than 2,900 U.S. health care workers have died in the COVID-19 pandemic since March, a far higher number than that reported by the government.\u201d", "The news site said those fatalities \u201chave skewed young, with the majority of victims under age 60 in the cases for which there is age data.\u201d In addition, \u201cpeople of color have been disproportionately affected, accounting for about 65% of deaths in cases in which there is race and ethnicity data,\u201d KHN said.", "Wheeler then goes on to distort a study to question why people who aren\u2019t ill are told to wear masks.", "\u201cSpeaking of science, why do people who aren\u2019t sick have to wear masks?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou might say, well, to prevent asymptomatic transmission. But no. A new study from the University of Florida\u2019s department of biostatistics found that the secondary attack rate for asymptomatic index cases was not statistically different from zero.\u201d", "But that\u2019s a misinterpretation of that research. The senior author of the paper, University of Florida biostatistician Natalie E. Dean, explained in a Twitter thread that her study \u201cdid not conclude \u2018no asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic spread\u2019 of SARS-CoV-2\u201d or that \u201cmasks and lockdowns are pointless.\u201d", "The paper, which was published in the journal JAMA Network Open in December, synthesized and analyzed 54 previously conducted studies to better understand how infectious the coronavirus is within households. The studies provided estimates of the secondary attack rate, or how frequently the virus spread to others from an index, or initial, case.", "One of several findings was that far more people contracted COVID-19 if the first infected person in the household had symptoms. Specifically, the secondary attack rate was 18.0% when the index case was symptomatic, versus 0.7% when the index case did not have symptoms.", "While this does suggest that transmission of the coronavirus within households is more likely if a person is symptomatic, it does not mean that the virus is not spread from people who aren\u2019t sick or that there\u2019s no reason to wear a mask.", "For one, as our colleagues at PolitiFact and the Associated Press\u00a0noted when debunking similar claims based on the study, the paper itself cautioned that the secondary attack estimate for index cases without symptoms was based on just four studies \u2014 and concluded that \u201cimportant questions remain\u201d about infectiousness and symptom severity.", "The combined estimate also included studies assessing the attack rate for people who never develop symptoms, and are asymptomatic, as well as those who haven\u2019t yet developed symptoms, but will, and are pre-symptomatic.", "As Dean pointed out, it\u2019s increasingly clear that people who never develop symptoms are less infectious, but pre-symptomatic transmission does occur \u2014 and even if less frequent than symptomatic spread, these modes of transmission can still be important to the pandemic.", "\u201cIf an asymptomatic person is far less infectious but has far more contacts than someone home with a fever,\u201d Dean said, \u201cit can come out in the wash.\u201d", "The attack rate estimates, too, are only for households, not for transmission in the community, which is more relevant to Wheeler\u2019s complaint about people being told to wear masks in public.", "Finally, while the mask guidance did shift in response to the recognition that people without symptoms can spread the virus \u2014 which by some estimates is quite common \u2014 that isn\u2019t the only reason to wear a mask. As the CDC explains, some evidence suggests masks may also provide a degree of protection to the wearer as well.", "\u201cHow well it protects you from breathing in the virus likely depends on the fabrics used and how your mask is made (e.g. the type of fabric, the number of layers of fabric, how well the mask fits),\u201d the CDC says.", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
