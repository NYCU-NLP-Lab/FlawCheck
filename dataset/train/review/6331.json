The blogger points out phrases like \"the two scrapped with each other\" and \"I feared he may inadvertently kill me\" as examples of poor or odd phrasing.", "Other \"errors\" could be due to copying procedures. An \"I\" toward the end of the document has a blur that makes it look lowercase. A line of text is stretched larger than other lines in the scan. The blogger points to the warp as an attempt to alter the content of the letter because that line has Kavanaugh\u2019s name in it. Kavanaugh is named several other places in the letter without any text warping.", "Another of the \"errors\" is that Ford uses the phrase \"opportune moment.\" The blogger says that wording \"indicates a low-level writer attempting to sound sophisticated.\" That\u2019s an unfounded opinion, not an error.", "This isn\u2019t the first time Natural News has made ridiculous claims related to Ford\u2019s credibility or motives.
