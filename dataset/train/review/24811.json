["About this rating", "Donald Trump's poll numbers took a hit in August 2016 as the Republican Presidential nominee stepped from one controversy to the next.

A screengrab from 15 August 2016 shows that ABC News, like nearly all other polling organizations, currently has Hillary Clinton leading the presidential race:", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
