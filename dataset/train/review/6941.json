["About this rating", "Space pioneer Sally Ride, who became the first female American astronaut in space, was asked by NASA engineers if 100 tampons would be sufficient for the 14 days she was to spend on the space shuttle Challenger in 1984.", "The story resurfaced in April 2020, when comedienne Marcia Belsky performed a now-viral song about Ride on Comedy Central titled, \u201cProof that NASA Doesn\u2019t Know Anything About Women.\u201d", "\u201cRemember when NASA sent a woman to space for only six days and they gave her 100 tampons. 100 tampons. And they asked, \u2018Will that be enough?\u2019 Because they didn\u2019t know if that was enough,\u201d Belsky sang at her keyboard. \u201cThese are our nation\u2019s greatest minds. They are literally rocket scientists.\"", "The video picked up steam once again in November 2020 when social media users expressed similar disbelief at the suggestion of 100 tampons for such a short amount of time.", "It\u2019s true that NASA engineers asked Ride how many tampons she might need during her time in space. But the physicist was quick to set them straight.", "Ride became the first American woman to fly in space when she served as an astronaut on a mission aboard the Challenger space shuttle, which blasted off on June 18, 1983. Her job was to work the robotic arm to help release satellites into space, according to NASA. (Before Ride, Russia sent female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova to space in 1963.)", "In a 2002 oral history interview with Rebecca Wright, then coordinator for the NASA Johnson Space Center History Office, Ride was asked what items NASA had added to her flight kit, including the tampons in question.", "\u201cI remember the engineers trying to decide how many tampons should fly on a one-week flight; they asked, \u2018Is 100 the right number?\u2019\u201d Ride recalled, according to the transcript. She replied that, \u201cNo, that would not be the right number.\u201d", "\u201cThey said, \u2018Well, we want to be safe,\u2019\u201d continued Ride. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, you can cut that in half with no problem at all.\u2019\u201d", "NASA engineers apparently had a history of sending women to space with inadequate supplies. In that same interview, Ride noted that the engineers had also decided that women astronauts would want makeup. So, they designed a makeup kit.", "\u201cThe engineers at NASA, in their infinite wisdom, decided that women astronauts would want makeup \u2014 so they designed a makeup kit,\u201d Ride was quoted as saying in a January 2018 tweet shared by the NASA History Office.", "It is not uncommon for astronauts to head to space with their own personal hygiene kits, which have been issued as standard equipment for astronauts since the 1960s. These kits typically contain items like a toothbrush, lotion, deodorant, comb, and razor. But in a predominantly male field in the 1980s, experts apparently had limited knowledge in the types of hygiene items that would be necessary for a woman.", "The optional \u2014 and unused \u2014 makeup kit included eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow, eye makeup remover, blusher, and lip gloss. It went on display in the Human Spaceflight at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, in 2002.", "Women still remain a minority of those who have visited space in the four decades since Ride's 1984 mission. Of more than 500 cosmonauts, astronauts, payload specialists, and space station participants who have been to space, NASA noted that just 65 have been women as of March 2020.", "Correction [Dec. 8, 2020]: A previous version of this article stated that Sally Ride had spent time aboard the International Space Station. In 1983, Ride became the first American woman in space aboard the Challenger\u2019s STS-7 mission. The following year, she launched on another Challenger mission, STS-41-G.", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
