["A screenshot of an article headline reporting that a study showed that asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 \u201cdidn\u2019t occur at all\u201d has been shared in multiple Facebook and Instagram posts.

By then the epidemic in Wuhan had been effectively under control.\u201d", "Song also cautioned against generalising the results of the study to countries where Covid-19 outbreaks have not been brought under control.", "\u201cThe asymptomatic cases identified in the screening programme in Wuhan were likely to be previously infected (antibody positive in >60% of them) and had only inactive remains of viral RNAs, compared with cases in locations with high SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission,\u201d he explained.", "Britain\u2019s University of East Anglia, which also participated in the study, preemptively refuted mischaracterisations of the study\u2019s findings.", "\u201cThe research team warn that their findings do not show that the virus can\u2019t be passed on by asymptomatic carriers,\u201d the university said\u00a0in a press release\u00a0on November 30, 2020.", "The study \u201cconfirms that transmission of Covid-19 can be successfully controlled by well implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, including face covering, hand hygiene, safe social distancing, contract tracing, and lockdown restrictions,\u201d the statement explained.", "The British Medical Journal published a\u00a0report\u00a0on the study\u2019s findings on December 1, 2020.
