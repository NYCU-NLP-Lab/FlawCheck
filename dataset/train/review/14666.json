["About this rating", "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump took to Twitter (again) on 8 August 2016 to criticize the news media for lying about him, and one instance he highlighted was a story about his allegedly having kicked a crying baby out of a campaign rally in Ashburn, Virginia:", "The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, \"the baby\" and so much more. Very dishonest!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2016", "Trump was referring to several misleading headlines published on 2 August 2016 that accused him of demanding that a crying infant be removed from the premises where his campaign was holding a political rally.  For instance, the New York Post ran a story under the headline \"Trump Loves Crying Baby, Then Kicks the Tot Out of His Rally,\" and the New York Daily News published a news video under the title \"Trump Kicks Crying Baby Out of Rally\" and stated Trump had \"booted a fussy baby from a rally\":", "Donald Trump booted a fussy baby from a rally because the tot was wailing over the businessman\u2019s speech.", "\u201cYou can get the baby out of here,\u201d the GOP presidential nominee barked from the stage in Ashburn, Va.", "The baby banishment came just seconds after Trump bragged about his love of children and promised that the crying kid could stay.", "Trump, however, didn't actually kick the squalling child out of his rally.", "Daniel Dale of the Toronto Star  wrote that he was sitting near the baby during the rally, and that while Trump really did make the comments captured in the above-displayed video, the incident was mischaracterized and Trump never actually ordered the tot be removed from the room.", "According to Dale, Trump said \"Don't worry about that baby\" when the infant first started crying, and when the child cried again, the mother quickly left the room to avoid interrupting the candidate. Trump noticed the woman leaving and called after her, \"You can get the baby out of here.\" But the woman and the child both returned to their seats later in the rally:", "The baby was one row in front of me, three or four rows from the stage, at Trump\u2019s event at a high school in Ashburn, Va. When it began to cry, Trump said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that baby, I love babies. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. I like it. What a baby, what a beautiful baby. Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. The mom\u2019s running around \u2014 don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d", "People applauded. One minute later, though, the baby began to cry again. This time, the mother quickly decided to take the baby out of the room. Trump, looking in our direction, appeared to notice that she was on her way to the exit.", "And then he said, \u201cActually, I was only kidding. You can get the baby out of here. That\u2019s all right. Don\u2019t worry. I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I\u2019m speaking?\u201d He cupped his hand over his eyes to watch her leave. \u201cThat\u2019s OK, people don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s OK.\u201d", "A joke? Possibly. An insensitive, heartless, ordinary-person-embarrassing remark? Possibly. Trump\u2019s tone is eternally hard to read. But, to my eyes, it certainly was not an ejection \u2014 it was an unusually barbed endorsement of the mother\u2019s own decision to depart.", "One other salient fact is missing from all the pieces on babygate. Mom and baby, very much not kicked out, came back to their seat a bit later.", "Whatever Donald Trump may have said or meant,  he did not order that a crying child be removed from his rally, nor was the child or its mother required to leave.", "Dale, Daniel. \u00a0 \"No, Donald Trump Did Not Eject a Baby.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Toronto Star. \u00a0 2 August 2016.", "Halper, Daniel. \u00a0 \"Trump Loves Crying Baby, Then Kicks the Tot Out of His Rally.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Post. \u00a0 2 August 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
