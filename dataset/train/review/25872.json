["A border wall with Mexico is needed for security reasons, even though traffic coming through has stopped significantly, claimed President Donald Trump.", "Trump has threatened\u00a0a government shutdown if Congress doesn\u2019t pass a bill allocating funds for parts of his promised border wall, despite his campaign assurances that Mexico would pay for the costs.", "\"The wall is needed from the standpoint of security. The wall is needed from the standpoint of drugs -- tremendous, the drug scourge, what's coming through the areas that we're talking about,\" Trump said at an Aug. 28 press conference. \"As you know, I have General (John) Kelly here. We stopped traffic coming through, 78 percent. It's going to be, I think, 81 percent this quarter, which is a record.\"", "Trump also claimed that during past administrations \"if they stopped it just a little bit, like 1 or 2 or 3 percent, they consider that a great thing. We're up to almost 80 percent.\"", "Trump has made similar statements before about his administration\u2019s control of the southwest border, using different timeframes to claim the greatest success.", "Has the Trump administration \"stopped traffic\" at the border by 78 percent? Not exactly. The most commonly used metric to gauge illegal immigration is border apprehensions, and the most recent data available do not support the claim.

The agency did not get back to us by deadline with those detailed numbers.", "Comparisons of pounds seized (for each type of drug) from fiscal year 2016 to year-to-date fiscal year 2017 do not show a 78 percent change, either.
