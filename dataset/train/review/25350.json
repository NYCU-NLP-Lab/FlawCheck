["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "The Virginia Education Association has complained for decades that salaries for state teachers are below the national average.\n\nKitty Boitnott, president of the 60,000-member organization, made the claim during an April 20 interview with WVTF Public Radio in Roanoke about merit pay for educators.\n\n\"The General Assembly has offered numerous times to get our teachers into the national average, and we\u2019re certainly nowhere near that, and yet now we\u2019re going to offer limited incentives to just a handful of people,\" Boitnott said. \"That doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\"\n\nWe examined her claim that state teachers are paid below the national average.\n\nCarol Donohue, the assistant director of government relations for the Virginia Education Association, said Boitnott\u2019s information comes from a December 2010 report from the National Education Association.\n\nThe report shows that the average 2010-2011 salary for classroom teachers in Virginia was $51,559. That\u2019s about 9 percent lower than the average national public teacher salary of $56,069, according to the report.\n\nVirginia had plenty of company in paying its teachers below the national average. In addition to the Old Dominion, 34 other states had teacher salaries trailing the average, according to the NEA report.\n\nVirginia\u2019s average pay for teachers ranked 23rd-highest among states. The top average state-wide salary was $72,708 in New York, while the lowest was $35,201 in South Dakota.\n\nSo in raw dollars, Virginia\u2019s average teacher salary ranks near the middle of states.\n\nThe amount of money it takes to live comfortably in Virginia is going to be different than what it takes in New York or South Dakota. So we looked at where Virginia ranks in cost of living.\n\nVirginia was the 26th most expensive state to live in during the last quarter of 2010, according to a report by the Missouri Department of Economic Development.\n\nIn other words, Virginia ranks in the middle of state both in teacher salaries and cost of living.\n\nThe VEA has long argued that Virginia is wealthy and can afford to pay teachers better than most states. Higher salaries, it argues, would help Virginia recruit and retain the best instructors.\n\nWe looked at Virginia\u2019s ability to pay more, turning to data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nIn 2010,Virginia\u2019s per capita income was $44,762 -- the seventh highest among the states.\n\nSo it\u2019s a logical argument that Virginia has greater ability than most states to pay teachers more. Virginians have higher salaries than most Americans. Their cost of living, meanwhile, ranks in the middle of states.\n\nBut we digress. Boitnott said Virginia pays its teachers below the national average and we owe you a rating on that.\n\nHer statement is True.", "WVTF Public Radio interview with Kitty Boitnott, president of the Virginia Education Association, aired on April 20, 2011.\n\nInterview with Carol Donohue, assistant director of government relations at the Virginia Education Association, April 20, 2011.\n\nNational Education Assocation\u2019s Rankings & Estimates report, December, 2010.\n\nVirginia Department of Education\u2019s 2010-2011 teacher salary survey, January 12, 2011.\n\nBureau of Economic Analysis, State Personal Income 2010, released March 23, 2011.\n\nInterview with Jeff Newman, economist with the Bureau of Economic Research, April 20, 2011.\n\nMissouri Economic Research and Information Center Cost of Living Data Series 4th Quarter 2010. \u00a0\n\nVirginia Education Association website.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
