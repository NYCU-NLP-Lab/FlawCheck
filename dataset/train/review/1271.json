While some service dogs may go through special training that teaches them to seek help if their owner is experiencing a medical emergency, not all service dogs will have been taught such discipline.", "The \u201cService Dog PSA\u201d was originally shared on the social media platform Tumblr by user lumpatronics on June 12, 2018, by a user who identified as Tessa Connaughton. The woman described falling down, and her dog going off to seek help. Although the fall was \u201cawful but ultimately harmless,\u201d the original poster went on to say that she had epilepsy, and that her service dog was trained to find help if she was having a seizure.", "\u201cIf a service dog without a person approaches you, it means the person is down and in need of help,\u201d she wrote.", "The post subsequently went viral in June 2018 and was reported by several media outlets. It later became a Twitter moment when user @lissalet reshared the Tumblr PSA. (However, the original Twitter post has since been deleted, according to Twitter.)

These animals may also lie next to their owners during a seizure to prevent injury while others may stand nearby to break a fall and prevent injury. Such dogs can also be trained to press alarm buttons or devices that call for help, and open and close doors, and find someone to help.", "It is important to note that seizure response dogs are not the same as seizure alert dogs, which some people claim can predict when a seizure is coming.
