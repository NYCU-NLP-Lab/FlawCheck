["Though the job market is bleak for some, a Republican assemblywoman claims Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s proposed income tax cut promises a brighter future.\n\nBettyLou DeCroce, a Republican representing parts of Morris, Essex and Passaic counties, recently penned a column touting Christie\u2019s proposal to reduce personal income tax rates by 10 percent over three years.\n\n\"We need to build momentum with an across-the-board tax cut to boost the recovery and give New Jersey a competitive advantage in attracting new jobs to our state,\" DeCroce wrote in an April 8 column in the Gloucester County Times.\n\n\"While the country\u2019s economy was battered, nine states with no income tax actually grew jobs from 2001 to 2010. If states without an income tax added jobs during the Great Recession, imagine how many more jobs New Jersey can grow by reducing taxes during the recovery. The next job created could be yours,\" she said.\n\nWith several tax cut plans swirling around Trenton, DeCroce\u2019s claim caught our attention. Have states with no personal income tax fared better than the nation on job growth?\n\nThe nation lost more than two million jobs from 2001 to 2010, according to federal labor data. On average states without a personal income tax experienced job growth, but two of those states lost jobs. And the connection between income taxes and job growth is murky.\n\nAlaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming do not levy a personal income tax. New Hampshire and Tennessee only tax interest and dividend income.\n\nGreg Volpe, a spokesman for the Assembly Republicans, pointed to a Wall Street Journal article from February about governors pushing to cut or abolish their state\u2019s personal income tax and a report from the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group based in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe group\u2019s 2012 report found that on average the nine states without personal income taxes experienced employment growth of 5.36 percent during the last decade.\n\nBut New Hampshire and Tennessee actually lost jobs during the same time frame. And other states the report identified as having high personal income tax rates, such as Hawaii and Maryland, gained jobs from 2001 to 2010.\n\nDeCroce called those states \"statistical outliers\" and said in a written statement they \"do not change the fact that states with no personal income tax were more successful in creating jobs than high-tax states during the last decade.\"\n\nBut Richard Pomp, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut and state taxation expert said, \"you can\u2019t bury bad news with good news. You have to take those as contradictions. Right away it shows you it\u2019s not uniform. There\u2019s more going on than just whether there\u2019s an income tax or not.\" Pomp noted population growth and natural resources as other factors.\n\nAlan Auerbach, professor of economics and law at University of California, Berkeley, said in an e-mail that grouping states without a personal income tax is \"OK if one wants a summary measure of growth in those states, but the exercise of trying to explain growth differences using just one factor doesn't make a lot of sense, particularly when one is considering a relatively short period of time.\"\n\nDeCroce said although others \"may have different economic opinions, I still believe the best way to grow jobs in New Jersey is by reducing government spending and cutting income taxes.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nDeCroce said in an opinion column: \"While the country\u2019s economy was battered, nine states with no income tax actually grew jobs from 2001 to 2010.\"\n\nA conservative group found that on average states that don\u2019t levy personal income taxes had more job growth during the past decade than the national average.\n\nBut the absence of an income tax isn\u2019t the only factor driving growth. In fact, two of the nine states without personal income taxes lost jobs between 2001 and 2010. And two states the conservative group points out as having high personal income tax rates gained jobs during the same decade.\n\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "The Gloucester County Times, To add jobs, give everyone in N.J. an income tax cut, April 8, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Greg Volpe, spokesman for the New Jersey Assembly Republicans, April 11, 2012\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, The Heartland Tax Rebellion, Feb. 7, 2012\n\nAmerican Legislative Exchange Council, Rich States, Poor States, 2012\n\nInternal Revenue Service, States Without a State Income Tax, accessed April 9, 2012\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment, Hours, and Earnings - State and Metro Area, accessed April 9, 2012\n\nOklahoma Council of Public Affairs, Eliminating the State Income Tax in Oklahoma:An Economic\nAssessment, November 2011\n\nInstitute on Taxation and Economic Policy, \"High Rate\" Income Tax States Are Outperforming No-Tax States, February 2012\n\nThe Tax Foundation, State Individual Income Tax Rates, 2000-2012, Feb. 16, 2012\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey, Conservative group claims Stephen Sweeney gave New Jersey the nation\u2019s highest income tax rates, driving out jobs, Oct. 31, 2011\n\nThe New York Times, South and West See Large Gains in Latest Census, Dec. 21, 2010\n\nThe Times of Trenton, Opinion: Cutting N.J. income tax will grow the state's economy, March 8, 2012\n\nInterview with Richard Pomp, professor of law at the University of Connecticut School of Law, April 12, 2012\n\nE-mail interview with Alan Auerbach, professor of economics and law at University of California, Berkeley, April 12, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
