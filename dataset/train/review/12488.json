["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on December 23, 2020 | Updated on December 23, 2020", "A TV ad from Republican Sen. David Perdue\u2019s campaign claims a supposed \u201cChina scandal\u201d involving his challenger, Democrat Jon Ossoff, \u201ckeeps getting worse.\u201d But it\u2019s the distortions of the facts that are getting worse, not any \u201cscandal.\u201d", "The ad claims Ossoff \u201ccould face federal investigation,\u201d but there\u2019s no indication of that. The only support for the claim is a Dec. 8 letter the Georgia Republican Party sent to the Senate Select Committee on Ethics asking for an investigation. We asked the Georgia GOP whether the committee had responded to the request, and a spokeswoman declined to answer.", "The Georgia GOP is asking the committee to investigate a rival candidate in the middle of an election, and Perdue is using that request to make the improbable claim that there could be an investigation. Perdue and Ossoff are facing off in a Jan. 5 runoff that will help determine which party will control the Senate.", "The issue concerns Ossoff\u2019s financial disclosure reports. He didn\u2019t disclose some payments received by his broadcast production company in his May filing, but amended the report to include the additional payments two months later, in a July report. We wrote about this in November.", "The Senate Select Committee on Ethics \u201cdoes not have authority to investigate allegations made against candidates,\u201d\u00a0Bryson B. Morgan, a member of the law firm Caplin & Drysdale who previously was investigative counsel for the House\u2019s Office of Congressional Ethics, told us in an email. \u201cInstead, the Committee\u2019s jurisdiction extends to \u2018the conduct of individuals in the performance of their duties as Members of the Senate, or as officers or employees of the Senate,'\u201d he said, citing the committee\u2019s \u201cRules of Procedure.\u201d", "Abigail Sigler, a spokeswoman for the Georgia GOP, told us: \u201cCandidates for US Senate are required to file financial disclosures with the Senate Ethics Committee, and therefore it falls under their jurisdiction.\u201d", "But she didn\u2019t answer whether the committee had responded to the request, and Morgan, who advises candidates and officeholders on matters involving the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, told us the committee \u201carguably would have jurisdiction\u201d if Ossoff wins the election. But even then, \u201csuch an investigation is extremely unlikely,\u201d both because the committee \u201crarely conducts investigations\u201d and the issue is moot. Ossoff \u201cproactively corrected the issue by filing an amendment,\u201d Morgan said.", "The Georgia GOP\u2019s letter claims Ossoff \u201cwillfully and knowingly failed\u201d to disclose \u201cties to controversial companies,\u201d but there\u2019s no evidence Ossoff willfully left out the information in the May report. The Ossoff campaign said it was \u201ca paperwork oversight\u201d that was \u201crectified\u201d in the July amended filing. The GOP letter asserts voters \u201cwere left in the dark\u201d during the primary, which was held on June 9.", "As we wrote in November, Ossoff\u2019s production company received payments from a Hong Kong media company and Al Jazeera for the rights to air investigative pieces. Ossoff is managing director and CEO of Insight TWI, a London-based documentary and TV production company. Republicans have misleadingly claimed Ossoff got cash from \u201cChinese communists and terrorist sympathizers.\u201d", "The Perdue campaign ad, which began airing on Dec. 19, according to AdImpact, revisits the issue, claiming the \u201cscandal \u2026 keeps getting worse.\u201d But the only new development is the Georgia GOP\u2019s letter asking for an ethics investigation.", "In Ossoff\u2019s May 15 financial disclosure filing, he listed 21 TV or broadcasting groups around the world from which Insight TWI received more than $5,000 in compensation in the past two years. Two months later, on July 10, Ossoff filed an amended report that included 32 TV or broadcasting groups that had paid Insight TWI.", "Those that he had left out of the initial report included PCCW Media Limited in Hong Kong and Al Jazeera Media Network in Doha, Qatar.", "The Perdue ad focuses on the payment from the Hong Kong company, claiming Ossoff was \u201cpaid by the communist Chinese government through a media company.\u201d It cites an October Townhall article that says PCCW is \u201cpartially owned by China Unicom, a company maintained by the Chinese government.\u201d", "The\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0reported\u00a0in 2009 and 2010 that the state-owned China Unicom\u00a0was the second-largest shareholder of PCCW, behind owner Richard Li.", "So, a partly state-owned company paid Ossoff\u2019s company to air TV segments. Ossoff\u2019s campaign says there was another layer of separation in the transaction. Miryam Lipper, a spokesperson for the campaign, told us Insight TWI, which \u201cconducts international investigations that have exposed corrupt officials, organized crime, and war criminals around the globe,\u201d licenses its documentaries to both TV stations and distributors. In the case of PCCW, TWI licensed documentaries to the distributor Sky Vision, which then licensed two investigations of Islamic State war crimes to PCCW.", "\u201cTWI would never have sold anything to PCCW directly, just received a royalty check from Sky Vision,\u201d Lipper said, when we wrote about this issue before.", "The campaign has since said that royalty payment was about $1,000. That\u2019s below the reporting requirement. The Senate financial disclosure forms ask about \u201ccompensation of more than $5,000 from a single source in the two prior years.\u201d", "In response to questions about Perdue\u2019s ad, Lipper told us: \u201cJon fully discloses the TV stations and distributors in dozens of countries and on every continent that have aired his company\u2019s work. Revisions to financial disclosures to ensure they are accurate and complete are totally normal.\u201d", "The Ossoff campaign points out that Perdue has amended his financial disclosures many times over the years. Perdue\u2019s financial disclosures show he amended his reports every year from 2014 to 2018, often more than once per year.", "The Perdue ad claims Ossoff \u201ctried hiding\u201d the payments from PCCW and \u201cgot caught, then lied.\u201d But Ossoff disclosed the payments himself in July. Articles about the payments from PCCW and Al Jazeera appeared afterward, based on Ossoff\u2019s amended report.", "John Burke, a spokesman for the Perdue campaign, told us Ossoff \u201chid this information\u00a0from voters in his own party,\u201d since it was disclosed after the Democratic primary. As for lying, Burke said Ossoff had \u201cchanged his story,\u201d but the evidence doesn\u2019t support that. Ossoff\u2019s campaign said the omission was \u201ca paperwork oversight,\u201d and now the campaign says the payment from PCCW was actually below the threshold of reporting requirements. Lipper\u00a0told\u00a0the\u00a0National Review\u00a0that both statements were true.", "As for the ad\u2019s claim that \u201cnow Ossoff could face federal investigation,\u201d as we said that\u2019s unlikely and based only on the Georgia GOP\u2019s request for an investigation.", "Lipper, with the Ossoff campaign, told us this was \u201can utterly false and desperate complaint, which will go nowhere.\u201d", "She added: \u201cThis is a laughable partisan smear by David Perdue and his allies to distract from the actual federal investigations Perdue has been under this year.\u201d", "According to a Nov. 25 New York Times article, the Justice Department this spring looked into Perdue\u2019s stock trades, but closed the case without filing any charges.", "Eugene Kiely contributed to this story.", "Updated, Dec. 23: We updated the story to include information from the Perdue campaign.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
