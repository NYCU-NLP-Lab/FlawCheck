As such, we rated the claim Mostly False.", "Economists agreed that Wisconsin\u2019s economy was caught in the same economic crash that crippled the entire country.

And, as we have noted previously, a Commerce secretary\u2019s influence would be even smaller.", "But even if all that were set aside, and the RGA is right to attach all of Doyle\u2019s second-term numbers to Burke, what about the other side of the coin? After all, she also served during Doyle\u2019s first term. Shouldn\u2019t those be included as well?", "The state gained 86,530 jobs in Doyle\u2019s first term from 2003 through 2006, so when combined with the losses of the second term, the final score for Doyle\u2019s eight years was a \u00a0loss of 47,000 jobs.", "Not good.
