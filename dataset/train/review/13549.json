The Incas ruled the Andean regions of South America from 1400 to 1533.", "Professor Alan Covey from the University of Texas, an archaeologist specialising in the Incas, said although there is evidence the Incas and the Aztecs both engaged in human sacrifice, there is a lack of evidence to support the specific claim in the misleading Facebook posts.", "\u201cI don't think there was evidence for epidemics before Europeans arrived, and the ones that reached highland Mexico (smallpox, 1520) and the Andes (possibly smallpox, c.1525) killed a lot of the native nobility, who were living in cities, possibly including the current Aztec and Inca rulers,\u201d he told AFP by email on September 30, 2020. \u201cNo description that I am aware of mentions sacrificing rulers.\u201d", "University of Alabama Professor of Mesoamerican Anthropology, Richard Diehl, said there was no evidence to support the claim in the misleading posts.", "\u201cThe fact is that epidemics never existed in pre-Columbian America,\u201d he said in an October 1 email. \u201cThe ancestors of the Native American left the Old World long before any such \"crowd diseases\" came into existence and so the infectious organisms never existed in the Americas until imported by the Europeans and their African slaves in the late 1400s and early 1500s. So no, they did not sacrifice their leaders.\u201d", "In response to the misleading posts, Dr John Verano from Tulane University, who primarily researches prehistoric populations of coastal and highland Peru, said: \u201cThis is not correct for any New World civilization I know\u201d.", "\u201cYes, there were societies who practiced human sacrifice in Mexico and Mesoamerica and in the Andes, but they did not choose their leaders as sacrificial victims. Important enemies, yes, but not their own,\u201d Dr Verano said in an email on October 1, 2020.", "Camilla Townsend, Rutgers University's Professor of Latin American history, said: \u201cAncient Native American peoples did NOT sacrifice their leaders in times of epidemic\u201d.", "\u201cWhat is true is that a number of indigenous cultures sometimes sacrificed prisoners of war. They believed that the ultimate gift to the gods was the gift of human life--and they also wanted to make a political point to their enemies,\u201d she said in an October 1 email to AFP.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
