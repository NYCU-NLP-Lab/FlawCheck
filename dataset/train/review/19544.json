A strong advocate of eugenics, Sanger preached mass extinction of \u2018inferior races\u2019 by \u2018mass abortions.\u2019\"", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Attending the meeting in New Jersey involved a complicated process that included driving to a secret location, according to her autobiography.", "We didn\u2019t find any photos showing Sanger at that meeting.", "And there\u2019s no evidence that the KKK image shared in the Facebook post had anything to do with Sanger. It was taken during a Ku Klux Klan ritual in Georgia on Jan. 1, 1930, according to Getty Images. In the Facebook post, the photo has been altered to make it look like Sanger is in the frame along with a sign welcoming her to the meeting. However, the original photo shows a white cross where this doctored image makes it look like Sanger is standing. There is no sign referencing Sanger in the original photo either.", "Gizmodo reported in 2015 that the altered image was created in 2006 as part of a contest from an anti-Sanger blog. \"The blog contest, unsurprisingly, was pretty specific,\" Gizmodo says in the story. \"Since there are no photos of Sanger addressing the KKK, people were supposed to create art commemorating the event.\"", "We rate this image False.", "Facebook post, May 15, 2020", "PolitiFact, Did Margaret Sanger believe African-Americans \u2018should be eliminated\u2019?
