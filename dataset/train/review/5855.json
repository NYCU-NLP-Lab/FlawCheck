["As North Korea continues to try the West\u2019s patience with a series of nuclear and missile tests, President Donald Trump is touting the success of tightening sanctions against the rogue nation.", "Referring to a conversation he had with South Korean president Moon Jae-in, Trump tweeted on Sept. 17, \"I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!\"", "Is it true that there are \"long gas lines forming in North Korea\"? We checked with several experts and reviewed the fragmentary news reporting out of Pyongyang.", "Gasoline supplies do seem to be short in North Korea these days, and the White House provided one article that cited long lines in April. But the unusual nature of the country\u2019s top-down system of control and its minimal levels of car ownership suggest the idea of \"long gas lines\" is exaggerated.", "I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!", "The White House told us that the remark referred to the sanctions package against North Korea approved by the United Nations on Sept. 11 that, in part, \"reduces about 30 percent of oil provided to North Korea by cutting off over 55 percent of refined petroleum products.\"", "It\u2019s unclear whether these particular sanctions could have acted quickly enough to show up on North Korean streets within a week. But they did provide one article citing long gas lines in North Korea, well before the most recent round of sanctions. It was an Associated Press dispatch from April that said in the wake of the initial gas shortage, \"lines at other stations were much longer than usual and prices appeared to be rising significantly.\"", "There is strong evidence that North Korea has been facing gasoline shortages this year.", "NKNews, an independent news outlet with operations in Seoul, London and Washington, reported that petroleum and diesel prices are \"far higher than usual\" in North Korea this year.", "The April price spike began amid \"rumors\" that China had been considering a halt of all crude oil sales, NKNews reported. The publication also reported that the government in September imposed \"new restrictions against customers filling up jerry cans to buy extra supplies, while a number of gas stations were reported as being closed in the city.\" All told, gas prices have more than doubled this year, data from NKNews shows.", "That said, more recent coverage suggests that lines at gas stations aren\u2019t widespread. The NKNews article cautioned in its headline, \" \u2018Long gas lines\u2019 not forming in North Korean capital, sources say.\" The Washington Post concurred, writing that Trump\u2019s long gas lines claim \"has residents puzzled.\"", "So how can gasoline be in short supply in North Korea without many signs of lines forming at the pump? To explain, let\u2019s take a look at the hermit kingdom\u2019s unusual relationship with the automobile.", "A \"traffic lady\" in Pyongyang, North Korea, in 2008. (Wikimedia commons)", "Personal automobiles in North Korea are rare. They are primarily for government or military use, or by the very richest members of the elite. Private citizens typically can\u2019t own cars unless they have government ties.", "\"You are more likely to know somebody with a private jet than a North Korean is to know somebody with a car,\" Car and Driver magazine wrote in 2010", "There is some anecdotal evidence that the number of cars in North Korea has risen in recent years, possibly due to a spike in the registration of privately purchased vehicles under the name of state enterprises, according to the publication DailyNK. But car ownership rates remain low in comparison to most countries.", "The combination of legal obstacles and high costs put cars out of the reach of ordinary North Koreans, who live in one of the world\u2019s poorest nations. So, despite the increase in automobile use, the Associated Press reported from the capital of Pyongyang in December 2015 that \"it\u2019s unusual to have more than a dozen or so cars waiting behind a red light at any time of day, in any part of the city. At night, the roads remain virtually empty.\"", "The size of the vehicle fleet in Pyongyang is so modest that it\u2019s easy to spot examples from a 1974 purchase of Volvo 144 sedans that are still puttering around the city. (North Korea never ended up paying for them, and Sweden is reportedly still tabulating interest on the purchase in the vain hope that the debt will be settled one day.)", "A billboard for Pyonghwa Motors in a Pyongyang park in 2007. The ad shows a Pyeonghwa Hwiparam, the North Korean version of the Fiat Siena. (Wikimedia commons)", "Not that North Korean drivers would have many places to go if they did have access to cars. By land area, North Korea is about 20 percent bigger than South Korea, yet it has less than 1 percent of South Korea\u2019s paved-road mileage. Even adding in unpaved roads, the North has only 26 percent of the road mileage that the South has.", "\"Public transport in the major cities is done by electrically driven buses, and many trucks in the countryside are converted to wood burning,\" said Erik van Ingen Schenau of the China Motor Vehicle Documentation Center in France. \"Outside Pyongyang, people have no cars, and the cars in Pyongyang are (driven by) the upper class, except for some taxis and government vehicles.\"", "Because of this, gas lines in North Korea mean something different than ones in the United States.", "\"They indicate not enough supply for non-regime elite \u2018luxury\u2019 use,\" said Joseph DeThomas, a former ambassador who now teaches at Penn State\u2019s School of International Affairs. \"It is not meaningless, but it may be less meaningful than would shortages of diesel for ground transport, kerosene for heat and air transport, and heavy fuel oil for power generation, industry and other similar needs.\"", "Trump referred to \"long gas lines forming in North Korea.\"", "North Korea does appear to be facing a gasoline crunch, with prices rising in recent months. But experts we contacted, along with media reports that appeared in response to Trump\u2019s tweet, uncovered little evidence of lines at the pump, likely because the North Korean government exerts such control over gasoline and automobiles that the impact of such shortages are far narrower than they would be in the United States.", "We rate the statement Half True", "Donald Trump, tweet, Sept. 17, 2017", "United Nations, sanctions package, Sept. 11, 2017", "CIA World Factbook entries on North Korea and South Korea, accessed Sept. 17, 2017", "NKNews, \"'Long gas lines' not forming in North Korean capital, sources say,\" Sept. 18, 2017", "NKNews, \"Ahead of possible oil embargo, fuel prices spike further in Pyongyang,\" Sept. 9, 2017", "Car and Driver, \"Cars from the \u2018Axis of Evil\u2019: North Korea,\" August 2010", "Associated Press, \"Pyongyang\u2019s once sleepy roads now filling with cars,\" Dec. 14, 2015", "DailyNK, \"Car ownership in North Korea on the rise,\" Feb. 12, 2017", "Washington Post, \"Trump\u2019s claim there were long gas lines in North Korea has residents puzzled,\" Sept. 18, 2017", "Associated Press, \"Pyongyang drivers scramble as gas stations limit services,\" April 21, 2017", "NPR, \"Fuel Shortages And The North Korean Economy, Explained,\" Sept. 18, 2017", "The Mirror, \"North Korea's only car maker unveils new range of 'luxury' motors that look remarkably similar to West's models,\" Dec. 30, 2016", "Email interview Scott Snyder, senior fellow for Korea studies and director of the program on U.S.-Korea Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, Sept. 18, 2017", "Email interview with Robert S.
