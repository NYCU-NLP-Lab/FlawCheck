But economists and federal agencies keep data on aggregate income growth that can tell us, on average, whether Americans\u2019 incomes are rising.", "To evaluate Clinton\u2019s claim, we\u2019ll start by looking at inflation-adjusted median household income, which takes into account rising prices when comparing average income levels across time.", "According to an analysis of U.S. Census Data performed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, median household income dropped from $57,843 in January, 1999, to $53,657 in January, 2014, the most recent period for which statistics are available. That\u2019s a 7 percent drop, and supports Clinton\u2019s assertion that Americans haven\u2019t seen their incomes rise over the last decade and a half.", "(These figures account for inflation by expressing income from both years in 2014 dollars.)", "Another way to measure whether Americans have \"had a raise\" would be to look at a narrower slice of the population: full-time workers over the age of 16. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis draws on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data to show median usual weekly earnings for these workers.", "In January, 2000, the average worker earned $334 a week. By January, 2015, that figure was $341 \u2013 a 2 percent increase.", "($334 a week equates to $17,368 a year, while $341 per week is $17,732. These inflation-adjusted figures are expressed in 2015 dollars.)", "As we\u2019ve explained before, we could judge Clinton\u2019s claim on this second figure, since it captures people who are employed full-time on a wage and salary basis and who could receive a \"raise\" as that term is commonly understood.", "That said, median household income is the broadest measure of income growth, and arguably the more appropriate one to use in this context.", "Many households receive at least a portion of their income from government transfer payments, such as Social Security, or from investments \u2013 income that isn\u2019t reflected in wages or salary data alone. Because median household income encompasses a wider range of income sources, it\u2019s reasonable for Clinton to base her statement on that measurement.", "Our ruling", "Clinton\u2019s campaign ad claims, \"Americans haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years.\" Inflation-adjusted median household income has indeed dropped 7 percent over that period, while earnings for wage and salary workers have increased a modest 2 percent.", "We rate Clinton\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis, \"Real Median Household Income in the United States,\" accessed Feb. 11, 2016", "Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis, \"Employed full time: Median usual weekly real earnings: Wage and salary workers: 16 years and over,\" accessed Feb. 11, 2016", "PolitiFact, \"Economy is 'too weak to raise income levels,' says Nikki Haley in State of the Union response,\" Jan. 12, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
