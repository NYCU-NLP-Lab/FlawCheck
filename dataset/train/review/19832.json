Chris Christie isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nThe governor defended the football coach, who recently left Rutgers University to become head coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in a Jan. 31 radio interview. Despite criticism about Schiano\u2019s 11-year tenure with the Scarlet Knights, Christie said the coach transformed the program from a \"laughingstock\" into a fierce competitor -- and in more than just athletics.\n\n\"Here's something that people never talk about with coach Schiano: Rutgers had the best graduation rate of any Division I football program in America. Now, when all you see is scandal all over college football, in 11 years you never saw it touch Rutgers. Not once,\" Christie said on New Jersey 101.5\u2019s \"Ask the Governor\" program. \u00a0\"And he graduated his kids from college, so those kids if they went on to the NFL like some of the folks who have gone on to the NFL and done really well, great. But the majority of them don't and for the majority who don't, he got them out of Rutgers with a Rutgers degree and I tell you, I bet you the parents of those kids love Greg Schiano because those kids now have a future because they have a college degree from a great university like Rutgers.\"\n\nThere\u2019s a reason people don\u2019t talk about Rutgers\u2019 football team earning the top graduation rate in its division: it never did.\n\nThere are 120 teams playing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association\u2019s Football Bowl Subdivision, formerly known as Division I-A.\n\nRutgers\u2019 Scarlet Knights play in the division\u2019s Big East Conference with seven other teams. The most recent data available on graduation success rates, which are calculated by the NCAA, ranks Rutgers at the top of its conference, but not the top of its division.\n\nAmong Football Bowl Subdivision teams, Notre Dame, Northwestern University, Rice University, Boston College, Duke University and the U.S. Naval Academy had higher graduation success rates than Rutgers.\n\nRutgers never topped its division in graduation rates under Schiano, but it\u2019s worth noting that in \u00a0five years, the team\u2019s NCAA graduation rate climbed from 55 percent to 89 percent.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment, but a spokesman for the Rutgers football program said: \"I would think he was referring to our APR, which he has commented on before.\"\n\nThe APR, or academic progress rate, is another measure of academic performance based on whether a student-athlete remains academically eligible and remains with the school.\n\nEmily Potter, a NCAA spokeswoman, said in an email that the academic progress rate is \"intended to be predictive of eventual graduation rates. Both should be important measures of academic success, and the higher that one of these measures is, the more likely it is that the other will also be high.\"\n\nBut, \"having said that, it is true that graduation is not included in the actual measurement of APR.\"\n\nRutgers grabbed the top spot in its division by that measure two years ago. Last year, Rutgers fell to the second spot in the academic progress rate rankings, behind Northwestern University in Illinois.\n\nDavid Ridpath, an assistant professor of sports administration at Ohio University, said in an email that \"Governor Christie is incorrect, but probably not intentional on his part\u2014still he should be more careful with his absolute statements.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nChristie claimed that \"Rutgers had the best graduation rate of any Division I football program in America.\"\n\nThe Scarlet Knights ranked at the top of their conference, but not the top of their division for graduation rates in the most recent data. During Schiano\u2019s tenure, the team never had the best graduation rate in the division. By another measure of academic performance, Rutgers football topped its division, but, according to a NCAA spokeswoman, graduation is not included in that calculation.\n\nWe rate the statement False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "New Jersey 101.5, Ask the Governor, Jan. 31, 2012\n\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, Division I Graduation Success Rates, accessed Feb. 1, 2012\n\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, Academic Progress Rate, accessed Feb. 1, 2012\n\nESPN, College Football Teams, accessed Feb 1, 2012\n\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, Academic Progress Rate: Rutgers University, 2009-2010, accessed Feb. 1, 2012\n\nRutgers University, Athletics & Recreation, accessed Feb. 1, 2012\n\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA grad rates top 80 percent, Oct. 25, 2011\n\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, Academic Progress Rate, accessed Feb. 1, 2012\n\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, Graduation Rates, accessed Feb. 1, 2012\n\nRutgers University, Rutgers Football Earns Prestigious #1 National Ranking in NCAA Academic Progress Rate, June 9, 2012\n\nThe Star-Ledger, Rutgers football ranks in top 10 in APR for fourth straight year, May 17, 2011\n\nThe Star-Ledger, Rutgers football finishes No. 1 nationally in latest Academic Progress Rate assessment, June 9, 2010\n\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA Academic Reform, accessed Feb. 1, 2012\n\nRutgers University, Greg Schiano Named Head Coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Jan. 26, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Jason Baum, associate athletic director/communications for Rutgers University, Feb. 2, 2012", "National Collegiate Athletic Association, Glossary of Terms, accessed Feb. 2, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
