["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on June 10, 2016", "Hillary Clinton said that Donald Trump cited hosting the Miss Universe pageant in Russia when \u201casked about his foreign-policy experience.\u201d That\u2019s not how the exchange went.", "Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier didn\u2019t ask Trump for an example of his foreign-policy experience. He tried to get Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, to say whether he had talked to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump wouldn\u2019t answer Baier\u2019s question, but he did say \u201cI know Russia well\u201d because \u201cI had a major event in Russia two or three years ago,\u201d referring to the 2013 Miss Universe pageant.", "Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, made the claim about Trump\u2019s foreign-policy experience during a June 6 campaign event in California (at 19:28 in the video).", "Clinton, June 6: He was asked about his foreign-policy experience. He said, \u201cWell, he had taken the Miss Universe contest to Moscow.\u201d", "She made a similar claim during a June 2 foreign-policy address where she attacked Trump on some of his foreign-policy positions.", "Clinton, June 2: He says he has foreign-policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia.", "In an email, the Clinton campaign pointed to a May 6 USA Today article with the headline, \u201cTrump Attributes Russia Knowledge To Hosting Miss Universe Pageant There.\u201d", "It would be accurate for Clinton to say, as USA Today did, that Trump said he has knowledge of Russia because he hosted a pageant there. Trump, who sold the Miss Universe Organization to the WME-IMG talent agency in 2015, held the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow.", "However, Trump didn\u2019t go so far as to say that that was an example of his foreign-policy experience, and Baier never asked him that question.", "Here is that part of the interview:", "Baier, May 5: About Russia, you were asked yesterday if you\u2019ve ever spoken to Vladimir Putin. And you said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to say.\u2019", "Trump: Yes, I have no comment on that. No comment. I was in Russia \u2014", "Baier: But one of the things people like about you is to answer any question.", "Trump: Yes. But I don\u2019t \u2014 let\u2019s assume I did. Perhaps it was personal. You know I don\u2019t want to \u2014 I don\u2019t want to hurt his confidence. But I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago. Miss Universe contest which was a big, big incredible event, an incredible success.", "Baier: OK. So we can say you talked to him.", "Trump: No. I got to meet a lot of people. And you know what? They want to be friendly with the United States. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we actually got along with somebody?", "At a Republican debate in November, Trump previously said that he knew Putin \u201cvery well\u201d because they were \u201cstablemates\u201d on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d But as we wrote, Trump and Putin did not appear on the show together because they were interviewed separately \u2014 Trump in the U.S. and Putin in Russia.", "This time, it\u2019s Clinton who is being misleading. She claims that Trump gave an answer to a question that he was never asked.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/63a70a4c-13a0-4554-b6d1-3857b6c744e4", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
