["About this rating", "In February 2016, an old rumor claiming that actor\u00a0Ato Essandoh had been killed during the filming of\u00a0Django Unchained began recirculating on Facebook in meme form.  The rumor held that Essandoh had been \"torn apart alive by dogs\" on camera, at the insistence of star Leonardo DiCaprio, in order to lend a sense of verisimilitude to the period film:", "This graphic was first shared on the internet shortly after the theatrical release of\u00a0Django Unchained in 2012, in reference to the following chilling scene:", "At the time, Ato Essandoh debunked his own death hoax on Twitter:", "The actor also discussed the death hoax in an interview with City Beat\u00a0in July 2013:", "(Dealing with the death hoax) was fun because I was just on Twitter and somebody tweeted me that and I just about to dismiss it \u2014 I was like oh, that\u2019s so stupid \u2014 and then I saw that there were like 500 comments, people who were like, \u2018Is this true? Did Leonardo DiCaprio kill this poor boy? Did he sacrifice himself?\u2019 Are you kidding me? So I just started tweeting. Once you get my snark going, I\u2019ll just start snarking it up all over Twitter. So that was one of the best things that\u2019s happened in my career, I guess \u2014 people thinking I\u2019m dead!", "Rumors about\u00a0Ato Essandoh's death at the hands of Leonardo DiCaprio, Quentin Tarantino, and a dog weren't true when they first circulated in 2012, and (unsurprisingly) still weren't true when they came around once again, nearly four\u00a0years later.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
