["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 12, 2020", "Campaign officials for President Donald Trump and supporters have promoted the\u00a0faulty\u00a0claim that Joe Biden received nearly 100,000 votes in Georgia\u00a0through ballots that only included selections for president, suggesting it\u2019s \u201csuspicious.\u201d But the claim ignores that some voters do not vote a straight-party ballot.", "Social media posts spread by Trump campaign officials suggest that voter fraud may have occurred in Georgia, based on the claim that President-elect Joe Biden secured nearly 100,000 votes through ballots that were \u201cONLY\u201d cast for Biden \u2014 and not for any candidates in other races.", "But that claim rests on a flawed assessment of vote tallies.", "The claim has nevertheless been passed along by thousands through various social media posts in recent days.", "\u201cNothing suspicious about this at all!\u201d one of President Donald Trump\u2019s sons, Donald Trump Jr., wrote with a retweet of a post spreading the claim. Both tweets have since been deleted.", "\u201cIn Georgia, ballots where the voter ONLY voted for President: \u2022 Trump: 818 \u2022 Biden: 95,801,\u201d the post read. The tweet came from an account using the name \u201cSarah Hucklebee\u201d that was made to look like an account for former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.", "The claim was put forward in a Nov. 10 video by Steve Cortes, a Trump campaign adviser, in which he outlined what he deemed a \u201cstatistical case\u201d demanding further \u201cinvestigation.\u201d", "\u201cBiden, though, a 95,000 vote differential \u2014 there were almost 96,000 people in Georgia, allegedly, who voted Biden-only and then did not vote for Senate,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cThat seems far too wide to be believable.\u201d", "We don\u2019t know how many voters only voted for Biden, but Cortes\u2019 number doesn\u2019t represent that.", "Instead, the figure refers to the fact that Biden won almost\u00a0100,000 more votes in Georgia than Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff. But it\u2019s faulty to assume that all of those votes must have been on ballots for Biden only, ignoring that some voters in the state selected Biden for president but didn\u2019t adhere to a strictly party-line vote for the Senate.", "As of early Nov. 12, there were\u00a04,992,420 votes\u00a0counted in the presidential race in Georgia. While the total number of votes fluctuates across other races \u2014 since, indeed, some people don\u2019t cast a vote for every race \u2014 there were\u00a04,945,792 votes counted in the Senate race between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Ossoff.", "That\u2019s a difference of 46,628 total votes \u2014 or almost half of what\u2019s being alleged in the viral posts.", "The conservative National Review\u2019s Dan McLaughlin said the difference between the total votes cast for the presidential race and the Perdue-Ossoff contest renders \u201cthe 95,000 number \u2026 mathematically impossible.\u201d", "McLaughlin also pointed out that one could look to the election in Maine \u2014 where Republican Sen. Susan Collins received 55,468 more votes than Trump as of Nov. 12.", "That \u201cmeans that some voters went for Biden and Collins, as voters have been doing as long as there have been elections,\u201d McLaughlin wrote, later adding: \u201cSplit-ticket voting is not fraud, and there is nothing unusual about it.\u201d", "Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us in an email that it\u2019s \u201cdifficult to assess the accuracy of the factual claims being made\u201d about \u201cBiden-only\u201d ballots.", "\u201cHow do these folks know how many voters selected Biden or Trump for president but skipped the Senate race?\u201d he said. \u201cKnowing that would require individual-level information from ballots, not aggregation information about ballots cast in each race.\u201d", "Burden also said it\u2019s common that voters \u201cchoose a candidate at the top of the ballot and then \u2018roll off\u2019 as they move down the ballot. There is nothing suspicious about lower participation in lower level races.\u201d", "And \u201ceven in an era of strong partisanship, some voters split their tickets. That is precisely why aggregate totals can be deceptive when trying to reach conclusions about individual voter behavior.\u201d", "Gabriel Sterling, Georgia\u2019s voting system implementation manager, made note of many voters straying from party-line votes during a press conference on Nov. 9.", "\u201cThe other thing we\u2019ve discovered is, from our initial assessment, there was a lot of ticket-splitting going on,\u201d he said.", "Biden\u2019s lead in Georgia stood at about 14,000 votes on Nov. 12.
