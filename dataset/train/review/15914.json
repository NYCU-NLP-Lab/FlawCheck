["The state of Georgia is slated to finish its recount this week. If President-elect Joe Biden keeps his lead, he will end the presidential contest with a total of 306 electoral votes versus 232 for President Donald Trump.", "But some users on Facebook claim that isn't the real outcome \u2014 or even close to it. They based their claims on One America News Network, known as OANN or OAN.", "\"OANN ran the story...True Electoral Vote,\" a user wrote. \"Trump: 410, Biden: 128.\"", "Another user posted an image\u00a0of an electoral map that also shows Trump at 410 votes and Biden at 128 votes with the caption,\u00a0\"OAN reporting.\"", "The users have not responded to requests from USA TODAY for comment.", "Fact check:Dominion voting machines didn't delete votes from Trump, switch them to Biden", "One America News Network is a conservative cable network.\u00a0It was founded in 2013 by businessman Robert Herring and is led by his son Charles Herring, according to The Guardian.", "It has developed a reputation for airing baseless conspiracy theories and spreading false information, including about COVID-19.", "NewsGuard \u2014 a network of\u00a0journalists that evaluates\u00a0news sites for reliability\u00a0\u2014\u00a0urges readers and advertisers to \u201cproceed with caution\u201d with One America News Network,\u00a0per The New York Times.", "Specifically, it found that OANN \u201cseverely violates basic standards of credibility and transparency\u201d and regularly includes \u201cfalse or distorted information.\"", "It has also spread numerous\u00a0debunked claims since the election, including about election software by Dominion Voting Systems \u2014 which did not delete or change votes, per another fact check by USA TODAY.", "Fact check:Critics satirically redact Trump's tweet to make it falsely appear he admitted defeat", "The map that showed Trump at 410 votes and Biden at 128 was displayed in the middle of\u00a0a segment on the conspiracy theory that\u00a0the U.S. Army\u00a0conducted a raid in Germany to seize servers with election-related info.", "\"New reports claim the real results of the 2020 U.S. election were found on a computer server that was seized by the U.S. military in Frankfurt, Germany,\" the anchor is heard explaining in a clip of the segment on YouTube.", "Then, a tweet\u00a0with the\u00a0map flashes on screen as the\u00a0anchor explains that it is \"allegedly based off of the data from that server\" (though the tweet is only sourced to a defeated congressional candidate.)", "\"It shows a landslide victory for President Trump with 410 Electoral\u00a0College votes, including liberal strongholds California and Minnesota,\" the anchor concludes.", "The conspiracy theory about the seized servers\u00a0has been previously debunked by USA TODAY.", "The U.S. Army confirmed that there was no raid, and the software company in question, Scytl, explained that it does not currently\u00a0have servers in Germany.", "Chris Krebs \u2014\u00a0who was the\u00a0director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency prior to his firing on Tuesday \u2014\u00a0also debunked the claims on\u00a0Twitter.", "\"Election-related servers WERE NOT recently seized in Europe by the US Army contrary to #disinfo rapidly spreading across social media,\" he wrote on Saturday.", "More:Trump ousts Homeland Security cyber chief Chris Krebs, who called election secure", "Other fact-checkers \u2014 including the\u00a0Associated Press,\u00a0Reuters, PolitiFact, and The New York Times\u00a0\u2014 have also discredited claims about the raid.", "Since there was no raid, the map that individuals\u00a0claimed\u00a0came from the seized servers, which showed Trump at 410 and Biden at 138, is also fake.", "The map is also very unrealistic. As the anchor noted, it shows California turning red\u2014 when the state has been won by Democrats in every presidential contest since 1992.", "This time around, Biden received\u00a063.7%\u00a0of the vote in California, compared with 34.2% for Trump, according to the state website.", "Fact check:Story of Army raid to seize election servers in Germany is false", "Based on our research, the claim that the\u00a0actual electoral vote count has Donald Trump at 410 and Joe Biden at 128 is FALSE. Those numbers\u00a0are based on false reports that the\u00a0U.S. Army seized servers with election information on them in a recent raid in Germany. USA TODAY and other fact checkers have\u00a0already debunked those reports."]
