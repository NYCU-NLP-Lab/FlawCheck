["About this rating", "Myriad unfounded claims have been made of the UK\u2019s Cancer Act of 1939, a law which some critics of the modern medical industry have suggested is part of a conspiracy to prevent a cure for cancer from being discovered so that \u201cbig pharma\u201d can continue to profit from the disease unabated.", "In fact, the law prohibits any person from taking \u201cany part in the publication of any advertisement ... containing an offer to treat any person for cancer, or to prescribe any remedy therefor, or to give any advice in connection with the treatment thereof.\u201d The act had other provisions when first passed, but the advertising portion is the only aspect of the act that remains on the books:", "Because it arrived nearly a decade before the founding of the NHS [National Health Service], the [Cancer] Act also contained details about how local councils should provide treatment and other services for cancer patients. And there was a whole section explaining how money should be allocated around the country to buy supplies of a radioactive element called radium \u2014 a forerunner of the far more sophisticated radiotherapy treatments we have today.", "All but one of these sections have now been repealed or subsumed into other pieces of legislation, and only one \u2014 section four \u2014 still stands. [Put simply, that section] is a blanket ban on advertising cancer treatments to the general public.", "One meme on the subject appearing online attempts to state as fact that the actually prevents anyone from curing cancer by criminalizing that activity:", "First, since this law was passed by the British Parliament, no \u201cmedical practitioners\u201d are being prosecuted \u201cin America\u201d under the law.", "More important, the act in no way prevents people from developing or researching cures for cancer. In fact, UK-based entities frequently fund research into cancer cures. The Act merely bars anyone (including UK drug manufacturers) from advertising they have a product that will \u201ccure\u201d cancer.", "The Act also does not, as claimed by Cannabis-culture website Herb, make it \u201cillegal to promote, write about, or even speak about cancer therapies other than radiation.\u201d That claim apparently stems from the way the act defines an advertisement: \"In this section the expression 'advertisement' includes any notice, circular, label, wrapper or other document, and any announcement made orally or by any means of producing or transmitting sounds.\"", "While the definition of what constitutes an advertisement is broad, the Act applies to the \u201cpublication\u201d of an advertisement. The law was intended to protect patients from quacks and snake oil peddlers, a threat as real to cancer patients then as it is today. The few prosecutions that have taken place under the Act are in keeping with that spirit of the law.", "For example, a man named Jerry Sargeant, who calls himself \u201cThe Facilitator\u201d and purports to have the ability to edit \u201cpeople\u2019s karmic blueprints through distance healing\u201d (for the low price of \u00a390 per quarter hour), claimed in several YouTube videos that his skills allowed him to rid people of cancer. He was found guilty of four violations under the Act and fined \u00a34,700.", "In another example, a \u201clife coach and naturopathic doctor\u201d who calls himself Dr. Stephen Ferguson (who is not a medical doctor, but has a PhD in nutrition and hypnosis), claimed that multiple patients of his had been \u201ccured\u201d of cancer thanks to vitamin supplements and protein shakes sold on his website. He was fined \u00a31,750 for violating the Act.", "If, in a bizarre turn of events, an individual did actually discover smoothie-based or telepathic cures for cancer, they would be free under the Cancer Act of 1939 to publish about their discoveries in scientific journals, discuss them privately or in academic contexts, or to continue researching the concept. They would not, however, be allowed to present that information to the general public in advertisements in the United Kingdom.", "legislation.gov.uk. \u00a0 \"Cancer Act 1939.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 18 July 2018.", "Cancer Research UK. \u00a0 \"The 1939 Cancer Act: What Is It, What Does it Do, And Is It \u2018Suppressing the Cure\u2019?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 19 February 2016.", "gov.uk. \u00a0 \"Cancer Research and Treatment.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 18 July 2018.", "Teague, Christopher. \u00a0 \"Seriously, WTF: Have You Ever Heard Of The 1939 Cancer Act?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Herb. \u00a0 16 July 2016.", "parliament.uk. \u00a0 \"House of Commons Written Answers 12 June 2014\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 12 June 2014.", "Hartley-Parkinson, Richard. \u00a0 \"Man Who Says He Cures People Through Crystals and Star Magic Facing Jail.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Metro. \u00a0 20 September 2017.", "de Graaf, Mia. \u00a0 \"Bodybuilder Turned Harley Street Nutritionist Fined for Claiming He Could Cure Cancer With Diet and Fitness Techniques \"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Daily Mail. \u00a0 6 May 2014.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
