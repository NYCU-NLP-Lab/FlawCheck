["In response to the president\u2019s state of the nation address, a member of parliament questioned why most of South Africa\u2019s informal economy is \u201cin the hands of non-citizens\u201d. But the evidence does not back up his claim.", "Member of parliament Zungula\u2019s statistic was based on a small study of spaza shops published in the book KasiNomic Revolution: The Rise of African Informal Economies.", "However, both the author of the book and other experts said spaza shops don\u2019t reflect the informal sector in general.", "The most recent data shows that around 20% of the informal sector\u2019s workforce were migrants from outside South Africa.", "The debate on South African president Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s state of the nation address covered many topics, ranging from gender-based violence to education. It was held in parliament on 16 February 2021.", "Vuyolwethu Zungula, president of the African Transformation Movement, focused on the country\u2019s informal economy. This refers to businesses that are not registered in any way. According to Statistics South Africa, they are \u201cgenerally small in nature\u201d and usually \u201crun from homes, street pavements and other informal arrangements\u201d.", "\u201cIt can\u2019t be that more than 70% of the most basic level of the economy is in the hands of non-citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cPrioritising citizens in the informal economy and jobs is long overdue.\u201d", "How accurate was Zungula\u2019s claim? We checked.", "Zungula provided Africa Check with a number of documents in support of his claim. However, only one included a mention of 70%. This was a report on an interview, aired on talk radio station 702, with GG Alcock, an entrepreneur and the author of KasiNomic Revolution: The Rise of African Informal Economies.", "But the article stated that \u201cforeigners ... run about 70% of informal stores in South Africa\u201d \u2013 not that they own or control 70% of the informal economy.", "The origin of the statistic can be traced to a small survey conducted by Minanawe Marketing, published in Alcock\u2019s book. It stated that 70% of informal retailers, which sold \u201cfast moving consumer goods\u201d, were owned by foreigners. These informal stores, known as spaza shops, sell essential household items. (Note: The study and its methodology was not published.)", "Speaking to Africa Check, Alcock said there is a \u201cperception by many people that all township or informal businesses are spaza shops\u201d. But he said they only represented one part of the informal sector.", "The proportion of foreign-owned spaza shops does not reflect informal business ownership in general, Caroline Skinner, senior researcher at the University of Cape Town\u2019s African Centre for Cities, told Africa Check.", "\u201cEven within trade there is significant diversity beyond spazas,\u201d she said.", "Alcock told Africa Check that Zungula had previously contacted him about the informal economy, and shared an excerpt from his answers. In an email to Zungula in late January 2020, Alcock explained that \u201cthe Kasinomic economy is not dominated by immigrants or foreign nationals\u201d.", "\u201cAlthough migrant workers are increasing in number they still constitute a small share of the labour force,\u201d Zaheera Jinnah, a research associate at Wits University\u2019s African Centre for Migration and Society (ACMS) in Johannesburg, told Africa Check.", "She said that \u201cdata-light and emotion-heavy\u201d comments were likely to \u201cstoke fear and intolerance\u201d.", "According to the organisation\u2019s latest analysis, 5.3% of the South African labour force was born outside the country. This was based on data from Stats SA\u2019s 2017 quarterly labour force survey.", "The centre\u2019s analysis found that migrants were more likely to work in informal or precarious employment. Just over 27% of international migrants worked in the informal sector, compared to 15.7% of South Africans.", "Based on the available data, there were around 540,000 migrants working in the informal sector. This represented 20% of the total informal sector\u2019s 2.7 million people.", "Jinnah said hiring practices could result in some sectors of the informal economy becoming predominantly immigrant-run in particular places, or at particular times.", "The Gauteng City-Region Observatory, a partnership between the universities of Johannesburg and the Witwatersrand and the Gauteng provincial government, conducts a quality of life survey every two years.", "The observatory provided its most recent data from 2017/18 to Africa Check. In total 24,889 adults from all of Gauteng\u2019s 529 wards were surveyed.", "The results showed that 19.7% of business owners, 21.5% of full-time employees and 14.4% of part-time employees in the informal sector migrated to South Africa from another country.", "Dr Julia de Kadt, a senior researcher at the observatory, said it was important to note that the survey did not ask about citizenship status \u2013 only whether respondents were migrants.", "\u201cSome proportion of individuals who migrated to South Africa will have gone on to obtain South African citizenship,\u201d De Kadt said. \u201cConsequently, I imagine that if we were able to restrict our analyses to non-citizens only, the figures would be somewhat lower.\u201d", "Vuyolwethu Zungula, president of South African political party the African Transformation Movement, claimed that \u201cmore than 70%\u201d of South Africa\u2019s informal economy is \u201cin the hands of non-citizens\u201d.", "An analysis found that around 20% of people working in the informal economy in 2017 were born outside the country.
