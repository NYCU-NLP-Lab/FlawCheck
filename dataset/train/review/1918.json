["About this rating", "On Feb. 2, 2021, a picture was shared on Facebook that showed former U.S. President Donald Trump sitting at a desk while video conferencing. The Facebook user who shared it hinted that the photograph depicted Trump planning a military coup to take back the White House subsequent to moving to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, after his term in office expired on Jan. 20.", "The text accompanying the photograph in that Facebook post read: \"This is Trump\u2019s office in Mar-a-Lago. Look who he\u2019s talking to.\"  Another commenter said of the picture, \"The military is in control and we know who the real POTUS is and that he'll be back!\":", "Photo via White House", "On Jan. 17, the same Facebook user also posted that the U.S. military was \"occupying certain cities\":", "He now has all the evidence ... iron clad evidence, and Trump handed control over to the military.", "Did anyone really think that Trump would just roll over and accept this massive fraud?", "He's coming for all of them.", "Notice the military occupying certain cities?", "Game set. Match.", "That Facebook user also posted false information about \"election fraud\" and said that the former president won in a \"landslide\" victory.", "All of these ominous headlines and comments suggesting hinting that the military would take part in a coup to help get Trump back into the White House were false and misleading, though.  The photograph of Trump in Mar-a-Lago had nothing to do with the 2020 election or a 2021 military coup, as it was taken on Christmas Eve in 2017 and captured President Trump's extending Christmas greetings to the U.S. armed forces. The White House tweeted the picture at the time with a caption stating that Trump spoke with \"all five branches of the military\":", "On the same day, the Associated Press documented the president's 2017  Christmas Eve activities:", "President Donald Trump's first Christmas Eve in office was a busy one that unfolded like this: tweet against perceived adversaries, cheer U.S. troops spending the holidays overseas, play golf, chat with children anxious to know when Santa will bring their presents, eat dinner with the family and attend a church service.", "US President Donald J.

Always underappreciated, the military families. The greatest people on Earth.\"", "Trump briefly addressed members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard stationed in Qatar, Kuwait and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and patrolling the Strait of Hormuz in the Middle East.", "In sum, a picture taken in 2017 did not show Trump planning a military coup in 2021. For that reason, we rate this claim as being miscaptioned.", "Jordan Liles is a Senior Reporter who has been with Snopes since 2016.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
