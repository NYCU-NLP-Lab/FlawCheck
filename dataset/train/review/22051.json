She spoke on record about it to a magazine. They say that she took a polygraph test. What is the president\u2019s response to her allegations?", "Shah:\u00a0This allegation was asked and answered during the campaign, and I\u2019ll point you to those comments.", "Reporter: Was there some kind of settlement, some kind of hush money that was paid?", "Shah: Like I said, this matter was asked and answered during the campaign, and anything else could be directed to Michael Cohen.", "Jan. 30 \u2014 Appearing on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!,\u201d Daniels\u00a0denies signing a statement put out by Cohen on Jan. 12 in which she said she did not receive \u201chush money\u201d from Trump. \u201cThat does not look like my signature does it,\u201d Daniels says. \u201cI do not know where it came from.\u201d", "Feb. 13 \u2014 Cohen issues a statement to the New York Times\u00a0claiming that he paid Daniels and falsely saying he was not reimbursed by the Trump Organization.", "\u201cNeither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,\u201d Cohen\u2019s statement says. \u201cThe payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201d", "March 7 \u2013 At a press briefing, a reporter asks White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders \u201cdid the president approve of the payment\u201d to Daniels, and Sanders says that the president \u201cmade very well clear that none of these allegations are true.\u201d", "Reporter:\u00a0Sarah, you\u2019ve said repeatedly that we\u2019ve addressed our feelings on that situation, in regards to the Stormy Daniels payment. But specifically, can I ask, did the president approve of the payment that was made in October of 2016 by his longtime lawyer and advisor, Michael Cohen?", "Sanders:\u00a0Look, the president has addressed these directly and made very well clear that none of these allegations are true. This case has already been won in arbitration.

One more for you just on the Stormy Daniels incident. I\u2019m sure my colleagues have more questions on that. Could you state, categorically, that the president, his campaign, and the Trump Organization did not violate federal law \u2014 specifically, election law \u2014 regarding that payment?", "Shah: Well, I can speak for only the White House, and I can say, categorically, and obviously, the White House didn\u2019t engage in any wrongdoing. The campaign or Mr. Cohen \u2014", "Reporter: (Inaudible question.)", "Shah: Yeah. The campaign or Mr. Cohen can address anything with respect to their actions.

Trump says Cohen represented him on the \u201ccrazy Stormy Daniels deal,\u201d but the president goes on to falsely claim that Cohen did \u201cabsolutely nothing wrong\u201d because the payment wasn\u2019t made by campaign funds. (In a previous story, we explain why it could still be a campaign violation even if campaign funds were not used.

There\u2019s no campaign finance law?", "Giuliani: Zero.", "Hannity later in the interview asks if Trump knew about the payment.", "Hannity: Do you, the president didn\u2019t know about this?", "Giuliani:\u00a0He didn\u2019t know about the specifics of it, as far as I know, but he did know about the general arrangement that Michael would take care of things like this.
