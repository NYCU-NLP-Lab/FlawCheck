Although this show went off the air in 2015, Nickelodeon still produces \"news\" segments on social media.", "In January 2021, the children's network produced two segments related to Trump's second impeachment. The first covered the riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6:", "The second covered Trump's impeachment:", "Nickelodeon is not providing live coverage of Trump's second impeachment trial, the network did not digitally edit Sponge Bob Square Pants into the Senate chamber, and they did not release any of their signature green slime on any politicians.
