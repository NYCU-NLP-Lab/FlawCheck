["Nigerian media widely reported a misleading statistic from a survey on the number of women who wore wigs daily in the country.", "Widespread news reports said 81.8% of women in Nigeria wore wigs daily, according to a survey.", "The survey was conducted in three cities, with 1,100 women aged 18 to 35 interviewed.", "Experts said the location of the sample was too limited for the results to be meaningful.", "\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bIs almost every woman you meet in Nigeria wearing a wig? Yes, if you believe recent reporting by many of the country\u2019s reputable publications.", "This was for fashion purposes, many said, with the convenience of wigs and their ability to transform a person\u2019s look \u201cin seconds\u201d said to be behind the trend.", "But is the eye-raising statistic accurate?", "The reports all cited a study by the News Agency of Nigeria, the country\u2019s largest public newswire.", "The survey of 1,100 women aged 18 to 35 found that \u201cno fewer than eight out of 10 Nigerian women\u201d wore wigs daily.", "According to the reports, the survey found that 81.8% of respondents owned wigs and preferred them to sew-in weaves. Those who did not wear wigs (18.2%) said they were heavy.", "Some 54.5% owned one to three wigs and 45.5% owned six or more, so they could wear different wigs on different days.", "Africa Check contacted Anita Eboigbe, the agency reporter who conducted the survey. She said the research was done in December 2018 and January 2019.", "\u201cI conducted the survey in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no team involved in carrying out the survey. I practically carried out the survey myself.\u201d", "This was as part of a larger topic \u201ca friend\u201d was working on, Eboigbe said. \u201cNigerian ladies and wigs (which is the focus of my study) was more or less a subset of what my colleague was working on.\u201dEboigbe did not give details on how the survey was structured.", "But she did say she had \u201cfocused on working-class women in the three states\u201d.", "But the survey as reported could not apply to all of Nigeria, statisticians told Africa Check.", "The study should have considered at least two or three states in each of Nigeria\u2019s six geopolitical zones, said Tunde Akinoladokun, a retired statistician.", "\u201cThe result of the survey should not be generalised to all Nigerian women. She also didn\u2019t consider women in rural areas. Women who aren't working should have been included in the survey.\u201d", "Prof Abayomi Adebayo, a former dean of economics at the Obafemi Awolowo University agreed the sample used should have been more widespread.", "\u201cFor the fact that she only considered three states, I would say it is a study of major cities in Nigeria. We can't use the study to judge Nigerian women in general.\u201d", "The study should also have considered income levels in other states, Adebayo added.", "To generalise the result, the researcher would have needed to interview women across states, ages, income brackets and other key criteria, said Emmanuella Akarawak, a data analyst at the University of Lagos.", "Eboigbe said the headlines did not reflect the findings of the survey, which was still ongoing.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t cast the headline though, my editors did,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what I always ensure is that whenever I write a story the body is a true picture of my intentions.\u201d", "\u201cI know the headline should have included the states I mentioned, but that isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d", "A survey widely reported in the media claimed 81.8% of women in Nigeria wore wigs daily. Some 1,100 women aged 18 to 35 in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt were interviewed.", "But experts said survey results from only working class women in the three cities couldn\u2019t be said to apply to all the women in Nigeria.", "An expert said the researcher would have had to interview women across states, ages, income brackets and other key criteria to get a broader result.", "We therefore rate the claim as reported in the media as misleading.", "Please complete this form to receive the HTML sharing code.", "Africa Check values your trust and is committed to the responsible management, use and protection of personal information.
