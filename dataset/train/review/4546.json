Rand Paul, R-Ky., criticizes the missed votes of his GOP presidential foes and fellow senators, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Jan. 3, 2016.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., has had a light schedule", "NBC Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Paul why he hasn\u2019t hosted a public event since Dec. 16 in Nevada.", "Paul said he\u2019s been attending to other responsibilities, such as spending time with his family, performing pro-bono surgeries (he\u2019s an ophthalmologist), and hosting fundraisers \u2014 not to mention his job as a senator. Paul went after the voting records of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.", "\"I mean, I have a job as senator,\" Paul said Jan. 3. \"I'm one of the few of the candidates that actually shows up to vote. Both Cruz and Rubio are missing the vast majority of their votes. But I feel an obligation to the taxpayer that pays my salary.\"", "Critics have attacked Rubio\u2019s Senate voting record throughout the 2016 cycle, so we decided to dig in a little further and see how it compares to the records of Cruz and Paul.", "We found that Paul far overstated when he said Cruz and Rubio missed \"the vast majority of their votes.\"", "The votes", "Paul used his busy Senate schedule as an excuse for not hosting many campaign events in the latter half of December, but there wasn\u2019t too much going on at Capitol Hill during this time. The Senate has been in recess since Dec. 18 and won\u2019t be back in session until Jan. 11.", "Paul didn\u2019t specify a time frame, but his campaign sent over data for his, Cruz\u2019s and Rubio\u2019s Senate careers.

He\u2019s followed by Cruz at 12.4 percent and Clinton at 9.5 percent. Paul and Sanders have both missed closer to 4 percent.", "All five are far away from the median career absentee rate for all current senators, 1.7 percent. Santorum comes close with 1.9 percent.", "However, no candidate has missed a \"vast majority\" of his or her votes.", "Another way to interpret Paul\u2019s statement is that he is specifically referring to votes cast during the 2016 election cycle or in recent months.

Neither Cruz nor Rubio missed a majority in 2015 overall.", "Paul and Sanders have had a better voting record throughout the 2016 election so far than Cruz and Rubio, but Paul\u2019s statement inflates the gap.", "Our ruling", "Paul said \"Rubio and Cruz are missing the vast majority of their votes\" in the Senate.", "Paul has a point that he has a better Senate voting record than Cruz and Rubio.
