["About this rating", "An old image purportedly showing a group of recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals act burning an American flag took another lap around the internet in December 2017, after it was featured in a video posted to the \"USA Politics Daily News\" Facebook page:", "DACA RECIPIENTS DRAPED IN MEXICAN FLAGS BURN THE AMERICAN FLAG YET WANT AMNESTY???", "The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals act, or DACA, refers to people who entered the United States as minors without documentation and grew up culturally American; DACA allows them to obtain driver's licenses, work permits, and sometimes in-state tuition. The program is in what immigration officials call a \"wind-down\" phase after President Donald Trump announced he was ending the program, putting at least 800,000 people at risk for deportation.", "The \"DACA\" image has been circulating with similar claims since at least September 2017, but is from a protest more than a year before that. Repeat offender Truthfeed originally promoted this video in a since-deleted article which consisted of a few short sentences and the following tweet:", "This photograph was taken outside the California Republican Convention at the Hyatt Regency in Burlingame, California on 29 April 2016 by photographer Gabriella Angotti-Jones. The accompanying caption made no mention of the DACA program, the legal status of those pictured, and the burning object in the foreground was identified as a Trump pi\u00f1ata, not a flag.", "Angotti-Jones captured a second image of this event which more clearly shows the burning object. SFist also took several photographs of protesters burning the effigy:", "Photo Du Jour: Trump Pinata Burned In Effigy in Burlingame https://t.co/k3iOnJ4BZt pic.twitter.com/as2n03DAJ6", "\u2014 SFist (@SFist) April 29, 2016", "The claim that these protesters were participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program appears to have been completely invented by people trying to push a particular ideology. We read several different reports and found that DACA was not one of the focal points of this protest; rather,\u00a0 protesters were angered by some of the comments Trump had made about the Mexican community:", "Protesters linked arms on one side of the street blocking incoming traffic on Old Bayshore Highway, while a raucous crowd of several hundred people \u2014 some whose faces were covered with bandanas \u2014 waved Mexican flags on the other side of the street, chanting, \u201cShut down Trump.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s numerous controversial comments throughout his presidential campaign, including those specifically targeting Mexicans, have enraged the Latino community, and have even led to violence breaking out at his rallies.", "\u201cHis policies just aren\u2019t right,\u201d said Roberto Lopez, 21, who was dressed as a Mexican superhero with a mask. \u00a0\u201cJust the way he talks about people, about Latinos and immigrants.

That was around the same time that President Trump announced that he would end the program, making it appear that the image's miscaptioning was not just a misunderstanding, but instead overt propaganda.", "Barmann, Jay. \u00a0 \"Photo Du Jour: Trump Pinata Burned In Effigy.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 SFist \u00a0 29 April 2016.", "SF Gate. \u00a0 \"Protesters Descend on Burlingame to Rail Against Trump.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 30 April 2016.", "CBS. \u00a0 \"Trump Speech At GOP Convention In Burlingame Met With Protests.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 29 April 2016.", "Diaz, Alejandro. \u00a0 \"Trump Visit to Bay Area Meets With Fierce Resistance.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 El Tecolote. \u00a0 2 May 2016.", "LoBianco, Tom. \u00a0 \"Demonstrators storm California GOP convention to protest Trump.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN. \u00a0 30 April 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
