["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on May 5, 2016", "Donald Trump again has repeated the false claim that Hillary Clinton \u201cstarted\u201d the so-called \u201cbirther\u201d movement against Barack Obama in 2008.", "As we wrote last year, there\u2019s no evidence that Clinton or her campaign had anything to do with bogus claims that Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States and thus was ineligible to be president.", "What we do know, as we wrote\u00a0in November 2008, is that some of Clinton\u2019s most loyal supporters pushed that theory during that year\u2019s presidential campaign.", "Trump previously linked Clinton to the \u201cbirther\u201d movement during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2015. On Sept. 22, 2015, he tweeted, \u201cJust remember, the birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!\u201d\u00a0He made the claim most recently during a May 4 interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer.", "Trump, May 4: Do you know who started the \u201cbirther\u201d movement? Do you know who started it? Do you know who questioned his birth certificate? One of the firsts? Hillary Clinton. She\u2019s the one that started it. She brought it up years before it was brought up by me.", "But Trump\u2019s campaign has never provided any evidence that claims that Obama was not born in the U.S. originated with Clinton or her campaign.", "In 2011, Politico did publish an article on the origins of \u201cbirtherism\u201d that said that it began with Democrats, not Republicans.", "Politico, April 22, 2011: The answer lies in Democratic, not Republican politics, and in the bitter, exhausting spring of 2008. At the time, the Democratic presidential primary was slipping away from Hillary Clinton and some of her most passionate supporters grasped for something, anything that would deal a final reversal to Barack Obama.", "Philip Berg, a former deputy Pennsylvania attorney general and a self-described \u201cmoderate to liberal\u201d who supported Clinton, was among the first to file a\u00a0lawsuit over Obama\u2019s birth certificate. Berg\u2019s suit was dismissed on grounds that he had no legal standing to file it.", "But one of the authors of the Politico story, Byron Tau, now a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, told FactCheck.org via email that \u201cwe never found any links between the Clinton campaign and the rumors in 2008.\u201d", "The other coauthor of the Politico story, Ben Smith, now the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed, previously told MSNBC during a 2013 interview that the conspiracy theories traced back to \u201csome of [Hillary Clinton\u2019s] passionate supporters.\u201d But he said the theories did not come from \u201cClinton herself or her staff.\u201d", "On March 19, 2007, then Clinton adviser Mark Penn wrote a strategy memo\u00a0to Clinton that identified Obama\u2019s\u00a0\u201clack of American roots\u201d as something that \u201ccould hold him back.\u201d That memo, which was part of campaign documents featured in a September 2008 article in The Atlantic, cited Obama\u2019s \u201cboyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii\u201d as life experiences that made his \u201cbasic American values \u2026 at best limited.\u201d But Penn\u2019s memo did not question Obama\u2019s birthplace or his birth certificate. It advised Clinton to contrast her life experiences in middle America \u201cwithout turning negative.\u201d", "\u201cWe are never going to say anything about his background,\u201d Penn wrote.", "If Trump has evidence that proves otherwise, it is long past time for him to produce it.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a20417aa-cd2d-42fe-8976-65e60d11e742", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
