["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Unemployment in Wisconsin is stubbornly high, but the state overall has not fared as badly as some other states.\n\nThe most recent federal figures, from September 2010, put Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment at 7.8 percent -- below the national rate of 9.6 percent and double-digit rates such as Michigan\u2019s 13 percent and Nevada\u2019s 14.4 percent.\n\nBut rates can vary widely from place to place and group to group.\n\nIn an election-night TV interview, Marvin Pratt, the first African-American to serve as acting mayor of Milwaukee, focused in on black males in the city.\n\nPratt supported Republican Scott Walker in the 2010 race for Wisconsin governor and was asked at Walker\u2019s victory party why he had not backed Democrat Tom Barrett, who defeated him in the 2004 mayoral election.\n\n\"Fifty-two percent black male unemployment,\" Pratt said in the interview with WISN-TV, adding that other reasons included Milwaukee\u2019s high poverty rate and Walker\u2019s pledge to create 250,000 jobs in his first term as governor.\n\nPratt wasn\u2019t the first to make such a claim.\n\nLess than two weeks earlier, Milwaukee radio host Eric Von said on TV at the 4th Street Forum that the rate was \"50 percent or better.\" And the headline on an Oct. 25, 2010, Milwaukee Business Journal article(later reprinted by BlackAmericans.com and BlackVoices.com) read, \"Report: 53% of black males unemployed.\"\n\nThe number is startling. At 53 percent, the unemployment rate for black males in the city would be nearly seven times that of the state overall.\n\nAsked about the statement, Pratt told PolitiFact Wisconsin a person he trusts told him shortly before the TV interview that the black male unemployment rate in Milwaukee was 52 percent. He then checked with that person and told us the figure -- actually 53 percent -- came from a report by University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee urban studies professor Marc Levine.\n\nIndeed, Von\u2019s statement and the Business Journal article also trace back to the same October 2010 report by Levine, who is a senior fellow at UWM\u2019s Center for Economic Development.\n\nBut the official unemployment rate in 2009 for black males in metro Milwaukee, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 33.3 percent.\n\nSo, what\u2019s going on here?\n\nThe difference is what is measured by the federal government\u2019s official unemployment rate and what Levine terms the \"jobless rate.\"", "Federal approach\n\nThe federal government defines the unemployed as people over age 16 who do not have a job but are available for work and have actively looked for work in the prior four weeks. That is, people out of work and looking for a job.\n\nThe unemployment rate is not calculated by using the number of people who file claims for unemployment insurance benefits, but is based on responses to the government\u2019s monthly surveys of some 110,000 people across the country.\n\nIn the Milwaukee metropolitan area, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, the overall unemployment rate for 2009 was measured as 9.4 percent. When broken down, the rate for black males -- 33.3 percent -- exceeded the rate of 7.9 percent for white males and 11.2 percent for Hispanic males.", "Levine's approach\n\nLevine\u2019s approach counts people who are out of work and looking for a job -- and nearly everyone else.\n\nHe looks at everyone between the ages of 16 and 64, including those who choose not to work, such as homemakers and early retirees, and those who cannot work, such as those behind bars or with disabilities. It also includes those in high school or college -- even those going back to school for more education to get a better job.\n\nLevine\u2019s report focuses strictly on male \"joblessness.\" His approach puts the metro Milwaukee \"jobless\" rate for white males at 22.3 percent and 32 percent for Hispanic males. Like African-American males, those come in higher than the official numbers.\n\nLevine argues that the same approach is used by scholars such as Harvard University\u2019s William Julius Wilson. He says it is better because the official rate understates the number of people not working -- the federal measure does not include the long-term unemployed who have stopped looking for jobs.\n\nBut Levine\u2019s approach, which he began using in 1990, overstates the number. Indeed, with his approach the rate could never reach zero -- a point he concedes in the report.\n\nLevine\u2019s approach has been controversial even within UWM.\n\nIn December 2009, UWM\u2019s Employment and Training Institute criticized the 2009 version of Levine\u2019s joblessness report for what it said was his \"misuse of the \u2018jobless\u2019 statistic as a proxy for unemployment.\" \u00a0\n\nAccording to the institute, Levine\u2019s report counted 88 percent of 16- to 19-year-old metro Milwaukee black males as jobless, even though most of them were enrolled in school.\n\nIn response, Levine issued a 14-page rejoinder in which he quoted the sections of his studies that explain the differences between his jobless rate and the unemployment rate.\n\nWhat do others say?", "Yet that is what has happened, repeatedly, with those citing Levine\u2019s report.\n\nThe result is a distorted view of a serious problem -- one being tackled most recently by the African-American Male Unemployment Task Force, created in 2010 by the Milwaukee Common Council.\n\nLet\u2019s bring our work to an end.\n\nIn his effort to catalog Milwaukee\u2019s woes, former Acting Mayor Marvin Pratt said the city\u2019s unemployment rate among black males tops 50 percent. Pratt said he was relating the finding of a recent UWM study. But that study uses a broader \"joblessness\" measure than the conventional unemployment rate, and looks at the full metropolitan area, not just the city. As such, Pratt falls into a trap others have before him -- stating one measure as another.
