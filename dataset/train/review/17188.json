(AP photo)", "A fake news story that said former NSA contractor Edward Snowden had proof that terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden was enjoying a taxpayer-funded lifetime vacation in the Caribbean has resurfaced after several years.", "\"Edward Snowden: Osama bin Laden is still alive living in the Bahamas,\" read the headline on a May 13, 2017, post on AntiNews.in, a repository of wild-eyed conspiracy stories. It was flagged by Facebook users as potentially fake as part of the social media website\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.", "The post said Snowden told the Moscow Tribune that instead of killing the al-Qaida leader in May 2011, the United States set him up with a cushy retirement fund through the CIA payroll. As of 2013, it said, bin Laden is living with \"five of his wives and many children\" collecting more than $100,000 a month via a Nassau bank account.", "\"Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA\u2019s most efficient operatives for a long time,\" Snowden is allegedly quoted as saying. \"What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody\u2019s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.\"", "We could find no evidence that Snowden, who leaked classified information about the federal government\u2019s surveillance programs, has ever said such a thing about bin Laden. Snowden fled to Moscow to avoid espionage charges and has since given several interviews, but this post is fake.", "Versions of the story have appeared on many other websites over the last several months.
