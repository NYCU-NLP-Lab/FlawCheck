Investigators were soon on the scene and confronted with one of the most gruesome sights imaginable.", "\u201cThere was an elderly man in a wheelchair and he was missing all his limbs, and there were fresh wounds on his abdomen,\u201d said one of the horrified officers. \u201cWhen we questioned his wife, she admitted she\u2019d been cutting flesh off her husband for at least three years and eating it.\u201d", "Alleged cases of homegrown cannibalism of this type this do occur, but this particularly gruesome and shocking story received no attention from local news venues whatsoever, and for good reason: It's a complete fiction. News Insider doesn't publish real news. It describes itself, rather, as \"the second most infamous fauxtire & satire entertainment website in the world. If it's disturbingly funny, you will find it here.\"", "But whereas legitimate satire tends to boast at least a modicum of literary and socially redeeming value, this article is neither entertaining nor pithy. News Insider is part of a network of junk news websites whose aggressively lurid content appears calculated instead to garner monetizable clicks and shares on social media.

The Centerville Police Department posted the following on their Facebook page:\n\nEven more amazingly, the sheriff of another jurisdiction shared the News Insider article via his Twitter account, for which he was immediately, if politely, upbraided by the Centerville police:", "Sheriff Jones this is a completely false story designed as \u201cclick bait\u201d to draw people onto their website.
