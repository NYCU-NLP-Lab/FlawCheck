But even in 2015, it lives on.", "This myth has been debunked over and over and over again. We\u2019ve been fact-checking claims about this since 2007, the year PolitiFact went live. Yet it resurfaced Sept. 17, 2015 in Rochester, N.H., at a town hall event for Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump.", "An unidentified audience member asked the first question: What would President Trump would do about Muslims in the United States?

Our fact-checking has shown that Obama is a Christian.", "According to the president's memoirs and independent biographies, Obama became a Christian when he was in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. (He was not raised in any particular faith as a child.) Obama said the churches there impressed him with their commitment to social justice and the hope they gave to the poor. Several independent reports have documented Obama's church membership and faith life.", "In office, Obama has not attended one church regularly. Instead, he has worshipped at various churches in the Washington area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He also has attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat.", "PolitiFact has debunked claims in chain e-mails that he attended a radical Islamic school, that his political rise mirrored a biblical tale about the Antichrist, and that he took the oath for U.S. Senate on a Koran. All three earned our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.", "Why do so many people keep saying he's Muslim? One explanation is that there is genuine confusion about his religion because Obama has Muslim ancestors on his father's side and a traditionally Muslim middle name, Hussein. Another possible explanation\u00a0is that people who disagree with him politically and dislike the Muslim religion like to associate him with something they perceive to be negative.", "Born in Kenya?", "The audience member also said Obama isn\u2019t an American. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, back in 2011 and 2012, Trump argued that Obama wasn\u2019t really eligible to be president because he was born in Kenya, not the United States.", "This is also not true -- Obama was born in Honolulu.

In the call, we hear a very rough Swahili-to-English translation in which an elderly woman agreed to a leading question that Obama was born in Kenya and that she was present. But the grandmother and translator immediately, clearly and repeatedly corrected the answer to say that Obama was born in the United States, and she was not present. We rated Trump\u2019s claim False.", "Just this year, an image circulating on Facebook accused Obama of reaching back to his Kenyan roots for inspiration in choosing to drop President William McKinley as the namesake of America\u2019s tallest mountain.
