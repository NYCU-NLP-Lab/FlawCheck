["An image is currently circulating on social media with the claim that an \u2018Idea of India Conclave\u2019 to be held in New Delhi has lined up prominent speakers, most with a Left lineage, to discuss \u2018anti-Modi\u2019 topics. Among those who have shared it is Twitter user Satish Choubey with the caption:\u201c\u0939\u0930\u093e\u092e\u091c\u093e\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u0947\u092e\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u092c\u091c\u0947\u0915\u094d\u091f \u0926\u0947\u0916\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u0915\u092e\u0940\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093f\u0938 \u0939\u0926 \u0924\u0915 \u0917\u093f\u0930 \u0917\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u201c(See the subject of Hara*****\u2019s seminar and to what extent these bast**** have fallen- translated).

It claims that the seminar will begin with lighting of the lamp by the niece of Indian communist revolutionary Charu Majumdar, followed by invocation of \u2018Vande Marxism by a group of 45-year-old JNU graduates.\u2019", "Topics such as \u2018Modi \u2013 A Threat to the Idea of India\u2019 and \u2018Modi \u2013 Evil that Lights a Million Fires\u2019 would be discussed during the day-long seminar, according to the itinerary in the image. It also mentions names of Barkha Dutt, Yogendra Yadav, Arundhati Roy, Rajdeep Sardesai, Kavita Krishnan, Kumar Ketkar and Kashmiri separatists Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Yasin Malik and Syed Ali Shah Geelani among others as speakers. The image has been shared by social media users on Twitter and Facebook, mostly by right-wing accounts.", "Alt News did a reverse Google image search and found that the picture was shared on Reddit three years ago. Going through the comments section of the post redirected us to the original source of the image, which is part of a sardonic piece written by Anand Ranganathan for Newslaundry. It was published on August 26, 2014.", "The image created by Ranganathan was simply meant to be a joke. \u201cYou need to attend the Idea of India conclave and find out what these left-wing anti-BJP intellectuals are thinking \u2013 what are their plans for the future, so on and so forth,\u201d reads a passage from the article.", "Regardless of the satirical intention and the consequent absurdness of the write-up, there are enough clues in the image to betray its falseness.", "Firstly, there is no date mentioned as to when the seminar will be held. In the original image from the article, the date is mentioned as August 25, 2014 on the top. However in the image being circulated now, the date is absent.", "Secondly, it includes the name of former Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal as one of the speakers and has \u201c(via video link)\u201d written adjacent to his name. Tejpal was in jail on accusations of sexual assault at the time Ranganathan wrote the article. Perhaps, this is why he jocularly included \u201cvia video link\u201d in the text.", "Thirdly, the picture also includes the name of former Times of India editor Dileep Padgaonkar as one of the speakers. However, Padgaonkar is no more. He passed away in 2016.", "However, the ludicrousness of the idea and obvious markers in the image did not prevent some from believing it to be true and sharing it on social media.", "Barkha Dutt who\u2019s been listed as one of the participants of the conclave in the satirical post also tweeted the image terming it fake.", "Hey @free_thinker @boomlive_in @SMHoaxSlayer \u2013 fake news alert.
