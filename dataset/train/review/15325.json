["By Lori Robertson, Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on March 28, 2019", "In his first extended interview since the completion of the special counsel probe,\u00a0President Donald Trump repeated several false and misleading claims regarding the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.", "The FBI investigation began in late July 2016, and Robert S. Mueller III was appointed special counsel to oversee the inquiry on\u00a0May 17, 2017.\u00a0On March 24, Attorney General William P. Barr released a four-page memo summarizing the principal conclusions of a confidential report from Mueller on the investigation.", "Barr wrote\u00a0that \u201cdespite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign,\u201d the Mueller report concluded:\u00a0\u201c'[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u2019\u201d", "Three days later, the president strayed from the facts on various aspects of the yearslong probe in a lengthy phone\u00a0interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News.", "Trump said: \u201c[N]ow that they see the Mueller report, where you look at their finding \u2014 I mean, the finding was very, very strong. No collusion, no obstruction, no Russia, no nothing.\u201d", "The facts: According to Barr\u2019s memo, the Mueller report \u201cdid not draw a conclusion \u2014 one way or the other \u2014 as to whether the examined conduct [by Trump] constituted obstruction.\u201d Barr wrote: \u201cThe Special Counsel states that \u2018while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u2019\u201d", "Instead, \u201cfor each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as \u2018difficult issues\u2019 of law and fact concerning whether the President\u2019s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction,\u201d Barr\u2019s memo said. The attorney general\u00a0said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made the determination that the evidence is \u201cnot sufficient\u201d to establish that Trump committed obstruction of justice.", "Trump said: \u201cRussia, if they were at all for me \u2013 and by the way, if you look at all of the things, they were sort of for and against both, not just one way.\u201d", "The facts: That is misleading. As\u00a0we have written,\u00a0indictments\u00a0handed down in February 2018 against 13 Russians and three Russian organizations for interfering in U.S. elections show their efforts clearly sought to support Trump over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential general election.", "It\u2019s true that prior to the election, in May 2014, the Russian operation\u2019s aim was to \u201cspread distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general,\u201d the indictment says. And during the presidential primary in 2016, the Russians \u201cengaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.\u201d By the general election, the groups\u2019 efforts were clear and focused: to support Trump and oppose Clinton. According to the indictment, \u201cby early to mid-2016, Defendants\u2019 operations included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump (\u201cTrump Campaign\u201d) and disparaging Hillary Clinton.\u201d After the election, the Russian group went back to sowing discord on both sides of the political aisle, staging rallies both supporting the president-elect and protesting his election.", "Trump said: \u201cThe FBI said he wasn\u2019t lying, as I understand it, and if the Mueller group said he was lying, and you know what he has gone through, and what so many others have gone through.\u201d", "The facts: Trump is referring to a report from Republicans on the House intelligence committee. It said former FBI Director James Comey testified to the committee that when two FBI agents interviewed then-National Security Adviser Michael\u00a0Flynn at the White House on Jan. 24, 2017, they \u201cdiscerned no physical indications of deception\u201d and saw \u201cnothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them\u201d (see page 54). However, the report goes on to note that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe \u201cconfirmed the interviewing agent\u2019s initial impression and stated that the \u2018conundrum that we faced on their return from the interview is that although [the agents] didn\u2019t detect deception in the statements that he made in the interview \u2026 the statements were inconsistent with our understanding of the conversation that he had actually had with the [Russian] ambassador.\u2019\u201d", "In\u00a0an interview\u00a0before a House committee on Dec. 7, 2018, Comey clarified, \u201cMy recollection was [Flynn] was \u2014 the conclusion of the investigators was he was obviously lying, but they saw none of the normal common indicia of deception: that is, hesitancy to answer, shifting in seat, sweating, all the things that you might associate with someone who is conscious and manifesting that they are being \u2014 they\u2019re telling falsehoods. There\u2019s no doubt he was lying, but that those indicators weren\u2019t there.\u201d (See page 106.)", "On Dec. 1, 2017, Flynn\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0to making false statements to the FBI. Flynn admitted to lying to FBI agents about two discussions he had with Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, in December 2016 when Flynn was still a private citizen and before Trump took office.", "Trump said: \u201cThe night I won, they were all screaming \u2018lock her up, lock her up.\u2019 Look, she lost 33 \u2013 they deleted 33,000 emails, and they were \u2013 BleachBit. That\u2019s a big deal and it\u2019s a very expensive process, and almost nobody does it because it\u2019s so expensive. But that\u2019s the way you really get rid of it. So she deleted 33,000 emails.\u201d", "The facts: As\u00a0we have written, in December 2014, Clinton gave the State Department 30,490 work-related emails\u00a0that she sent or received while she was secretary of state. There were another 30,000 emails or so that were deemed personal by Clinton. Those were not turned over to the department. An outside contractor for Platte River Networks wiped Clinton\u2019s computer hard drive of all emails sometime between March 25 and March 31, 2015, according to the FBI. PRN used a\u00a0free\u00a0software program called BleachBit to delete the emails. During its investigation, the FBI recovered nearly 15,000 deleted emails that were not part of the 30,490 work-related emails that Clinton gave to the department. About 5,600 of the 15,000 emails\u00a0that were forensically recovered by the FBI were deemed work-related, but a \u201csubstantial number\u201d of them were near duplicates of emails that were already released to the public.", "More important, Comey said the FBI \u201cfound no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\u201d", "The State Department\u2019s policy allows its employees to determine which emails are work-related and must be preserved.\u00a0\u201cMessages that are not records may be deleted when no longer needed,\u201d according to the\u00a0department\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual.", "Trump said: \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to know that Russia or anybody else had no impact on votes. And that\u2019s very important for people to know. And that\u2019s been coming out, as you know, from every agency and everybody that\u2019s done it. So whether they tried, and how hard they tried, and President Obama knew, the bottom line is, they had zero impact on the election of 2016. And I\u2019m very happy about that.\u201d", "The facts: We know of no government agency that has concluded that the Russian efforts \u201chad zero impact on the election of 2016.\u201d An\u00a0October 2016 report\u00a0by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis found that \u201cRussian government cyber actors\u201d potentially targeted \u201cInternet-connected election-related networks\u201d in 21 states. But none of those states reported any evidence of altered voter data or ballots. However, reports from the director of national intelligence and Department of Justice indictments have detailed various other ways that Russians inserted themselves into the presidential election, and those reports specifically avoided commenting on whether those efforts ultimately swayed voters.", "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Jan. 6, 2017,\u00a0released\u00a0a\u00a0declassified intelligence report\u00a0that said \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.\u201d Among other things, the report said, Russian intelligence services gained access to Democratic National Committee computers for nearly a year, from July 2015 to June 2016, and released hacked material to WikiLeaks and other media outlets \u201cto help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances.\u201d The\u00a0report\u00a0itself stated that the intelligence community \u201cdid not make an assessment of the impact that Russian\u00a0activities had on the outcomes of the 2016 election,\u201d noting that the agency \u201cdoes not analyze US political processes or US public opinion.\u201d", "In a\u00a0Senate intelligence committee hearing\u00a0on Jan. 10, 2017, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper reiterated that the report \u201cdoes not \u2014 repeat does not assess the impact of Russian activities on the actual outcome of the 2016 election or draw any conclusions in that regard one way or the other.\u201d", "Indictments\u00a0handed down by the Justice Department in February 2018 against 13 Russians and three Russian organizations provided more detail about the Russians\u2019 efforts. The indictments allege a Russian conspiracy that involved using the names of U.S. citizens and companies to illegally buy political ads on social media and stage political rallies. The defendants were alleged to have employed hundreds of people for online operations, \u201cranging from creators of fictitious personas to technical and administrative support personnel, with an annual budget of millions of dollars,\u201d\u00a0Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein\u00a0said. As with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Rosenstein said, \u201cThere is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\u201d In other words, the indictment made no determination about that.", "Trump said: \u201cAs far as your other part of the question, in September, if you look, supposedly, the FBI told President Obama all about Russia trying to get involved in some form in the election. And he decided to do nothing about it because he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win. So he didn\u2019t want to do anything because he thought that Clinton was going to win and he didn\u2019t want to upset the applecart. But he knew about it. And the question is \u2013 one of the many, many questions, and this is probably not as big as other questions because you\u2019re talking about major, major treason and corrupt and all of the things. But one of the questions, why didn\u2019t he do something?\u201d", "The facts: As\u00a0we\u2019ve written, Obama\u2019s administration did \u201cdo something\u201d after being informed by the CIA in August 2016 about Russia\u2019s election interference.", "Obama\u00a0said he confronted\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin that September about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer servers, and three months later he\u00a0announced sanctions\u00a0against Russia for that reason.", "Prior to that, Obama said his \u201cprincipal goal leading up to the election\u201d was to have the Department of Homeland Security and the Election Assistance Commission work with states to prevent Russia from hacking into voting systems and tampering with registration rolls and ballots.", "In a\u00a0June 2017 congressional hearing, Jeh Johnson, Obama\u2019s second secretary of DHS, said: \u201cI can tell you for certain that, in the late summer, fall, I was very concerned about what I was seeing, and this was on my front burner all throughout the pre-election period in August, September, October, and early November \u2014 to encourage the states to come in and seek our assistance. And I\u2019m glad that most of them, red and blue, did.\u201d", "Johnson said there was no evidence that votes were changed in the election.", "Trump said: Well, when I said there could be somebody spying on my campaign, a lot of things happened. It was like \u2014 it went wild out there. They couldn\u2019t believe that I could say such a thing.\u00a0And as it turned out, that was a small potatoes compared to what went on.", "The facts: Trump\u2019s comment came in response to Hannity mentioning the\u00a0Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications in 2016 and 2017 from the FBI and Department of Justice for electronic surveillance on a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. Hannity said those approved FISA court orders \u201cgave a backdoor into your campaign for spying, which I know the media made fun of at the time, when you said it happened.\u201d", "First, Page wasn\u2019t with the campaign when the FISA surveillance requests were approved.\u00a0Page was a foreign policy adviser to the campaign for about six months, and he left in late September 2016, after\u00a0news\u00a0reports\u00a0that U.S. intelligence officials were looking into possible communications between him and Russian officials. The first FISA court order was issued to the DOJ and FBI in\u00a0October 2016, with three subsequent renewals.", "Second, Trump\u2019s claim about spying was decidedly different. He accused President Barack Obama of illegally wiretapping his phones. \u201cJust found out that Obama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory,\u201d Trump said in a series of tweets on March 4, 2017, calling his predecessor a \u201cBad (or sick) guy!\u201d and comparing his unsubstantiated allegation to Watergate. There\u2019s no evidence to support that.", "In a September 2017 court filing, the FBI and the National Security Division confirmed they had no record to support the president\u2019s comments.\u00a0\u201cBoth FBI and NSD confirm that they have no records related to wiretaps as described by the March 4, 2017 tweets,\u201d the Justice Department motion said.", "Trump said: \u201cBut these people, there were so many lies, and lies before Congress, which is just about the ultimate, sworn testimony where Comey told so much. And he leaked \u2013 he leaked classified information. Well, if somebody in our team leaked classified information, it would be years in jail.\u201d", "The facts: We\u2019ve\u00a0explained Comey has admitted\u00a0that, after he was fired as FBI director in May 2017, he shared with his \u201clegal team\u201d copies of four of the seven memos he had written about his interactions with Trump. But Comey said the four memos he shared were all unclassified at the time, including a February 2017 memo, which he instructed Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman to relay the \u201csubstance\u201d of to the\u00a0New York Times.", "In\u00a0that memo, Comey wrote\u00a0that when he met with Trump, the president brought up the FBI investigation of former National Security Adviser Flynn and said, \u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\u201d", "Comey\u00a0said he sent Richman\u00a0to the\u00a0Times\u00a0with that information with the hope that it \u201cmight prompt the appointment of a special counsel\u201d in the Russia investigation.", "In an April town hall event broadcast on CNN, Comey said\u00a0he had decided that only three of the seven memos he wrote contained classified information. However, when\u00a0all seven of Comey\u2019s memos were sent to Congress in April 2018, four of them had markings indicating they contained some classified information. That means one of the memos that Comey previously shared was \u201cup-classified,\u201d which refers to information that is retroactively deemed classified when documents are reviewed for public release.", "We don\u2019t know which memo that was, but we know it wasn\u2019t the one Comey told Richman to convey to the\u00a0Times. When that was made public, the memo was labeled \u201cunclassified//FOUO,\u201d which the\u00a0National Archives and Records Administration says\u00a0is used by some federal agencies for documents \u201crequiring a degree of control\u201d but does \u201cnot designate classified national security information.\u201d", "Update, Aug. 29, 2019:\u00a0The Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Inspector General issued a\u00a0report Aug. 29, 2019, that said Comey gave a copy of one memo (identified as \u201cmemo 4\u201d) to Richman with instructions to share the contents of the memo with a reporter. The FBI later determined that memo 4 \u201cdid not contain classified information,\u201d according to the report.", "\u201cWe found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the Memos to members of the media,\u201d the IG report said.", "Trump said: \u201cBut these were people [on Mueller\u2019s team] that contributed, most of them contributed to [Clinton\u2019s] campaign.\u00a0I mean, it was shocking to see it.\u201d", "The facts: Some of the lawyers who worked on the special counsel\u2019s team did make contributions to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, but not \u201cmost of them.\u201d", "As we\u2019ve written before, there were 17 team members, and five of them gave money to Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. Those five were:\u00a0Jeannie Rhee ($5,400), James Quarles ($2,700), Rush Atkinson ($200), Elizabeth Prelogar ($250) and\u00a0Kyle Freeny ($250),\u00a0according to contribution information available through the\u00a0Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 website.", "One other investigator on the team, Andrew Weissmann,\u00a0gave $2,300 to Clinton in 2007.", "Trump said: \u201cI mean, McCabe, his wife got hundreds of thousands of dollars. He was running the FBI and running all sorts of cases, and his wife got hundreds of thousands of dollars from essentially Clintons, from Clintons\u2019 closest friend. And then he ruled so favorably. I mean, he tries to say that he wasn\u2019t involved. I don\u2019t think too many people believe that.\u201d", "The facts: Trump\u00a0gives the false impression\u00a0that former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe was \u201crunning the FBI\u201d and its investigation of Clinton\u2019s emails when McCabe\u2019s wife was running for a Virginia state Senate seat and received nearly $700,000 in campaign contributions from political action committees affiliated with Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic governor of Virginia and a longtime friend and ally of Hillary and Bill Clinton.", "Jill McCabe\u00a0lost the election\u00a0against Republican incumbent Richard Black in November 2015. That was months before the FBI\u00a0promoted her husband\u00a0from associate deputy director to deputy director in February 2016, which is when he \u201cassumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails,\u201d according to an FBI spokesman quoted in a\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0article\u00a0about the campaign donations.", "That is backed up by a\u00a0June 2018 report\u00a0from the Department of Justice inspector general that says: \u201cThe fact that McAuliffe supported Dr. McCabe\u2019s campaign, and was a known associate of Hillary Clinton, did not create any connection between the Clinton email investigation and Dr. McCabe\u2019s financial interests. Indeed, by the time McCabe became Deputy Director and assumed supervisory responsibilities for any Clinton-related matters, Dr. McCabe had already lost her election, and no developments in the Clinton-related matters could have any plausible impact on Dr. McCabe\u2019s financial interests.\u201d", "\u201cOnce the campaign was over, officials said, Mr. McCabe and FBI officials felt the potential conflict-of-interest issues ended,\u201d the\u00a0Journal\u00a0reported. The article also noted that \u201cany final decisions on that probe\u201d about Clinton\u2019s emails were made by Comey, who was then FBI director.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
