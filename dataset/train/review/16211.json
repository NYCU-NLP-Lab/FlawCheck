He said, \u201cI had shot the video around 8:30 am when I saw this crowd of students at the station.

Currently, 230 special trains were made operational and the government is in talks with the Railways to start more special trains in high demand areas.", "Donate Now", "Jignesh is a writer and researcher at Alt News.
