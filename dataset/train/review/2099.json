However, several political Facebook pages and groups shared the post without specifying the humoristic intentions of the article.", "This screenshot of data from the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle shows the social media pages and groups which shared the article.", "Comments found on these posts suggest certain users took the information seriously.", "Such comments reflect a resentment towards the UN that was also seen in the lead-up to the signing of the Global Compact for Migration.
