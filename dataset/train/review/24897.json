["By Rem Rieder", "Posted on April 14, 2020", "The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action has been running an ad falsely suggesting President Donald Trump called the coronavirus outbreak a \u201choax.\u201d", "At the beginning, the ad splices together two quotes to have Trump saying, \u201cThe coronavirus, this is their new hoax.\u201d It is obvious in listening to the ad that he said, \u201cThe coronavirus,\u201d and, \u201cthis is their new hoax,\u201d at different times. His voice sounds quite different in the two segments.", "But on the screen, \u201cThe coronavirus, this is their new hoax\u201d appears as a single sentence.", "Trump did use the word \u201choax\u201d but his full comments, and subsequent explanation, make clear he was talking about Democratic attacks on his administration\u2019s handling of the outbreak, not the virus itself.", "On April 13, the Trump campaign sued WJFW-NBC of Rhinelander, Wisconsin, for defamation for running the ad, which has been running in some version in swing states almost continually since March 24, according to Advertising Analytics, at a cost so far of about $2.5 million.", "A 15-second version of the ad also appears online as part of a digital ad campaign.", "After Priorities USA Action launched its $6 million ad campaign on television stations in the swing states of Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in late March, the Trump campaign warned the stations not to run the ads to \u201cavoid costly and time consuming litigation.\u201d", "In addition to the misleading \u201choax\u201d segment, the ad features a series of statements in which Trump downplayed the risk of the coronavirus outbreak. These quotes are accurate.", "As we have reported, the \u201choax\u201d kerfuffle began at a Trump rally in South Carolina on Feb. 28. At one point Trump said, \u201cAnd this is their new hoax.\u201d But he did so in the context of assailing Democrats for trying to politicize what the Democrats saw as his administration\u2019s shortcomings in combating the crisis.", "Trump, Feb. 28: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, \u201cHow\u2019s President Trump doing?\u201d They go, \u201cOh, not good, not good.\u201d They have no clue. They don\u2019t have any clue. They can\u2019t even count their votes in Iowa. They can\u2019t even count. No, they can\u2019t. They can\u2019t count their votes.", "One of my people came up to me and said, \u201cMr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.\u201d That didn\u2019t work out too well. They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They\u2019d been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning. They lost. It\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.", "The president, who often\u00a0dismissed\u00a0special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and his impeachment as hoaxes, portrayed the Democrats\u2019 criticism of his coronavirus policy as a continuation of a campaign to bring him down. Later in the rally, he referred to the coronavirus criticism as the Democrats\u2019 \u201csingle talking point.\u201d", "\u201cA virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn\u2019t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes and the Democrats\u2019 single talking point, and you see it, is that it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s fault, right? It\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s fault,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, just things that happened.\u201d", "Democratic presidential candidates were quick to pounce on Trump\u2019s \u201choax\u201d remark. Former Vice President Joe Biden described the president\u2019s comments as \u201cabsolutely bizarre.\u201d", "The following day, at a press conference, Trump reiterated that he used the term \u201choax\u201d in connection to the Democrats\u2019 attacks.", "Reporter, Feb. 29: You were down in Charleston last night, using the word \u201choax\u201d when talking about Democrats. Somebody now is dead from this. Do you regret that kind of talk?", "Trump: No, no, no. \u201cHoax\u201d referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we\u2019ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them, not \u2014 I\u2019m not talking about what\u2019s happening here; I\u2019m talking what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s the hoax. That\u2019s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it\u2019s the impeachment hoax or the \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia\u201d hoax. This is what I\u2019m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff.", "But the way they refer to it \u2014 because these people have done such an incredible job, and I don\u2019t like it when they are criticizing these people. And that\u2019s the hoax. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.", "The rest of the Priorities USA Action ad consists of statements by Trump dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus. As we have written, Trump made a series of such statements from Jan. 22 to March 10, and as recently as March 24 likened the disease\u2019s impact to that of the flu or automobile accidents.", "The ad has Trump saying, \u201cWe have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming in from China.\u201d That\u2019s what Trump told CNBC in an interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22.", "The ad continues with Trump saying, \u201cOne day \u2014 it\u2019s like a miracle \u2014 it will disappear.\u201d That\u2019s what Trump told a gathering of African American leaders at a meeting on Feb. 27.", "The next quote is, \u201cWhen you have 15 people and within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.\u201d Trump said this at a press conference on Feb. 26.", "\u201cWe really think we\u2019ve done a great job in keeping it down to a minimum.\u201d Trump said that at the same press conference.", "The ad also quotes Trump: \u201cI like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it.\u201d Trump said this, referring to medical issues, during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 6.", "And finally, the ad quotes Trump saying, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d That\u2019s what the president said at a press conference on March 13 when asked if he took responsibility for the federal government\u2019s lag in testing for the coronavirus.", "So the overwhelming bulk of the ad is on target. But the beginning is deceptive.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
