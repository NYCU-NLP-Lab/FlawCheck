Both in person and around the globe.\"", "Spicer offered a few \"facts\" to disprove media reports of low turnout, but many of them are misleading or inaccurate. His overall assertion that Trump\u2019s inaugural drew the \"largest audience\" ever is flat-out wrong.", "Infrastructure issues", "Spicer pointed to changes in infrastructure that gave the illusion of low turnout.", "It was the \"first time\" that floor coverings were used to protect the grass on the National Mall, which had highlighted empty spots in the inaugural crowd, an effect not experienced in past inaugurations, he said.", "But this is not the case. Floor coverings were also used in 2013, and floor coverings remained on the Mall during the Women\u2019s March on Washington the day after the inauguration.", "Spicer also blamed the \"first time\" usage of fencing and magnetometers on the Mall for \"preventing hundreds of thousands of people being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had inaugurations past.\"", "According to a 2017 Congressional Research Service report, screening magnetometers, or metal detectors, have been used in past inaugurations, though it\u2019s not clear if they were placed on the Mall itself. The screening zones, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, did include two busy metro stops close to the Mall.", "Spicer\u2019s claim was also disputed by New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt, who tweeted that two unnamed law enforcement officials told him \"magnetometers were not used in the areas Spicer said they were on the Mall.\"", "Crowd size", "Spicer then knocked the press for tweeting out \"inaccurate numbers involving crowd size.\"", "\"No one had numbers because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out,\" he said. \u00a0\"We do know a few things. So let\u2019s go through the facts.\"", "\"We know that from the platform from where the President was sworn in to 4th Street holds about 250,000 people. From 4th Street to the media tent is about another 220,000. And from the media tent to the Washington Monument another 250,000 people. All of this space was full when the President took the oath of office.\"", "Many news organizations, including PolitiFact, have noted that it\u2019s difficult to gauge crowd size and that estimates are inconsistent. The National Park Service stopped tallying crowds on the National Mall in 1995 after a dispute over the attendance of the Million Man March.", "Spicer\u2019s claim of full spaces on the Mall -- which photographs contradict -- would give Trump a crowd size of at least 720,000, which is higher than preliminary estimates reported in the media but are on par with the 700,000 to 900,000 organizers expected to attend. The President himself touted 1.5 million on Jan. 21 at CIA headquarters.
