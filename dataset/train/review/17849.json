["Remember that time when former Florida congressman Alan Grayson quipped on the House floor that the Republican health care plan plan was \"don\u2019t get sick\" and, if you do, \"die quickly\"?\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce sure does.\n\nThe business lobbying group is using Grayson\u2019s words against him in an attack ad. The commercial is part of a broader Chamber campaign targeting Democrats over their support of \"Obamacare,\" including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson. (Read our fact-checks of the Nelson ad here and here).\n\nThis commercial compares Grayson to a literal broken record (remember records?) entitled Reckless, featuring House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The ad repeats his explosive lines from floor debate.\n\nNarrator: \"Reckless politicians gave us Obamacare. Alan Grayson was one of Obamacare\u2019s biggest cheerleaders. He\u2019d say anything.\"\n\nGrayson: \"Die quickly. The Republicans want you to die quickly.\"\n\nNarrator: \"Now we learn Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage.\"\n\nAnother record appears with Grayson\u2019s face on it, labeled \"Obamacare Unconstitutional.\"\n\nNarrator: \"And a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional. Will Alan Grayson change his tune on Obamacare, or be the same broken record?\"\n\nPolitiFact Florida already fact-checked the chamber\u2019s claim about 20 million people losing their current coverage in our review of the Nelson ad. We rated it a Pants on Fire, because it cherry-picks a worst-case-scenario statistic and strongly suggests seniors would lose Medicare coverage.\n\nHere, we\u2019re checking the ad\u2019s other claim that \"a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional.\" The Chamber includes this claim in another ad against Democrat Lois Frankel, running in Florida\u2019s 22nd District.\n\nGrayson is running in Florida's\u00a0new District 9 seat, which includes part of Orlando and parts of the district he lost in 2010 to U.S. Rep. Daniel Webster. At this time, Grayson is the only Democrat in the race.\u00a0\n\nFrom this moment on\n\nObama signed the Affordable Care Act into law May 23, 2010. It\u2019s been a long and winding legal path ever since.\n\nAt issue, for most plaintiffs, is the individual mandate, which requires all citizens to buy health insurance and takes effect in 2014.\n\nThe ACA Litigation Blog, launched by Santa Clara University law professor Brad Joondeph, keeps a spreadsheet of all lawsuits against the reforms on its website. By its count, 31 parties have filed lawsuits against the law, 12 of which have been dropped. Eight have reached the Supreme Court.\n\nOn the same day Obama signed the law, then-Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum filed a lawsuit on behalf of 13 states challenging the law. (Ultimately, 26 governors and attorneys general joined the suit.)\n\nTwo months later, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli sued the government over the law\u2019s implementation. At the end of 2010, a Virginia district judge appointed by Ronald Reagan ruled the individual mandate unconstitutional.\n\nFlorida re-entered the picture on Jan. 31, 2011. Pensacola-based U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson went further than the Virginia judge, declaring in Florida v. HHS\u00a0that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and \"inextricably bound\" to the rest of the law -- meaning the whole thing needed to be tossed out because of that faulty provision.\n\n\"The act, like a defectively designed watch, needs to be redesigned and reconstructed by the watchmaker,\" Vinson wrote in his opinion.\n\nVinson\u2019s decision on the individual mandate was upheld by a three-person panel at the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Aug. 12, 2011, though they reversed his recommendation to throw out the law. The case then moved up to the U.S. Supreme Court.", "Then a district judge in Pennsylvania ruled against the mandate on Sept. 13, 2011, but said the rest of the law could stand.\n\nThis brings us to the first misleading aspect of the claim. The tone and visuals of the commercial may lead viewers to think that because a Florida judge ruled it unconstitutional, the fate of Obamacare has been decided.\u00a0\n\nWhat the commercial doesn\u2019t mention is that the Supreme Court has the final say.\n\nThe court heard three days of oral arguments in March and could release a verdict by the end of June.\n\nMandate upheld elsewhere\n\nJudicial decisions on various challenges have not all been negative on the individual mandate.\n\nThree federal district judges -- all appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton -- have upheld the mandate since 2010. A judge in Detroit did so in an Oct. 7, 2010, decision. The next month, a federal judge in Virginia followed suit over a challenge from Liberty University. And on Feb. 22, 2012, a district judge in Washington\u00a0also deemed the individual mandate constitutional.\n\nAnd even though the U.S. Appeals panel in Atlanta isn\u2019t keen on the insurance requirement, its counterpart in Cincinnati went the other way.\n\nA Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals panel, by 2-to-1 approval, declared the provision a \"valid exercise of legislative power by Congress under the Commerce clause\" on June 29, 2011. That was consistent with a lower court\u2019s decision on a challenge by the conservative Thomas More Law Center.\n\nFighting back\n\nGrayson pushed back against the Chamber ad in a May 17, 2012, Orlando Sentinel column. He referenced a D.C. newspaper report saying Republicans have no plan to present a health care alternative this year.\n\n\"Which means that after almost four years of debate, the national Republican health care plan still is this: Don't get sick,\" he said, sticking by his old catchphrase.\n\nHe turned the commercial of \"brazen lies\" into a fundraising appeal to supporters, asking them to contribute to his \"Fight Back\" Fund.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe U.S. Chamber's ad says, \"A Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional.\" It\u2019s true that a Florida judge ruled parts of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. But the chamber fails to acknowledge that other judges have upheld it, and that the Supreme Court will have the final say this summer.\n\nTheir statement is accurate but needs additional clarification. We rule it Mostly True.", "YouTube.com, U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Alan Grayson ad\n\nOrlando Sentinel, \"My Word by Alan Grayson: Don\u2019t believe the Chamber\u2019s TV attack ads,\" May 17, 2012\n\nFactCheck.org, \"Chamber continues to mislead on healthcare reform,\" May 11, 2012\n\nCurrent.com,The War Room interactive timeline\n\nACA Litigation blog\n\nYoutube.com, Alan Grayson\u2019s \"die quickly\" speech, Sept. 29, 2009", "Interview with Blair Latoff, U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokesman, May 18, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
