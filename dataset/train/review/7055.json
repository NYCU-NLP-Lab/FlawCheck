["A report by K24, a private TV station, archived here by AFP, stated that 60-year-old Teresa Estes had agreed to undergo FGM before a traditional wedding\u00a0ceremony.", "Despite the practice\u00a0being illegal, FGM is still carried out by rural communities in Kenya, such as the Pokot community in the Rift Valley area.", "Estes had previously lived among the Pokots for almost a decade and decided to hold a traditional\u00a0wedding ceremony with her American husband in July 2019.", "But the erroneous report\u00a0stated that she agreed to undergo FGM as part of the ceremony.", "\u201cCheigar agreed to undergo the cut and fully immerse herself in Pokot culture,\u201d a journalist said, referring to Estes by her\u00a0supposed nickname \"Cheigar\".", "The video on K24\u2019s YouTube channel\u00a0was viewed more than 4,000 times, before it was later deleted.", "The description read: \u201cThey say home is what you make it. Two foreign missionaries of American origin living in Baringo county today caused a stir after they tied the knot under the Pokot culture, including undergoing Female Genital Mutilation in order to fulfill the marriage customs. The colorful ceremony attracted a huge turnout of eager residents who were curious to witness the cultural spectacle.\u201d", "The report also formed\u00a0the topic of a discussion on another television show on Switch TV posted on Youtube and generated\u00a0a number of articles that AFP has archived here, here, here and here.", "The same claims also spread on Facebook where they were shared as facts. Nairobinews, for instance,\u00a0posted a link to an\u00a0article on its Facebook page, which has more than 700,000 followers, archived here. It\u00a0has since removed\u00a0the story from its website.", "Other Facebook posts can be found here and here.", "Critical tweets shared\u00a0articles with similar claims and tagged Kenyan authorities, while some online users called for the couple to be deported.", "Visibly shaken,\u00a0Estes denied the claims that she herself had undergone FGM, which she said were humiliating and undermined her work.", "She said she\u00a0came to Kenya in August 2010 as a missionary and\u00a0had focused on preaching the gospel in the village of Chepungus, of some\u00a0500-600 residents. She said she\u00a0helped girls to avoid undergoing FGM and forced marriages.", "\u201cMy credibility as a person who rescues girls from FGM is totally destroyed,\u201d Estes said.", "Estes said she decided to hold\u00a0a traditional wedding ceremony\u00a0in the community\u00a0after marrying\u00a0Tony Estes\u00a0a year and a half ago.", "\u201cI have lived among these people for years and they consider me to be part of the family. So when my Pokot family heard I was getting married they wanted to have a Pokot wedding. I told my Pokot baba (father) that we will do the wedding but the dowry is just going to be symbolic. We will just have Tony buy a camel, bring gifts in some sodas and other things which\u00a0we would use to cater for the feast afterward, not a real dowry,\u201d she said.", "\u201cWe went through the traditional ceremony, they poured milk on us as a sign of blessing but I did not go through FGM,\u201d she said.", "\u201cFGM (female genital mutilation)\u00a0 is a barbaric practice that leaves young girls literally scarred for life.\u00a0 I help find sponsors to put the girls through school,\" reads a statement on\u00a0her website.", "A day after the reports of Teresa\u2019s circumcision were published, Kenya\u2019s Anti-FGM board released a statement saying the news report was incorrect.", "\u201cInvestigations by relevant government agencies has (sic)\u00a0established that there was a misrepresentation of facts in the purported case and FGM was not part of the ceremony as reported by a certain media house,\u201d the statement read.", "Estes is considering legal action against the K24 television station, noting that she has received no formal apology for the erroneous report.", "\u201cWhatever they did is defamatory. Deleting the video does not amount to an apology. If you slander you need to cover the apology the same way you covered the misleading one,\u201d said her legal representative who was also present during the interview.", "Estes also denied claims in the report that she had permanently settled among the Pokots. She told AFP that she visited regularly but did not live with them in their village.", "She said a\u00a0claim that her husband had lived among the Pokot for many years was\u00a0also incorrect and he had first visited Kenya in July, shortly before the ceremony.", "Kenya has officially advanced in the fight against FGM in recent years. The 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) gives the national prevalence of FGM as 21 percent, down from 27 percent in 2008/9 and 32 percent in 2003.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
