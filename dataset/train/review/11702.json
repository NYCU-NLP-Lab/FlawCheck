The text superimposed below claims that \u201cautopsies after the war proved that the 1918 flu was not a 'flu'\u00a0at all\u201d and that it was actually \u201ccaused by random dosages of an experimental 'bacterial meningitis vaccine'\u201d.", "The post goes on to claim: \u201cThe massive, multiple assaults\u00a0with additional vaccines on the unprepared immune systems of soldiers and civilians created a 'killing field'. Those that were not vaccinated were not affected.\"", "A similar claim was also shared hundreds of times by Facebook users from around the world\u00a0here, here and here. It also resurfaced in a TikTok video here in April 2022.", "The claim, however, is false.", "The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic is estimated to have infected about 500 million people, approximately one third of the world\u2019s population at that time. According to the\u00a0US Centers\u00a0for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0(CDC), \u201cthe vulnerability of healthy young adults and the lack of vaccines and treatments created a major public health crisis, causing at least 50 million deaths worldwide\u201d.", "The CDC says the pandemic was caused by the \u201cH1N1 virus with genes of avian origin\u201d.", "It states: \u201cThe 1918 influenza pandemic was the most severe pandemic in recent history. It was caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin. Although there is not universal consensus regarding where the virus originated, it spread worldwide during 1918-1919.\u201d", "Dr Peter Hobbins, a University of Sydney historian specialising in medicine and technology, told AFP that autopsies conducted after the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic did not show that an experimental bacterial meningitis vaccine caused the virus outbreak.", "\u201cMany autopsies were conducted in patients who died from 'Spanish' flu, which confirmed that the primary cause of death was the filling of the lungs with fluid, either due to the disease or to the body's over-active immune response to infection.", "\u201cThere was a clear link between the clinical syndrome of 'Spanish' flu and the autopsy presentation, and no suggestion that the deaths were due to a proposed experimental vaccine,\"\u00a0he said in the November 23 email.", "The real cause of the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic was a novel strain of Influenza A virus, Dr Hobbins said. He added that attempts around the world were made to create a vaccine, but at the time\u00a0it was unclear what \u201cthe causative agent was, as the microscopes in use were not powerful enough to see viruses\".", "Dr Hobbins estimates that between one quarter and one third of New Zealand\u2019s population was infected during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.", "New Zealand, Dr Hobbins added, had\u00a0no mass vaccination campaign against bacterial meningitis at the time.", "\u201cThis scale and intensity of infection could not have been caused by the proposed experimental 'bacterial meningitis' vaccination - partly because it did not exist, and partly because the only mass vaccination campaign underway at the time was against the influenza itself,\u201d he explained.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
