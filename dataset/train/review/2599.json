["Out of jail for the first time since August, Kyle Rittenhouse is garnering a new wave of attention.", "The 17-year-old from Antioch, Ill., had been held on a $2 million bond on charges he shot three people \u2014 killing two \u2014 during the Kenosha unrest that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake. In that time the Illinois teen has become something of a conservative celebrity, generating millions of dollars for his release and the ongoing legal case where his lawyers will argue he acted in self defense.", "Rittenhouse was released from custody Nov. 20, 2020, but we learned an array of new details the day before in a jailhouse interview with the Washington Post \u2014 including how he came by the gun used in the shooting.", "One widely shared Instagram post honed in on that detail Nov. 20, saying, \"Kyle Rittenhouse used his COVID-19 stimulus check to purchase the AR-15 he used in the fatal Kenosha shooting.\"", "Did the gun used in the streets of Kenosha really come from a federally-funded stimulus?", "The balleralert Instagram account that posted the claim cited the Washington Post as its source, and that is largely what the paper reported.", "The Nov. 19 story reads in part, \"The Post found that Rittenhouse, who was too young to buy a rifle, had arranged for an adult friend to buy the weapon for him using money Rittenhouse had received from a government stimulus program.\"", "That friend, 19-year-old Dominick Black of Burlington, Wis., purchased the weapon for him at an Ace Hardware store in Ladysmith, Wis., on May 1, 2020, according to a criminal complaint charging Black with two felony counts of intentionally giving a dangerous weapon to someone under 18, resulting in death. The gun was then stored at Black\u2019s stepfather\u2019s house in Kenosha, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.", "Here\u2019s how Rittenhouse described the purchase to the Post.", "\"I got my $1,200 from the coronavirus Illinois unemployment because I was on furlough from YMCA,\" he said. \"And I got my first unemployment check so I was like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll use this to buy it.\u2019\"", "This is where the matter gets a bit muddled.", "The Post reported generally that stimulus funds were used, while the Instagram post made a more specific reference to \"stimulus checks,\" which would reference the payments of $1,200 per person. And Rittenhouse appears to confuse the two in his statement.", "The stimulus checks approved by Congress in March were indeed for $1,200, but those are different from unemployment. Stimulus payments went to all adults under certain income limits, while unemployment benefits are paid only to those out of work \u2014 as Rittenhouse was, based on his furlough description.", "Rittenhouse told the Post he lived with his mother, a circumstance that would typically mean she claims him as a dependent on her taxes. That would make him ineligible for the $1,200 stimulus payment.", "Instead, it appears Rittenhouse was referencing several weeks of unemployment compensation approved through the CARES Act, said Washington Post Investigations Editor Jeff Leen. He said Rittenhouse\u2019s mother later told the paper that money for the gun came from \"special unemployment\" related to the pandemic.", "Rittenhouse had noted he was off work, and the act signed into law March 27 provided an extra $600 per week in unemployment through the end of July.", "Rittenhouse\u2019s attorneys did not return a phone call or email seeking clarification.", "An Instagram post says \"Kyle Rittenhouse used his COVID-19 stimulus check to purchase the AR-15 he used in the fatal Kenosha shooting.\"", "We don\u2019t have bank records or documents to concretely prove this, leaving us to take Rittenhouse at his word on the source of the funds.", "Rittenhouse did tell the Post he used $1,200 in coronavirus funds, but\u00a0he appears to confuse stimulus and unemployment payments.", "It\u2019s more likely Rittenhouse was referring to unemployment than the stimulus program itself, based on his life circumstances and description from him and his mother. That is indeed a \"COVID-19 stimulus,\" but not the one people would think of based on this post\u2019s description.", "We rate this claim Half True.", "Instagram post, Nov. 20, 2020", "The Washington Post, Kenosha: How two men\u2019s paths crossed in an encounter that has divided the nation, Nov. 19, 2020", "Dominick Black criminal complaint, filed Nov. 3, 2020", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 'I'm going to jail for the rest of my life': What Kyle Rittenhouse told the friend who supplied rifle used in the Kenosha protest shooting, Nov. 20, 2020", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 'I shot two white kids': New records detail Kyle Rittenhouse's surrender to hometown cops, path of AR-15 rifle used in Kenosha, Oct. 30, 2020", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Friend who bought rifle for Kyle Rittenhouse charged, Nov. 9, 2020", "Antioch Police Department, public records request", "Email exchange with Jeff Leen, Washington Post investigations editor, Nov. 25, 2020", "IRS, Economic Impact Payment Information Center \u2014 Topic A: EIP Eligibility, updated Oct. 26, 2020", "The Washington Post, IRS to begin issuing $1,200 coronavirus payments April 9, but some Americans won\u2019t receive checks until September, agency plan says, April 2, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
