["The latest baseless Wisconsin voter fraud claim centers on Rock County, where Eric Trump and other conservatives say they have uncovered votes that switched from President Donald Trump to President-elect Joe Biden.", "Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son and adviser, tweeted this claim late on Monday, citing a story earlier that night from The Gateway Pundit. That headline blared: \"BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: System \u2018Glitch\u2019 Also Uncovered In Wisconsin \u2013 Reversal of Swapped Votes Removes Lead from Joe Biden.\"", "Eric Trump and Gateway Pundit have both\u00a0circulated misinformation since the election, claiming voter fraud without evidence \u2013 or even in the face of clear evidence to the contrary.", "Rock County votes were accurately recorded.", "Here\u2019s what actually happened.", "Gateway Pundit\u2019s article claims the organization \u201cidentified approximately 10,000 votes that were moved from President Trump to Biden in just one Wisconsin County.\u201d", "The\u00a0site presents as evidence two screenshots from Fox News\u2019 election results showing Trump listed with 46,649 votes at 11:43 p.m. CST\u00a0on Nov. 3, compared with 37,133 for Biden. Those numbers then switched in a screenshot with a time of 11:57 p.m.", "Since current counts show Biden leading in Wisconsin by just 20,540 votes, the article notes switching those 9,516 votes back to Trump and away from Biden would make the state a virtual tie.", "But this projection makes sense only if Trump rightfully received those votes. And he didn\u2019t.", "The article does not include any discussion of why those votes flipped, or interviews with election officials. Here\u2019s what Gateway Pundit would have found if it had done that research.", "USA TODAY reached out to Gateway Pundit and Eric Trump for comment.", "More:Fact check: That spike in the Wisconsin vote tally was expected and legitimate, not fraud", "More:Fact check: Wisconsin has more registered voters than ballots cast", "Vote totals reported by The Associated Press create the stream of data used by Fox News and many other election websites on Election Day.", "For Rock County, Wisconsin, that stream showed a steady increase for both Trump and Biden from the first report around 8:30 p.m. CST until the last one just before midnight.", "When the final vote tallies were reported at 11:43 p.m. \u2013 after poll workers tabulated the absentee ballots \u2013 Biden\u2019s total jumped from 30,453 to 46,649, while Trump\u2019s jumped from 31,343 to 37,133. (That difference in absentee ballots is consistent with the rest of the state and nation, as Trump had repeatedly urged his supporters not to use mail-in votes\u00a0while Biden and Democrats had encouraged absentee balloting.)", "The Rock County Clerk\u2019s Office website shows those tallies for the two candidates and has not been updated since 11:43 p.m. on Election Day, Clerk Lisa Tollefson said.", "However, The Associated Press sent an update at 11:45 p.m. that transposed the numbers, wrongly assigning the 37,133 total to Biden and the 46,649 total to Trump. That was corrected minutes later to correctly show Trump losing by 9,516 votes.", "That data is entered by the AP based on the clerk\u2019s website, without involvement from election officials.", "\u201cThere was a brief technical error in AP\u2019s collection of the vote count in Rock County, Wisconsin, that was quickly corrected,\u201d Patrick Maks, AP spokesman, said in an email to\u00a0the USA TODAY Network. \u201cAP has myriad checks and redundancies in place to ensure the integrity of the vote count reporting. We are confident in what we have delivered to customers.\u201d", "In other words, the \u201cglitch\u201d was in a media system, not a voting system. The wrong numbers were briefly loaded into an array of media websites, but the numbers were never counted or reported incorrectly by Rock County.", "\u201cEverybody\u2019s human, but maybe you should check your source instead of jumping to conclusions,\u201d Tollefson said of the voter fraud claim.", "The 55%-44% margin in Biden\u2019s favor is in line with the 2016 election, when Trump drew 41% of the vote, compared with 52% for Democrat Hillary Clinton.", "We rate this claim FALSE because it is not supported by our research. There was no glitch in the election system. And there\u2019s no \u201cgotcha\u201d moment or evidence that will move votes over to Trump\u2019s column.", "The presidential totals were transposed for several minutes because a data entry error by The Associated Press, without any involvement by election officials. The votes were counted following standard procedures by the Rock County Clerk\u2019s Office and show Biden winning the county by a margin of more than 9,000 votes.", "Contact Eric Litke at (414) 225-5061 or elitke@jrn.com.
