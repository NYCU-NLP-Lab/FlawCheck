It took nearly 45 minutes, and he eventually died of a heart attack after officials stopped the execution.", "He\u2019s not alone. Seven percent of all executions by lethal injection are \"botched,\" or not done in line with\u00a0protocol, according to an Amherst law professor.\u00a0Each time, the death penalty debate reignites among legislators and the public about executions.", "Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., went on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe May 1 to emphasize his support for the death penalty, despite the complication with Lockett\u2019s execution.", "\"I think it is a deterrent that does affect and impact people,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve given a lot of thought. I don\u2019t like it. I wish we put everybody that had such a history as this gentleman behind bars and working and doing things that would help them, but I haven\u2019t changed my position.\"", "We decided to check the research to see if Coburn was right that the death penalty is a deterrent. Does the death penalty discourage crime?", "We found there\u2019s no conclusive evidence to support any viewpoint, including Coburn's. We can\u2019t definitively say that the death penalty deters homicides, increases homicides or has no effect, so Coburn can't back up his point with widelyaccepted scientific evidence.", "Daniel Nagin, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, chaired the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Deterrence and the Death Penalty. He and his team were tasked with addressing whether or not available studies can prove that the death penalty serves as a deterrent for violent crime.", "In 2012, he and his team published \"Deterrence and the death penalty,\" a report that sums up more than three decades worth of research:", "\"The committee concludes that the research to date on the effect of capital punishment on homicide is not informative about whether capital punishment decreases, increases, or has no effect on homicide rates. Therefore, the committee recommends that these studies not be used to inform deliberations requiring judgments about the effect of the death penalty on homicide. Consequently, claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate should not influence policy decisions about capital punishment.\"", "Nagin found a few common problems with the existing research:", "No comparison to deterrent effects of life imprisonment: Study authors often can\u2019t access the data they need from the government. An ideal deterrence study would examine whether people are more deterred by the death penalty than by other serious punishments.", "No information on would-be murderers\u2019 perceptions: \"Deterrence is about how people are responding to their perceptions,\" Nagin said.
