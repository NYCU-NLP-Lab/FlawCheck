["About this rating", "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was once held at a United States detention facility in Iraq.", "According to the Pentagon, Baghdadi was released from Camp Bucca in 2004, during the administration of George W. Bush.", "On Oct. 28, 2019, shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an old and persistent rumor holding that the Islamic State (IS) leader had been released from a United States detention facility in 2009 under the Obama administration started to recirculate on social media:\n\nThis is not accurate. While al-Baghdadi was once held at a U.S. detention facility called Camp Bucca in Iraq, he was released in 2004, more than four years before Barack Obama took office.\nThe rumor that IS leader al-Baghdadi (who was born Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai) was released during the Obama administration first started to gain prominence in 2014 as the U.S. negotiated an exchange for soldier Bowe Bergdahl. As conservative pundits accused Obama of having a so-called terrorist \"catch-and-release\" policy, some pointed to al-Baghdadi's alleged 2009 release as an example. \nFox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro, for instance, said: \nAmerica left Iraq as a state not able to stand on its own.\nAnd the head of this band of savages is a man named Abu al Baghdadi - the new Osama bin Laden - a man released by Obama in 2009 who started ISIS a year later. When Baghdadi left Camp Bucca, where the worst of the worst were held in Iraq, he threatened his American jailers, saying \u201cI\u2019ll see you in New York.\u201d\nAnd as the nation of Iraq teeters on the brink of total destruction, there is no question that the march will inevitably continue toward the West and the United States.\nThe claim that al-Baghdadi said \"I'll see you in New York\" as he left Camp Bucca, as well as the claim that he was released in 2009 during the Obama administration, can both be traced back to a 2014 Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King. \nKing told The Daily Beast that he remembered al-Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2009 after seeing news reports about how he had become the leader of IS in 2014, and that he was a \"little surprised\" by al-Baghdadi's rise in the terrorist ranks:\nKing had not imagined that in less that five years he would be seeing news reports that al-Baghdadi was the leader of ISIS, the ultra-extremist army that was sweeping through Iraq toward Baghdad.\n\"I\u2019m not surprised that it was someone who spent time in Bucca but I\u2019m a little surprised it was him,\u201d King says. \u201cHe was a bad dude, but he wasn\u2019t the worst of the worst.\"\nAlthough King told The Daily Beast he remembered al-Baghdadi being released from Camp Bucca in 2009, the Defense Department disputed this account. According to a statement from the Pentagon, al-Baghdadi was captured in February 2004 and then released a few months later in December. \nA U.S. official also disputed King's account in a statement to ABC News. The official said that he wasn't sure exactly when al-Baghdadi had been released, but said that he had \"resumed his activities\" and had been \"active with the group [ISIS]\" since 2006, two years before Obama took office. \nWhen pressed on this by ABC News, King said that he \"could be mistaken\" about the timing of al-Baghdadi's release. While King said that the man who left Camp Bucca in 2009 saying \"I'll see you in New York\" was a \"dead ringer\" for al-Baghdadi, the U.S. colonel conceded that he didn't connect al-Baghdadi to the 2009 encounter until he saw photographs of the IS leader in 2014:\nKing said that he first believed it was al-Baghdadi he had spoken with all those years past when he saw al-Baghdadi\u2019s photo a week ago during coverage of the Iraq crisis. King said he took over as commander of the detention center in December 2008 and the man he believed to be al-Baghdadi was already there.\nSo the claim that al-Baghdadi was released in 2009 is largely based on a U.S. colonel's recollection of a five-year-old encounter after glimpsing a recent photograph of al-Baghdadi. The only other piece of \"evidence\" to support this claim comes from an alleged \"Pentagon document\" cited by The Telegraph about a terrorist named \"Abu Duaa.\" \nWhile al-Baghdadi may have used the name \"Abu Duaa\" at one point, this is likely a nom de guerre, a fake name an individual assumes during war, that multiple members of IS used. The Telegraph quotes Lieutenant-General Sir Graeme Lamb, a former British special forces commander who helped U.S. efforts against al-Qaeda in Iraq, saying that \"we either arrested or killed a man of that name about half a dozen times\":\n\u201cAbu Duaa was connected to the intimidation, torture and murder of local civilians in Qaim\u201d, says a Pentagon document. \u201cHe would kidnap individuals or entire families, accuse them, pronounce sentence and then publicly execute them.\u201d\nWhy such a ferocious individual was deemed fit for release in 2009 is not known. One possible explanation is that he was one of thousands of suspected insurgents granted amnesty as the US began its draw down in Iraq. Another, though, is that rather like Keyser S\u00f6ze, the enigmatic crimelord in the film The Usual Suspects, he may actually be several different people.\n\u201cWe either arrested or killed a man of that name about half a dozen times, he is like a wraith who keeps reappearing, and I am not sure where fact and fiction meet,\u201d said Lieutenant-General Sir Graeme Lamb, a former British special forces commander who helped US efforts against al-Qaeda in Iraq. \u201cThere are those who want to promote the idea that this man is invincible, when it may actually be several people using the same nom de guerre.\u201d\nThe evidence supporting the claim that al-Baghdadi was released from Camp Bucca in 2009 is flimsy at best. It is based on a single colonel's years-old recollection and a document mentioning a nom de guerre. \nThe official story is that al-Baghdadi was captured in February 2004, held at the Camp Bucca detention center, and then released a few months later in December.\nHere's a statement from the Pentagon about IS leader al-Baghdadi's detention and release from Camp Bucca in 2004:\n\"Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badry, also known as \u2018Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019 was held as a \u2018civilian internee\u2019 by U.S. Forces-Iraq from early February 2004 until early December 2004, when he was released. He was held at Camp Bucca. A Combined Review and Release Board recommended \u2018unconditional release\u2019 of this detainee and he was released from U.S. custody shortly thereafter. We have no record of him being held at any other time.\"\nIn addition to the Pentagon's statement, Business Insider obtained al-Baghdadi's detainee records through a Freedom of Information Act request in 2015.
