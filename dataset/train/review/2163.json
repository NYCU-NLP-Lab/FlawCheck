["About this rating", "In November 2020, videos and photographs purportedly showing a bright purple sky in Sweden started circulating on social media:", "These are genuine images showing a purple sky over the town of Trelleborg, Sweden, in late November 2020. This visual may bring about thoughts of some sort of natural phenomena, but the culprit behind these purple skies is actually a nearby tomato farm.", "SVT, Sweden's national public television company, reported on Nov. 24 that these purple skies appeared after a new energy-saving LED system was installed at a tomato farm in nearby Gisl\u00f6v. The lights were meant to extend the farm's growing season, but they had an unexpected side effect: purple skies.", "SVT writes:", "A light phenomenon amuses and worries the inhabitants of Gisl\u00f6v's location.

That comes from high-powered grow lights.", "Lights that \u2014 because of shorter winter days \u2014 LEF Farms has been running after the sun sets.
