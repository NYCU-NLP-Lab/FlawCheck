["Billionaire philanthropist George Soros isn\u2019t \"funding the chaos\" in Minneapolis as people protest over the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody after an officer pressed his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck.", "We debunked that claim. But misinformation about Soros tends to mushroom online. Now we\u2019re looking at a new allegation, which claims he\u2019s supplying rocks for rioters in Los Angeles.", "\"Rocks being dropped off in cages in LA for rioters,\" the June 1 Facebook post says. \"Compliments of George Soros. America is laced with terrorist activities that are using a HORRIBLE SITUATION to terrorize our homes, businesses and cities. This is a warning to all my friends that these are not protesters. These are paid very dangerous people by George Soros. Don\u2019t think for a minute that you may not have to defend your family.\"", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

In one the images, the sign of a business across the street is visible: Monza Car. We looked for Monza Car in Los Angeles and found the street where the photos were taken \u2014 Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, Calif. Using Google Maps street view, you can see that the building closest to the rocks in the photo is Chabad of Sherman Oaks, a community center for Jews.", "The rocks don\u2019t appear in the Google Maps image. However, Chabad of Sherman Oaks responded to the rock rumors on its Facebook page on June 1.", "\"To all concerned neighbors and friends,\" the post says. \"There were false pictures and videos going around today, claiming some bricks or rocks were placed at our center. Here is the truth: THESE ARE SECURITY BARRIERS and have been here for almost a year! Nevertheless to alleviate people\u2019s concern that they may be vandalized and used by rioters, they were temporarily removed (as can be seen in this picture). Stay safe, we are praying for you all, and may there only be goodness and peace in our community.\"", "The post includes a photo of the barriers without rocks.", "We rate this claim False.", "Facebook post, June 1, 2020", "PolitiFact, No, George Soros and his foundations do not pay people to protest, June 1, 2020", "Chabad of Sherman Oaks Facebook post, June 1, 2020", "Google Maps street view of Monzo Car in Sherman Oaks, Calif., visited June 2, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
