["A screenshot of a tweet claimed to have been posted by former US president Barack Obama is widely circulating on social media. The screenshot portrays that Obama tweeted a picture of him shaking hands with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and wrote, \u201cToday I am shamefull for a hand shake with this man\u2026. #NarendraModi\u201d.
