Debbie Wasserman Schultz accused him of buying his victory.\n\n\"Mitt Romney\u2019s victory tonight in the Florida GOP primary comes as no surprise \u2013 Romney and his super PAC outspent his nearest opponent by running 13,000 ads to Newt Gingrich's 200, carpet-bombing the airwaves with negative ads. \u00a0In fact, Romney\u2019s campaign has already spent more on negative ads than John McCain did during his entire presidential run,\" said the South Florida congresswoman in a DNC press release\u00a0on Jan. 31, 2012.\n\nIf Wasserman Schultz\u2019s statement is true, that means a staggering amount of money will be spent this year, as the campaign still has nine months to go. We decided to check it out.\n\nWe soon realized that there was no way Wasserman Schultz\u2019s statement could be accurate. McCain spent much more in his general election effort than Romney has spent on the primary so far.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the numbers.\n\nMcCain\u2019s ad spending in 2008\n\nFor an analysis of McCain\u2019s ad spending, we turned to the Wisconsin Advertising Project, now the Wesleyan Media Project. In a report about the 2008 election, the group found the McCain campaign spent about $12 million during the primary season and then more than $162 million from June through November, for a total of $174 million.\n\nThe report also shows that a majority of McCain\u2019s ads were negative, as were Barack Obama\u2019s.\n\n\"During the final presidential debate Sen. John McCain argued that Obama had \u2018spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history,\u2019 while Barack Obama accused Senator McCain of running an entirely negative campaign,\" the report said. \"In a way, both candidates were correct. \u2026 At certain points in the campaign Barack Obama aired nearly as many negative or contrast ads as John McCain aired altogether. As a proportion, however, it is clear that most of McCain\u2019s ads were negative in tone.\"\n\nRomney\u2019s ad spending\n\nNext, we looked at what Romney has spent on the primary.\n\nSeveral news reports have said the Romney campaign and the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future have spent approximately $15.4 million on TV and radio ads in Florida based on data from Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group.\n\nCMAG would not answer our specific questions about their data since PolitiFact is not one of their clients. We could not find a total dollar figure for how much Romney spent through Jan. 31 on negative ads.\n\nHowever, the president of CMAG, Kenneth Goldstein, told the Daily Beast that the 2012 primary was \"the most negative election ad atmosphere I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"I have absolutely never seen television advertising so negative in a Republican presidential primary,\" he added.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that 92 percent of spending on behalf of Romney was negative.\n\nWhat Wasserman Schultz said\n\nWhatever the final spending tally is for the Romney campaign and pro-Romney super PAC, it\u2019s clearly much less than John McCain spent in the general election.\n\nAfter PolitiFact Florida questioned the numbers, DNC spokesperson Brad Woodhouse said the press release garbled its talking point.\n\n\"Where it says \u2018presidential\u2019 it should have said \u2018primary,\u2019\" he said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nWasserman Schultz said that \"Romney\u2019s campaign has already spent more on negative ads than John McCain did during his entire presidential run.\" We couldn\u2019t find a precise figure for what Romney spent on negative ads in all the states combined through the end of January, but it\u2019s clearly much less than what McCain spent on his entire general election run. But it was her dramatic contrast between primary spending and general election spending that caught our attention, and that point is clearly wrong.
