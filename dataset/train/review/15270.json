["By D'Angelo Gore, Lori Robertson and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on January 18, 2019", "The weekslong partial government shutdown has led to around 800,000 federal employees not working or working without pay. It also has led to some false or questionable claims from Democrats about the shutdown\u2019s impact on a host of federal services.", "The partial shutdown began on Dec. 22 amid a budget standoff between Democratic congressional leaders and President Donald Trump over funding for his proposed border wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Congress has yet to pass seven appropriations bills to fund a number of federal departments and agencies, resulting in the staff shortages.", "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that Trump delay his State of the Union address, scheduled for Jan. 29, due to \u201csecurity concerns\u201d during the government shutdown. But the Secret Service \u2014 which is in charge of security for the SOTU \u2014 is still operating, with 83 percent of its employees exempt from the shutdown.", "Pelosi wrote in a Jan. 16 letter to Trump that he might consider waiting to give the annual address to Congress until the government was open or submitting the address in writing. She wrote: \u201cIn September 2018, Secretary Nielsen designated State of the Union Addresses as National Special Security Events (NSSEs), recognizing the need for \u2018the full resources of the Federal Government to be brought to bear\u2019 to ensure the security of these events.\u201d", "She said the Secret Service, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security, was designated \u201cthe lead federal agency\u201d responsible for the security for the speech. \u201cHowever, both the U.S. Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security have not been funded for 26 days now \u2013 with critical departments hamstrung by furloughs,\u201d she said, adding that these \u201csecurity concerns\u201d were the reason she was suggesting a delay.", "DHS is affected by the shutdown. Employees who are not considered essential aren\u2019t working, and those who are working aren\u2019t getting a paycheck. But the vast majority of Secret Service employees are essential workers.", "In a Dec. 17, 2018, report titled \u201cProcedures Relating to a Lapse in Appropriations,\u201d DHS said that an estimated 5,978 Secret Service employees, out of a total workforce of 7,222, were \u201cexempt/excepted and estimated to be retained during a lapse in appropriations.\u201d", "In a Jan. 16 tweet, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said: \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security and the US Secret Service are fully prepared to support and secure the State of the Union.\u201d", "In fact, most of DHS\u2019 employees are exempt from a government shutdown. The agency said in its December report that 212,699 of the total 245,405 DHS employees were exempt/excepted from a lapse in government funding.", "Juliette Kayyem, a security analyst for CNN and an assistant secretary for DHS during the Obama administration, told CNN that there could be \u201cperformance\u201d issues due to \u201cpersonal challenges\u201d associated with law enforcement employees not being paid.", "We leave it to readers to judge whether the lack of pay, and slightly smaller workforce, amount to \u201csecurity concerns.\u201d But the vast majority of Secret Service employees are still on the job.", "Pelosi addressed the lack of pay in her Jan. 17 press conference. \u201cI have no doubt that our men and women in the federal workforce have the capability to protect,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re professionals. They are trained for this. They should be paid for this.\u00a0And that\u2019s why I said to the president: If you don\u2019t open up government, if that doesn\u2019t happen, let\u2019s discuss a mutually agreeable date. \u201d", "Some Democrats also falsely claimed that the government shutdown was causing problems for Social Security and Medicare recipients and workers.", "Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, during a Jan. 7 interview on CNN, claimed seniors were encountering problems filing applications for Medicare and Social Security.", "\u201cIt\u2019s an incompetent strategy,\u201d he said of the shutdown. \u201cIt does damage to all kinds of people who are making applications, whether it\u2019s benefits for Social Security or for Medicare or so on and so forth.\u201d", "Rep.\u00a0Debbie Dingell of Michigan, during a\u00a0Jan. 11 interview on MSNBC, expressed concern about the Social Security Administration\u2019s ability to handle complaints.", "\u201cI care about every one of those government workers who aren\u2019t getting paid, who are scared to death about how they\u2019re going to live and by the way, we should care about the services that aren\u2019t getting performed. From keeping us safe in the skies, to food being inspected, to Social Security complaints, to people having housing issues, to food stamps, the list is endless,\u201d Dingell said.", "Social Security and Medicare are not affected by the shutdown, according to both agencies.", "In a statement to us, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said its operations are fully under an appropriations bill signed into law last year.", "\u201cOn September 28, 2018, the President signed the 2019 Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act (PL 115-245), which fully funds the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for Fiscal Year 2019. CMS is continuing to accept Medicare enrollments from the Social Security Administration, and provider claims are being processed as normal,\u201d the CMS statement said. \u201cBy statute, Social Security processes Medicare Part A and Part B enrollments, and we refer you to the Social Security Administration on that aspect.\u201d", "We did contact the Social Security Administration, and a spokeswoman also said the administration is fully funded for the fiscal year by the same legislation that funds CMS.", "\u201cSocial Security services and offices will remain fully operational, and Social Security benefits will be paid on time,\u201d SSA spokeswoman Nicole Tiggemann said.", "We also checked with the AARP, the nation\u2019s largest advocacy group for older Americans. \u201cWe\u2019re not aware of any complaints on our end,\u201d Greg Phillips, an AARP spokesman, told us. He too said both Social Security and Medicare are fully funded for the year \u201cper the passing of the Labor-HHS bill.\u201d", "House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer questioned if the IRS will issue tax refunds.", "\u201cThere is the possibility that people won\u2019t get their refund checks [from their tax return], which is about $140 billion, the average refund $2,500 that people are relying on and that spur our economy,\u201d Hoyer said in a Jan. 9 press conference.", "But in a Jan. 7 statement, the IRS \u201cconfirmed that it will process tax returns beginning January 28, 2019 and provide refunds to taxpayers as scheduled.\u201d", "\u201cCongress directed the payment of all tax refunds through a permanent, indefinite appropriation (31 U.S.C. 1324), and the IRS has consistently been of the view that it has authority to pay refunds despite a lapse in annual appropriations,\u201d the statement said.", "In 2011, under President Barack Obama, the Office of Management and Budget argued that the IRS should not issue refunds during a lapse in funding. However, the IRS\u2019 recent statement said the OMB had \u201creviewed the relevant law at [the Department of] Treasury\u2019s request and concluded that IRS may pay tax refunds during a lapse.\u201d", "To make sure refunds go out as planned, the IRS said it was \u201crecalling a significant portion of its workforce, currently furloughed as part of the government shutdown, to work.\u201d", "Still, some aren\u2019t as confident the IRS will be able to disburse refunds without issue, especially if the agency can\u2019t get enough employees to work without pay.\u00a0Kiplinger advised its readers: \u201cFile as early as possible. If the IRS falls behind schedule due to the shutdown, you don\u2019t want your return at the back of a potentially massive backlog.\u201d", "In his remarks, Hoyer also warned that \u201cflood insurance is at risk.\u201d It\u2019s not.", "On Dec. 28, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees the National Flood Insurance Program, said that it was reversing earlier instructions for private insurance companies not to sell or renew flood insurance policies.", "\u201cToday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced that it will resume the sale of new insurance policies and the renewal of expiring policies. This rescinds initial guidance issued on December 26, 2018, to industry partners to suspend sales operations as a result of the current lapse in annual appropriations,\u201d a FEMA statement said.", "FEMA previously had said any flood insurance claims would be paid during the shutdown.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
