["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on June 7, 2018", "Q: Have the \u201cfeds bust[ed] Barack Obama\u201d on felony charges?", "A: No. That claim is based on the false assertion that the former president committed treason in his last few months in office.", "A story making the rounds online has distorted an account of former President Barack Obama\u2019s last few months in office. The story claims that he committed treason and that there has been a \u201cbust\u201d by the \u201cfeds.\u201d", "Neither is true.", "The claims were concocted from a story published in the New York Times on May 30 that included anecdotes from a\u00a0book by one of Obama\u2019s longtime advisers, Ben Rhodes.", "Among those anecdotes are Rhodes\u2019 recollection of responses from world leaders after the Nov. 8, 2016 presidential election \u2014 but before President Donald Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017 \u2014 when Obama was still president.", "New York Times, May 30:\u00a0Mr. Rhodes describes the reaction of foreign leaders. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan apologized for breaching protocol by meeting with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan after the election. Mr. Obama urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to take on a more vocal role defending the values they shared.", "Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told Mr. Obama that she felt more obliged to run for another term because of Mr. Trump\u2019s election to defend the liberal international order. When they parted for the final time, Ms. Merkel had a single tear in her eye. \u201cShe\u2019s all alone,\u201d Mr. Obama noted.", "The bogus story quotes from the Times story, but casts it this way: \u201cBarack Hussein Obama was just caught redhanded trying to c\u043envince Can\u0430dian President Justin Trudeau to help him take down President Donald Trump.\u201d", "It concludes: \u201cObama blatantly committed treason here.\u201d", "The U.S. Constitution defines treason this way: \u201cTreason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.\u201d", "But the story offers no evidence to support the claim that Obama committed treason.", "Similarly, it offers no evidence to support the claim it makes in the headline: \u201cThe Feds Bust Barack Obama FELONY \u2014 This Is It.\u201d", "The former president was photographed\u00a0in May meeting with fellows at the Obama Foundation and is scheduled to headline a political fundraiser in Los Angeles on June 28. There is no evidence of a \u201cbust\u201d by federal officials \u2014 which, obviously, would be major news.", "At least three different websites posted the story and two YouTube channels posted videos with a robotic voice reading versions of the story.", "Facebook users flagged the written stories as potentially false. They are.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.", "Baker, Peter. \u201cHow Trump\u2019s Election Shook Obama: \u2018What if We Were Wrong?\u2019\u201d The New York Times. 30 May 2018.", "Rhodes, Ben. \u201cThe World as It Is: A Memoir of The Obama White House.\u201d Penguin Random House. 2018.", "National Archives. \u201cThe Constitution of the United States: A Transcription.\u201d Accessed 5 Jun 2018.", "\u201cThe Feds Bust Barack Obama FELONY \u2014 This Is It.\u201d FreedomPoliticsToday.org. 3 Jun 2018.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
