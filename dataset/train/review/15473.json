Even much of that ends up as runoff in rivers and streams.

Water usage by residents is on a downward trend as well, not just in Florida, but nationwide. But even keeping that in mind, ensuring quality should take precedent over quantity, Swihart said.", "\"All of this concern about water supply deflects attention from the much more serious problem of excessive nutrients in Florida waters,\" he said, referring to the proliferation of fertilizers, pesticides and dangerous chemicals in the water supply from the industries for which AIF lobbies. \"That truly is a statewide issue and needs urgent attention.\"", "Our ruling", "The Associated Industries of Florida said in its press release that \"large parts of Florida\" have experienced \"years of below average rainfall.\" While parts of Florida have had below-average rainfall, we also saw years of above-average rainfall.
