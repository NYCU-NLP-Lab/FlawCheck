While observers expect Lynch to win confirmation, the Senate\u2019s Republican majority has been withholding a vote as leverage to secure other legislative items. In addition, some Republicans have taken issue with Lynch\u2019s refusal to speak out against President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, which some in the GOP have called unconstitutional.", "Obama himself decried the delay at a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on April 17, 2015.", "Obama called it a \"crazy situation where a woman who everybody agrees is qualified, who has gone after terrorists, who has worked with police officers to get gangs off the streets, who is trusted by the civil rights community and by police unions as being somebody who is fair and effective and a good manager -- nobody suggests otherwise -- who has been confirmed twice before by the United States Senate for one of the biggest law enforcement jobs in the country, has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined.\"", "We wondered: Has Lynch\u2019s nomination been \"sitting there longer than the previous seven Attorney General nominees combined\"?", "We looked at data from the Senate about the past seven nominees.

How about Lynch? Here it gets a little complicated.", "Lynch\u2019s nomination was initially received in the Senate on Nov. 13, 2014. The Senate -- then under lame-duck Democratic control -- did not move the nomination forward. One obvious problem, beyond a short calendar interrupted by Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks: Rushing the nomination through might have been seen as thwarting the will of the people, who had just voted for a Republican Senate.", "Then, the Obama administration resubmitted Lynch\u2019s nomination to the newly Republican-held chamber on Jan. 7, 2015. That\u2019s standard procedure when one Congress ends and another begins.", "If you count the entire period -- from Nov. 13 to April 17, the day of Obama\u2019s remark -- then Lynch had waited for 155 days (and 158 by this article\u2019s publication date). That\u2019s easily more than the 119 logged by the previous seven nominees.", "However, if you count only the time after the Republicans took over the Senate -- the period for which Obama\u2019s obstructionism argument is strongest -- the delay was 100 days by the time of Obama\u2019s comments, and 103 by this article\u2019s publication. That\u2019s less than the 119 days waited by the previous seven nominees, though it\u2019s possible the wait could ultimately reach or exceed 119 days if no action is taken by early May.", "Obama does has a point that the delay for Lynch -- however many days it was -- has been unusually long.", "Of the hundreds and hundreds of nominations submitted in recent decades, only a few have waited for longer than 100 days, according to the Senate Historical Office.

Smith, a political scientist and Senate expert at Washington University in St. Louis.", "\"The Democrats could have moved the nomination quickly at the end of the last Congress if the Republicans were not requiring cloture on everything, even nominations, which created a backlog of must-pass legislation and nominations as the Congress came to a close,\" Smith said.", "Our ruling", "Obama said that Lynch\u2019s nomination \"has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined.\"", "Mathematically, Obama was correct if you start counting from Lynch\u2019s initial nomination, but short by 19 days if you start counting from the resubmission of her nomination to the newly installed Republican-controlled Senate.
