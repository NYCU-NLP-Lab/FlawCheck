["About this rating", "In the months after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a popular Internet meme suggested that the newly-elected Donald Trump had said in the 1990s that politics is boring and unprofitable:", "Around the time the meme became popular, Trump's 1990 interview with Playboy magazine gained attention for quotes articulating opinions that would later become cornerstones of Trump's presidential campaign. When asked about which political party he would join if he ran for office, Trump picked the Democratic party \u2014 but only because at that time he perceived it to be the party of average American worker:", "Well, if I ever ran for office, I\u2019d do better as a Democrat than as a Republican \u2014 and that\u2019s not because I\u2019d be more liberal, because I\u2019m conservative. But the working guy would elect me. He likes me. When I walk down the street, those cabbies start yelling out their windows.", "He also made comments about trade and criminal justice:", "A group of Japanese visitors to New York was recently asked if there were anything in the U.S. they would like to buy. The answer: towels.\n\nThat\u2019s fair trade: They\u2019ll take the towels and we\u2019ll buy their cars. It doesn\u2019t sound like a good deal to me. They have totally outsmarted the American politician; they have no respect for us, because they\u2019re getting a free ride. Of course, it\u2019s not just the Japanese or the Europeans\u2013the Saudis, the Kuwaitis walk all over us.", "...", "You have taken out full-page ads in several major newspapers that not only concern U.S. foreign trade but call for the death penalty, too. Why?", "Because I hate seeing this country go to hell. We\u2019re laughed at by the rest of the world. In order to bring law and order back into our cities, we need the death penalty and authority given back to the police. I got fifteen thousand positive letters on the death-penalty ad. I got ten negative or slightly negative ones.", "So remarkable were the similarities between Trump's positions on topics like trade, wealth inequality, and \"law and order\" that the New York Times in 2016 called the interview in Playboy a \"glossy time capsule\":", "Twenty-six years ago this month, Donald J. Trump sat down with Glenn Plaskin, a celebrity columnist, and, over a glass of chilled Coke, offered a grievance-filled economic agenda, a searing denunciation of weak-kneed American leadership and a keen understanding of his appeal to blue-collar Americans that uncannily resembled the White House campaign he is waging today \u2014 without Twitter, which didn\u2019t yet exist.", "A glossy time capsule, the interview is testament to consistency, stubbornness or stuntedness, depending on your view.", "Plaskin, Glenn.\u00a0\"Playboy Interview: Donald Trump.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Playboy Magazine.\u00a0March 1990.", "Barbaro, Michael.\u00a0\"Between Playboy\u2019s Pages, a Peek at How a Future Donald Trump Would Campaign.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The New York Times.\u00a031 March 2016.", "Chandler, Adam.\u00a0\"Why Foreign Leaders Read Trump's 1990 Playboy Interview.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The Atlantic.\u00a018 March 2016.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
