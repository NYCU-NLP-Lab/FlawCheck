["About this rating", "In October 2020, a graphic featuring a photo of one of U.S. President Donald Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr., and a quote ostensibly uttered by him during an appearance on conservative commentator Sean Hannity's radio program started to circulate on social media.\u00a0 Trump Jr. allegedly said\u00a0 his father doesn't need to rape woman because it's more likely that they would rape him:", "This is not a genuine quote from Trump Jr.", "For starters, Trump Jr. was not a guest on Hannity's radio program on Oct. 14. Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia was Hannity's guest on that day.", "We were also unable to find any news articles reporting on this quote, nor any audio or video clips of Trump Jr. making this statement. It appears that this quote exists solely in the form of the above-displayed meme.", "But the biggest red flag that this quote is fake is the faint watermark running along the right side of the image that reads: Facebook/StopTheWorldTheDeplorablesWantOff. This is the URL of a Facebook page that traffics in political humor and memes, and often posts factually inaccurate content. In 2018, for example, this page shared another fake quote ostensibly uttered by Trump Jr. about wildfires in California.", "Dupuy, Beatrice. \u00a0 \"Fabricated Quote Falsely Attributed to Donald Trump Jr.\" \u00a0\r\n\u00a0 The Associated Press. \u00a0 17 October 2020.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
