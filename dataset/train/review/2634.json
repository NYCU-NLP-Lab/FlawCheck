At that point, if a donor is inked we enquire into the history of tattoos prior to permitting them to donate blood. The one year wait time is strictly a precautionary measure and should not be regarded as a move to discourage them from donating blood,\u201d he said.", "As of March 2, 2021, the NBTS\u2019 website has not\u00a0excluded people with tattoos in its Donor Selection Criteria.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
