Apparently, the chemical poses a high-degree of health risks and side effects.", "Colgate Total is just one of many products that list triclosan as an active ingredient.", "In reality, Colgate Total is one of very few products containing triclosan that the FDA has not banned. In September 2016, the agency ruled that a host of antiseptic and antibacterial wash products could no longer be sold in the United States, due to the presence of certain ingredients \u2014 including triclosan:", "The agency issued a proposed rule in 2013 after some data suggested that long-term exposure to certain active ingredients used in antibacterial products \u2014 for example, triclosan (liquid soaps) and triclocarban (bar soaps) \u2014 could pose health risks, such as bacterial resistance or hormonal effects.", "However, this ruling did not include Colgate Total because the manufacturers \u2014 Colgate-Palmolive \u2014 were able to demonstrate that the health benefits of the product (it is effective at reducing plaque and gingivitis) outweighed any potential for harm.

Contrary to the article's claim, the FDA did not make an announcement during the week of 26 June 2017 that a ban on Colgate Total, or an additional ban on triclosan, was imminent; nor did the agency make such an announcement at any time during the first half of 2017.", "Food and Drug Administration. \u00a0\"FDA Issues Final Rule on Safety and Effectiveness of Antibacterial Soaps.\"\r\n\u00a0 FDA.gov. \u00a02 September 2016.", "Saint Louis, Catherine. \u00a0\"Why a Chemical Banned From Soap Is Still In Your Toothpaste.\"\r\n\u00a0 New York Times. \u00a07 September 2016.", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
