["About this rating", "Some time in April 2016, social media users began sharing a set of three photographs depicting Oscar-winning actors Meryl Streep and Morgan Freeman and rap artist Future, claiming that Future looked like an amalgam of both Streep and Freeman. The meme apparently started as a Twitter joke, but as such things tend to do, it passed seamlessly from Internet joke to rumor.", "The meme originated in 2015, when social media users noticed that Future and Streep share certain facial features, including high cheekbones, strong noses and similar smiles.

(Streep has been married to sculptor Don Gummer since 1978, and articles about Streep's personal life generally characterize it as stable.)", "We found no evidence to support the claim that Streep is the biological mother of Future due to an extra-marital affair with Freeman. In fact, the meme seems to have started as a joke playing off similar facial features shared by the celebrities, and as memes do, caught on and circulated around the Internet for the sole sake of social media users' amusement.", "Webber, Stephanie.\u00a0\"Meryl Streep Really Looks Like Future, and It Will Make Your Jaw Drop: Hilarious Reactions!\"\r\nUs Weekly.\u00a020 October 2015.", "Kimble, Lindsay.\u00a0\"Inside Meryl Streep's Bedside Vigil for Dying Boyfriend John Cazale and How She Found Love Again with Don Gummer.\"\r\nPeople.\u00a031 March 2016.", "Iley, Chrissy.\u00a0\"Morgan Freeman: Fatherhood Didn\u2019t Change Me \u2013 I Was Too Busy Acting.\"\r\nThe Telegraph.\u00a021 September 2014.", "Bd, Peter.\u00a0\"Meryl Streep and Morgan Freeman are Future's parents.\"\r\nThe Daily Dot.\u00a010 May 2016.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
