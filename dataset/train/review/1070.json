["By Robert Farley, Lori Robertson and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on December 7, 2018", "In a flurry of tweets, President Donald Trump stretched the facts when he alleged that special counsel Robert Mueller and his staff have \u201cmany\u201d conflicts of interests:", "Trump made his accusations in a string of tweets on the morning of Dec. 7, the same day that Mueller was expected to file court papers in the Russia investigation\u00a0regarding two of Trump\u2019s former aides: former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort and former Trump Organization Executive Vice President Michael Cohen.", "Mueller\u2019s office later detailed how Manafort allegedly violated the terms of\u00a0his plea agreement. The government on Nov. 26 accused Manafort of \u201clying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Counsel\u2019s Office on a variety of subject matters.\u201d", "The special counsel\u2019s office also filed a sentencing memo for Cohen, who has been cooperating with the government since pleading guilty on Aug. 21 to tax evasion charges related to his businesses and campaign finance violations related to the Trump campaign. (Cohen also pleaded guilty\u00a0on Nov. 29\u00a0to lying to Congress\u00a0about a real estate project that the Trump Organization pursued in 2015 and 2016, while Trump was running for president.)", "In his first of five Mueller-related tweets in the span of an hour, Trump claimed that \u201cthe woman in charge of prosecuting Jerome Corsi\u201d was \u201cin charge of \u2018legal\u2019 at the corrupt Clinton Foundation.\u201d Not exactly.", "Jeannie Rhee, a prosecutor on the Mueller team, worked as outside counsel on behalf of the Clinton Foundation on one case, a lawsuit\u00a0against the nonprofit in 2015. The lawsuit was dismissed. Rhee was never \u201cin charge of \u2018legal'\u201d at the Clinton Foundation, and has never been an employee there.", "Robert Mueller and Leakin\u2019 Lyin\u2019 James Comey are Best Friends, just one of many Mueller Conflicts of Interest. And bye the way, wasn\u2019t the woman in charge of prosecuting Jerome Corsi (who I do not know) in charge of \u201clegal\u201d at the corrupt Clinton Foundation? A total Witch Hunt\u2026", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2018", "Corsi, a conservative author who was one of the chief proponents of the theory that Barack Obama was not born in the U.S., said he rejected a plea deal recently offered by the Mueller team on one count of perjury related to his previous comments about contact with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. According to drafts of court documents obtained by NBC News, Mueller\u2019s team obtained an email from Corsi to former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone, written two months before WikiLeaks released emails stolen from the Clinton campaign, in which Corsi wrote,\u00a0\u201cWord is friend in embassy [Assange] plans 2 more dumps. One shortly after I\u2019m back. 2nd in Oct. Impact planned to be very damaging.\u201d", "Corsi said he and his attorney met with\u00a0prosecutors Jeannie Rhee, Aaron Zelinsky and Andrew Goldstein, who alleged that that email contradicted his previous testimony that he had no advance knowledge about the theft of the emails or their pending publication. Corsi denies this.", "Rhee, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel under President Obama, was one of the partners from Mueller\u2019s previous law firm, WilmerHale, brought on to the special counsel\u2019s team from the outset.", "That\u2019s whom Trump is referring to when he tweeted, \u201cthe woman in charge of prosecuting Jerome Corsi.\u201d Rhee\u2019s name is one of several Mueller team members listed at the end of the statement of the offense\u00a0and draft plea agreement presented to Corsi.", "As we said, while employed at WilmerHale, Rhee and Jamie Gorelick\u00a0represented the Clinton Foundation in 2015 in a lawsuit\u00a0that claimed the Clinton Foundation operated as a racketeering enterprise shaking down donors in exchange for official favors. The lawsuit was dismissed.", "A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation told us that while Rhee was retained as outside counsel for that one case, she has never been employed at the Clinton Foundation. At the time of the lawsuit, Scott Curran was the foundation\u2019s general counsel. That position is now held by Amy Sandgrund-Fisher.", "Interestingly, the WilmerHale attorney working with Rhee in the 2015 lawsuit against the Clinton Foundation, Jamie Gorelick \u2013a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton \u2014 represented Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law, Jared Kushner.", "Trump also exaggerated in claiming there were \u201csubstantial & many contributions made by the 17 Angry Democrats\u201d to Clinton.", "\u2026..overturned, 9-0, in the United States Supreme Court.

As CNN and the Hill\u00a0reported in August and October, respectively, four members of the team left their positions in the special counsel\u2019s office this year. Among the previous 17, there were 13 who had previously registered as Democrats,\u00a0according to the\u00a0Washington Post. Now, the figure is 10.\u00a0(We previously asked the special counsel\u2019s office about this, and spokesman Peter Carr told us the special counsel doesn\u2019t maintain any records on party affiliation of the staff.)", "Carr did confirm to FactCheck.org the names of the remaining 13 prosecutors on staff.", "Seven of them have made federal political contributions. Four gave money to Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign: Jeannie Rhee, James Quarles, Rush Atkinson and Elizabeth Prelogar.", "Whether those donations are \u201csubstantial & many\u201d may be a matter of opinion, but two of the four who contributed to Clinton\u2019s campaign gave $250 or less each, according to political contribution information available through the\u00a0Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 website.", "Altogether, the four team members gave $8,550 to Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. More than half of that came from\u00a0Rhee.", "Quarles, also\u00a0a former WilmerHale partner\u00a0who worked as a prosecutor on the Watergate investigation, gave $2,700 to Clinton\u2019s campaign, but also\u00a0contributed $2,500 to Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz in 2015 and $250 to Republican Sen. George Allen in 2005. Quarles\u00a0has given more than $30,000 to Democrats over the years, dating back to at least 1996.", "One other investigator, Andrew Weissmann, gave $2,300 to Clinton in 2007. And among the four prosecutors who are no longer working for the special counsel, one, Kyle Freeny, had given money to Clinton \u2014 a $250 donation in 2016.", "The president also accused Mueller of \u201cbig time conflicts of interests.\u201d We asked the White House for a list of them, but did not get a response.", "However, the president and his allies have leveled the accusation before. There are at least four alleged conflicts that Trump or his allies have cited, including three outlined in a New York Times story from January that was based on anonymous sources.", "New York Times, Jan. 25:\u00a0Amid the first wave\u00a0of news media reports\u00a0that Mr. Mueller was examining a possible obstruction case, the president began to argue that Mr. Mueller had three conflicts of interest that disqualified him from overseeing the investigation, two of the people said. First, he claimed that\u00a0a dispute\u00a0years ago over fees at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va., had prompted Mr. Mueller, the F.B.I. director at the time, to resign his membership. The president also said Mr. Mueller could not be impartial because he had most recently worked for the law firm that\u00a0previously represented the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Finally, the president said, Mr. Mueller had been interviewed to return as the F.B.I. director the day before he was appointed special counsel in May.", "Let\u2019s take them in order.", "Golf course fees: A special counsel spokesman denied that there was any disagreement between Mueller and Trump over golf course membership fees.\u00a0\u201cMr. Mueller left the club in October 2011 without dispute,\u201d special counsel spokesman\u00a0Joshua Stueve told the DailyMail.com in July 2017.", "Mueller\u2019s former law firm:\u00a0It\u2019s true that Mueller was a partner at WilmerHale, which says it has \u201c1,000 lawyers located throughout\u00a012 offices\u00a0in the United States, Europe and Asia.\u201d It is also true that another partner at the firm,\u00a0Jamie Gorelick, represented the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as mentioned in the Times article. But the Justice Department has said that\u2019s not a conflict of interest.", "Shortly after Mueller was\u00a0appointed\u00a0special counsel, Justice Department ethics officials\u00a0concluded\u00a0it was \u201cappropriate\u201d for Mueller to lead the investigation even though his former law firm, WilmerHale, had represented Kushner, Manafort (Trump\u2019s former campaign manager) and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka.", "\u201cGovernment ethics regulations permit the Department of Justice to authorize an employee to participate in a matter where their former employer represents a party,\u201d Justice spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said.", "\u201cWhile we cannot confirm or deny the applicability of the regulation to the matters to which Special Counsel Mueller was appointed, we can confirm that the Department ethics experts have reviewed the matters and determined that Mr. Mueller\u2019s participation in the matters assigned to him is appropriate,\u201d she added.", "Flores noted that Mueller himself was not involved in representing Kushner, Manafort or Ivanka Trump. \u201cMr. Mueller is permitted to participate in matters involving his former firm\u2019s clients so long as he has no confidential information about the client and did not participate in the representation,\u201d she said.", "Mueller\u2019s interview for Trump\u2019s FBI director:\u00a0Trump raised this issue in remarks to reporters on Nov. 7. \u201cThey all have conflicts over there that are beyond anything that anybody has ever seen in terms of conflicts \u2014 from the fact that people ask for jobs; from the fact that they have very good friends on the other side, like really good friends, like Comey.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s statement about \u201cthe fact that people ask for jobs\u201d appeared to be a reference to a report that Mueller and Trump spoke about the FBI\u2019s top job after Comey was fired. The Daily Caller reported\u00a0on June 13, 2017, that Trump interviewed Mueller, citing an unnamed senior administration official.", "\u201cThat claim is patently ridiculous,\u201d Stephen Gillers, an ethics expert at New York University School of Law, told us via email. \u201cPerhaps Trump is saying that Mueller is so angry about not getting the job that he is unable to act professionally as special counsel but will instead use his powers unlawfully to \u2018get even.\u2019 (The \u2018golf club dues\u2019 argument would seem to be the same.) There is no evidentiary basis for such a theory. The mere fact of an unsuccessful application by itself means nothing.\u201d", "In addition to the three alleged conflicts cited in the Times\u2019 article,\u00a0Trump also has claimed Mueller is conflicted because of his prior relationship with Comey, calling the two men \u201cbest friends\u201d in August and again in his Dec. 7 tweet.", "The fact is that the two men have known each other professionally since at least 2003, according to the Washingtonian\u2018s 2013\u00a0profile of the two men\u2019s relationship. Mueller became President George W. Bush\u2019s FBI director on Sept. 4, 2001, and Comey, two years later, became deputy attorney general in Bush\u2019s Justice Department on Dec. 11, 2003.", "The fact that they have a prior work relationship, however, is not unusual and does not necessarily pose a conflict.\u00a0Richard Painter, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota and\u00a0chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007, called Trump\u2019s claim \u201cabsurd.\u201d", "\u201cOf course you are going to have people who know each other,\u201d Painter told us in a phone interview.\u00a0\u201cComey is not a subject of the investigation, he\u2019s a witness.\u201d", "\u201cThe \u2018friends\u2019 issue has been floating around for a while without much clarity on what people mean by that word,\u201d Gillers said. \u201cFor there to be even the possibility \u2014 and I stress possibility \u2014 of a conflict based on friendship, they would have to be very close (\u201clike a brother\u201d) AND Comey would have to be at real personal risk in the Mueller investigation. Neither of these is true so far as I can tell.\u201d", "We also note that Mueller\u00a0was\u00a0described as a\u00a0registered Republican\u00a0by the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0when Bush appointed him in 2001.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
