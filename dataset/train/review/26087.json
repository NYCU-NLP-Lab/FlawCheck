As one (of many) academic studies found that year, \"Individuals\u2019 social distancing has more to do with whether they are Republicans or Democrats than the incidence of COVID-19 in their communities, and the effect of partisanship on the willingness to social distance is increasing over time, especially among Republicans.\"", "Each side blamed the other for \"weaponizing\" the pandemic response, with President Donald Trump accusing Democrats of hypocrisy during the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign by repeatedly asserting that come the day after the Nov. 3 election (i.e., when COVID would no longer be a useful political issue), Americans wouldn't be hearing much about the coronavirus any more:", "Trump's words on the campaign trail echoed those of U.S. Sen.

That's wrong, It's cynical, and we shouldn't be a part of it.", "Here's a clip of Cruz issuing his \"guarantee\":", "Cruz turned out to be doubly wrong.", "Not only did Biden win the election, but Democrats did not re-open schools and businesses amidst proclamations that \"everything's magically better\" a week later. In fact, within a few weeks after the election, Democratic governors and mayors in states such as Washington, California, and Michigan had imposed extensive new restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994 as a creative outgrowth of his wide-ranging interests in a variety of subjects (particularly folklo ... read more", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
