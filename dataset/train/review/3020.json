["About this rating", "In August 2017, several news web sites reported that the owner of a hotel in Switzerland had posted signs asking Jewish guests to shower before using the swimming pool, and restricting their use of kitchen facilities to only certain hours.", "The story was first reported in Hebrew on 14 August 2017 by Israel's Channel 2 News. The Coordination Forum for Countering Antisemitism later offered its own synopsis:", "A haredi [strict orthodox Jewish] family from Israel received a shock when they found an antisemitic sign at the Swiss hotel they were staying at. The family had found the Aparthaus Paradies hotel in the town of Arosa, Switzerland online. Previous guests had given the hotel positive ratings.", "However, when the family arrived at the hotel, they were greeted by a sign instructing all Jewish guests to shower before and after using the swimming pool. The sign read in broken English: \"To our Jewish guests, men women and children, please take a shower before you go swimming and although [sic] after swimming.\"", "The sign contained a threat to ban Jewish swimmers if they failed to comply. \"If you break the rules, I'm forced to cloes [sic] the pool for you.\"", "\"Thank you for understanding, Ruth Thomann,\" the sign concludes.", "The incident provoked international criticism. According to the AFP, Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister called the signs \"an antisemitic act of the worst and ugliest kind\", and the country's ambassador to Switzerland contacted the hotel directly. Several readers contacted us to check the veracity of these reports.", "The signs are indeed real, and were posted by hotel owner Ruth Thomann, who admitted as much in an interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency on 14 August 2017:", "Ruth Thomann, who runs the Paradies Arosa hotel 80 miles southeast of Zurich, responded Monday to articles published in Israeli media outlets about the signs put up by hotel staff over the weekend.", "\u201cI have nothing against Jews, whom we regularly receive warmly here,\u201d she told JTA on Monday. \u201cI may have selected the wrong words; the signs should have been addressed to all the guests instead of Jewish ones.\u201d Thomann removed the signs following complaints.", "Thomann said her staff allowed only the Jewish guests as a courtesy to put food in the refrigerator normally reserved for staff.", "\u201cThe sign was addressed to Jewish guests simply because the other guests are not allowed to put food in the fridge, and we wanted our Jewish guests to access the food only at set times because otherwise it was an impossible situation,\u201d she said. She also said that only the hotel\u2019s Jewish guests went into the pool while wearing T-shirts and without showering first.", "Thomann said that while the hotel wants its Jewish guests to feel at home, \u201cthe behavior of some of those guests is making other guests feel uncomfortable, and we received complaints so we need to be responsible for all our guests and find a balance.\u201d", "The Jerusalem Post. \u00a0\"Signs in Swiss Hotel Single Out Jewish Guests.\"\r\n\u00a0 JPost.com. \u00a014 August 2017.", "Agence France-Press. \u00a0\"Swiss Hotel Accused of Antisemitism Over Signs Singling Out Jews.\"\r\n\u00a0 The Guardian. \u00a015 August 2017.", "Keaten, Jamey. \u00a0\"Sign at Swiss Hotel Directed to 'Jewish Guests' Draws Anger.\"\r\n\u00a0 Associated Press. \u00a015 August 2017.", "Jewish Telegraphic Agency. \u00a0\"Swiss Hotelier Sorry for Signs Telling Jews to Shower Before Entering Pool.\"\r\n\u00a0 JTA.org. \u00a014 August 2017.", "RT. \u00a0\"Swiss Hotel Signs Telling Jews to Shower Before & After Swimming Sees Owner Under Fire.\"\r\n\u00a0 RT.com. \u00a015 August 2017.", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
