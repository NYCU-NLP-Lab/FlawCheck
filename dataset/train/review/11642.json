At the 2:06-minute mark, Sharma says, \u201cNothing like that had happened, there was no such intention. I greeted him out of respect, he is the senior councillor from my area and he extended his hand towards me to express his gratitude in response. I was not insulted. The way people are making this footage viral now, they are definitely insulting as a woman. They want to use this video for political mileage. This is visible in their mindset. I want to request all those people through your channel to avoid resorting to such types of actions.\u201d Similarly, at the 3-24-minute mark, Garg says that the two greeted each other like brother and sister. He said, \u201cI extended my arms considering her a sister and nothing else. If something like this had happened, would the other members have allowed me to stay in the party till now?\u201d", "Suman Sharma therefore categorically denied misbehaviour by BJP councillor Ashok Garg.
