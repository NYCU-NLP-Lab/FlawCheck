The identical video was also circulated by national in-charge of social media \u2013 BJP Mahila Morcha, Priti Gandhi.", "Meanwhile, Former PM Manmohan Singh has given a thumbs up to the good governance in Madhya Pradesh & Chhatisgarh!! #TrustBJP pic.twitter.com/rQJkpTOzV3", "\u2014 Priti Gandhi (@MrsGandhi) November 27, 2018", "As it turns out, Malviya and Gandhi shared a mischievously clipped video of the former PM\u2019s speech made on November 26. Singh was a panelist in a discussion organised for the book release function of former Union Minister Manish Tewari\u2019s new book \u2018Fables of Fractured Times\u2019. During the dialogue, journalist and anchor Rajdeep Sardesai posed a question to the former PM regarding maintaining dignity and decorum at a time of polarised election propaganda.", "Responding to Sardesai, Singh asserted the significance of the Prime Minister maintaining a certain restraint on the use of language when he visits states that are ruled by parties other than the BJP. Singh continued to say that during UPA\u2019s government, he maintained cordial relationships with the governments of both Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh despite the states not being ruled by the Congress.", "The former PM\u2019s exact words were, \u201cMy relationships with the government of Madhya Pradesh, the government of Chhattisgarh were very good. We never discriminated against BJP-ruled states.\u201d He further went on to say that MP CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan can testify the same. The relevant part of Singh\u2019s statement starts at 1:20 minutes in the complete video tweeted earlier by Congress.", "A lesson for PM Modi on maintaining the dignity of his office. pic.twitter.com/JvUiXebnJF", "\u2014 Congress (@INCIndia) November 27, 2018", "In conclusion, former PM Manmohan Singh wasn\u2019t praising BJP governments in MP and Chhatisgarh. He was, in fact, advising Prime Minister Modi to not discriminate against states that aren\u2019t ruled by the BJP, same as he claimed to have practised when in power. This was first pointed out by True News (@TrueNewsBengal). Singh\u2019s original statement \u201cmy relationships with the government of Madhya Pradesh, the government of Chhattisgarh were very good\u201d was clipped to \u201cthe government of Madhya Pradesh, the government of Chhattisgarh were very good\u201d to make it seem otherwise.", "This wasn\u2019t an isolated instance when BJP IT cell heads circulated cropped videos to portray Congress in poor light. Earlier, Amit Malviya had tweeted a misleading clip of INC MLA Jitu Patwari. He had also shared a clipped video to malign journalist Ravish Kumar. In August, Priti Gandhi had circulated a video of pro-Khalistan supporters gate-crashing a Congress event with a false narrative.", "Donate Now", "Pooja Chaudhuri is a senior editor at Alt News.", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
