["\u201cThe future of Canada...?\u201d asks a September 16, 2020 version of the post.", "All the versions of the posts point to Alberta\u2019s Health Statutes Amendments Act, also known as Bill 30, to claim it brought in mandatory medical isolation and vaccinations when it came into force in July 2020.", "AFP Fact Check breaks down the claims:", "\u201cAlberta is the first\u201d says the\u00a0one post, while another asks, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they do this with ebola or swine flu?\u201d", "Lorian Hardcastle, an associate professor at the University of Calgary\u2019s Faculty of Law, told AFP by email, \u201cThese are not new powers, nor are they unique to Alberta.\u201d", "She added, \u201cAlthough there is interprovincial variation in public health laws, all laws provide for examinations and detentions in response to public health threats. And although these laws have been amended in response to Covid, they have existed for many years.\u201d", "This is consistent with the 1984 version of the Public Health Act and the current one.", "\u201cIf you have a runny nose from allergies, the government can drag you to an isolation facility and force you to take vaccines or enter your place of work and shut it down if you have allergies\u201d says this version of the post.", "Hardcastle, who specializes in health law, explained: \u201cThe legislation allows for detention if a medical officer knows or has reason to believe that a person is \u2018suffering from a communicable disease.\u2019 Not only are allergies not a communicable disease, but the legislation actually defines and lists communicable diseases, and allergies are not included on that list.\u201d", "Steve Buick, Press Secretary to Alberta\u2019s Health Minister Tyler Shandro similarly confirmed in an email, \u201cThe post about runny noses from allergies is also incorrect. Our public health guidance on self-isolation for people with respiratory symptoms refers to new symptoms not related to an existing health condition.\u201d", "Hardcastle added that \u201call government laws and actions are subject to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Arbitrarily detaining people for medical treatment or detaining them when other less intrusive alternatives were available (i.e. isolating at home) would all be unconstitutional.\u201d", "The province of Alberta recommends vaccinations saying: \u201cImmunization is one of the most important public health measures used to protect the health of Albertans. It is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions.\u201d", "Alberta\u2019s Public Health Act could allow for mandatory immunization, but Deena Hinshaw, Alberta\u2019s Chief Medical Officer of Health told the Alberta Legislative Assembly\u2019s Public Health Act Review Select Committee, in August 2020, \u201cTo my knowledge Alberta has never mandated any population province-wide vaccine in its history.\u201d", "Jason Kenney, Alberta\u2019s Premier from the United Conservative Party, agreed. He said in this Facebook live town hall that \u201csince 1910, the Public Health Act and previous legislation have had the ability to require mandatory inoculation. As far we know, it has never been used and the Government has no intention of making that mandatory.\u201d", "Both Hinshaw and the province\u2019s health minister have said they would support removing that power from the statute.", "\u201cI don\u2019t see an example where that would be used. I think if we have a piece of legislation that we\u2019re unlikely to use, I\u2019m not sure it provides much benefit. So I would be comfortable with that particular piece of the legislation being removed,\u201d Hinshaw said.", "Shandro\u2019s press secretary told AFP that the minister\u00a0\u201cis on record as supporting the current proposal to remove the provision in the Public Health Act giving the government the power to impose mandatory vaccination.\u201d", "AFP Fact Check has debunked more than 630 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus.
