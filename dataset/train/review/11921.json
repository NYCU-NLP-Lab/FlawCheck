["About this rating", "One of the many prominent rumors circulated about Apple's iPhone 7 long before its September 2016 unveiling (and confirmed afterwards) was that the device would no longer include a traditional 3.55 mm headphone jack.  Instead, Apple announced, the iPhone 7 would come with a set of Apple earbuds designed to plug into the phone's Lightning connector port.", "Shortly afterwards, some online pranksters played on that change, circulating a fool's errand image suggesting that the headphone jack was still present on the new phones but \"hidden behind the casing\" and could be accessed by drilling a small hole in the device's shell:", "We shouldn't have to point out (but we will) that no amount of drilling will turn up the iPhone 7's \"hidden\" headphone jack, as such a jack is no longer a feature included with that device.  It's possible the image was created simply as a joke mocking the company's decision to drop the headphone jack, a decision that Apple's Phil Schiller maintained was made to make room for other, newer features:", "This is really important, our smartphones are packed with technologies ... it\u2019s all fighting for space. Maintaining an ancient analogue connector doesn\u2019t make sense.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
