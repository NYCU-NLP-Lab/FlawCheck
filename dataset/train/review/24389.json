That research organization is funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates and is led by Max Roser, director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development at the University of Oxford.", "As of May 9, the date of the post, the confirmed COVID-19 death toll was 4,569 for Canada and 77,180 for the U.S., or nearly 17 times as many.", "But the United States has a much larger population. To account for that, Our World in Data also reports the number of COVID-19 deaths per million people as of May 9: 121.06 for Canada and 233.17 for the United States.", "So adjusted for population, the U.S. death toll is not quite double Canada\u2019s.", "The U.S. leads the world in overall COVID-19 deaths.

It took us a very long time to scale up testing in the United States.", "\"Provinces in Canada have generally coordinated well with the federal government on how to respond to the outbreak, whereas U.S. states have often taken their own paths and sometimes clashed with the federal government,\" said Michaud, a former infectious-disease epidemiologist. \"That has not helped the response in the United States, if you have that sort of tension.\"", "Berman said public-health officers in Canada are much more empowered legally, and medical care is largely under the same government authority as public health, so it is much easier to direct and coordinate a response.", "Canada\u2019s politicians, he said, \"tended to cede the podium to the public-health scientists more and didn\u2019t undermine or question them, especially in public. In the U.S., political leaders disagreed with scientists often and publicly.", "With the U.S. in an election cycle, Berman added, \"political opposition is looking for things to criticize, as is a politically polarized media. Also, the U.S. seems to me to be a more polarized society politically. All of this has different results in terms of coherence and coordination of policy response.\"", "News reports have also looked at differences in leadership.", "An analysis by the CBC, the Canadian broadcast network, said Trump gave mixed messages about social distancing, and one American study found that people in counties that voted predominantly for Trump in 2016 were less likely to perceive risk associated with coronavirus, seek information or practice physical distancing, the analysis noted. In contrast, according to the analysis, Canadian politicians were more consistent in their messaging, and tracking data collected by Google from smartphones suggested that Canadians practiced more physical distancing than Americans and began doing it earlier.", "In addition to citing Trump\u2019s mixed messaging, the CBC analysis said the U.S. death rate is higher because its largest city, New York, was struck early in the pandemic; and because a lack of health insurance is a problem in the U.S., especially among Americans more vulnerable to COVID-19, such as African Americans.", "\"Canada has universal health care, whereas many people in the United States do not have health insurance or easy access to care, Michaud said. And, he said, the U.S. has a \"fractured\" health care system, with government providers, health insurance companies and private practitioners \"competing for scarce resources.\"", "A Facebook post claimed: \"It\u2019s not that there\u2019s a virus shield between Canada (4,500 deaths) and the U.S. (80,000 deaths).
