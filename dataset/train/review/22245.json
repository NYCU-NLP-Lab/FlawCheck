["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on February 18, 2020", "In what has become an annual Washington exercise, Democrats and Republicans are waging a war of words over the president\u2019s proposed budget and how it would affect programs for seniors. President Donald Trump tweeted that he \u201cwill not be touching your Social Security or Medicare\u201d in the budget, while Democrats have charged it does exactly that.", "The budget does propose reductions in future projected Medicare spending, but experts say they are similar to last year\u2019s budget proposal, which included bipartisan ideas also supported by former President Barack Obama. The watchdog group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said the Medicare proposals \u201crepresent reductions in costs not cuts to benefits.\u201d", "On Social Security, the budget calls for changes to disability benefits that would translate to cuts for some beneficiaries. On Medicaid, there are more significant (but not well-defined) cuts. We\u2019ll go through what the budget calls for in each of these programs.", "We\u2019ll also note that we\u2019re talking about a budget that won\u2019t actually be enacted. Any president\u2019s budget proposal is largely a symbolic statement of priorities, not a piece of legislation on which Congress would vote. And this budget is possibly \u201cdeader on arrival than most,\u201d Joseph Antos, a health care expert at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told us.", "If readers are feeling a little d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, it\u2019s because we wrote nearly a year ago about similar Democratic spin on the 2020 budget proposal\u2019s potential impact on Medicare.", "This year, Trump goes too far in claiming \u201cwe\u2019re not touching Medicare\u201d in the 2021 budget. There are several proposals to reduce the growth in spending over the next 10 years by about $600 billion, as the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates. But Democrats, again, have spun those proposals as a \u201cslashing\u201d and \u201ccuts\u201d that \u201ccould ultimately hurt beneficiaries\u2019 access to needed care.\u201d", "Former Vice President Joe Biden said in a Feb. 10 interview, the day the White House released the budget, that the proposal \u201ceviscerates Medicare.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the next day in a press conference: \u201cSo if you\u2019re sitting at home at your kitchen table and you\u2019re a senior or if there\u2019s a senior in your family on Medicare, you\u2019re getting cut. And if there is long-term care in your family\u2019s budget, you are getting cut.\u201d", "A \u201ccut\u201d or \u201csavings\u201d \u2014 the word choice depends on one\u2019s political party \u2014 of $600 billion over 10 years would be a 6% decrease from projected spending, CRFB said.", "As we saw with the Affordable Care Act, when Democrats proposed cuts in the growth of future Medicare spending, they were criticized by Republicans for hurting the program, and seniors. Now, the rhetoric is reversed.", "\u201cDespite what you hear from the other side, Medicare will grow at 6% under this budget,\u201d Acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought told reporters on Feb. 10. That\u2019s 1 percentage point slower growth, on average, than what is projected under current law, according to CRFB.", "\u201cThe debate about reducing the rate of growth in spending vs spending cuts is somewhat semantic, and it has been trotted out by both parties in past years,\u201d Tricia Neuman, senior vice president and director of the Program on Medicare Policy at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, told us in an email.", "Some reduction in the growth of the program and/or an increase in funding is necessary. The trust fund for hospital insurance (Medicare Part A) is set to be insolvent in 2026, meaning the trust fund would be exhausted and payroll taxes wouldn\u2019t be enough to cover all projected spending.", "\u201cA big boost in the economy could potentially extend the life of the trust fund a bit,\u201d Neuman said. \u201cBut even with a tailwind, policymakers will need to reduce Medicare spending, increase revenues or both to keep the trust fund solvent for an extended period of time. That said, there are a number of policies that could be considered to extend the life of the trust fund beyond those proposed in the Administration\u2019s budget.\u201d", "What does the administration propose? Several of the same policies it backed last year, including:", "Those figures come from CRFB and are similar to the amounts for such proposals in Trump\u2019s 2020 budget released last year.", "Trump\u2019s post-acute care payment change mirror\u2019s\u00a0Obama\u2019s fiscal 2017 budget proposal for nearly $100 billion in savings over 10 years from a similar proposal. Obama also had proposals for reducing bad debts and equalizing payments.", "\u201cSeveral of the major budget proposals, such as site-neutral payments to equalize Medicare\u2019s payments to different kinds of facilities \u2026 are similar to recommendations from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to address overpayments to certain providers,\u201d Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote in a Feb. 13 analysis.", "Trump\u2019s budget \u201cwould mainly affect hospitals and post-acute providers,\u201d KFF\u2019s Neuman told us, noting that she would describe the proposals \u201cas more non-partisan than bi-partisan since they are still somewhat controversial and have yet to move through the legislative process.\u201d", "Democrats have argued that changing payments to health care providers could affect beneficiaries\u2019 access to care. Henry Connelly, a spokesman for Pelosi, told us when we asked about the speaker\u2019s comments on the budget that\u00a0\u201cthese Medicare cuts in the Trump Budget mean seniors will find it harder to access quality care when they need it.\u201d", "Van de Water told us in a phone interview that it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d access to care could be affected but \u201cnot likely at least in the near term.\u201d He explained that the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent agency that advises Congress, \u201ctakes a thorough look every year at the adequacy of payments with an eye to making sure they\u2019re not reduced to a point where they impair access on the part of beneficiaries.\u201d If it appeared access was going to be significantly restricted, that agency, known as MedPac would say so.", "CRFB said in a footnote to its analysis of the Medicare proposals that lower payments to providers \u201ccould impact quality and access in some select cases.\u201d But it said \u201cthere is little evidence of any significant effect,\u201d particularly for proposals that \u201clargely focus on reducing excessive payments and spending more efficiently.\u201d", "The providers who would be affected \u201cwouldn\u2019t be very happy\u201d with reduced payments, AEI\u2019s Antos noted in a phone interview. (Indeed, the Federation of American Hospitals said the budget \u201cwill make the job of America\u2019s caregivers much more difficult.\u201d)", "In terms of an impact on beneficiaries\u2019 access, Antos said \u201cthere\u2019s always that possibility,\u201d but given seniors are a big customer base for health care providers, there\u2019s \u201creally more risk on the side of providers to say, no we\u2019re not going to take Medicare patients.\u201d", "Medicare beneficiaries could also benefit from some proposals. KFF\u2019s Neuman said it was \u201cconceivable\u201d that provider payment changes to hospitals would reduce Medicare spending growth \u201cwhich could potentially slow the growth in Medicare deductibles.\u201d", "CRFB said \u201cthe policies would actually reduce costs for individuals by lowering premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\u201d", "One notable difference between the 2020 and 2021 budget proposals is the lack of detail in Trump\u2019s latest drug spending policies. The new budget includes $135 billion in \u201ccomprehensive drug pricing reform,\u201d without explaining what that might be. Antos at AEI told us that drug pricing is the most likely topic Congress would address from these budget proposals, so the administration is leaving \u201csome wiggle room.\u201d Both parties want to do something on drug pricing, but it\u2019s unclear what legislation might be feasible. \u201cBoth want to claim victory for themselves,\u201d he said.", "Like last year\u2019s budget, this one proposes moving two programs in Medicare \u2014 payments to hospitals for uncompensated care and for graduate medical education \u2014 to other parts of the budget. That\u2019s not included in CRFB\u2019s calculation of $600 billion in Medicare spending reductions. (Note: CBPP calculates $501 billion in Medicare reductions in the budget over 10 years. The difference between the two organizations\u2019 figures is that CRFB included $100 billion in \u201clikely\u201d savings from the budgets\u2019 unspecified \u201cdrug pricing reform.\u201d)", "In his CBPP post on the budget\u2019s Medicare proposals, Van de Water did take issue with other Trump administration proposals that he said \u201cwould weaken Medicare\u2019s finances and harm beneficiaries,\u201d pointing to an October executive order to boost private Medicare Advantage plans. That \u201ccould raise costs for some or all beneficiaries by increasing payment rates to providers,\u201d Van de Water wrote. Two proposals in that executive order \u2014 \u201cremoving limits on private contracts between patients and providers, and making it easier for seniors to opt out of Medicare,\u201d he wrote \u2014 are also in the budget, he said, but without any spending reduction figures.", "The budget proposes reductions to the Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income programs, but not reductions to the retirement portion of Social Security.", "The savings from SSDI \u2014 benefits for those unable to work due to a medical condition that lasts more than a year or causes death \u2014 and SSI \u2014 for low-income disabled adults and children \u2014 would come partly from reducing retroactive benefits beneficiaries can receive from 12 months to six. That means a worker who becomes disabled would be eligible for half the amount of retroactive benefits once he or she applies, CBPP explains.", "Other proposals include reducing benefits if more than one family member gets SSI benefits and testing methods to increase work participation among disability recipients. CRFB said these proposals would amount to $35 billion over 10 years in \u201ctangible policy savings\u201d and $45 billion in work promotion savings \u201cwhich are unlikely to materialize at such a large scale.\u201d", "Neuman at KFF said proposals to restrict SSDI eligibility would affect Medicare as well. She points to a provision in the budget to \u201c[r]educe improper payments caused by barriers for beneficiaries to report income and assets.\u201d That provision calls for developing new reporting and review systems, as well as \u201cfuture related legislative changes\u201d that \u201ccould include requiring suspension of benefits when beneficiaries neglect wage and resource reporting requirements, and instituting mandatory training for beneficiaries on reporting requirements prior to receipt of their first benefit checks.\u201d", "\u201cPeople may not think of that as a Medicare provision, but it is, in that SSDI is a pathway to Medicare,\u201d Neuman told us. \u201cIf fewer people qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance payments, then fewer people with disabilities may qualify for Medicare.\u201d", "Medicare beneficiaries include 52.6 million seniors and 8.6 million individuals with disabilities, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.", "Politicians often include Medicaid when they criticize the Trump budget\u2019s proposals for Medicare, and the president\u2019s proposals have included more significant reductions to the health program for low-income individuals. This year, though, the budget is less specific on what exactly those will be.", "Trump, too, included Medicaid when telling governors on Feb. 10: \u201cWe\u2019re not touching Medicare. We want to keep Medicare. We\u2019re not touching Social Security. We\u2019re making our country stronger again. We\u2019re not decreasing Medicaid.\u201d", "That\u2019s false. The budget includes \u201csignificant Medicaid savings by requiring work and community engagement activities, reintroducing asset limits, and otherwise tightening eligibility requirements for able-bodied adults \u2013 resulting in about $130 billion of savings,\u201d CRFB said.", "Beyond that, the budget includes $844 billion in savings over 10 years for what it calls the president\u2019s \u201chealth reform vision,\u201d with little information on what that would be. CRFB noted that in past years, the president\u2019s proposal has included changing Affordable Care Act spending to block grants to states and putting a cap on the growth of Medicaid spending. \u201cWhile this proposal is likely to differ,\u201d CRFB said, \u201cthe bulk of the savings would most certainly come from Medicaid and ACA subsidies.\u201d", "CBPP estimated the reduction to Medicaid and ACA spending over a decade at $1 trillion (the figure was $777 billion for the 2020 budget).", "This year\u2019s budget does make a reference to ending the enhanced federal matching funds to states that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA. Medicaid, which is jointly funded by the states and the federal government, primarily has covered the disabled, children, pregnant women and families with low incomes, but the ACA enabled states to expand eligibility to all adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level. The federal government has paid nearly all of the costs of covering this expansion population: The federal match was 100% initially and has phased down to 90%. (The traditional federal match rate varies but can be as low as 50%.)", "The budget refers to this adult expansion population when it says that under the health reform vision: \u201cMedicaid spending will grow at a more sustainable rate by ending the financial bias that currently favors able-bodied working-age adults over the truly vulnerable.\u201d", "Ending the higher federal match to cover the expansion population \u201cwould almost certainly lead states to end coverage for most of the more than 12 million people who have gained coverage through the expansion,\u201d CBPP\u2019s Aviva Aron-Dine, vice president for health policy, wrote.", "We don\u2019t know exactly how states would respond. Politicians have linked the overall Medicaid cuts to seniors\u2019 health care, since the program pays for long-term care for those with low incomes and assets.", "There is one specific provision in the budget that would affect eligibility for such Medicaid coverage. It calls for taking away state authority to set higher home equity limits than the federal minimum when determining eligibility, Van de Water told us. This would \u201cquite likely have a substantial effect on people getting long-term care\u201d coverage. Seniors, particularly in states with high home values, would either not qualify if their homes were worth more than the limit, or they would have to sell their homes.", "Neuman, too, noted that the budget \u201cwould achieve more than $30 billion in savings by limiting eligibility for Medicaid-covered nursing home care.\u201d", "As we said, a president\u2019s budget is more a statement of policies and priorities than a budget Congress would debate. In fact, Republican Sen. Mike Enzi, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said in a floor speech on Feb. 10 that he wouldn\u2019t hold a hearing on Trump\u2019s budget, for the same reason he didn\u2019t hold one on Obama\u2019s final budget \u2014 \u201cbecause it turns into a diatribe against the president.\u201d", "\u201cOver the next few days, you will hear lots of complaints about the president\u2019s budget. Seldom will anybody mention anything good, and it has been that way for every president.\u201d Enzi said.", "\u201cCongress doesn\u2019t pay any attention to the president\u2019s budget exercise. That is all it is \u2014 an exercise,\u201d he continued. \u201cCongress holds the purse strings, according to the Constitution, and Congress is very protective of that constitutional authority.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
