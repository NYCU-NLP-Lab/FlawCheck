["U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisconsin, said Trump's May 29, 2019 tweet on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's comments \"directly contradict\" Mueller. (AP photo)", "In a long-awaited public statement on the investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said \u2014 and didn\u2019t say \u2014 a lot.", "Mueller leaned heavily on his previously released report in describing the two-year investigation, which left some elements open to interpretation.", "President\u00a0Donald Trump was quick to provide his own analysis,\u00a0tweeting after the May 29, 2019 news conference, \"Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you.\"", "U.S. Rep.\u00a0Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat, took issue with that characterization.", "\"The President\u2019s claim that \u2018There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed!\u2019 is incorrect and in direct contradiction to what Special Counsel Mueller said earlier today,\" Pocan\u00a0tweeted.", "Is Pocan \u2014 who has called for Trump to be impeached \u2014 right that the President contradicted Mueller\u2019s comments?", "These are murky waters, but let\u2019s dive in.", "The core of Trump\u2019s tweet \u2014 and therefore Pocan\u2019s claim about it \u2014 is the reference to \"insufficient evidence.\"", "Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you.", "What did Mueller say about that?", "\"The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election,\"\u00a0Mueller said, reading from notes at the Justice Department news conference. \"This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign\u2019s response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.\"", "So Mueller made a vague reference to \"insufficient evidence\" of a conspiracy related to Russian interference.", "Trump\u2019s tweet, meanwhile, implies a much more specific and far-reaching meaning \u2014 that there was no evidence Trump himself committed any crime. Mueller said no such thing.", "In fact, Mueller addressed a potential interpretation like Trump\u2019s in his comments.", "\"After that investigation, if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,\" Mueller said. \"We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.\"", "What\u2019s more, Mueller said his office didn\u2019t assess whether Trump committed a crime \u2014 because it could not issue any such charges against a sitting president anyway.", "\"Under longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional,\" Mueller said. \"Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider. \u2026 It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge.\"", "He went on to refer to impeachment as the only way to address such a matter.", "\"The (Department of Justice) opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,\" Mueller said. \"Those were the principles under which we operated. And from them, we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime.\"", "Ron Boehmer, a spokesman for Pocan, said the congressman\u2019s tweet was referring to this limitation.", "\"Special Counsel Mueller did not reference insufficient evidence, but rather a restriction on being able to charge the President and made it very clear that he could not be cleared,\" Boehmer said in an email.", "So, Pocan\u2019s \"direct contradiction\" claim isn\u2019t exactly cut and dried. Trump did use the same term as Mueller.", "But it\u2019s clear Trump over-reached in his summary of Mueller\u2019s comments, claiming a level of vindication that Mueller didn\u2019t offer.", "Pocan said Trump\u2019s response to Mueller \u2014 that there was \"insufficient evidence\" and therefore Trump is innocent \u2014 is \"in direct contradiction\" to what Mueller said.", "Mueller did use the term \"insufficient evidence,\" but that was in a generic reference to proof of a broad conspiracy involving Russian election interference. Trump\u2019s tweet treats that statement as a commentary on his own guilt or innocence.", "In actuality, Mueller was very clear that he cannot charge a sitting president with a crime, and therefore out of fairness couldn\u2019t even accuse him of one. And Mueller was careful to note, \"if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.\"", "Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
