["About this rating", "On 28\u00a0December 2015, a grand jury declined to charge Officer\u00a0Timothy Loehmann in the November 2014 shooting death of 12-year-old\u00a0Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio. \u00a0A\u00a0New York Times\u00a0article titled \"Cleveland Officer Will Not Face Charges in Tamir Rice Shooting Death\" reported:", "The case began when a caller to 911 said a male was pointing a gun at people in a Cleveland park. The caller added that the gun was \u201cprobably fake,\u201d and that the person waving it was \u201cprobably a juvenile.\u201d But those caveats were not relayed to Officer Loehmann or his partner, Frank Garmback, who was driving the patrol car. Officer Loehmann, who is white, opened fire within seconds of arriving at the park. Officer Garmback was also spared any charges.", "Tamir Rice's death was one of several high-profile, fatal\u00a0incidents involving police and people of color in 2014 and 2015. Beginning with the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin,\u00a0who was killed by an armed civilian, social media users began locating and spreading photographs they claimed indicated the deceased individuals were not wholly \"innocent.\"", "Shortly after Tamir Rice\u00a0was killed, the above-reproduced image began circulating on social media. Iterations of the rumor held that it depicted Tamir,\u00a0who was holding a\u00a0pellet gun at the time he was shot, posing with two guns. According to\u00a0the rumor, Tamir's\u00a0mother, Samaria Rice, deleted the photograph from her Facebook account shortly after her son was shot dead.\u00a0No reason for the purported deletion was provided alongside the claim.", "Multiple news articles reported that\u00a0the incident\u00a0was initially called in to dispatch as having involved a much older male (\"maybe 20.\") Subsequently, folks\u00a0contested the justification of the shooting based on the fact Ohio is an open carry state. Had Tamir\u00a0been 20 years old rather than 12, he would have been legally within his rights to openly carry a firearm from the age of 18.", "Interest in the purported photograph\u00a0escalated again following the December 2015 decision not to indict Loehmann in Tamir's\u00a0shooting death; the\u00a0Times article reported that Loehmann and partner\u00a0Frank Garmback remained on restricted duty pending the completion of an administrative review.", "The identity of the depicted young man was not known, but photographs of Tamir\u00a0bore no resemblance to the unidentified male in the photo:", "We contacted lawyers for his family to determine whether\u00a0the photograph was authentic, despite the lack of visual similarity between Tamir\u00a0and the youth in the photo. The lawyer with whom we spoke confirmed that the individual depicted was not Tamir Rice.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
