["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on July 3, 2018", "In a Fox Business interview, President Donald Trump singled out trade barriers as a reason for five \u201cvery bad years\u201d for U.S. farmers. But agricultural economists blame low farm commodity prices \u2014 not trade barriers.", "In fact, U.S. agricultural exports totaled $140.5 billion in fiscal year 2017 \u2014 the third-highest amount on record. And, as it has done for decades, the U.S. agricultural sector posted an annual trade surplus of $21.3 billion in 2017, up almost 30 percent from fiscal 2016.", "Chad E. Hart, an associate professor of economics and crop markets specialist at Iowa State University, described trade as a \u201cbright spot\u201d for an industry that has been in decline after record income levels from 2011 through 2014.", "\u201cFarm incomes have dropped significantly since, but most of the blame for that should go [to] consistent, near record high production for most agricultural goods,\u201d which has \u201clowered prices and incomes,\u201d Hart told us in an email. \u201cTrade is more likely to be a bright spot for ag, rather than a barrier (as the aggregate data shows).\u201d", "In a wide-ranging discussion on trade deals, Trump talked about farm trade during a July 1 interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business.", "Trump, July 1: If you look at what has happened with farms. Over 15 years, it\u2019s just a steady decline. Over the last five \u2014 I\u2019ve been here a year-and-a-half \u2014 over the last five years, they have been very bad years for farms and farmers. I said, we have to change that. And one of the reasons is because they have barriers. These aren\u2019t even economic barriers, although, in Canada\u2019s case, 275 percent tariff for dairy. That\u2019s not fair.", "Trump is wrong that farm income has been in \u201csteady decline\u201d over 15 years and generally right that the last few years have been \u201cvery bad\u201d \u2014 but not for the reason he gives.", "U.S. farms \u201cexperienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014 due to strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports,\u201d according to a February report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Since then, however, net farm income has been well below those record levels \u2014 a trend that will continue through fiscal 2018, the CRS report says.", "\u201cNet cash income and net farm income are both forecast lower in 2018 relative to 2017, thus continuing a general downward trend in farm income since 2013 \u2014 primarily the result of a significant decline in most farm commodity prices since the 2013-2014 period,\u201d the CRS report says. (The emphasis is ours.)", "The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s\u00a0Economic Research Service forecasts\u00a0national net farm income at $59.5 billion in 2018, down nearly 7 percent from last year and \u201csubstantially below the 10-year average of $85.7 billion,\u201d the CRS report says.", "\u201cThe ag sector is seeing some hard times, but it is because of lower prices and not trade,\u201d Wallace E. Tyner, who teaches agricultural economics at Purdue University, told us. \u201cWeather has been pretty good, production high, and prices therefore lower.\u201d", "As for trade, the USDA reported in November 2017 that farm exports \u201ctotaled $140.5 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2017, climbing nearly $10.9 billion from the previous year to the third-highest level on record.\u201d That\u2019s an increase of 8.4 percent.", "\u201cAs it has done for well over 50 years, the U.S. agricultural sector once again posted an annual trade surplus, which reached $21.3 billion, up almost 30 percent from last year\u2019s $16.6 billion,\u201d the USDA said.", "The USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service projects that exports will remain flat at $140 billion in fiscal 2018, which ends Sept. 30. But $140 billion \u201cwould still rank in the top 5 years for ag export value,\u201d Hart, the Iowa State University professor, told us. \u201cFor historical perspective, 2008 was a record year for ag exports at the time, at $115 billion. So there has been significant growth in ag exports over the past decade.\u201d", "Mary Marchant, a professor in Virginia Tech\u2019s Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, said simply, \u201cBottom line, trade has been good for ag. overall & we are dependent on it for our success.\u201d", "This USDA chart shows how farm exports have fueled farm cash receipts since 2000.", "Trump is generally correct about Canada\u2019s high tariffs on U.S. dairy imports.\u00a0Canada limits U.S. dairy products that can be imported without tariffs and imposes stiff tariffs above those quotas.", "\u201cUnder the current system, U.S. imports above quota levels are subject to high tariffs (e.g., 245 percent for cheese, 298 percent for butter),\u201d according to Export.Gov, a project of the U.S. Department of Commerce.", "But that\u2019s the exception \u2014 not the rule \u2014 when it comes to trade with Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement.", "\u201cCanada eliminated tariffs on all industrial and most agricultural products imported from the United States under the terms of NAFTA,\u201d with\u00a0dairy and poultry being the exceptions, according to Export.Gov.", "Tyner, the Purdue professor, said it is not unusual for countries to impose trade barriers on what he called the \u201cwhite trade,\u201d which he said is rice, dairy, sugar and cotton.", "\u201cMany countries have protections on those \u2013 for whatever reason, people want to produce it at home,\u201d Tyner told us in a phone interview. \u201cIt is not uncommon. Most of the world has protection [on white trade]. The U.S. has huge protection on sugar \u2013 though tariffs and quotas. Rice is sacred in Japan \u2013 very high protection. Those four commodities have always been tough to get free trade on.\u201d", "Despite Canada\u2019s high tariffs on dairy, the USDA says that\u00a0U.S. dairy exports grew 17 percent to $5.3 billion in fiscal 2017 from the previous year.", "Soybeans were the top U.S. agricultural export in 2017 at $21.6 billion, according to the USDA.", "Tyner said retaliatory tariffs\u00a0from China, the European Union, Mexico and Canada threaten to do long-term damage to\u00a0U.S. agricultural exports, citing soybeans in particular.", "For example, the Trump administration has announced it will charge tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports, beginning July 6. China says it will retaliate with equal tariffs on $34 billion in U.S. goods, including on\u00a0U.S. soybeans, wheat, corn, sorghum and beef.", "Tyner co-authored an article\u00a0with a Purdue colleague, Farzad Taheripour, on the potential impact of China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs \u2014 focusing in particular on the No. 1 agricultural export, soybeans.", "China is \u201cby far the largest importer of U.S. soybeans\u201d and imports soybeans from both the U.S. and Brazil, the authors write. As a result, Tyner and Taheripour estimate that U.S. global exports of soybeans would fall between 24 percent and 34 percent, while Brazil would see a 15 percent to 25 percent increase in global soybean trade. (See Table 1.)", "\u201c[T]he 25% Chinese tariff is a lose\u2013lose proposition for both China and the United States,\u201d the authors write. But Brazil would see \u201ca significant increase in soybean production and an improvement in economic well-being.\u201d", "Tyner told us that the impact would occur over a period of years, as Brazil increases production.", "\u201cIf those [tariffs] go away in six months, it won\u2019t have any impact. But if it goes on for six years, Brazil and others will expand market,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can be quite serious.\u201d", "Contrary to Trump\u2019s claim, Tyner said that trade has not been a problem for the U.S. agriculture sector \u2014 until now.", "\u201cFor the president or anyone else to say trade is a problem \u2013 it is now,\u00a0but wasn\u2019t a month ago,\u201d he said, referring to the retaliatory tariffs.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
