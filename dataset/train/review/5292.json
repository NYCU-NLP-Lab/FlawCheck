Despite plagiarising the original poem [from Vladimir Mayakovsky], the grammar is still wrong.\u201d", "The post was published alongside a photo of Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s hand-written poem and a composite image.", "The composite image includes a stock photo of Russian poet Mayakovsky\u00a0that has circulated widely online, for example here in a tweet from the Russian Embassy in Sri Lanka.", "It also includes Russian language text which saying: \"On this day\u00a019 July 1893 was born Vladimir Mayakovsky\" and a\u00a0photograph of a Russian-language book called\u00a0The Story of Zoya and Shura by Russian folk hero\u00a0Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya.", "The image of the handwritten poem has been taken from a post by poet Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi, who auctioned the poem.", "He posted the image of the handwritten poem here on his Facebook page with a caption saying: \"Poem from 54 University Avenue. This handwritten poem on a piece of paper was given to me by Mother Su [Aung San Suu Kyi] in the\u00a0dining room of\u00a054 University Avenue [Suu Kyi's house]\u00a0at around 4:00 pm on June 30, 2011. It was just before I was setting off for Colombia. I was on my knees thanking\u00a0Mother Su.\"", "In another post\u00a0here\u00a0he explains that he asked Suu Kyi to write the poem when he was due to speak at the\u00a020th international poetry festival in Colombia.", "\"I told her that I would like to recite her poem before my own poems. That's the reason Mother Su wrote\u00a0this poem. I didn't ask her to compose the poem as a gift to me.\u00a0I asked for her poem in order to share it with international poets,\" the post said.", "The hand-written copy of the poem went up for auction on September 5, 2020 in Yangon and sold to an anonymous buyer for 240 million Burmese Kyats, or $180,000 USD.", "In this September 16, 2020 Facebook post Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi said he has since donated all of the proceeds to Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party, ahead of the November 8, 2020 General Election.", "Vladimir Mayakovsky is a Russian poet, widely considered a leading literary figure of the early Soviet period.", "Identical claims were also published here, here, here, and here on Facebook.", "The claim is false.", "Vera Teriokhina, the head of a specialist group on Mayakovsky at the Russian Science Academy\u2019s Institute of World Literature, told AFP the poem \u201ccertainly is not borrowed from Mayakovsky\u201d.", "During a phone conversation on September 17, 2020, Teriokhina said: \u201cIt\u2019s imitating Mayakovsky, but it\u2019s certainly not borrowed from him. It\u2019s actually quite far from Mayakovsky. The poem is influenced by Mayakovsky\u2019s work, and his understanding that poetry can be a force for transformation of society.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
