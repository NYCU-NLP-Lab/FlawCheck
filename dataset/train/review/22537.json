["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on May 24, 2016", "Hillary Clinton distorts the facts when she accuses Donald Trump of \u201cheaping praise\u201d on North Korea strongman Kim Jong Un. Trump has called Kim a \u201cmaniac\u201d and a \u201cmadman\u201d who is \u201csick enough to use\u201d nuclear weapons.", "The Clinton campaign said she was\u00a0referring to Trump\u2019s comments at a rally in January in Iowa, where Trump said Kim deserved \u201ccredit\u201d for how he took over the country at such a young age. But in that speech Trump also called Kim a \u201cmaniac\u201d with nuclear weapons who needs to be taken seriously because of the ruthless way he killed his rivals to retain power.", "Clinton, who was secretary of state from January 2009 to February 2013, made her remarks on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d while talking about Trump\u2019s statements on foreign affairs.", "Clinton, May 22:\u00a0What he is advocating \u2014 look what he\u2019s done this past week. You know, attacking our closest ally, England. Heaping praise on a dangerous dictator in North Korea.", "Trump has gotten into a verbal spat with two of England\u2019s leaders, British Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Sadiq Khan, over Trump\u2019s call to ban Muslims\u00a0from entering the U.S. \u201cuntil our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d But did Trump praise Kim Jong Un?", "We could not find any instance of the likely Republican presidential nominee praising Kim last week. The only instance we could find of Trump even talking about Kim last week was in a\u00a0Reuters interview on May 17. In that interview, Trump said he would have \u201cno problem speaking to [Kim]\u201d as president of the United States. But Trump didn\u2019t praise Kim.", "Josh Schwerin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, referred us to a Jan. 9 Business Insider article that carried the headline \u201cTRUMP: You\u2019ve got to give that \u2018maniac\u2019 in North Korea some credit.\u201d", "In a Jan. 9 speech in Iowa, Trump said that \u201cyou have to give him credit\u201d for the way Kim took control of the country after his father died. But Trump used Kim\u2019s rise to power as a cautionary tale for the U.S. \u201cThe Republican presidential front-runner said Kim\u2019s willingness to push aside generals and \u2018wipe out\u2019 his uncle demonstrated why the US needs to treat North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal as a serious threat,\u201d Business Insider wrote.", "Here are Trump\u2019s remarks in context:", "Trump, Jan. 9:\u00a0If you look at North Korea \u2013 this guy, he\u2019s like a maniac, OK? And you have to give him credit. How many young guys \u2014 he was like 26 or 25 when his father died \u2014 take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden \u2014 you know, it\u2019s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture and it\u2019s a cultural thing, he goes in, he takes over, and he\u2019s the boss. It\u2019s incredible.\u00a0He wiped out the uncle. He wiped out this one, that one. I mean, this guy doesn\u2019t play games. And we can\u2019t play games with him. Because he really does have missiles. And he really does have nukes.", "Kim became \u201csupreme leader\u201d of North Korea in December 2011 two weeks after his father\u2019s death. At the time, the New York Times\u00a0noted that\u00a0Kim was only in his 20s and \u201cuntested, making him more vulnerable to challenges.\u201d Since then, there have been reports from South Korea that Kim ordered his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, and his uncle\u2019s deputies executed. The Times\u00a0reported that Kim\u2019s uncle was executed for \u201cstealing state funds and plotting to overthrow his nephew.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s comments on Kim at the Iowa rally came at a time when there were news reports\u00a0of North Korea conducting a hydrogen bomb test. Three\u00a0days before the rally, Trump on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d called Kim a \u201cmadman\u201d when asked about those reports\u00a0of a nuclear test. \u201cYou have this madman over there who probably would use it\u00a0and nobody talks to him, other than, of course, Dennis Rodman talked to him. That\u2019s about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut nobody is talking to him whatsoever and nobody is discussing it with China.\u201d", "Trump went on to say that he would work with China to \u201cclose down\u201d North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program. \u201cHe\u2019s getting too close to doing something,\u201d Trump said of Kim. \u201cRight now he\u2019s probably got the weapons but he doesn\u2019t have the transportation system. Once he has the transportation system, he\u2019s sick enough to use it.\u201d", "We understand that, taken out of context, Trump\u2019s words about giving Kim \u201ccredit\u201d may seem to some as praise for Kim. But in context of what Trump said in the Jan. 9 speech and what he said three days before that speech, it\u2019s clear that Trump sees Kim as a dangerous leader.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/252533d7-3eb1-4d29-912b-9ff1c2c01c66", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
