["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on April 10, 2020 | Updated on April 15, 2020", "In early March, President Donald Trump said that restrictions he placed on travel to and from China \u201csaved a lot of lives,\u201d a claim that grew to \u201cprobably tens of thousands\u201d and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d by early April. But we found no support for such figures.", "The few studies that have been done estimate the U.S.\u2019 and other countries\u2019 travel restrictions regarding China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. We didn\u2019t find a study that looked at the U.S. restrictions alone, and we found only one non-peer-reviewed study, on Australia, that found an impact of such policies on deaths, though it has significant limitations.", "Past studies, too, have found international travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.", "Saad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told us he hasn\u2019t seen any evidence to support the president\u2019s claims. Previous studies of viruses with a reproduction number of 1.9 or higher, meaning the average number of other people one person infects, have shown the restrictions have to be very strict to have an effect, he said. Travel restrictions \u201ccan have an impact if you shut down 90% of all travel,\u201d Omer said. But, \u201ceven then, it delays it a little bit but it doesn\u2019t stop it.\u201d", "Omer co-authored a Feb. 3 article on why a travel ban wouldn\u2019t stop the coronavirus.", "Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, looked at several of the same studies we examined and concluded that \u201cby themselves, travel restrictions do little but delay the onset of a crisis mentality and shift the curve to the right rather than flattening it.\u201d", "As we have found with prior claims from the president, Trump\u2019s assertions have progressively grown:", "Trump, March 5, Fox News town hall: But as soon as I heard that China had a problem, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with China? How many people are coming in?\u201d \u2026 [Y]ou both know that I closed the borders very early. \u2026. You know, it saved a lot of lives.", "Trump, March 17, coronavirus task force briefing: We closed it down to China, the source, very, very early. Very, very early. Far earlier than even the great professionals wanted to do. And I think, in the end, that\u2019s going to be \u2014 that will have saved a tremendous number of lives.", "Trump, March 24, Fox News virtual town hall: I made a decision to close off to China. \u2026 Thousands and thousands of more people \u2014\u00a0probably tens of thousands would be dead right now\u00a0if I didn\u2019t make that decision.", "Trump, April 7, task force briefing: And I was called all sorts of names when I closed it down to China. \u2026.\u00a0If I didn\u2019t do it \u2014 if I didn\u2019t do that, we would\u2019ve had hundreds of thousands more people dying.", "We asked the White House for support for the president\u2019s claims, specifically whether there was support for his claims of \u201ctens of thousands\u201d or \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of lives saved. We haven\u2019t received a response.", "On Jan. 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency for the novel coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. As of that date, there were nine confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in the U.S., though there had been very little testing. At that point, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had not yet sent test kits to public health labs, so all testing was done through the CDC.", "Currently, the U.S. has the most confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world. As of April 10, the U.S. had more than 486,000 cases and nearly 18,000 deaths, according to John Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Systems Science and Engineering.", "Under the travel restrictions, non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, were prohibited from entering the U.S. if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks.", "As we\u2019ve written before, a study published in the journal Science on March 6 estimated that travel restrictions instituted in Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, and those put in place by several countries in early February regarding China would \u201conly modestly\u201d affect the spread of the pandemic.", "The researchers \u2014 a team from the U.S., Italy and China, led by Northeastern University in Boston \u2014 used a model to estimate the impact. The model showed that a travel ban in Wuhan \u201cwas initially effective at reducing international case importations,\u201d but \u201cthe number of cases observed outside Mainland China will resume its growth after 2-3 weeks from cases that originated elsewhere.\u201d It found that restrictions by other countries would have \u201ca modest effect\u201d if they reduced travel to and from China by up to 90%, unless those restrictions were \u201cpaired with public health interventions and behavioral changes that achieve a considerable reduction in the disease transmissibility.\u201d", "In other words, travel restrictions could delay, but not stop, the spread of the disease, and social distancing and hand-washing behaviors would reduce the transmission of the disease.", "Another study published in March in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences similarly found that travel restrictions and airport screenings in several countries \u201clikely slowed the rate of exportation from mainland China to other countries, but are insufficient to contain the global spread of COVID-19.\u201d", "The researchers, mostly with the Yale School of Public Health, said that \u201crapid contact tracing\u201d was \u201cessential\u201d to limit person-to-person spread.", "The study did find that the travel lockdowns put in place in Wuhan and Hubei province lowered the daily rate of exportation of cases from China by 81.3% on average by Feb. 15. \u201cAt this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response,\u201d the study said.", "The study also found that airport screening \u201chas only a moderate benefit\u201d early in the epidemic, as most people \u2014 64% \u2014 travel during the incubation period, before exhibiting symptoms.", "The study, which relied on data on the outbreak in China and airline network data to make its estimates, concluded that travel restriction measures are \u201cunlikely to contain the outbreak,\u201d but they could delay the importation of cases, providing time for unaffected areas to prepare a public health response.", "A third recent study, by researchers in China, the U.S. and the U.K., looked at both the travel restrictions and other emergency measures put in place in China only, estimating that shutting down Wuhan slowed the virus\u2019 spread to other cities in China by 2.91 days.", "The study, which was published in Science on March 31, concluded that the delay \u201cprovided extra time to prepare for the arrival of COVID-19 in more than 130 cities across China but would not have curbed transmission after infection had been exported to new locations from Wuhan.\u201d", "Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has praised Trump\u2019s travel restrictions on China, saying the U.S. has dealt with a lower number of cases because of the policies. At a\u00a0press conference\u00a0on Feb. 29, Fauci said, \u201cIf we had not done that, we would have had many, many more cases right here that we would have to be dealing with.\u201d", "The studies we cited suggest that the travel restrictions could have slowed down, but not stopped, the importation of COVID-19 in the U.S. But when we looked into this issue in early March, Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us there\u2019s no evidence to show that and some reasons that it may not be the case \u2014 chiefly, the lack of testing, particularly early on.", "\u201c[W]e weren\u2019t seriously looking for cases in the US,\u201d Nuzzo said.", "Initially, the CDC testing criteria focused on those with symptoms who also had been to Wuhan or in contact with someone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. By late February, those criteria included\u00a0anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a respiratory illness. On\u00a0March 3, Vice President Mike Pence announced doctors could order tests if they thought one was needed.", "Also, the U.S. restrictions were limited. In February, Nuzzo said, other countries, including Japan, Singapore and Korea, had a significant number of coronavirus cases, but they weren\u2019t subject to travel restrictions. The U.S. \u201cwould likely not have picked it up\u201d if travelers coming to the U.S. from those countries were infected with the virus \u201cbecause we weren\u2019t using these other countries as criteria for testing,\u201d she said.", "Omer, of the Yale Institute for Global Health, echoed that, saying, \u201cPeople coming from Italy wouldn\u2019t have been stopped,\u201d whether they exhibited symptoms or not. (Trump\u2019s restrictions on travel from Europe didn\u2019t go into effect until March 13.)", "The ability of the virus to elude limited travel restrictions raises questions about the one study we did find that estimates an impact on deaths. The study \u2014 which hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed \u2014 estimated Australia\u2019s restrictions on travel from China will lower the potential number of deaths from COVID-19 in the country over the next year. However, it didn\u2019t consider any impact of cases coming in from other countries, saying it \u201cillustrates the principle of travel bans and public health impact on epidemic control using China as a case study.\u201d", "The study, posted without peer review on medRxiv on March 12, estimated the travel restrictions, implemented Feb. 1, would reduce the cases and deaths by 87% over 400 days. The case and death counts are relatively low in Australia: 6,215 cases and 54 deaths as of April 10, according to Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.", "Several past studies have looked at the impact of travel restrictions on epidemics. They also have found some delay in the spread of the diseases, if the restrictions are significant, but not containment.", "It\u2019s possible that the U.S. travel restrictions on China could have had some impact in slowing the importation of cases to the U.S. But we don\u2019t have evidence of that, or of what that impact is, let alone evidence that \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of lives were saved, as the president claimed.", "Update, April 15: This story was updated to include the video.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
