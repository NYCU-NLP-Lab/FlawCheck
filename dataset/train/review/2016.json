Democrats dove into L\u00f3pez-Cantera\u2019s past record on immigration and launched immediate attacks, including about a controversial 2011 proposal known as the Florida Immigration Enforcement Act (HB 7089).", "\"In 2011, Lopez-Cantera staunchly supported HB 7089, the anti-immigrant bill modeled after the racial profiling Arizona law, which Rick Scott embraced during his first governor's race,\" said the Miami-Dade chapter of the Democratic Hispanic caucus of Florida in a Jan. 16 press release. \"Lopez-Cantera called it a \u2018common sense\u2019 and \u2018reasonable\u2019 bill in a press release on March 10, 2011.\" The Florida Democratic Party launched a similar attack.", "We wanted to know, did L\u00f3pez-Cantera \"staunchly support\" House Bill 7089?", "L\u00f3pez-Cantera\u2019s comments about an Arizona-style law in 2010", "During his Republican primary in 2010, Scott vowed to bring an Arizona-style law to Florida.", "\"Rick Scott backs Arizona\u2019s law; he'll bring it to Florida and let our police check if the people they arrest are here legally. That\u2019s common sense,\" his campaign said.", "Signed into law by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer in 2010, that law requires police who stop a person to verify their immigration status if they reasonably suspect the person of being in the country illegally. (The U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the law in 2012.)", "The law became a focal point of a hotly contested Republican primary between Scott and then Attorney General Bill McCollum as they battled for conservative voters.

The bills were not identical to Arizona\u2019s law, but for immigrant advocates it raised fears that it would increase racial profiling. Some business-backed groups also raised concerns because there was a component that related to employers.", "The House bill would have required police to check the immigration status of a person subject of a criminal investigation if the police had \"reasonable suspicion\" the person was in the country illegally. Also, employers would be required to check workers\u2019 immigration status. The Senate counterpart didn\u2019t go as far and only let police police check the status of an inmate -- not a person only under investigation -- and it gave some wiggle room to employers.", "In March 2011, the House judiciary committee passed the bill 12-6.", "L\u00f3pez-Cantera, Miami-Dade\u2019s delegation chair, wasn\u2019t a member of that committee.
