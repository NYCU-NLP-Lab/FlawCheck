His name is Shubham Bokade. Shubham is 23 years old, and is pursuing MA in Linguistics at JNU. In a conversation with Alt News, Bokade said, \u201cMy name is Shubham Bokade. I am a student at JNU doing my master\u2019s in Linguistics. I\u2019m 23 years old. I\u2019ve completed my undergrad from Nagpur University. I came to this University to study because of my passion for academics and because JNU remains the most reputed University in the country. The recently erupted protests in the University for fee hike, like everyone else had affected me as well. Thus, I participated in the protests because I believe accessible and affordable education is a right. Just because you want to vilify a University and because of my premature balding you think it\u2019s okay to Target me is deplorable. I\u2019ve faced harassment because of my bald head all my life and I thought coming to JNU would somehow stop that, the recent episode however, has shaken me. Whatever mental harassment done to me because of this episode is irreparable.\u201d", "Bokade called out the post and further stated, \u201cFirst of all, the post being circulated is fake. I think the narrative being circulated is also very problematic. It is Islamophobic, clearly. Secondly, suppose even if I were the Abdul Raza who is 45 years of age as the fake news claims, the question is what\u2019s wrong with a 45 year old man trying to get an education at an affordable price. The idea of education is not to make University spaces exclusive but rather to make space for the last person standing.\u201d", "This is only the latest instance of misinformation of this nature, wherein JNU students are being targeted online through the use of either old and unrelated photographs, or false narratives altogether.", "Donate Now", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
