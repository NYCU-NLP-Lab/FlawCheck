["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Author\u00a0Stephen King once asked his publisher to pull one of his novels off the shelves.\n\nSix people had died \u00a0\u2014 in real life.\n\nFour boys in 10 years brought guns to school. One killed a teacher and two students. Another shot five members of a prayer group, killing three. All four teenagers had read Rage, a book King wrote when he was a teen himself and published under another name.\n\nKing, in a blunt, impassioned essay, wrote that when he learned of the copycat crimes, he wanted the book off the market. He argues the United States should do the same for assault weapons.\n\n\"You don\u2019t leave a can of gasoline where a boy with firebug tendencies can lay hands on it,\" he said in the 25-page piece, published Jan. 25, 2013, for Amazon Kindle readers.\n\nKing, a Democrat who says he owns three handguns and supports the Second Amendment, argues stricter gun control \"would save thousands of lives.\" (His earnings from the sale of the essay will go the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.) He says Australia shows it\u2019s possible.\n\nIn 1996, 28-year-old Martin Bryant shot and killed 35 people near the Port Arthur historic site, a popular tourist destination. After the shootings, the country banned and bought up automatic and semi-automatic long guns, destroying at least 600,000 in 12 months \u2014 ultimately about a third of its privately owned guns.\n\nIt worked, King argues.\n\n\"Since the (Martin) Bryant killings and the resulting tough gun laws, homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent in Australia. The guns-for-everyone advocates hate that statistic, and dispute it, but as Bill Clinton likes to say, it's not opinion. It's arithmetic, honey.\"\n\nHe likes talking to \"honey.\" He also drops a few F-bombs.\n\nWe wanted to know: Have homicides by firearm in Australia dropped almost 60 percent? And did those \"tough gun laws\" do it?\n\n \u2018It\u2019s arithmetic, honey\u2019\n\nWe asked King and Australian and American experts in gun violence for evidence.\n\nBy a few different measures, the arithmetic works. Homicides by firearm did decline after 1996 \u2014 in fact, had already been in decline.\n\nOne path to \"almost 60 percent\" comes from statistics compiled in part by Philip Alpers, a public health professor at the University of Sydney. The number of gun homicides fell from 69 in 1996 (excluding the 35 victims of the mass shooting prompting the laws) to 30 in 2012. \u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s a decrease of 56.5 percent.\n\n(And, yes, you read those numbers right \u2014 we didn\u2019t miss any zeros. The United States has about the same number of gun homicides every day as happened in Australia last year.)\n\nThen there\u2019s King\u2019s source, an item from Slate.com, he told us. It was a blog post citing a blog post citing a study \u2014\u00a0 a reputable peer-reviewed piece in the American Law and Economics Review.\n\nThe researchers, Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University, found that in the decade after the gun laws, firearm homicides dropped 59 percent.\n\nSo, on the numbers, King has strong support.\n\nBut did the 1996 laws drive the numbers? That\u2019s more vexing.\n\n\"He could be right. Or he could be wrong,\" said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center who wrote a helpful 2011 summary of the evidence. \" \u2026 The true answer is, we really don't know.\"\n\nLeigh and Neill designed their study to test for the law\u2019s effect. They asked whether death rates dropped more in states that destroyed relatively more banned weapons through gun buybacks.\n\nThey found the buyback program drove down firearm suicides by almost 80 percent, with no significant change in suicides that didn\u2019t use guns. But the effect on homicides, while of \"similar magnitude,\" was less precise, they wrote \u2014 perhaps between 35 and 50 percent.\n\nTwo other studies, which Hemenway described as flawed, found the laws made little difference. \u00a0But their design made it nearly impossible to find an effect, he argues.\n\nThe first, authored by members of the Australian gun lobby, highlighted the fact that before the law passed, the firearm homicide rate was already dropping. If it had continued on that track, they found, that would explain the entire change \u2014 showing the law made no difference. The authors cherry-picked a high year for homicides to start their analysis, then assumed deaths would drop at the same linear rate forever \u2014 with negative deaths by 2015.\n\nThe second study was more sophisticated. Authors searched for a shift in deaths in a single year that might be attributed to the law, and found their tests suggested the law didn\u2019t \"have any large effects on reducing firearm homicide or suicide rates.\" Hemenway answers that the buyback occurred over two calendar years, in 1996 and 1997 \u2014 and the two-year drop was substantial. Gun homicides fell 46 percent.\n\nAustralian experts told us the science leans King\u2019s way. But it\u2019s not yet definitive.\n\n\"The truth is that gun homicide did decline substantially after the toughening of Australia's gun laws and the massive gun buyback,\" said Don Weatherburn, director of the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. \"The complication is that gun homicide was coming down before any of this. The academic debate is about whether the downward trend accelerated.\"\n\nHis own view? That there\u2019s some evidence that tougher gun laws reduced the homicide rate, but it is \"far from conclusive.\"\n\nPaul Mazerolle, director of the Violence Research and Prevention Program at Griffith University in Brisbane, echoed that \"more definitive work is required.\"\n\nSome feel more certain the laws did their job.\n\nSimon Chapman, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney, co-authored a 2006 study showing faster falls in firearm deaths after the laws.\n\n\"Six years on, there still has not been a massacre,\" he told PolitiFact.\n\nBut an even messier question is whether similar laws would work in the United States. Australia doesn\u2019t have domestic gun manufacturers \u2014\u00a0 and has the benefit of being, you know, an island. Guns destroyed aren\u2019t so easily replaced.\n\n Our ruling\n\nKing, urging his readers to support an American assault weapons ban, said that since Australia passed tough gun laws, \"homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent.\" The raw numbers back him up \u2014 but cause and effect are much peskier questions. Scholars we spoke with say the evidence leans King\u2019s way, but is less than conclusive. That\u2019s an important clarification.
