However, \"these recommendations were not mandatory, and over the course of time implementation lapsed. Many of the generators that experienced outages in 1989 failed again in 2011,\" the report stated.", "The report found that in 2011 \"the generators did not adequately anticipate the full impact of the extended cold weather and high winds.\" More thorough preparation for cold weather could have prevented many of the weather-related outages, the report found.", "There are a lot of similarities between the deficiencies in the grid cited in the 2011 report and those now, said Dave Tuttle, an Energy Institute research associate at the University of Texas at Austin, in an interview with the Austin American-Statesman.", "Following the 2011 blackout, state legislators held a hearing where senators expressed surprise that Texas had outages when other areas of the country are able to keep power on during cold weather.", "O\u2019Rourke told us in a text message that one of the people who warned about the problems was Sylvester Turner, who was a state representative in 2011 and is now Houston\u2019s mayor. Turner, a Democrat, authored HB 1986, which called for the Public Utility Commission to ensure the Electric Reliability Council of Texas had adequate reserve power to prevent blackout conditions.

The author of that bill, Republican Glenn Hegar, who is now the state comptroller, questions whether the bill went far enough, according to a recent report in the Houston Chronicle.", "\"I am extremely frustrated that 10 years later our electric grid remains so ill-equipped for these weather events,\" Hegar said.", "The Texas House Democratic caucus cited some other bills that were intended at least in part to improve the state\u2019s energy infrastructure that failed to pass or remain pending. Some bills pertain directly to the Public Utility Commission, which has oversight of ERCOT. One bill included a proposal to elect a member of\u00a0the commission while another would have required state agencies to create strategic plans to account for expected changes in weather. A separate bill called for creating an agreement between ERCOT and an adjacent Mexican power grid for cross-border dispatch.
