["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on August 15, 2018", "A group calling itself DefendArizona attacks Senate candidate Kelli Ward of Arizona in a TV ad filled with images of terrorists and misstatements of facts:", "Kelli Ward, a former state senator, is one of five Republicans\u00a0running for U.S. Senate in the Aug. 28 primary. Polls show she is running second to Rep. Martha McSally, who was elected to Congress in 2014.", "A group calling itself DefendArizona was formed\u00a0as a super PAC in February to\u00a0support\u00a0McSally\u2019s bid.", "The DefendArizona TV ad now airing in Arizona warns that Ward would be weak on national defense and fighting terrorists.\u00a0But the facts don\u2019t support the ad\u2019s claims.", "The ad starts with powerful images of armed masked terrorists, while the narrator talks about ISIS \u2014 the terrorist group also known as the Islamic State. The vilifying visuals continue throughout the 30-second ad.", "\u201cISIS killed thousands. Plotted attacks on U.S. soil. They\u2019re a real threat,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cBut Kelli Ward called for restraint in fighting terrorism.\u201d", "On the screen, viewers see: \u201cKelli Ward on fighting ISIS \u2018\u2026restraint and realism,\u2019\u201d with a notation citing an interview that Ward gave to Seth Leibsohn on June 28, 2016.", "We listened to the interview and Ward did not call for \u201crestraint in fighting terrorism.\u201d Quite the opposite.\u00a0She said the U.S. has \u201cto be willing to decimate ISIS,\u201d not merely contain them.", "The partial quote used in the ad \u2014 \u201crestraint and realism\u201d \u2014 wasn\u2019t about fighting terrorists. It was directed at past presidents who, she claimed, overreached by trying to \u201cspread democracy\u201d and \u201cdo nation building.\u201d", "Here is her full response, which comes at\u00a0about the 5:25 minute mark, when Leibsohn asked Ward about her policy toward ISIS.", "Ward on \u201cThe Seth and Chris Show,\u201d June 28, 2016:\u00a0We can\u2019t continue with this strategy of go in and do nation building, try to spread democracy, and unfortunately we had that policy under George W. Bush as well. It isn\u2019t what traditional conservative foreign policy has been, which is restraint and realism. Those things need to be brought back into the process in the foreign policy arena.", "I think that we also, we have to be willing to decimate ISIS \u2013 not control them, not to curb their activities \u2026 not live with them, not to empower them, certainly not to empower them, and I think it is going to take that strong commander in chief and then conservative reinforcements in both the House and Senate to make it happen.", "Ward did not explain how she would \u201cdecimate ISIS,\u201d but she also did not say that she would pursue a policy of \u201crestraint in fighting terrorism,\u201d as the ad claims.", "The ad\u2019s narrator goes on to say,\u00a0\u201cKelli Ward would cut military funding, putting the war on terror at risk.\u201d Again, DefendArizona misstates the facts.", "On the screen, the ad cites \u201cVote Smart, 2016\u201d as its source. But that source, in fact, contradicts the ad.", "A\u00a02016 Vote Smart survey\u00a0asked candidates if they would be willing to cut defense spending to balance the budget. Ward answered \u201cno.\u201d She\u00a0did say that \u201ceverything has to be on the table\u201d when it comes to cutting spending, \u201cincluding\u00a0waste and bureaucracy in the Defense Department,\u201d but she went on to say the U.S. \u201cmust fund our troops and maintain the strongest military in the world.\u201d", "Her answer, in full:", "Kelli Ward, 2016:\u00a0I think everything has to be on the table for spending reductions, including waste and bureaucracy in the Defense Department. I wouldn\u2019t phrase it as \u201cdefense cuts,\u201d but rather that we cannot have sacred cows.", "Also military spending is constitutional while social spending is not. We must fund our troops and maintain the strongest military in the world. I believe in Peace Through Strength.", "DefendArizona twisted Ward\u2019s answer on cutting military spending to balance the budget \u2014 which was clearly \u201cno\u201d \u2014 by selectively seizing on how she would\u00a0consider cutting bureaucratic waste everywhere in government.", "After falsely saying she \u201cwould cut military funding,\u201d the ad immediately says \u201cWard\u2019s position would even have prevented raises for the troops who keep us safe.\u201d That\u2019s misleading.", "As juxtaposed in the ad, \u201cWard\u2019s position\u201d would grammatically refer to the preceding false claim about cutting military funding \u2014 leaving the mistaken impression that cutting military funding would prevent military pay raises. But that\u2019s not how it works.", "Military pay is set by statutory formula.", "As we have written before, federal law mandates that military pay raises be equal to the change in the Labor Department\u2019s annual\u00a0Employment Cost Index,\u00a0or ECI, for private sector wages.", "The automatic pay raise could be changed in two ways,\u00a0as explained\u00a0in an\u00a0May report\u00a0by the\u00a0nonpartisan Congressional Research Service:", "That means military pay raises cannot be prevented unless Congress or the president specifically acts separately from appropriating less funding for defense.", "The ad\u2019s narrator doesn\u2019t explain what he means by \u201cWard\u2019s position,\u201d but viewers may notice the language on the screen that says, \u201cKelli Ward: Opposed Defense Authorization Act.\u201d In larger type, it adds, \u201cIncluded pay raises for troops.\u201d", "This refers to statements Ward made about the annual National Defense Authorization Act in 2013 and 2016. But the ad doesn\u2019t explain what Ward said about the NDAA, so viewers would not know that those statements had nothing to do with cutting defense spending or blocking military pay raises.", "The ad cites a Dec. 1, 2013, interview that Ward gave to Luca Zanna, and a survey that she took during the 2016 campaign for the Arizona Liberty Caucus.", "In both cases, Ward expressed her opposition to\u00a0a controversial provision in the NDAA that would allow the military to detain U.S. citizens without trial if they are suspected of terror-related crimes.", "In the 2013 interview, Zanna said the provision would violate the U.S. Constitution and deny American citizens due process. Ward agreed.", "\u201cI don\u2019t support the bill, and I think there should always be due process \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s put there to protect the little guy,\u201d Ward said.", "In the 2016 survey, Ward checked \u201cyes\u201d when asked: \u201d Will you oppose any legislation that includes or allows the indefinite detention of US citizens without charge or trial, such as the most recent NDAA?\u201d", "This is not an unusual position for a conservative Republican. Days after Ward\u2019s interview, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, among others, voted against the NDAA for the same reason.", "In a\u00a0Dec. 19, 2013, statement, Cruz said, \u201cToday I voted against the National Defense Authorization Act. I am deeply concerned that Congress still has not prohibited President Obama\u2019s ability to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens arrested on American soil without trial or due process.\u201d", "Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and\u00a0Rand Paul of Kentucky have also opposed that provision and voted against the NDAA in 2013. The bill passed the Senate 84-15 with 12 Republicans opposed \u2014 so the \u201cno\u201d votes actually cast that year, as opposed to the ad\u2019s speculation about how Ward would have voted, did not prevent a military pay raise.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that the NDAA for fiscal years 2014 and 2016 did not include any language for military pay.", "For 2014, President Obama specified an alternative pay adjustment of 1 percent, revised down from the statutory formula of 1.8 percent, and Congress took no action to override Obama when it passed H.R. 3304, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2014.", "In a report on the fiscal year 2014 defense authorization and appropriations bills, CRS said \u201cH.R. 3304 included no provision setting the FY2014 military pay raise.\u201d", "More recently,\u00a0CRS said in May 8 report:\u00a0\u201cCongress specified no percentage increase for 1983, 2011, 2012, or 2014-2016, thereby allowing the permanent formula or the presidential alternative adjustment to go into effect.\u201d", "The NDAA is the first of a two-step process to fund the military.\u00a0The NDAA process gives the Defense Department the authority to make financial commitments,\u00a0but an annual defense appropriations bill actually gives the department the money to pay for its commitments.", "The NDAA is routinely approved and the \u201cno\u201d votes made no difference in 2014 and 2016. \u201cEnactment of the annual NDAA has come to be expected, as the FY2016 NDAA was the 54th consecutive defense authorization act to be enacted,\u201d CRS says.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
