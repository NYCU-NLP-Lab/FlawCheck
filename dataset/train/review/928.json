["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on March 29, 2019", "A social media post falsely claims that President Donald Trump \u201cimmediately dropped our sanctions against Russia\u201d after his election.", "Days after Attorney General William P. Barr issued a summary of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s concluded investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, a meme appeared on Facebook purporting to offer \u201cwhat we know\u201d about relations between Russia and President Donald Trump.", "But the popular meme offers a misleading take on Trump\u2019s actions regarding Russia after getting into office \u2014 namely by claiming\u00a0that \u201c[a]fter his election Trump immediately dropped our sanctions against Russia.\u201d", "That\u2019s not so.", "Trump did not drop the\u00a0sanctions that President Barack Obama implemented in late December 2016 in response to the cyberattack. Sanctions were imposed on two Russian intelligence agencies, four intelligence officers and three companies that provided support for the cyber operations; the administration also shut down two Russian compounds, in Maryland and New York, and ordered the removal of 35 \u201cintelligence operatives.\u201d", "Some Democrats, including now-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, misleadingly\u00a0claimed in the first weeks of the new administration that Trump was\u00a0\u201clifting sanctions\u201d on a Russian intelligence agency. \u201cVladimir Putin\u2019s thugs meddle with an American election, and President Trump gives them a thank you present,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a Feb. 2, 2017, press release. In fact, the change to which she referred was an adjustment\u00a0to the sanctions by the Treasury Department in order to authorize U.S. companies to import information technology products into Russia.", "Several months into his presidency, Trump actually signed a law\u00a0that, among other things, codified Obama\u2019s election-related sanctions \u2014 and instituted mandates for future sanctions.\u00a0The law\u00a0also requires congressional review if the president attempts to lift such sanctions. While Trump signed the legislation, which\u00a0passed with veto-proof majorities, he did so reluctantly,\u00a0calling\u00a0the bipartisan legislation \u201csignificantly flawed.\u201d", "It\u2019s worth noting that Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. about the sanctions. In a phone call with the ambassador, on the same day the Obama administration announced the sanctions, Flynn asked that Russia refrain from retaliating, according to the charge filed by the special counsel\u2019s office. Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, allegedly agreed that Russia would moderate its response, and Russian President Vladimir Putin then\u00a0issued a statement saying\u00a0Russia would not retaliate, citing plans to restore relations with the U.S. under the incoming Trump administration.", "People can debate whether the president\u2019s policies and mixed messages regarding Russian interference are aggressive enough, but the Trump administration has continued to implement various sanctions\u00a0against Russia for a number of issues, including election meddling, as a Jan. 11 report by the Congressional Research Service outlines in detail.\u00a0In March 2018, for example, the Treasury Department applied sanctions on\u00a0five entities and 19 individuals for cyber attacks, including during the 2016 election.", "The administration did lift sanctions earlier this year on the businesses of a Kremlin-linked Russian billionaire, drawing some criticism, though the Treasury Department did not lift sanctions on him personally. The department announced the sanctions against Oleg Deripaska and other oligarchs, as well as Russian government officials, in April 2018, calling the action a response to \u201cmalign activity\u201d by the Russian government, including \u201cmalicious cyber activities.\u201d\u00a0This month, Deripaska filed a lawsuit against the\u00a0department over the sanctions.", "According to the attorney general\u2019s summary, the Mueller report states that its investigation \u201cdid not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u201d Mueller\u2019s\u00a0full report has not yet been released.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.
