Chris Christie, who endorsed Trump last week, was shown standing behind the Republican presidential front-runner wearing an expression of unmasked horror. And, the government of Canada\u2019s immigration website was experiencing delays. Coincidence? The Internet didn\u2019t think so. By the end of the night, Trump had secured victories in seven states, well ahead of his competitors.
