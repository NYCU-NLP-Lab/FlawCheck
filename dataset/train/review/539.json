["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on October 12, 2020", "A tweet, shared by President Donald Trump, mischaracterizes a video that purports to show \u201cAmericans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services.\u201d The video actually shows a demonstration in Idaho against a public health order regarding COVID-19 requirements held by a church in a city hall parking lot.", "A church protest against a local public health order in Moscow, Idaho (population: 25,702), has gotten national attention since President Donald Trump retweeted a video from the event with a claim that falsely suggested it showed \u201cAmericans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services.\u201d", "The president added his own comment to his retweet, saying, \u201cDEMS WANT TO SHUT YOUR CHURCHES DOWN, PERMANENTLY. HOPE YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. VOTE NOW!\u201d", "Neither the original claim nor the president\u2019s comment is true.", "We\u2019ll start with the video.", "Trump retweeted a post from Cliff Maloney, the president of a Texas-based libertarian group, that included a video of a man being handcuffed in a parking lot while a group sings in the background.", "Maloney wrote: \u201cIf you would have told me in 2019 that we were just 1 year away from Americans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services, I would have thought you to be insane.

It was a demonstration against a local order requiring people to wear face masks or stay six feet apart in public to slow the spread of COVID-19.", "On Sept. 21, Moscow\u2019s city council had voted unanimously to extend that order until Jan. 5. Latah County, where Moscow is located, is at \u201cminimal risk\u201d for COVID-19, according to the public health district in north central Idaho. But average daily cases in the county rose from about 3 at the beginning of September to about 23 at the beginning of October.", "Two days after the council vote, on Sept. 23, Christ Church in Moscow posted on its Facebook page an invitation to gather at city hall for a \u201cflash psalm sing.\u201d The invitation said, \u201cWe are asking folks to please not wear a mask.\u201d", "Before the demonstration, city workers drew marks on the pavement that were six feet apart so that singers could safely participate.", "\u201cThe city had tried to provide an avenue for this event to take place,\u201d Moscow Police Chief James Fry told FactCheck.org in a phone interview.", "Also, before the event began, officers told the organizer that police would enforce the public health order, he said, and the organizer repeated that warning to participants.", "\u201cAs soon as he said it, everybody actually moved closer together,\u201d Fry said.", "Police issued tickets to five people for violating the city\u2019s ordinance, Fry said, and they charged two of those people for resisting arrest when those people refused to identify themselves.", "Among those ticketed was\u00a0Gabriel Rench, co-host of a political Christian podcast and a Republican candidate for a county office. Rench is the man being arrested in the viral video.", "Two days after the incident, Rench was a guest on Glenn Beck\u2019s radio show, where he described the event as a \u201cprotest, as kind of a worshipful protest\u201d to the public health order.", "Still, the falsehood that the video shows \u201cAmericans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services\u201d continues to spread on social media.", "As for Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cDEMS WANT TO SHUT YOUR CHURCHES DOWN, PERMANENTLY,\u201d that\u2019s not true, either.", "The Democratic Party platform for 2020 includes a section on \u201csupporting faith and service,\u201d which says: \u201cReligious freedom is a core American value and a core value of the Democratic Party. Democrats will protect the rights of each American for the free exercise of his or her own religion. It will be the policy of the Democratic Administration to advocate for religious freedom throughout the world.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
