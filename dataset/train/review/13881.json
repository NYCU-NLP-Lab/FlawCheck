Because, if they got a false social security card, if they got a false identification, if they got a false driver's license prior to us passing AB-60, if they got a false green card. And anyone who has family members who are undocumented knows that almost entirely everybody has secured some sort of false identification, that's what you need to survive, to work - they are eligible for massive deportation.", "De Le\u00f3n's remarks related to a 25 January 2017 executive order signed by Donald Trump, which ordered the enhancement of immigration law enforcement, especially in so-called \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions.", "The article offers no evidence that either President Trump or Immigration and Customs Enforcement had targeted or was about to target members of de Le\u00f3n's family.
