["About this rating", "On 6 March 2016, Bernie Sanders was asked during a Democratic presidential debate on CNN to identify any \"racial blindspots\" he might have. Sanders told moderator Don Lemon two stories\u00a0before concluding that America needed to put an end to institutional racism \u2014\u00a0one about the plight\u00a0of a Black Lives Matter activist, the other about an African-American senator who couldn't get a cab:", "When I was in one of my first years in Congress, I went to a meeting downtown in Washington, D.C. And I went there with another congressman, an African-American congressman. And then we kind of separated during the meeting. And then I saw him out later on.", "And he was sitting there waiting, and I said, well, let\u2019s go out and get a cab. How come you didn\u2019t go out and get a cab? He said, no, I don\u2019t get cabs in Washington, D.C. \u00a0This was 20 years ago. Because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. I couldn\u2019t believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in Washington, D.C.", "Tell you another story, I was with young people active in the Black Lives Matter movement. A young lady comes up to me and she says, you don\u2019t understand what police do in certain black communities. You don\u2019t understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and I\u2019m not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we\u2019ve got to hold police officers accountable, I\u2019m just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people.", "So to answer your question, I would say, and I think it\u2019s similar to what the secretary said, when you\u2019re white, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be living in a ghetto. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be poor. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.", "And I believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear. We will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system.", "Shortly afterward, a meme featuring a quote from the debate appeared on social media:", "While the image does show a real quote from Bernie Sanders, it is (like just about any quote that gets turned into a meme) lacking necessary context. \u00a0Regardless, Sanders detractors shared the image,\u00a0mocking\u00a0the senator both for using the word \"ghetto,\" and insinuating that white people could not be poor.", "Sanders supporters responded by sharing their own meme, which criticized the media for taking Sanders' quote out of context:", "The second meme, however, also\u00a0also\u00a0left\u00a0out some important detail and nuance, such as the fact that Sanders used the phrase\u00a0\"when you're white\" in his response. This meme\u00a0also attempts to frame Sanders' quote to make it appear\u00a0as though\u00a0he was simply repeating what the Black Lives Movement activist had told him.", "Transcripts\u00a0and video of the debate are widely available online:", "The date after the debate, reporters in Detroit\u00a0asked Sanders about his use of the\u00a0term \"ghetto\":", "\u201cWhat I meant to say is when you talk about ghetto, traditionally what you are talking about is African American communities,\u201d Sanders said.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
