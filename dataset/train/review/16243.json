["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 28, 2019", "Viral posts have erroneously claimed that Sen. Kamala Harris is the aunt of \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett, who police have accused of faking a hate crime.", "The evolving case of Jussie Smollett \u2014 who Chicago police say falsely reported to be a victim of a hate-crime attack\u00a0\u2014 has prompted some prominent Democrats to revisit their earlier words of support for the \u201cEmpire\u201d actor.", "Among them is Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who originally called the reported attack an \u201cattempted modern day lynching.\u201d She has since said the new developments in the Smollett case left her \u201csad, frustrated, and disappointed.\u201d", "Social media conspiracy theories, however, have tried to further link the presidential contender with Smollett by erroneously\u00a0claiming that\u00a0she is his aunt.", "Before she was married, Janet Smollett, Jussie\u2019s mother, had the same common last name as the senator, Harris, according to California birth information for Jussie Smollett. But that\u2019s not evidence they are sisters.", "Kamala Harris, who kept her maiden name, has only one sister,\u00a0Maya Harris, according to an obituary\u00a0for their mother,\u00a0Shyamala Harris,\u00a0and multiple profiles documenting the senator\u2019s political rise.", "Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told FactCheck.org in an email: \u201cWe have no information on Mr. Smollett being related to Senator Harris.\u201d", "Likewise, we could find no support for any familial connection between Jussie Smollett and Kamala Harris\u2019 husband, Douglas Emhoff.", "Some of the posts\u00a0present the fictitious family allegation within another claim cast without evidence. \u201cIt\u2019s been reported Chicago police found on Jussie\u2019s phone records that, just before the \u2018attack\u2019, he was in contact with Booker and his Aunt, Kamala Harris,\u201d those posts say. \u201cBooker\u201d is an apparent reference to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, another Democratic candidate\u00a0for president, who also initially issued a statement of support for Smollett.", "The posts go on to claim the alleged false attack was \u201cOrchestrated from the TOP.\u201d", "We could find no reporting that corroborates that account. Guglielmi told us that, \u201cgiven this case is now pending trial, I cannot comment on or confirm or deny any specific evidence we may or may not have.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cDr. Shyamala G.
