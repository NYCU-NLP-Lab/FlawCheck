A Facebook claim comparing Canadian refugee resettlement program benefits to average U.S. Social Security benefits is an old claim spread\u00a0by, among others, former President Donald Trump in a since-deleted tweet. The alleged monthly assistance benefit references a Canadian agency's\u00a0policy and is therefore, not comparable to U.S. Social Security benefits. The claim also suggests refugees are \"illegal,\" which is false; they fall under a special legal status assigned by the federal government. Lastly, the claim incorrectly quoted average monthly retirement benefits at $1,200. The average benefit was\u00a0$1,514\u00a0in 2020.", "The Associated Press contributed to this story.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
