But it\u2019s not.", "Let\u2019s begin by reviewing polls done in New Jersey on same-sex marriage.", "Back in April, the Rutgers-Eagleton poll asked 819 registered voters if they would vote for legalizing same-sex marriage if the question appeared on a ballot.

Thirty percent were opposed.", "The same poll found that 72 percent of New Jerseyans say it\u2019s a good idea to decide the same-sex marriage issue by referendum on the November ballot.", "Let\u2019s be clear: Sweeney\u2019s claim of 70 percent support only rings true when voters are asked if same-sex marriage should go on the ballot.

We saw an immediate uptick in African-American support.\"", "But even as that support grows, neither Redlawsk nor Murray said they\u2019ve seen approval numbers hitting the 70 percent mark claimed by Sweeney. Quinnipiac also hasn\u2019t seen support that high.", "We also looked at other polls to gauge national support and those numbers didn\u2019t approach 70 percent, either.", "A May Gallup poll found that 53 percent of Americans said the law should recognize same-sex marriage, marking the third time Gallup has measured a reading above 50 percent on the issue.
