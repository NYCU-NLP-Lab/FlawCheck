["About this rating", "Variations:", "Origins: \u00a0 Although many schools will offer some sort of bereavement consideration under exceptional circumstances, no college or university in the United States has a policy awarding a 4.0 average (or anything else) to a student whose roommate dies. This rumor (or at least its widespread distribution) appears to be of fairly recent origin, dating from approximately the mid-1970s. It most likely started out as an expression of the pressures students feel to achieve good grades in the form of a morbid joke (i.e., \"Even if the pressures of school cause some people to off themselves, there's no reason we can't profit by it!\"), and the joke became a legend when it was spread as true by credulous students, picking up variations along the way. A similar theme of suicide (and student grade consideration for witnessing it) can be found in the pencil suicide legend.", "Sightings:", "Additional information:", "Bennett, Gillian and Paul Smith. \u00a0 A Nest of Vipers.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Sheffield: Univ. of Sheffield Press, 1990. \u00a0 ISBN 1-85075-256-7 \u00a0 (pp. 69-76).", "Bronner, Simon J. \u00a0 Piled Higher and Deeper.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Little Rock: August House, 1990. \u00a0 ISBN 0-87483-154-7 \u00a0 (pp. 32-33).", "Brunvand, Jan Harold. \u00a0 Curses!
