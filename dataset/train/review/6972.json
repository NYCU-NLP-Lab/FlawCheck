The rules said you had to wear a mask ... Everyone in that hall was supposed to keep the mask on, other than the president, Biden and Chris Wallace.\"", "The Trump family's failure to wear masks became even more controversial when Trump, first lady Melania, and more than two dozen Republican officials and White House staff members tested positive for coronavirus in the days following the debate.", "In response to the COVID-19 outbreak at the White House, and with growing concern about the safety of the debates, the commission said that they would be more vigilant in enforcing the mask rules at the vice presidential debate.
