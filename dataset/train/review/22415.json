And I didn\u2019t need little Bruce Springsteen and all of these people.\u201d", "He then claimed, without evidence, that these artists would come in and perform a couple of songs at Clinton events because she was unable to get a crowd. \u201cWhat happens is they leave and everyone leaves with them, and she\u2019s still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd. Craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d", "Afterwards, Occupy Democrats posted a meme that quoted Springsteen as saying \"We're living in a frightening time.
