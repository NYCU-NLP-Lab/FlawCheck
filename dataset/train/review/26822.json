["In this July 31, 2018, photo, Elissa Slotkin, a Democratic candidate for Congress from Michigan, speaks during a news conference at her campaign headquarters in Lansing, Mich. (AP)", "It has been 18 years since a Democrat held the U.S. House seat in Michigan\u2019s 8th Congressional District.", "Even so, the race between political newcomer Elissa Slotkin and incumbent Mike Bishop is\u00a0viewed as a bellwether in the fight for control of the U.S. House in November.", "Slotkin, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst, is looking to unseat the two-term Republican congressman, who received 56 percent of the vote in his 2016 re-election bid.\u00a0The district, which stretches from north of Detroit to the state capital Lansing, voted for President Trump with 51 percent of the vote.", "Slotkin\u00a0is seen as a \"different kind\" of Democrat who\u00a0served in both the Bush and Obama administrations,\u00a0supports existing gun rights and criticizes\u00a0single-payer health care.", "One argument routinely made against Slotkin \u2014 and emphasized in a\u00a0recent radio ad\u00a0by\u00a0Bishop \u2014 is her weaker ties to the district.", "\"What do we know about D.C. insider Elissa Slotkin? Not much, since Elissa Slotkin just parachuted into the district to run for Congress. We know that Elissa Slotkin was recruited by Nancy Pelosi and sent here from Washington. Slotkin doesn\u2019t own a home in Michigan, and her only voting record \u2026 for herself, just a few days ago in the Michigan primary. Elissa Slotkin even admitted that she doesn\u2019t know our area.\"", "(Audio of Slotkin's voice)\u00a0\"I did not know the outline of the district\u2026\"", "\"Doesn\u2019t know the district? Then how can Elissa Slotkin know us?\"", "Here, we are focusing on her Michigan ties and the claim that she \"doesn\u2019t know\" the district\u2019s boundaries. She's not as much of an outsider as the ad says.", "Slotkin\u2019s campaign calls her a third-generation Michigan native. Slotkin was born in New York, but her family \u00a0returned to Michigan when she was 4 years old, the campaign said.\u00a0Slotkin grew up on her family\u2019s farm in Holly, which is located in the 8th district in Oakland County.", "Her great-grandfather established her family\u2019s meat business called Hygrade Foods, which opened its Detroit headquarters in 1949. The business created a number of foods, but most famously the Ballpark Frank, first sold at Tiger Stadium.", "Slotkin studied at Cornell University in New York and then went to graduate school at Columbia University.\u00a0She\u00a0served three tours in Iraq as a Central Intelligence Agency analyst before taking on various roles in Washington in the intelligence and defense departments during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.", "Slotkin moved back to her family\u2019s farm from D.C. in the spring of 2017 after her national security post ended with the Obama administration. She runs a small consulting business there called Pinpoint Consulting, according to the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.", "The ad claims that Slotkin doesn\u2019t own a home in Michigan. That is accurate, but leaves out some important context.", "Slotkin does not own her family\u2019s farm herself \u2014 the deed is in the name of her father, Curtis Slotkin, Oakland County property records show. Slotkin's father and stepmother live about 30 minutes from the farm, in the Detroit suburbs of Oakland County.", "The farm was purchased by Slotkin\u2019s grandfather and passed down to her father when her grandfather passed away, said Slotkin campaign spokeswoman Laura Epstein.", "\"When Elissa\u2019s parents pass,\" Epstein says, \"the property will then be in her name \u2014\u00a0in line with family tradition.\"", "Bishop\u2019s ad asserts that Slotkin has only voted in Michigan once, and that was in her own primary.", "That statement, according to state records, is correct.", "Michigan Secretary of State Elections Bureau records show that Slotkin has only voted once in the state, and that was in the August primary.", "The audio clip of Slotkin talking about the district\u2019s outlines is from a town hall event sponsored by the NAACP Lansing chapter, according to Bishop campaign consultant Stu Sandler.", "It is clear the audio is clipped. Slotkin said she \"did not know the outline of the district,\" even though the ad's retort of \"doesn't\" makes the listener think she still doesn't know.", "We were unable to obtain a full recording from that event. However, at a campaign volunteer event on July 7, Slotkin can be heard saying something similar, that she \"didn\u2019t know, probably a year and a half ago, the exact boundaries of the district.\" She then goes on to review the district\u2019s outlines.", "Epstein told PolitiFact that Slotkin frequently introduces herself by giving a lay of the land at the beginning of an event and sometimes starts by talking about the district lines.", "Bishop\u2019s ad portrays Slotkin as a \"Washington insider\" who parachuted into the district to run for the U.S. House.\u00a0It also utilized an audio clip to allege she doesn\u2019t know the outlines of the district.", "On some of the technical claims, the ad is accurate. Slotkin has only voted once in the state (in her own primary race), and\u00a0she is not a Michigan homeowner.", "However, the ad leaves out important details about her childhood\u00a0background in the district, and takes her words at a campaign event out of context. The home where she lives is owned by her parents on her family farm, and is slated to be passed down to her.", "The ad's soundbite is clipped to make it sound like Slotkin admitted to not knowing the outlines of her own district. A similar Slotkin statement shows she may not have known the boundaries before moving back to the state, but she does now.", "We rate the claim Half True.", "Update, Sept. 24, 2018:\u00a0This report was updated to include Slotkin's birth in New York. The rating remains the same.", "New York Times, \"Michigan U.S. House 8th District Results: Mike Bishop Wins,\" Accessed Sep. 14, 2018", "Mike Bishop\u2019s campaign ad, Accessed Sep. 11, 2018", "The Detroit News, \"Bishop's seat in Congress deemed 'toss up,\u2019\" July 13, 2018", "The Detroit News, \"Bishop's re-election fight seen as a bellwether for control of U.S. House,\" June 11, 2018", "Newsweek, \"Not Your Average Democrat: Who is Elissa Slotkin?\" June 9, 2018", "Oakland County Government, \"Register of Deeds,\" \u00a0Accessed Sep. 14, 2018", "Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, Accessed Sep. 14, 2018", "Michigan Secretary of State Elections Bureau, Accessed Sep. 14, 2018", "ABC 7 Detroit, \"Here's a look at Michigan's gerrymandered congressional districts,\" Aug. 1, 2018", "Michigan.gov, \"Michigan Congressional Districts map,\" accessed Sep. 17, 2018", "YouTube, \"Elissa Slotkin July 7th 2018 Campaign Volunteer Event,\" Accessed Sep. 17, 2018", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
