["About this rating", "A common form of glurge is the inspirational tale of faith, one meant to encourage Christians not to waver in their beliefs even in the face of denunciation by an unchallengeable authority figure.", "This theme is echoed in a often-shared tale about a religious army recruit whose disdainful CO decides to show the young man up by ordering him to park a jeep despite knowing that he can't drive:", "THE IMPOSSIBLE GOD OF A YOUNG SOLDIER", "A young man in the army was constantly humiliated because he believed in God. One day, the Captain wanted to humiliate him in front of the army.  He called out to the young man and said, \"Young man, come here, grab the key, and go and park the Jeep in front.\"", "The young man replied, \u201cI can't drive!\u201d", "The captain said, \"Well, then ask your God for help!
