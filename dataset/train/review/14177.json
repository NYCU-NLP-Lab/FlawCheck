Adult\u00a0American Bullfrogs, the largest frogs in the United States, only weigh about 1.5 pounds. The largest frog in the world, the Goliath Frog, is also too small to meet the requirements of this claim. The Goliath Frog, which has a relatively small habitat range in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea\u00a0(and not South Texas), only weighs about 7 pounds.", "In addition to its exaggerated weight,\u00a0we suspect this picture makes the frog appear larger than it actually is by using forced perspective. The hunter is most likely using a gig pole to hold the frog closer to the camera. This places the frog in the foreground, making it appear much larger in comparison to the man, now standing in the background.", "Photographs showing people \"holding up\" the Leaning Tower of Pisa are good examples of forced perspective photography.
