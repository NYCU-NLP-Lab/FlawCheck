Rick Scott has touted a strong Florida economy built up over his two terms in office. But Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate seeking to replace him, says the economy is \"propped up\" by low wages and people working multiple jobs just to make ends meet.", "In an interview on CBS Miami\u2019s \"Facing South Florida,\" host Jim DeFede asked the Tallahassee mayor if he gave Scott any credit for the economy.", "\"I give him credit for an economy that is largely propped up on low-wage work,\" Gillum said. \"Of course you've got a low unemployment rate when people have got to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet.\"", "In a companion fact-check, we looked Gillum\u2019s claim about low-wage work propping up Florida\u2019s economy (Half True). Here, we will examine Gillum\u2019s latter point about the low unemployment rate is propped up by people with multiple jobs.", "After the interview, the campaign of Gillum\u2019s Republican rival, Ron DeSantis, cried \"Pants on Fire!\" to Gillum\u2019s multiple jobs claim.

However, he said, Florida is ranked 26th in the United States in this measure. Nationally, the number of jobs rose 2.9 percentage points faster than the number of workers in that time period.", "Data about multiple job holders isn\u2019t specific enough to draw conclusions about the quality of the jobs, according to Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida\u2019s Institute for Economic Competitiveness.", "\"You can have multiple jobs even if your primary job is high-paying,\" Snaith said.", "Over the past year, the number of American workers who\u2019ve held multiple jobs has ranged between 6 million and 7 million, compared to more than 148 million who are employed in a single job.", "The number of jobs people hold does not affect the BLS unemployment rate.
