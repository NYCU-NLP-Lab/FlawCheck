This commission would consist of the heads of the Justice and Homeland Security departments and the Federal Trade Commission, plus 16 other members appointed by Congress, and the guidelines would be subject to further approvals", "If child predators are caught on their systems, tech companies can either comply with these practices or abide by their own practices, as long as they\u2019re approved by the commission.", "The bill allows victims the chance to sue tech companies that don\u2019t comply with practices approved by the commission.", "The impetus for the bill is data showing the volume of child sexual abuse files.

This key \u2014 think of it as an extra-long password \u2014 is used to protect the data that is stored in a particular message.", "In encrypted systems that are not \"end to end,\" the tech platform that carries the message holds the keys to encode and decode the message. When two users message each other, Vallee said, \"the first user sends the message to a platform \u2014 that is one encrypted stream \u2014 and the platform re-encrypts it, sends it to the second user, the receiver of the message, and that\u2019s a separate encryption stream.\"", "But an \"end to end\" encryption system means that the two users exchanging the message have their own keys.", "End-to-end systems are more secure because only the two people communicating have keys, not the third-party tech platform over which their messages travel.", "But that set-up limits a tech platform\u2019s ability to monitor messages for evidence of abuse or exploitation.", "The EARN IT Act\u2019s primary sponsor, Sen.
