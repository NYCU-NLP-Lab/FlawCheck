Few of his plans ever become law.", "\"(Ryan) has actually proposed three \u2014 total, three \u2014 bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999,\" David Canon was quoted as saying. \"Paul Ryan is not a detail kind of legislator in terms of putting bills together to pass, and he never has been.", "\"He is an ideas guy.\"", "When Ryan announced his endorsement of Trump, he wrote that the first step in setting policy agenda is \"putting it on paper and having a real debate.\"", "In making his claim, Canon suggested Ryan doesn\u2019t follow his own advice \u2014 or hasn\u2019t had much success with it.

Early cosponsors can be heavily involved in the bill\u2019s content and committee chairs, while they don\u2019t necessarily write more bills, often serve as facilitators.", "A better indicator of effectiveness, Victor said, is a tool developed by two professors that measures a lawmaker relative to his or her peers.", "It takes into account the content of a lawmaker\u2019s bills and how far the bills moved. Policy bills, for example, increase a lawmaker\u2019s score more than commemorative bills. But it only looks at solely sponsored bills, which does not necessarily give the full picture of a lawmaker\u2019s impact.", "By this tool, Ryan comes off as more effective, though his effectiveness is below the benchmark expectation for all but one two-year period since 1999.", "The expectation is calculated based on his party, tenure and specific committee and subcommittee positions he has held.", "Our rating", "Canon told the New York Times that Ryan \"has actually proposed three \u2014 total, three \u2014 bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999.\"", "Canon was referring to bills Ryan solely sponsored and is on target by that measure.
