Greg Abbott speaks on the topic of illegal immigration during a press conference on the border at Anzalduas Park, Tuesday, March 9, 2021, in Mission, Texas. (Joel Martinez/The Monitor via AP)", "One day after Gov. Greg Abbott announced he would\u00a0lift\u00a0the statewide mask mandate and allow\u00a0all businesses to open to 100% capacity, the governor turned his attention to\u00a0the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0spreading along\u00a0the\u00a0Texas-Mexico\u00a0border.", "\"The Biden\u00a0Administration is recklessly releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants who have COVID into Texas communities,\" the governor said in a March 3 tweet. \"The Biden Admin. must IMMEDIATELY end this callous act that exposes Texans & Americans to COVID.\"", "According to a March 2 NBC News article, 108\u00a0asylum seekers\u00a0in Brownsville had tested positive for COVID-19 by rapid testing\u00a0while waiting to\u00a0board busses\u00a0destined for other U.S. cities.\u00a0The city of Brownsville conducts these tests on migrants after they are released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. As of March 2, the 108 positive cases represented\u00a0about 6% of all tests\u00a0the city had been administered\u00a0since the city began testing on Jan. 25.\u00a0While the city can refer infected migrants\u00a0to non-governmental organizations for quarantining, it does not have the authority to stop people from traveling throughout the country.", "The\u00a0NBC\u00a0News\u00a0article was picked up by Fox News and the New York Post\u00a0the next day\u00a0and\u00a0prompted\u00a0Abbott's March 3\u00a0tweet about COVID-positive migrants endangering Texas communities.", "Abbott continued this\u00a0line of attack\u00a0in the subsequent days, first during a TV interview with\u00a0KPRC-TV\u00a0in\u00a0Houston,\u00a0then in an interview with\u00a0CNBC, and\u00a0again\u00a0in another\u00a0tweet\u00a0in which\u00a0he\u00a0said the state denied the federal government\u2019s\u00a0request for help\u00a0in screening, testing and quarantining migrants.", "\"The unconscionable act by the Biden Administration of releasing COVID-positive illegal immigrants in our state puts the lives of Texans and Americans at risk,\" he tweeted. \"Border security is strictly a federal responsibility.\"", "In a\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0news conference\u00a0at the border, Abbott\u00a0urged the Biden\u00a0administration to increase\u00a0U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00a0funding, which is responsible for testing and detaining anyone crossing the border.", "A\u00a0negative\u00a0coronavirus test is required by the federal government before entry\u00a0to the U.S.\u00a0While U.S.

agency\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement.", "Felipe Romero, a spokesperson for the city of Brownsville,\u00a0confirmed that\u00a0the city was rapid testing each person Border Patrol\u00a0dropped off\u00a0at the city\u2019s bus terminal.\u00a0The 108 positive cases reported by NBC News on March 2\u00a0had\u00a0climbed to\u00a0204\u00a0Tuesday, or about\u00a012% of the total number of people tested.", "Romero said that there are two\u00a0categories of migrants who\u00a0are being released\u00a0to\u00a0the city\u2019s\u00a0bus terminal: asylum seekers\u00a0entering\u00a0after the repeal of the Trump\u00a0administration\u2019s Remain in Mexico policy, and\u00a0those who have been\u00a0apprehended at the border\u00a0and allowed to remain in the country pending immigration court hearings,\u00a0a policy\u00a0derogatorily described\u00a0by critics\u00a0as\u00a0\"catch\u00a0and release.\"", "Let\u2019s look closely at each category to determine the accuracy of Abbott\u2019s tweet.", "In February, the Biden\u00a0administration announced that it was dismantling many of the immigration policies put in place by former President Donald Trump.\u00a0The first phase of reform\u00a0began by processing\u00a0the 25,000\u00a0asylum seekers\u00a0who had been forced to remain in Mexico\u00a0under Trump\u2019s Migrant Protection Protocols.", "On Feb. 19, federal authorities began processing up to 300 people per day at three different border crossings\u00a0\u2014 two in Texas, in Brownsville and\u00a0El Paso, and one in California,\u00a0according to the Associated Press.", "Because Abbott\u2019s statement focuses on the release of \"hundreds of illegal immigrants\" in Texas, this fact-check focuses on the\u00a0crossings\u00a0in Brownsville and El Paso.\u00a0While\u00a0the city of Brownsville reported\u00a0108\u00a0positive\u00a0cases among migrants\u00a0released\u00a0by Border Patrol, the city of El Paso\u00a0said that zero positive cases have been identified through its rapid testing program.\u00a0El Paso\u2019s tests are being supplied by the city and\u00a0administered by non-governmental organizations, a city spokesperson said.", "The second major policy\u00a0shift releasing migrants\u00a0in Texas communities\u00a0is the reintroduction of the Obama-era policy\u00a0that allows asylum seekers to remain in the U.S. while awaiting court dates.\u00a0That policy was suspended by the Trump\u00a0administration\u00a0in 2018.\u00a0The\u00a0revived policy\u00a0allows some families who are apprehended by Border Patrol to be released in the U.S. as they await their asylum proceedings.\u00a0However,\u00a0not all\u00a0apprehended\u00a0migrants\u00a0are awarded this privilege;\u00a0many\u00a0are expelled to their origin countries.",

policy could be released anywhere along the border.\u00a0However,\u00a0the number\u00a0of\u00a0tests administered to\u00a0people released under this policy\u00a0is\u00a0unknown\u00a0and,\u00a0according to Border Report,\u00a0there are concerns that not all are being tested before they travel elsewhere in the U.S.\u00a0to await court dates.", "It\u2019s unclear what actual numbers form the basis of\u00a0Abbott\u2019s claim that \"hundreds of illegal immigrants\" carrying COVID-19 are being released in Texas.
