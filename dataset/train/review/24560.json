["About this rating", "In June 2015, a controversial opinion piece entitled \"The Black Dilemma\" was circulated online along with an attribution to the Baltimore Sun.", "Although many online postings of the below-displayed piece in June 2015 claimed that it had been recently published in Baltimore Sun, the newspaper denied this.", "The missive has actually been circulating on the internet since at least September 2014, when it was published under the title \"Ten Percent Is Not Enough\" on the American Renaissance blog, which Southern Poverty Law Center has described as espousing white supremacist and racist ideologies.", "The American Renaissance posting was originally attributed to Anthony Bryan; but that name was stripped from versions shared via internet forums, Craigslist postings, and comments sections of several race-related articles. Several different authorial names have been attached to the piece, including \"John S. Mosby\" (a Confederate cavalry officer), \"Edmund Hughes,\" and \"Ian Duncan,\" but the article didn't truly go viral until after the Baltimore Sun attribution was tacked on.", "Below is the piece that has been circulating for years:", "The black/white experiment has failed.", "For almost 150 years the United States has been conducting an experiment. The subjects of the experiment: black people and working-class whites. The hypothesis to be tested: Can a people taken from the jungles of Africa and forced into slavery be fully integrated as citizens in a majority white population?", "The whites were descendants of Europeans who had created a majestic civilization. The former slaves had been tribal peoples with no written language and virtually no intellectual achievements. Acting on a policy that was not fair to either group, the government released newly freed black people into a white society that saw them as inferiors. America has struggled with racial discord ever since.", "Decade after decade the problems persisted but the experimenters never gave up. They insisted that if they could find the right formula the experiment would work, and concocted program after program to get the result they wanted. They created the Freedman\u2019s Bureau, passed civil rights laws, tried to build the Great Society, declared War on Poverty, ordered race preferences, built housing projects, and tried midnight basketball. Their new laws intruded into people\u2019s lives in ways that would have been otherwise unthinkable. They called in National Guard troops to enforce school integration. They outlawed freedom of association. Over the protests of parents, they put white children on buses and sent them to black schools and vice versa. They tried with money, special programs, relaxed standards, and endless handwringing to close the \u201cachievement gap.\u201d To keep white backlash in check they began punishing public and even private statements on race. They hung up Orwellian public banners that commanded whites to \u201cCelebrate Diversity!\u201d and \u201cSay No To Racism.\u201d Nothing was off limits if it might salvage the experiment.", "Some thought that what W.E.B. Du Bois called the Talented Tenth would lead the way for black people. A group of elite, educated blacks would knock down doors of opportunity and show the world what blacks were capable of. There is a Talented Tenth. They are the black Americans who have become entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors and scientists. But ten percent is not enough. For the experiment to work, the ten percent has to be followed by a critical mass of people who can hold middle-class jobs and promote social stability. That is what is missing. Through the years, too many black people continue to show an inability to function and prosper in a culture unsuited to them.", "Detroit is bankrupt, the south side of Chicago is a war zone, and majority-black cities all over America are beset by degeneracy and violence. And blacks never take responsibility for their failures. Instead, they lash out in anger and resentment. Across the generations and across the country, as we have seen in Detroit, Watts, Newark, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, and now Ferguson, rioting and looting are just one racial incident away.", "The white elite would tell us that this doesn\u2019t mean the experiment has failed. We just have to try harder. We need more money, more time, more understanding, more programs, more opportunities. But nothing changes no matter how much money is spent, no matter how many laws are passed, no matter how many black geniuses are portrayed on TV, and no matter who is president.", "Some argue it\u2019s a problem of \u201cculture,\u201d as if culture creates people\u2019s behavior instead of the other way around. Others blame \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d But since 1965, when the elites opened America\u2019s doors to the Third World, immigrants from Asia and India\u2013people who are not white, not rich, and not \u201cconnected\u201d\u2013have quietly succeeded. While the children of these people are winning spelling bees and getting top scores on the SAT, black \u201cyouths\u201d are committing half the country\u2019s violent crime\u2013crime, which includes viciously punching random white people on the street for the thrill of it, that has nothing to do with poverty.", "The experiment has failed. Not because of culture, or white privilege, or racism. The fundamental problem is that white people and black people are different. They differ intellectually and temperamentally. These differences result in permanent social incompatibility.", "Our rulers don\u2019t seem to understand just how tired their white subjects are with this experiment. They don\u2019t understand that white people aren\u2019t out to get black people; they are just exhausted with them. They are exhausted by the social pathologies, the violence, the endless complaints, the blind racial solidarity, the bottomless pit of grievances, the excuses, the reflexive animosity. The elites explain everything with \u201cracism,\u201d and refuse to believe that white frustration could soon reach the boiling point.", "They will be the only ones who are surprised when real revolution comes to the United States, and that it is white people who lead the revolt.", "Article reformatted to meet current style guidelines and updated with links to Baltimore Sun and Southern Poverty Law Center.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
