["About this rating", "On 14 March 2017, two days after the release of \"Lavender,\" a controversial, clown-themed music video in which Snoop Dogg is seen firing a prank \"Bang!\" flag gun at a clown decked out to resemble President Trump, several unreliable web sites posted an article bearing the false claim that the rapper was arrested by the Secret Service for making \"violent threats\" against the president:", "Snoop Dogg, major pothead and advocate of violence as a form of protest, has landed in hot water over his video \u201cLavender,\u201d in which he shoots Donald Trump. In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that\u2019s not what got him in trouble.", "After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:", "\"No, man. I don\u2019t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin\u2019 that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That\u2019s not violence\u2026it\u2019s survival of the species.\"", "The quote, along with the claim that Snoop Dogg was arrested for making the statement, was entirely fabricated, however. It originated on the fake news web site TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which describes its own content as \"satirical\":", "All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.", "The intent of the article, presumably, was to spoof expressions of outrage that greeted the video, including that of President Trump himself (who once joked at a campaign event that he could \"shoot somebody\" and still not lose voters):", "Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2017", "The video was also blasted by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), according to a TMZ report cited in Billboard:", "\"Snoop shouldn't have done that. We've had presidents assassinated in this country before so anything like that is really something we should be careful about,\" Rubio said. \"I think people could disagree on policy, but we gotta be careful with that kind of thing, because the wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea, you can have a real problem. I'm not sure what Snoop was thinking. He should think about that a little.\"", "In his own remarks to Billboard, Snoop Dogg insisted he wasn't looking for controversy, though did he set out to make a statement:", "\"When I be putting shit out, I don\u2019t ever expect or look for a reaction. I just put it out because I feel like it\u2019s something that\u2019s missing. Any time I drop something, I\u2019m trying to fill in a void,\" he says. \"I feel like it\u2019s a lot of people making cool records, having fun, partying, but nobody\u2019s dealing with the real issue with this f--king clown as president, and the shit that we dealing with out here, so I wanted to take time out to push pause on a party record and make one of these records for the time being.\"", "Snoop Dogg's video for \"Lavender,\" directed by Jesse Wellens, can be viewed in its entirety via YouTube:", "Diamond, Jeremy. \u00a0 \"Trump: I Could 'Shoot Somebody and I Wouldn't Lose Voters.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN. \u00a0 24 January 2016.", "Platon, Adelle. \u00a0 \"Senator Marco Rubio on Snoop Dogg's 'Lavender' Video's Mocking Trump: 'Snoop Shouldn't Have Done That.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Billboard. \u00a0 14 March 2017.", "Platon, Adelle. \u00a0 \"Snoop Dogg on 'Lavender' Video Parodying Trump: 'Nobody's Dealing with the Real Issue with This F--king Clown as President.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Billboard. \u00a0 12 March 2017.", "Reed, Ryan. \u00a0 \"Watch Snoop Dogg Aim Gun at Clown-Trump in 'Lavender' Video.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Rolling Stone. \u00a0 13 March 2017.", "Stryker. \u00a0 \"BREAKING: Snoop Dogg Arrested for Conspiracy After Talking About His \u2018Murder Trump\u2019 Video.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense. \u00a0 14 March 2017.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
