Pelosi in the KPIX report is shown walking through San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown District and encouraging people to visit its shops and restaurants, which were seeing a decline in business since the coronavirus outbreak began in China.", "At the time, KPIX reported, there were no active cases of coronavirus in San Francisco.
