["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "On June 6, 2012, Wisconsin Democrat Pat Kreitlow huffed and puffed in declaring that U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., \"voted twice to end Medicare.\"\n\nIt was a claim, made numerous times about others, that PolitiFact National labeled its Lie of the Year for 2011. Kreitlow, who is challenging Duffy in the November 2012 election, earned a Pants on Fire for his version.\n\nA day later, Duffy fumed over Kreitlow\u2019s support of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform law, saying it \"slashed $500 billion from Medicare.\"\n\nThat has been another popular claim for the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nLet\u2019s see whether Duffy is spouting anything more than hot air.\n\nPast claims\n\nThe first phases of the health care reform law, which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2012, took effect in March 2010.\n\nSix months later, the 60 Plus Association, a conservative advocacy group for senior citizens, began running TV ads against Democratic members of Congress from Wisconsin and other states who voted for it.\n\nThe claim? The law \"will cut $500 billion from Medicare\" and \"hurt the quality\" of care for seniors.\n\nPolitiFact National found the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget, but reduces the growth of Medicare spending by just over $500 billion over 10 years.\n\nIn rating the claim Mostly False, our colleagues noted that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will rise to $929 billion in 2020, an increase of $430 million over actual spending in 2009.\n\nSo, Medicare spending continues to increase, but not by as much as it would have without the reform law.\n\nThe claims of a $500 billion cut to Medicare, however, have continued.\n\nIn May 2012, a Republican Ohio congressman accused a Democratic Ohio congresswoman of having \"gutted Medicare by $500 billion\" by voting for the health care reform law. PolitiFact Ohio rated the claim Mostly False, noting that Medicare spending would have grown at a faster rate without the law.\n\nThe same month, PolitiFact Florida gave a Mostly False to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for saying \"seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund \u2018Obamacare.\u2019\" Our colleagues found that slowing the growth in Medicare spending is intended to offset, to some extent, the overall cost of the law.\n\n(For a comprehensive look at Medicare and claims made about it, read \"The PolitiFact guide to Medicare attack lines.\")\n\nDuffy claim\n\nDuffy's made his claim in a news release issued June 7, 2012 to criticize Kreitlow's support of the health care reform law. Regarding the law's effect on Medicare, Duffy said:\n\n\"Kreitlow's full-throated support for the government\u2019s unwarranted takeover of healthcare slashed $500 billion from Medicare, too.\"\n\n(Claims that Obama's law is a government takeover of health care was PolitiFact National's Lie of the Year for 2010.)\n\nDuffy campaign manager Justin Richards argued that \"slashed\" is an accurate way of describing how the law reduces the growth in Medicare spending. But even though some of the news article excerpts Richards cited referred to cuts, he acknowledged that the reductions are in the growth of future spending.\n\nOur rating\n\nDuffy said the federal health care reform law \"slashed $500 billion from Medicare.\"\n\nThere is an element of truth in his statement because Medicare spending will grow by about $500 billion less than it would have without the law. But the law has not already reduced Medicare spending by $500 billion, as Duffy suggests.\n\nWe rate Duffy's statement Mostly False.", "PolitiFact, \"Medicare \u2018cuts\u2019 in the health care law will hurt seniors, says 60 Plus Association,\" Sept. 20, 2010\n\nPolitiFact Virginia, \"American Crossroads says Tim Kaine urged $500 billion in Medicare cuts,\" June 20, 2012\n\nPolitiFact Ohio, \"Jim Renacci says that Betty Sutton \u2018gutted Medicare by $500 billion\u2019 with her vote for health care reform,\" May 21, 2012\n\nPolitiFact Florida, \"Chamber says Bill Nelson voted to cut Medicare $500 billion,\" \u00a0May 15, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, \"The PolitiFact guide to Medicare attack lines,\" May 6, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
