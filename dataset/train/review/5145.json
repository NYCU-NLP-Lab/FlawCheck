In fact, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers\u00a0activated the guard\u00a0early in the morning of Aug. 24, well before Trump weighed in.", "Trump:\u00a0We could solve that problem [Portland] quickly. Like I did in Kenosha. You know, Kenosha went through three or four days. You wouldn\u2019t have a Kenosha right now. We demanded that they send in the National Guard. Called the governor. And in all fairness, the governor did it. Not enough, but it was enough to put it out. And we ultimately put in where we had 1,000 people and we put it out quickly. You wouldn\u2019t have Kenosha right now.", "Trump also tweeted on Aug. 31 that he was the one who brought in the guard.", "If I didn\u2019t INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha, Wisconsin, there would be no Kenosha right now.

That never happened, the mayor said.", "Trump, Sept. 1: I saw last night where these radical anarchists were trying to get into the mayor\u2019s house, and lots of bad things were happening to this poor, foolish, very stupid mayor. \u2026 They had tremendous numbers of people, really, harassing him horribly, and, I guess, trying to break into his house.", "Antaramian\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement there were no angry mobs.", "Antaramian, Sept. 1:\u00a0I want to dispel the President\u2019s statement that angry mobs were trying to get into my house last night. Nothing of the sort happened. The statement in the President\u2019s video is completely false.", "Near the end of the\u00a0first day\u00a0of Ingraham\u2019s aired interview, Trump brought up New York and COVID-19, blaming the governor of the state for coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and incorrectly stating that if New York could be excluded from U.S. statistics, America would have \u201cthe best numbers in the world.\u201d", "Trump: [Cuomo] killed 11,000 people with bad decisions on nursing homes. He\u2019s the number one state in the country by far for death. I mean, probably in the whole world, for death. You take New York out of the equation, I think we have among the best numbers anyway, but you take New York, we have the best numbers in the world, countrywide.", "With respect to Cuomo, Trump is referring to the governor\u2019s controversial March 25\u00a0advisory\u00a0that stated that no nursing home resident \u201cshall be denied re-admission or admission \u2026 based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19\u201d and that nursing homes are \u201cprohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.\u201d", "Critics have argued that the policy allowed patients returning from the hospital to seed infections in nursing homes, leading to a high number of avoidable deaths.", "In May, Cuomo\u00a0rescinded\u00a0the policy with an executive order that required hospitals to release patients to nursing homes only after a negative COVID-19 test.", "As a\u00a0Kaiser Health News\u00a0fact-check article\u00a0explains, the motivation for the original policy may have been to avoid overwhelming hospitals, but many nursing homes interpreted the directive to mean that they could not refuse infected patients, even though that\u2019s not strictly what the rules said.", "Cuomo has been defensive about the policy, going so far as to issue a\u00a0report\u00a0from the New York State Department of Health in July that concluded the data indicate infections in nursing homes came from staff members, not from returning residents.", "According to the report, which was revised on July 20,\u00a098%\u00a0of nursing homes that received a returning patient already had a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case in the facility, and the peak of nursing home deaths in early April is consistent with the timing of the peak of staff infections. The report also argued that by the time patients were readmitted to a nursing home, they would no longer be infectious.", "Many outside experts, however, did not think the report could rule out an effect of the directive on fatalities. \u201cI don\u2019t think this report convincingly demonstrates that the policy was not another important driver of deaths,\u201d City University of New York epidemiologist\u00a0Denis Nash\u00a0told\u00a0ProPublica.", "At the same time,\u00a0Kaiser Health News\u00a0reported that experts agreed with the general idea that staffers and possibly visitors were the primary drivers of death within the state\u2019s nursing homes.", "\u201cBased on the timeline of the policy and deaths in the city, it is very\u00a0unlikely\u00a0that policy contributed to thousands of deaths,\u201d Columbia University epidemiologist\u00a0Rupak Shivakoti\u00a0told\u00a0KHN.", "That rebuts the president\u2019s claim that Cuomo\u2019s \u201cbad decisions\u201d caused \u201c11,000 deaths.\u201d", "The state\u00a0reports\u00a0only 6,639 confirmed and presumed deaths in nursing homes and adult care facilities through Sept. 1, although that tally is widely believed to be an undercount, since it only includes deaths that occurred in a facility, not residents who died in the hospital, for example.", "The White House did not explain the source of the 11,000 number, but that estimate has been used in news reports to describe how far off New York\u2019s death count might be. An Aug. 11 Associated Press\u00a0story\u00a0explained that the Kaiser Family Foundation found that for the 43 states with data, nursing home deaths on average accounted for 44% of all COVID-19 deaths (the percentage has\u00a0since fallen\u00a0to 43% for 45 states). Applying that percentage to New York, according to the article, \u201cwould translate to more than 11,000 nursing home deaths.\u201d", "Also, the president\u2019s related claim that New York entirely skews the U.S. mortality figures is off-base \u2014 and reminiscent of his false\u00a0claim last month\u00a0that removing the New York tri-state area would give America a better per-capita death rate than \u201cour peer nations of Western Europe.\u201d", "While it\u2019s true that New York has more raw COVID-19 deaths than any other state, it\u2019s second \u2014\u00a0behind\u00a0New Jersey \u2014 in terms of deaths per capita. And removing the state from national statistics does not give the U.S. the \u201cbest numbers in the world.\u201d", "Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0show\u00a0the state reported a total of 32,662 COVID-19 deaths as of Sept. 2, or 168 deaths per 100,000 people, using 2019\u00a0U.S. Census Bureau\u00a0figures.", "Excluding New York from the U.S. totals \u2014 a dubious prospect, given the unfairness to other nations \u2014\u00a0 improves America\u2019s relative standing on two mortality metrics, but only slightly.", "On per-capita deaths, the U.S. falls from 56 deaths per 100,000 to 49. On Johns Hopkins University\u2019s\u00a0ranking\u00a0of 169 countries on per-capita deaths, that moves America from the 11th highest spot to the 12th, better than the one additional country of Mexico.", "On the case fatality rate, or the percentage of people who are known to be infected who die, the U.S. drops from 3.0% to 2.7%. That\u2019s enough to improve from the 55th highest mortality rate to tying with Chile, Moldova, Austria, Estonia and Uruguay for the 66th highest spot, per Johns Hopkins\u2019 list. But it\u2019s still worse than around 60% of the world.", "Neither change benefits the U.S. all that much, and certainly not to the degree that Trump claims. Moreover, even removing New York\u2019s death toll from the U.S. total, America\u00a0still\u00a0has the highest number of COVID-19 deaths than any other nation.", "Listing his accomplishments on the military, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m bringing many of the troops home and most of the troops home.\u201d But the number of troops in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria is currently nearly the same as it was in the last month under Obama. And the overall number of overseas troops is only slightly smaller.", "Trump: On the military, I\u2019ve accomplished, first of all I\u2019m bringing many of the troops home and most of the troops home, even cutting down Germany. Okay?", "Trump\u2019s comment on Fox News was similar to one he made at the Republican National Convention, when he said, \u201cUnlike previous administrations I have kept America out of new wars, and our troops are coming home.\u201d Those kinds of sentiments have been a familiar refrain during Trump\u2019s presidency, such as when he said during a\u00a0cabinet meeting\u00a0in October 2019, \u201cWe\u2019re bringing our troops back home. I got elected on bringing our soldiers back home.\u201d", "But the president hasn\u2019t made much headway in reducing the number of U.S. troops in conflict zones, or overseas in general.", "According to the Pentagon\u2019s\u00a0Defense Manpower Data Center, there were about 15,000 troops total in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria on Dec. 31, 2016, near the end of the Obama presidency (9,294 in Afghanistan, 5,540 in Iraq and 204 in Syria). A spokesman for the Department of Defense told us, \u201cU.S. force levels in Afghanistan currently remain in the mid-8,000s with the goal to reduce that number to less than 5,000 by the end of November. U.S. forces in Iraq number approximately 5,200 and in Syria number approximately 500.\u201d That puts the current levels at about 14,200, or about 5% lower than when Obama left office.", "Trump said recently\u00a0that he expects the number of troops in Afghanistan to be cut to under 5,000 by November, but that hasn\u2019t happened yet.", "The total number of overseas troops was about 199,000 in the last month of the Obama administration, according to the Defense Manpower Data Center. The most recently available figures from the DMDC in June put the number at 171,025. But that figure comes with a large asterisk. Beginning in December 2017, the Trump administration\u00a0stopped reporting\u00a0the troop levels in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria in its DMDC data for overseas troop levels. A Pentagon spokesperson told us those figures are withheld for \u201csecurity purposes.\u201d", "But as we said, DoD provided us approximate figures for those three countries. Adding the approximated figures to the reported figure for the remaining overseas troop levels, the total comes to about 185,000. That\u2019s about a 7% decrease from the final Obama levels.", "Citing Pentagon leaders, the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported in late July that Trump was making a concerted push to significantly reduce overseas troop levels by Election Day in November. But despite the president\u2019s efforts to fulfill his 2016 campaign promise to significantly reduce the number of U.S. troops serving overseas, the article notes, \u201cTrump has been stymied at virtually every turn\u201d as members of his administration and military leaders \u201chave talked Trump out of specific withdrawals or employed delaying tactics.\u201d", "Trump\u00a0recently approved\u00a0plans to reduce the number of troops in Germany by 9,500 (from about 34,500), but not all of them will be coming home. According to\u00a0Joseph Parent, a professor of international relations at the University of Notre Dame, roughly half of them are being redeployed within Europe, and the other half would return to the U.S. \u00a0\u2014 \u201cbut that has not yet been approved.\u201d", "While Trump has cut overseas troop levels a bit, and promises more by November, by any measure, it is a stretch to claim, as Trump did, that he is bringing \u201cmost of the troops home.\u201d", "In Michigan, the stay-at-home order was lifted on June 1, though the state ordered a stop to indoor service at bars in July. In North Carolina, some businesses began reopening in May, and the state will enter a new phase of reopening on Sept. 4. Yet Trump claimed both states were \u201cclosed.\u201d", "He further distorted the facts in claiming: \u201cThese states that are closed are run by Democrats.\u201d Although Trump used the term \u201cclosed,\u201d no states are any longer under stay-at-home orders. Most states have restrictions, though. According to a Washington Post analysis, updated Aug. 28, only one state has \u201cmajor\u201d restrictions \u2013 California, which has a Democratic governor. And 16 more states (including Washington, D.C.) have \u201cmoderate\u201d restrictions, including three with Republican governors.", "Among the 24 states that have paused or reversed their reopenings, 11 have Republican governors and 13 have Democratic governors, according to\u00a0a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0analysis updated Sept. 1.", "Trump: Michigan is closed. All of these states that are closed. North Carolina is closed. These states that are closed are run by Democrats. And the reason they\u2019re closed is because we have an election on Nov. 3, and they don\u2019t want the opening of the states and they don\u2019t want the income. They want to keep it nice and closed.", "The president exaggerated the situation in Michigan and North Carolina and floated a political motivation for state closures that falls apart upon a closer look at state actions.", "On June 1, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, lifted the state stay-at-home order, allowing some businesses to reopen, such as retailers and restaurants at limited capacity. A month later, however, she ordered indoor service at bars in the lower part of the state closed, after a cluster of cases were linked to one East Lansing bar in late June. By early July, 174 cases were linked to the bar. Whitmer later extended the indoor-bar-closure to the rest of the state, for bars that get more than 70% of their sales from alcohol.", "Michigan is in what the New York Times labels a \u201creversing\u201d phase. Other states in the \u201creversing\u201d phase include four with Republican governors and six with Democratic governors. For instance, Florida and Texas \u2014 also in the \u201creversing\u201d category and led by Republican governors \u2014 ordered bar closures or a stop to on-premise consumption of alcohol in late June when coronavirus cases spiked in those states.", "North Carolina is in the \u201cpausing\u201d phase, according to the Times, along with five other Democratic-led states and seven Republican-led states. Gov. Roy Cooper declared that some businesses could reopen in May, though the state remained paused in its \u201cPhase 2\u201d guidelines throughout the summer. Cooper\u00a0announced a \u201cmodest step forward\u201d to the next reopening phase to begin Sept. 4.", "Other states that are in the process of \u201creopening,\u201d by the Times\u2019 categorization, include two Republican states and four Democratic ones.", "Trump also claimed: \u201cThey\u2019re keeping the churches closed on purpose. You have churches that still aren\u2019t open but you\u2019re allowed to go to a casino.\u201d While some churches may be closed, the Times analysis shows every state but California allows places of worship to be open. California allows churches to be open in some counties and casinos in \u201csome areas,\u201d the Times says.", "Referring to the 1994 crime bill championed by then-Sen. Biden, Trump said \u201cAnd look what Biden did in 1994.

Although the bill received bipartisan support at the time, it has been criticized for some of its provisions, such as mandatory minimum sentencing, and its impact on mass incarceration, particularly of Black men. As we have written, the trend of increasing imprisonment began well before 1994, but experts told us the 1994 law exacerbated the issue.", "Trump: Criminal justice reform was such a big deal.

In his Sept. 1 comments, Trump said \u201cthe looters, the anarchists, the rioters\u201d had boarded a plane headed in an entirely different direction, \u201cgoing from Washington to wherever.\u201d", "There is also the question of how such a large cadre of obvious troublemakers could have all made it past the forces of the Transportation Security Administration.", "Neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to our questions about Trump\u2019s claim.", "NBC News\u2019 Ben Collins pointed out that the baffling story was reminiscent of a viral Facebook post from June.", "President Trump tonight: \"We had somebody get on a plane\u2026 it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms.\"", "Viral Facebook rumor from June: \"At least a dozen males got off the plane in Boise from Seattle, dressed head to toe in black.\" pic.twitter.com/xn5YrM1R2k", "\u2014 Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) September 1, 2020", "Misleads on number of COVID-19 deaths.\u00a0Trump repeated a statistic he previously\u00a0shared\u00a0on Twitter that falsely claimed \u201conly 6%\u201d of reported COVID-19 deaths were from the coronavirus.", "\u201cAnd by the way, I saw a statistic come out the other day talking about only 6% of the people actually died from COVID,\u201d he\u00a0said, \u201cwhich is a very interesting \u2014 that they died from other reasons.\u201d", "Ingraham pointed out that\u2019s not what the data showed \u2014 that in fact, the figure was referring to the propensity of coronavirus patients to have comorbidities, or\u00a0other health conditions, which has long been known \u2014 and that \u201cCOVID might ultimately have been the key morbidity to hit them.\u201d", "\u201cIt could be,\u201d Trump allowed, \u201cbut it\u2019s an interesting statistic.\u201d", "As we have\u00a0written, the statistic comes from the CDC, which\u00a0noted\u00a0that for 6% of deaths involving COVID-19 between Feb. 1 and Aug. 22, COVID-19 was the only cause of death mentioned on the death certificate. That doesn\u2019t mean that those were the only patients who died from COVID-19.", "Because infection with the coronavirus can trigger other conditions, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, it\u2019s not surprising that many COVID-19 patients who died would have other causes of death listed on their death certificates. And because it\u2019s well known that chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure tend to make COVID-19 more severe, it\u2019s also expected that many patients would have those diseases listed as contributors as well.", "The CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics told us that contrary to Trump\u2019s suggestion, the underlying cause of death \u2014 the condition ultimately responsible for a patient\u2019s demise \u2014 was COVID-19 in 92% of deaths involving the coronavirus.", "Suburbs:\u00a0Trump\u00a0falsely claimed\u00a0that he \u201cended the regulation \u2026 that mandated low-income housing\u201d in the suburbs. Experts\u00a0told us\u00a0the 2015 Housing and Urban Development \u201cAffirmatively Furthering Fair Housing\u201d rule that Secretary Ben Carson\u00a0announced\u00a0he will terminate did not require low-income housing to be built in the suburbs or anywhere else. The rule changed the process for jurisdictions that receive HUD funding to show how they plan to address fair housing issues in their communities. The rule\u00a0specifically says\u00a0it \u201cdoes not impose any land use decisions or zoning laws on any local government.\u201d", "Ventilators:\u00a0Trump, talking about the Strategic National Stockpile, again\u00a0falsely claimed\u00a0that the federal government initially \u201cdidn\u2019t have ventilators\u201d to treat COVID-19 patients because \u201cwe had empty cupboards when I got there.\u201d In June, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services\u00a0told us\u00a0that the SNS had 16,660 ventilators \u201cimmediately available for use\u201d in March 2020, which \u201cwould not have been much different\u201d from the \u201ctotal number of ventilators in the SNS inventory immediately available for use\u201d when Trump was inaugurated in January 2017. As of June 17, Trump had inherited more ventilators than were distributed from the stockpile during the pandemic.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
