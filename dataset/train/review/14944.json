Two surnames in particular come up frequently in discussions of who secretly runs the New World Order, Rothschild and Rockefeller.

There are sources who claim that Jacob Greenberg/Mark Zuckerberg's maternal grandfather is none other than sometime Rockefeller associate Maurice R. \"Hank\" Greenberg, who allegedly married one of David Rockefeller's daughters. That's a less promising lead than it sounds, however. According to CNN, Greenberg married Corinne Phyllis Zuckerman (no relation to the Rockefeller family that we could find) and had four children named Jeffrey, Evan, Scott, and Cathleen \u2014 but none named Jacob.", "For his part, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was born on 14 May 1984 to middle class parents, Ed and Karen Zuckerberg (no relation to the Rockefeller family that we could find), in White Plains, New York.", "For Jacob Greenberg's part, we know nothing about him except that his mugshot appeared on the Internet a few years ago in connection with an arrest in Arizona.
