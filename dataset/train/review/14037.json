Mike Pence of Indiana after delivering his acceptance speech at the RNC in Cleveland. (AP)", "Donald Trump tweaked one of his most repeated falsehoods as he accepted the Republican nomination for president.", "On the final night of the Republican National Convention, Trump positioned himself as the fiscally sound counter to rival and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, whom he claimed is proposing a tax hike.", "\"Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone, I mean everyone,\" Trump said. \"America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it'll happen and it'll happen fast.\"", "This is the fourth time we\u2019ve weighed in on a statement from Trump about America\u2019s tax rate. The difference tonight is the slightly tempered tone. Instead of declaring the United States as having the highest tax rate, he said we\u2019re one of the highest-taxed countries.", "That\u2019s progress.

So the United States does have a higher corporate tax rate than most of its industrialized peers.", "That said, it\u2019s worth remembering that the official tax rates are one thing, while the tax rates corporations actually pay can be substantially less. In practice, U.S. companies pay less because they can claim deductions and exclusions.", "Trump teed up his statement by mentioning the tax impact on \"middle-income Americans and businesses,\" which could easily lead listeners to perceive this as a question of overall tax burden, not businesses specifically.", "Our rating", "Trump called the United States \"one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.\"", "Trump tweaked his language this time in effort to improve his accuracy, saying it\u2019s \"one of\" the highest taxed nations.
