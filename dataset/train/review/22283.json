["The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone who may have been exposed to COVID-19 quarantine for 14 days. But a recent Instagram post appears to claim that the federal health agency then delivers food and supplies to make those weeks more comfortable.", "\"If you know anybody (that) test positive with COVID-19 the CDC has funding,\" the post says. \"They deliver groceries and cleaning products (2) twice while you\u2019re in quarantine. Call the CDc intake hotline.\" The post then lists two phone numbers with Philadelphia area codes.", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Order online or choose curbside pickup instead, the CDC says.", "The website also includes recommendations on meal kit and food delivery safety, guidance for food and grocery delivery drivers trying to stay safe, and resources for people seeking food assistance during the pandemic.", "It lists two numbers for information about meal sites, food banks and other services: 1-866-3-HUNGRY for English speakers and 1-877-8-HAMBRE for Spanish speakers.", "We called the two Philadelphia numbers in the Instagram post. They turned out to be access numbers for a health center\u2019s voicemail system.", "James Garrow, director of communications for the Public Health Department in Philadelphia, told us the numbers are for contact tracers with the city\u2019s COVID-19 containment division.", "Contact tracers try to connect people who test positive for COVID-19 with services and support if they need it, but the health department doesn\u2019t provide those services, Garrow said.", "He also said he was unaware of other organizations, including any that may use the abbreviation \"CDC,\" offering such services to people in quarantine in Philadelphia.", "In any case, the numbers listed as the \"CDC intake hotline\" are actually city numbers that are not for arranging food deliveries.", "We tried contacting the user who made the post, but did not immediately get a response.", "We rate this post False.", "Instagram post, Dec. 4, 2020", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, When to quarantine, updated Dec. 10, 2020", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mission, role, pledge, visited Dec. 14, 2020", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Running errands, updated Sept. 11, 2020", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food & grocery pick-up & delivery drivers, updated Nov. 12, 2020", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and food system resources during COVID-19 pandemic, visited Dec. 14, 2020", "Email interview with Belsie Gonz\u00e1lez, senior public affairs specialist, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "Email interview with James Garrow, communications director, Philadelphia Department of Public Health, Dec. 14, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
