["The report\u00a0was published here on March 2, 2020 by Komchadluek, a Thai newspaper. The report, titled \u201c7 evil things that virus COVID-19 is afraid of\u201d, has been shared more than 12,000 times and read more than 34,000 times, according to the website\u2019s data tracker.", "Below is a screenshot of the misleading article:", "Parts of the report translate to English as: \u201cWhen realised, you shouldn't be alarmed but you should be aware of the evil \u2018COVID-19\u2019 because there are still some \u2018weaknesses\u2019 that this evil virus can not overcome.", "\"Komchadluek\u00a0has compiled 7 things that COVID-19 fears:", "The seven \u201cfears\u201d were also shared here in a Thai-language Facebook health group with more than 6,000 followers. A similar claim was\u00a0posted on social media in Thai here, here, here and here; in Spanish here; and in English here, here, here, here and here.", "But\u00a0some of the tips in the report\u00a0are misleading and do not correlate with\u00a0health experts' advice.", "--UV light--", "While ultraviolet (UV) light can be used at extremely high intensities as a disinfectant, everyday UV emitters, such as the sun, only release low levels of UV light.", "\u201cUltraviolet is able to kill COVID-19 if it is exposed to the concentrated UV ray in a certain amount of time and distance,\u201d Dr. Pokrath Hansasuta, an assistant professor of virology in Chulalongkorn University\u2019s Department of Microbiology, explained to AFP by phone on March 18, 2020. \u201cHowever, that level of UV exposure is harmful to human\u2019s skin. Most likely, it will be in the light bulb or lamp as the natural UV from the sun is not strong enough to kill it.\u201d", "The World Health Organization (WHO) also stated here that UV should not be used as a disinfectant for the coronavirus. \u201cUV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation,\u201d the agency said.", "Below is the screenshot of the WHO\u2019s advisory:", "--Chlorine disinfectants--", "Chlorine disinfectants can also be effective repellents against the coronavirus, but only if used properly.", "The WHO states here that chlorine should not be applied directly to your\u00a0body as it can be damaging to clothes and sensitive areas, such as your eyes and mouth.", "But\u00a0the Australian Department of Health notes here that chlorine should be used as a disinfectant in clean supplies and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes here that it can be used to disinfect certain water sources, like pools.", "--High temperatures--", "It remains unclear whether or not temperatures of 56 degrees celsius would effectively kill the novel coronavirus, according to experts.", "\u201cSince it is a new virus, there is no research that proves that,\u201d Dr. Hansasuta said.", "It is true, however, that the SARS coronavirus, which caused a global epidemic in 2002-2003, was killed in temperatures above 56 degrees Celsius, according to the WHO.", "--Other claims--", "The other practices mentioned in the misleading post can be effective precautions when applied properly.", "Alcohol based products, such as hand sanitizer, do require a high percentage of alcohol to kill the virus. \u201cOnly alcohol 70-75% can kill the novel coronavirus,\u201d Dr. Hansasuta said.", "The CDC noted here that hand sanitizers should be at least 60% alcohol and cleaning solutions at least 70%. Such products, however, are not for consumption.", "Keeping air-ventilated is also a recommended practice, but does not provide foolproof protection against the virus.", "\u201cAlthough there is no evidence of the effectiveness of mechanical or natural air ventilation to reduce COVID-19 transmission, there is mechanistic plausibility, and it should be applied, and enhanced especially in settings where people gather regularly,\u201d the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control states in a report here.", "Frequently washing one\u2019s hands and taking steps to maintain a strong immune system are also widely accepted as worthwhile preventive measures.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
