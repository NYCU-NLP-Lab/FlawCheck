["As reported by AFP, the Ethiopian Airlines jet, a Boeing 737 MAX 8, crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. All 157 people onboard were killed. Numerous countries and airlines have banned the 737 MAX 8 since\u00a0the crash, which was the second fatal accident involving the model since October.", "Since Sunday\u2019s tragedy, a series of photos and videos falsely purporting to show the Ethiopian Airlines crash have been spreading online. We\u2019ve fact-checked some of these here.", "In this particular clip posted a day after the crash -- which we\u2019ve archived here -- the caption says that the footage was obtained from \u201cintelligence\u201d.", "\u201cZambian Watch working with its intelligence have obtained a full video of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 which took off from Addis Ababa to Nairobi and crashed killing 157 people,\u201d it reads.", "The same video was posted on Twitter\u00a0in a post that claimed it was footage captured by one of the passengers.", "AFP traced the clip to a video simulation Youtube Channel called Bull Bosphorus, which has more than 30,000 subscribers. The account mostly posts animated simulations of flights, as well as live-action videos filmed through plane windows.", "The caption on this particular clip states clearly: \u201cTHIS IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, THIS IS ONLY A SIMULATED FLIGHT CRASH FOR ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT ET302.\u201d", "It says that the video was made using X-Plane 11, a computer program which allows users to create realistic flight simulations. You can find other examples on the company\u2019s website.", "Looking at the two videos posted on YouTube and Facebook, it\u2019s easy to see that they show the same simulation. The Facebook version is of a lower quality, which makes it easier to mistake it for filmed video footage rather than an animation -- particularly when watching it on a small screen like a mobile phone.", "In the two screenshots below, you can see the same three signs on the plane\u2019s dashboard in red, orange and yellow.", "And here, you can see the wing of the plane with the Ethiopian Airlines logo, at a similar angle with the same line of white clouds below.", "Finally, you can see the same distinctive cloud patterns in both the simulation on YouTube and the video circulating on Facebook.", "When false content like this is spreading around social media, it\u2019s often useful to take a quick look through the comments to see what people are saying. In this case, several commenters on Facebook correctly identified the footage as having been taken from a simulation -- including this user who linked to the original YouTube video.", "\u200b \u200b", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
