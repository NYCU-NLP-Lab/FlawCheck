["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 18, 2018", "Q: Did the late surgeon Dean Lorich expose \u201cClinton Foundation corruption in Haiti\u201d?", "A: No. Lorich co-authored an article criticizing the medical response to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, not the Clinton Foundation.", "FULL QUESTION", "Is this true or not? THANK YOU!!!!", "FULL ANSWER", "For years, conspiracy theories have abounded tying Bill and Hillary Clinton to various deaths.", "One of the latest examples in that flow of wild tales is a story about a surgeon found dead in New York City who \u2014 a slew of questionable websites have falsely claimed \u2014 \u201cexposed Clinton Foundation corruption in Haiti.\u201d", "An article repeating that assertion appeared April 24 on dailypresser.com, leading our readers to ask us about its veracity. Facebook users also rightfully flagged the claim as potentially false.", "That story originally appeared in December 2017 on yournewswire.com, a website known to distribute fictitious reports. It has been recycled numerous times, as conspiracy theories often are. (It\u2019s worth noting that the website also featured another story, which PolitiFact\u00a0debunked, claiming that a Haitian official who died was set to \u201cexpose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice.\u201d)", "Beneath its bogus headline, the story begins with an accurate detail:\u00a0Dean Lorich, a 54-year-old respected surgeon, was found dead in his apartment \u2014 in December, not in late April, which the date on the dailypresser.com post implies. He was discovered with a knife in his torso, as was\u00a0widely reported at the time.", "Lorich\u2019s death was ruled a suicide, the New York City Police Department confirmed in an email to FactCheck.org.", "But the bogus article goes on to falsely claim that\u00a0Lorich wrote \u201can article published by CNN, accusing the Clinton Foundation of widespread corruption and malpractice in Haiti that cost the lives of thousands of children.\u201d", "Lorich did co-author a Jan. 25, 2010, opinion piece for CNN that offered a grim view of the medical response in Haiti immediately following the devastating earthquake. The natural disaster on Jan. 12, 2010, left hundreds of thousands of people dead and many more injured and homeless in the already impoverished country.", "The CNN piece describes how David L. Helfet, a doctor and one of the three co-authors, assembled a 13-member squad of medical professionals to travel to Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince, on a private plane within 24 hours of the earthquake. But the team encountered delays flying into the capital and, when it finally did get to Haiti, the doctors found the medical effort on the ground was ill-equipped, understaffed and poorly coordinated.", "The doctors\u2019 article refers to the Clintons once and only in passing.", "\u201cThe difficulties in getting in \u2014 despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and Dr. Helfet\u2019s connections with Partners in Health and Bill and Hillary Clinton \u2014 only hinted at the difficulties we would have once we arrived,\u201d they wrote.", "At no point did the doctors accuse the Clintons of wrongdoing, corruption, or of being the reason for the response\u2019s shortcomings. Nor did they do so in a Wall Street Journal opinion\u00a0piece that they wrote that same month.", "In the Wall Street Journal, the doctors did call the U.S. response an \u201cembarrassment\u201d and said they received \u201cvirtually no support from any branch of the U.S. government, including the State Department.\u201d Hillary Clinton was secretary of state at the time.", "But Helfet told us by phone that their writings were not targeted at the Clinton Foundation or at anyone in particular.", "\u201cIt was against the whole (response) organization and the waste of resources and the lack of organization in Haiti,\u201d said Helfet, director emeritus of the Orthopedic Trauma Service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York and a longtime friend of Lorich.", "Lorich was a fellow under Helfet at the Hospital for Special Surgery between 1995 and 1996, Helfet said. In 2002, Lorich returned to the hospital and became the associate director of\u00a0the Orthopedic Trauma Service, where he worked until his death.", "Helfet, who called the conspiracy theory \u201cludicrous,\u201d said he and Lorich talked nearly every day and that they hadn\u2019t discussed the issues they faced in Haiti in years. He also said Lorich wasn\u2019t political.", "\u201cHe was totally apolitical,\u201d Helfet said. \u201cHe took care of a lot of people across the political spectrum that were injured in New York and he would get invited to political events \u2014 that was the extent of his political involvement.\u201d", "The false story about Lorich also said the doctor voiced \u201chis concerns to Hillary Clinton directly.\u201d", "An email\u00a0released by the State Department and published on WikiLeaks does show that Lorich expressed his concerns about the medical response in an email that was forwarded several times, eventually to Clinton. But what he wrote there is similar to the doctors\u2019 published accounts; it likewise makes no mention of the Clintons or their foundation or corruption.", "The Clintons were involved in the response and recovery following the earthquake, in a variety of ways. In addition to Hillary Clinton\u2019s role as\u00a0secretary of state, Bill Clinton was the United Nations special envoy for Haiti\u00a0and co-chaired the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission.", "The Clinton Foundation also spent millions in Haiti for efforts such as opening a cholera treatment center, assisting farmers and improving schools. But over the years, the Clintons\u2019\u00a0work received\u00a0mixed reviews\u00a0in Haiti. Some Haitians lamented that Clinton-backed projects did not yield the number of jobs expected and that luxury hotels built seemed to mostly benefit foreign investors and the wealthy. Supporters pointed to other Clinton-associated projects, such as one that energized the peanut-farming industry, as indicators of progress.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Eachempati, Soumitra R., et al. \u201cHaiti: Obama\u2019s Katrina.\u201d The Wall Street Journal. 27 Jan 2010.", "Grimpel, John.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
