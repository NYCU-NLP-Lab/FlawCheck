["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on August 23, 2016", "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, made the baseless insinuation that Donald Trump compromised national security by inviting a man with Russian ties to his intelligence briefing.", "Appearing on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d Mook said Trump was accompanied to his first intelligence briefing on Aug. 17 by \u201csomeone who\u2019s on the payroll of the Russia Times, which is a basically a propaganda arm of the Kremlin.\u201d\u00a0Mook claimed this \u201cgentleman\u201d \u2014 whom he did not name \u2014 \u201cwas sitting two seats away from Vladimir Putin\u201d at RT\u2019s\u00a010th anniversary gala in December, and he demanded that Trump disclose \u201cwhether his advisers are having meetings with the Kremlin.\u201d", "Who is this mysterious, unnamed gentleman? The Clinton campaign told us Mook was referring to retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who until two years ago was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama.", "Flynn is not \u201con the payroll of the Russia Times.\u201d He was merely one of many speakers at RT\u2019s anniversary conference on Dec. 10, 2015, in Moscow. RT is a Russian\u00a0government-funded TV station once known as Russia Today.", "Mook made his misleading assertion about Flynn shortly after he claimed that \u201creal questions being raised about whether Donald Trump himself is just a puppet for the Kremlin.\u201d Host George\u00a0Stephanopoulos questioned Mook about that claim \u2014 which has been part of the Clinton campaign\u2019s attacks on Trump ever since it was reported that Russia was likely behind the successful attacks on computer servers at the Democratic National Committee and the release of DNC emails.", "Stephanopoulos: You\u2019re saying he\u2019s a puppet for the Kremlin?", "Mook: Well, real questions are being raised about that. We \u2014 again, there\u2019s a web of financial ties to the Russians that he refuses to disclose. We\u2019ve seen over the last few week, him parroted Vladimir Putin in his own remarks. We saw the Republican Party platform changed. She saw Donald Trump talk about leaving NATO and leaving our Eastern European allies vulnerable to a Russian attack. The gentleman he brought with him to his security briefing just last week is someone who\u2019s on the payroll of the Russia Times, which is a basically a propaganda arm of the Kremlin. He was sitting two seats away from Vladimir Putin at their 10th anniversary gala.", "There are a lot of questions here. And we need Donald Trump to disclose all of his financial ties and whether his advisers are having meetings with the Kremlin.", "Trump has praised Putin and has called for improved relations with Russia, but he has denied that he has had any financial ties with Russia beyond holding the Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow in 2013. Also, Trump\u2019s personal financial disclosure report required of all presidential candidates does not show any investments in Russia.", "However, Paul Manafort, who until last week was Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, did have business dealings with Russian-aligned leaders in Ukraine, as uncovered by the New York Times.\u00a0With Manafort gone, Mook redirected the campaign\u2019s guilt-by-association attack on Trump by questioning Flynn\u2019s associations with the Kremlin.", "Trump was joined at his first intelligence briefing on Aug. 17 at FBI headquarters in New York City by Flynn and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. As Huffington Post wrote,\u00a0Flynn \u201cwas paid by a Russian state-funded television network to speak at its 10th-anniversary gala,\u201d and Putin attended that conference. Reuters reported that Flynn \u201cwas pictured sitting at the head table with Putin\u201d at the conference.", "In an Aug. 15 article, Flynn told the Washington Post that his speaking engagement was arranged by his speaker\u2019s bureau and that he was paid for it. He said he was introduced to Putin, but did not speak to him.", "Flynn was one of many speakers at the conference. Others included former London Mayor\u00a0Ken Livingstone, Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein and liberal U.S. media commentator Thom Hartmann.", "Flynn sat for a\u00a0one-on-one Q&A with RT correspondent Sophie Shevardnadze on the Islamic State terrorist group and the crisis in the Middle East. His conference topic coincided with the announcement that he is writing a book with Michael Ledeen on the Middle East called\u00a0\u201cThe Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies.\u201d", "The Clinton campaign provided no evidence that Flynn is \u201con the payroll\u201d of RT or that he is \u201chaving meetings with the Kremlin,\u201d as Mook alleged. It forwarded us a Politico story from May that said Flynn \u201cmakes semi-regular appearances on RT as an analyst.\u201d Politico wrote that Flynn is \u201cpresumably\u201d paid for those TV appearances, but the retired lieutenant general told the Post\u00a0that he is not paid by RT or any other TV stations, because \u201cI want to be able to speak freely about what I believe.\u201d", "Steve Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us\u00a0that Flynn\u2019s appearance at the conference certainly raises a question about Flynn\u2019s \u201cjudgment and good sense,\u201d but it probably doesn\u2019t make him a security risk.", "Flynn served for more than three decades in the military, including in Afghanistan and Iraq. He became\u00a0the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama in July 2012. He was asked to resign after two years and quickly became one of the Obama administration\u2019s most vocal critics on foreign policy.\u00a0\u201cI was asked to step down,\u201d Flynn admitted\u00a0in an interview with Foreign Policy. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily the timing that I wanted, but I understand.\u201d", "Trump reportedly\u00a0considered Flynn during his search for a vice presidential candidate, but ultimately picked Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.", "The Clinton campaign certainly has legitimate questions it can raise about Trump\u2019s foreign policy positions, such as his comments that he would\u00a0\u201ccertainly look at\u201d pulling the United States out of NATO, because it is \u201cobsolete\u201d and \u201cis costing us a fortune.\u201d But Mook goes too far in falsely claiming that Flynn is \u201con the payroll\u201d of the government-funded Russia TV station and insinuating without evidence that the retired United States Army lieutenant general is a security risk.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bc5ba499-7ee5-4a42-b789-4c4fa7ea8912", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
