["Member of parliament in South Africa's second-largest opposition party, tweeted that South Africa is not ready to ease covid-19 lockdown.", "Echoing an earlier statement from the party, EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi tweeted that South Africa was easing its national Covid-19 lockdown despite the WHO saying the country wasn\u2019t ready.", "No such statement from the WHO exists. Spokespeople say the international agency makes recommendations but governments have to make their own decisions.", "The health department has cited the WHO guidelines, but the degree to which the country is following them remains unclear.", "South Africa\u2019s nationwide Covid-19 lockdown was eased in April 2020. It was replaced with a risk adjusted strategy, where regulations are lifted or reimplemented as the risk of transmission changes.", "While welcomed by some, others saw the lockdown relaxation as coming too soon.", "One of them was Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, a member of parliament for the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), South Africa\u2019s second-largest opposition party.", "He tweeted on 30 June that South Africa was easing its national lockdown \u201cdespite [the World Health Organization] unequivocally declaring that [South Africa] was not ready\u201d. A similar statement had been made by the EFF in a press statement on 28 May.", "Did the World Health Organization, or WHO, declare South Africa was not ready to lift its lockdown? And did it say so \u201cunequivocally\u201d?", "Africa Check could not find any statements from the WHO saying that South Africa was \u201cnot ready\u201d to ease its lockdown. Ndlozi did not respond to requests for evidence supporting his claim.", "Multiple spokespeople for the WHO said that they were not aware of any statement like this being issued.", "The organisation did, however, publish guidelines for \u201ctransitioning to and maintaining a steady state\u201d of low-level or no transmission of Covid-19 on 14 April.", "These included, for example, that transmission be \u201ccontrolled\u201d, public health services be \u201csufficient\u201d and \u201cworkplace preventive measures\u201d be in place.\u00a0Exact details of how to measure these are not provided.", "Dr Owen Kaluwa, WHO representative to South Africa, commented on the transition guidelines in an interview with news channel eNCA on 20 May.", "\u201cThese are global guidelines that countries have to use or apply according to their local contexts, and local situations,\u201d he said.", "The video was originally shared online by eNCA with a banner saying that South Africa did not meet WHO criteria to ease the lockdown. The news channel later deleted the video and republished it without the banner, saying it had been \u201cincorrectly titled\u201d.", "The WHO did release a statement urging \u201ccaution as countries in Africa ease lockdowns\u201d on 28 May.", "It noted concerns that \u201cCovid-19 cases could start increasing rapidly\u201d if lockdown measures were relaxed too quickly. The statement mentioned South Africa, saying that the time taken for the number of cases to double had remained stable since the lockdown measures started being relaxed.", "\u201cEnding a lockdown is not an event, but a process, and it\u2019s important to have a clear view of local conditions so informed decisions can be made about how to relax these measures,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa.", "But the final decision of when and how to lift lockdowns lies with governments, Collins Boakye-Agyemang, communications officer for the WHO regional office for Africa, told Africa Check.", "He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t get involved in the decision of whether a government should lock down or not. Our role is to provide the best possible evidence and recommendation to countries. Then they have to make their own decisions.\u201d", "These decisions, he said, should be based on countries\u2019 \u201clocal context, the epidemiological situation and the health system\u2019s capacity\u201d.", "South Africa\u2019s health minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, referred to the \u201csound guidelines\u201d from the WHO in an article on 15 May.", "Four days later, during a closed media briefing, he reportedly suggested the rate of new infections had to slow before the lockdown could be lifted \u201cin line with World Health Organization guidelines\u201d.", "His presentation included the guidelines for easing public health measures and indicators used to monitor them.", "For example, the \u201cweekly rate of change in the number of positive cases per district\u201d was presented as an indicator for the WHO\u2019s guideline that \u201cevidence should show that the Covid-19 transmission is controlled\u201d.", "But the presentation did not say if the guideline was being met or the rate that would need to be achieved in order to do so.", "Africa Check asked the health department if it considered South Africa to meet the guidelines. At the time of publication we had not received a response.", "Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, a member of parliament for the EFF, claimed the WHO \u201cunequivocally\u201d said South Africa was not ready to ease its national Covid-19 lockdown.", "We could find no evidence of the WHO making this statement.
