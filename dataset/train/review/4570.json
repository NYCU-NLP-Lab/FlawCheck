Obama\u2019s office has said a story claiming otherwise is false.", "Former President Barack Obama has not announced plans to seek the top position at the United Nations, as an online story\u00a0claims. It would be major news if he did.", "Yet that claim \u2014 shared on multiple websites and across social media\u00a0in recent months \u2014 again surfaced this week, prompting some Facebook users to rightfully flag the report as potentially false.", "\u201cObama Announces Bid To Become UN Secretary General,\u201d reads the April 12 headline on the website\u00a0usanews24h.tk.", "While rumors of Obama\u2019s alleged\u00a0interest in the job date back several years, we could find no evidence of Obama ever making such an announcement. In fact, it\u2019s something that his office has previously denied.", "\u201cObama\u2019s office says the story is not true and he\u2019s happy as a private citizen,\u201d the Associated Press reported in February.", "Even if the claims were accurate, such a \u201cbid\u201d would be moot for now.\u00a0The current U.N. secretary-general,\u00a0Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u00a0of Portugal, took the position last year, replacing South Korea\u2019s Ban Ki-moon.\u00a0Guterres was appointed to a five-year term, concluding at the end of 2021.", "The recycled story on USA News didn\u2019t bother to update the fact that Ban was no longer the secretary-general. It says, \u201cU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s term expires in early 2017, making Obama\u2019s bid for the position a possibility.\u201d But it is no longer a possibility.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "\u201cAppointment Process | United Nations Secretary-General.\u201d United Nations.
