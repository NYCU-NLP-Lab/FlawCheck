Our source inside the West Wing says a dispatch was sent to the border to cease and desist all complaints against Gus [Hopkins]. He has been issued full immunity and a Presidential Pardon for his felony. The dispatch has to legally be delivered in person, so official channels may not see the communication in time for Gus to have Easter Dinner with his family.", "Trump has not issued a pardon for Hopkins, and nothing that appears on nbcnews.world can be trusted.

They were seen in the viral video holding rifles while dressed in military-style fatigues and detaining a large group of migrants, which included children, before handing them off to the Border Patrol. The video drew outrage, prompting the American Civil Liberties Union to dub UCP a \"fascist militia.\"", "Hopkins' past convictions include felony firearm possession and impersonation of a peace officer.
