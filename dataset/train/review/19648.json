["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on November 19, 2020", "In a tweet, Sen. Rand Paul misleadingly suggested that immunity from \u201c[n]aturally acquired\u201d COVID-19 was better than that from a vaccine. But it\u2019s not known how immunity from the two sources compares \u2014 and the entire point of a vaccine is to offer immunity without the risk of getting sick.", "Paul made his claim in a Nov. 17 tweet in which he listed interim efficacy figures from two ongoing vaccine clinical trials and then provided his own calculation of the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of natural infection with the coronavirus.", "Great news! \u2013 Pfizer vaccine 90% effective\u2013 Moderna vaccine\u00a094.5% effective \u2013 Naturally acquired COVID-19\u00a0 99.9982% percent effective*", "* (estimating 200 reinfections out of 11 million Americans, which is likely an overestimation of actual reinfections)", "\u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) November 17, 2020", "In a follow-up tweet, the Kentucky Republican shared a link to a New York Times article about a new unpublished study that found evidence of some immunity to the coronavirus in most people for at least six months. He commented: \u201cWhy does the left accept immune theory when it comes to vaccines, but not when discussing naturally acquired immunity?\u201d", "Paul, who has previously\u00a0spread misinformation\u00a0about childhood vaccines, has\u00a0inaccurately argued during the COVID-19 pandemic that parts of the U.S. have reached herd, or community, immunity because of preexisting immunity to other coronaviruses.\u00a0Herd immunity\u00a0is when enough people in a population are immune to prevent spread of the disease.", "Public health experts, however, have said that threshold is still a ways off \u2014 and that allowing the virus to spread uncontrolled would lead to many needless deaths. A better approach, they say, is to stave off the spread of the virus until a vaccine is widely available.", "A Paul spokesperson told us that the senator was not suggesting that immunity through natural infection with COVID-19 is better than getting immunity from a vaccine, but rather, \u201chighlighting research that says immunity is real.\u201d", "We were directed to subsequent tweets, including one in which Paul said he was not \u201carguing against vaccines\u201d but that COVID-19 patients \u201ccan celebrate immunity if lucky enough to survive,\u201d as well as Paul\u2019s support for alternative options to speed along access to COVID-19 vaccines.", "Still, the efficacy figure Paul provides for natural COVID-19 infection isn\u2019t accurate. And the juxtaposition of the numbers implies a kind of superiority of natural infection over vaccination \u2014 a dangerous notion, given that contracting the virus poses a serious risk.", "As University of Florida biostatistician Natalie Dean pointed out in response to Paul\u2019s tweet, \u201cThe key distinction is that vaccines are a SAFE way to achieve immunity. Getting sick with COVID-19 is inherently unsafe. We would never ever tolerate a vaccine that carried even a fraction of the risks of natural infection.\u201d", "While Paul purports to offer a precise percentage for how \u201ceffective\u201d natural infection is relative to vaccines, experts told us that the comparison is premature and faulty.", "The efficacy figures for the vaccines come from interim results released in press releases by the two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, and refer to the ability of the vaccines to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 infection in phase 3 trials. (The day after Paul\u2019s tweet, Pfizer announced additional data reflective of the full trial, which showed 95% efficacy.) But the number for natural infection is a broad-strokes calculation Paul made based on reinfections.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t really know how many reinfections there have been,\u201d virologist Angela Rasmussen said in a phone interview, adding that many reinfections have not been confirmed and that efficacy of naturally-acquired immunity \u201cisn\u2019t a thing.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s just really ridiculous to try to use the way that efficacy is calculated in clinical trials for vaccines and apply that to epi[demiologic] data across the entire population,\u201d she said.", "Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, agreed.", "\u201cClearly, there are people who can be reinfected. As a general rule, it\u2019s usually more mild reinfection,\u201d he told us. But, he added, \u201cmost people aren\u2019t tested, so you don\u2019t really know who\u2019s getting reinfected and who isn\u2019t.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that reinfections so far appear to be rare, which bodes well both for a vaccine and for people who may have immunity as a result of infection. But no one knows yet how the immunity from each will compare.", "Most vaccines do not offer quite as good protection from a pathogen as a natural infection will \u2014 but of course, a person has to survive or suffer through the infection to get that future protection, sidestepping the entire function of a vaccine. It\u2019s therefore largely irrelevant whether or not vaccine immunity is superior to that from natural infection.", "There are some instances in which a vaccine does elicit a better immune response. That\u2019s the case for vaccines against human papillomavirus, or HPV; tetanus; Haemophilus influenzae type b; and pneumococcus.", "Whether COVID-19 will be one of them remains to be seen. Rasmussen said it was possible, but still hypothetical at this point. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know. We only know that these vaccines typically induce levels of neutralizing antibody that are comparable to the higher levels of neutralizing antibody that\u2019s been observed in convalescent patients,\u201d she said, referring to the type of antibody that can prevent cells from becoming infected with the virus.", "Based on the performance of the shingles vaccine, Offit speculated that some of the later-arriving vaccine candidates that include powerful adjuvants, or chemicals that are added to vaccines to boost the immune response, such as those from Sanofi-GSK or Novavax, might be better than natural infection.", "For both the vaccine and natural infection, important questions about COVID-19 immunity remain.", "\u201cWe do know that most people who get COVID-19 do develop some kind of measurable antibody response, but we don\u2019t know what that really means in terms of protection against either reinfection or whether you will mount protective immune responses upon a re-exposure,\u201d said Rasmussen.", "As a result, public health officials have cautioned that for now, even if people have previously contracted COVID-19, individuals should still follow the standard recommendations.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, advises all people, including those who have recovered from COVID-19, to continue to physically distance, wear masks, wash their hands and avoid crowds.", "Similarly, the CDC notes that it doesn\u2019t yet know \u201cif or when\u201d it will stop recommending masks or physical distancing after vaccination.", "This is in contrast to Paul\u2019s assertion that people \u201ccan celebrate immunity.\u201d In a Nov. 12 interview on Fox News, Paul used similar language and advocated that people drop these precautions.", "\u201cWe have 11 million people in our country who\u2019ve already had COVID. We should tell them to celebrate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should tell them to throw away their masks, go to restaurants, live again, because these people are now immune.\u201d", "A huge question is how durable immunity will be. Although the study Paul highlighted suggests that most people will be protected for at least six months \u2014 and might mean they are protected against severe disease for many years \u2014 it\u2019s still not definitive, and doesn\u2019t mean that those timeframes will apply to everyone.", "Shane Crotty, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology and one of the senior authors of the paper, noted on Twitter that the team observed a wide range of immune responses in people, including a lack of a measurable response in some people.", "\u201cThat led us to speculate,\u201d he said, quoting his manuscript, that \u201c\u2018it may be expected that at least a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2-infected population with particularly low immune memory would be susceptible to re-infection relatively quickly.\u2019\u201d", "The CDC, notably, has said that people who have had COVID-19 may still benefit from a coronavirus vaccine. And some experts envision a future in which multiple vaccines are on the table for everyone.", "\u201cIt strikes me as not unlikely that we will learn what the duration of protection is and people will need \u2014 whether naturally infected or vaccinated \u2014 to have booster shots over some period of time, once a year, once every two years, once every five years,\u201d Barry Bloom, an immunologist and global health expert at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a press call.", "In his tweet about the new immunity study, Paul also suggested that Democrats were somehow denying realities about immunity from natural infection.", "\u201cWhy does the left accept immune theory when it comes to vaccines, but not when discussing naturally acquired immunity?\u201d he asked.", "Scientists, however, objected to Paul\u2019s characterization.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s dismissing [immunity following natural infection]. I think what people are saying is, it\u2019s a bad idea as a strategy for dealing with infection,\u201d said Offit, who noted that 30% to 40% of the population could be considered at high risk for COVID-19.", "Both Offit and Rasmussen also pointed out that historically, there isn\u2019t a lot of precedent for building herd immunity through natural infection.", "\u201cPeople were getting smallpox for millennia,\u201d Rasmussen said, and \u201cthe herd immunity threshold was never really reached.\u201d", "The much safer way of getting to herd immunity is to use a vaccine instead, especially when multiple candidates are on the horizon.", "\u201cTrying to achieve herd immunity [without a vaccine] would result in hundreds of thousands more \u2014 if not millions \u2014 of unnecessary deaths and debilitating illness for millions more,\u201d Rasmussen said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s not really right to talk about vaccine-induced herd immunity versus naturally-acquired herd immunity without mentioning the fact that one of them has a very, very large price tag in human lives and quality of life attached to it.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
