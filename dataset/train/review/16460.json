["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on October 24, 2018", "In his midterm campaign rallies, President Donald Trump has repeatedly made the preposterous claim that he came up with \u201cthe greatest idea\u201d for \u201cveterans choice\u201d \u2014 a program that was launched in 2014 during the Obama administration. He also claimed it took \u201c44 years\u201d to get the legislation passed.", "In fact, nothing he said about the program\u2019s origin is true.", "Trump,\u00a0Nevada, Oct. 20: And we just passed \u2014 after 44 years, we just got it passed, I signed it two months ago, veteran\u2019s choice, so that if they have to wait on line for 12 days or 14 days or 32 days, or much longer than that \u2014 can you believe it? \u2026", "They go immediately to see a doctor privately. We pay for their bill. \u2026", "But I thought it was so brilliant, I came back to my group, I said, I got the greatest idea, because I haven\u2019t been doing this that long, so, you know, it wasn\u2019t like high on my list, but it became high. I did know the veterans were never treated fairly. But I said, I have the greatest idea. We\u2019re going to do this. If a veteran has to wait, we\u2019re going to send them to a private doctor. We\u2019ll pay the bill. What a genius \u2014 I said, I said, how good is that? They said, \u201cSir, we\u2019ve been trying to get it passed for 44 years.\u201d So I was good at getting things passed. That\u2019s what I did.", "Ten days earlier, at a rally in Pennsylvania, the president told the crowd: \u201cWhen I first heard about it, I mean, it\u2019s not like I was studying it for my whole life. But I heard about it three-and-a-half years ago. I said, I have an idea. Let\u2019s \u2014 when they wait on line for 10 days, 22 days, 38 days, you have to see, months and months, why don\u2019t we let them go see a private doctor and we pay the bill? It will solve our problem. And I told everybody: I am the most brilliant guy in the world.\u00a0Who else would think \u2014 who else would think of that?\u201d", "And at his rally in Kentucky on Oct. 13, Trump said this was \u201cthe greatest idea I think I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d", "In fact, that was the idea for the Veterans Choice Program, which\u00a0was created by the bipartisan Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, signed by President Barack Obama on Aug. 7, 2014. The legislation, which garnered a 91-3 vote in the Senate and a 420-5 vote in the House, followed a scandal over\u00a0wait times at Veterans Affairs facilities.", "The VA summary of the 2014 bill said it would \u201callow those Veterans who are unable to schedule an appointment within 30 days of their preferred date or the clinically appropriate date, or on the basis of their place of residence to elect to receive care from eligible non-VA health care entities or providers. This is separate from VA\u2019s existing program providing Veterans care outside of the VA system.\u201d", "If a veteran lives more than 40 driving miles from the closest VA medical facility or faces other travel burdens, or the VA can\u2019t provide the services required, that veteran can receive care from another provider, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, which says on its website that Veterans Choice is \u201cone of several programs through which a Veteran can receive care from a community provider.\u201d", "Since Trump took office, he has continued the program, signing legislation to provide\u00a0funding for the program and to\u00a0eliminate\u00a0the expiration date. In June of this year, Trump signed the bipartisan VA MISSION Act,\u00a0which provided funding to keep the Veterans Choice program for one more year, and then called for consolidating it and other private-care options into a new\u00a0Veterans Community Care Program.", "The MISSION Act \u2014 a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of which came from earlier bipartisan legislation from Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson and Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, according to the senators \u2014 says that under the consolidated program a veteran can go to a private medical provider if \u201cthe covered veteran and the covered veteran\u2019s referring clinician agree that furnishing care and services through a non-Department entity or provider would be in the best medical interest of the covered veteran,\u201d based on criteria to be set by the VA secretary. Those criteria will include distance from a medical facility, type of services needed, and the timeliness of appointments.", "A\u00a0June\u00a0Government Accountability Office report\u00a0said that it wasn\u2019t clear whether the Choice Program had \u201cimproved the timeliness of veterans\u2019 care because VA\u2019s data are incomplete and unreliable,\u201d and Tester\u00a0has said\u00a0the new law \u201cstreamlines community care.\u201d", "So, Trump has continued the Veterans Choice Program and the new law could expand eligibility for such services. But how can Trump say a law that was passed years before he took office was both his idea and 44 years in the making? We asked the White House press office but haven\u2019t received a response.", "In some of his rallies \u2014 such as Oct. 12 in Ohio \u2014 Trump merely claims\u00a0that \u201cI got done what they\u2019d been trying to do for 44 years.\u201d But on several occasions he has expanded that falsehood into a story about\u00a0\u201cthe greatest idea I think I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
