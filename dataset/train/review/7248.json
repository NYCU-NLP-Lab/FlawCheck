A movement is afoot there and elsewhere to allow non-citizens to vote and to serve on local boards. A handful of cities and towns nationwide already allow immigrants who have legal residency status to vote in local matters.", "In stating his case, Hayduk made this provocative statement: \"But what most don\u2019t know is that the right to vote in this country has never been intrinsically tied to citizenship.\"", "When we asked him for his evidence, he referred us to \"Legal Aliens, Local Citizens: The Historical Constitutional, and Theoretical Meanings of Alien Suffrage,\" a law review article by Jamin Raskin, professor of law at Washington College of Law at American University.

It is also true that not every citizen could vote during that period, namely women, children and free black men.", "(Hayduk\u2019s research pushed the number of states and territories that extended voting privileges to non-citizens to 40. Rhode Island had no citizenship requirement to vote from 1762 to 1842.)", "According to Raskin, non-citizen voting played an important part in the building of America until it was undone by \"xenophobic nationalism\" following World War I. After the war, many states enacted laws to restrict voting rights. Since 1926, no state has allowed non-citizens to vote in state or federal elections.", "Rogers M. Smith, associate dean of social sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that during much of the mid-to late-19th century, Western states, in particular, allowed resident aliens who indicated they had applied for citizenship to vote, a policy aimed at encouraging European immigrants to move west.", "Like Raskin, Smith also noted that being a citizen didn\u2019t guarantee the right to vote. He cited a Supreme Court ruling from 1875 that concluded that though women were citizens, they still couldn\u2019t vote.
