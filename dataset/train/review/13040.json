["Oprah Winfrey gave a speech at the Golden Globes Jan. 7 that focused on race, gender, injustice and the importance of speaking the truth, all of which fueled talk about Winfrey running for president in 2020.", "The speculation has led to numerous claims about her past statements recirculating on Facebook including her alleged comments about white people in 2014:", "\"Oprah tells Fox News host \u2018all white people have to die,\u2019 \" stated an Oct. 12, 2014,\u00a0headline on American News.", "Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.

There is a whole generation -- I said this for apartheid South Africa, I said this for my own community in the south -- there are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in that prejudice and racism and they just have to die.\"", "Winfrey\u2019s overall point during the interview is that race relations have improved from decades ago, but there are older people in the United States and other countries who grew up surrounded by racism. The inference of her comments is that when older racists die out, that particular type of racism will die out.", "Note that Winfrey didn\u2019t say \"all white people have to die\" \u2014 she didn\u2019t say \"white people\" at all.", "While some on the left\u00a0have shown some support for Winfrey\u2019s 2013 statement, her comments drew criticism from conservatives.", "About a week after her BBC interview, her comments were criticized on Fox News'\u00a0The Kelly File by\u00a0former U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., a Fox News commentator.", "West criticized Winfrey and Obama for trying \"to use the race card to talk about the failures and the faults not in his racial content but in the content of his character and the failure of his policies.\"", "We emailed American News and did not get a reply.", "Our ruling", "A headline on American News said that \"Oprah tells Fox News host \u2018all white people have to die.\u2019\" We found multiple versions of this story circulating with similar headlines.", "The headline gets key details wrong and twists Winfrey\u2019s words. She did not say that all white people have to die. What Winfrey actually told a BBC interviewer in 2013 was that some older people grew up surrounded by racism. When she said \"they just have to die,\" she seemed to be suggesting\u00a0that a certain type of racism will have to die out when this generation dies.", "We rate this claim False.", "'", "BBC, \"the Butler, racism and Obama,\" Nov. 13, 2013", "Fox News The Kelly File, Interview with former U.S. Rep.
