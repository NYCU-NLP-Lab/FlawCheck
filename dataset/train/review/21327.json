He didn\u2019t say, \"When you\u2019re 60, you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place.\" He didn\u2019t say, \"There are no minority rights\" when Muslims are in the majority. He didn\u2019t say, \"The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists,\" as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted last year. And he didn\u2019t say, \"A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on,\" as Colin Kaepernick tweeted in 2017.", "He also didn\u2019t make this statement that appeared on Facebook on March 31.
