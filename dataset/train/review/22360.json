["Six candidates -- including debate newcomer Mike Bloomberg -- squared off three days before the Nevada caucuses.", "By Brooks Jackson, Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley, Lori Robertson, D'Angelo Gore, Jessica McDonald and Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 20, 2020", "Many of the factual disputes centered on disagreements among the candidates:", "NBC News, MSNBC and the Nevada Independent hosted the debate, which was held in Las Vegas on Feb. 19.", "Bloomberg and Biden sparred over the controversial stop-and-frisk policy administered during Bloomberg\u2019s term as mayor of New York City from 2002 through 2013.", "Bloomberg has apologized for the policy, but he continues to frame the policy\u2019s turnaround in a misleading way.", "Bloomberg: Well, if I go back and look at my time in office, the one thing that I\u2019m really worried about, embarrassed about, was how it turned out with stop-and-frisk. When I got into office, there were 650 murders a year in New York City. And I thought that my first responsibility was to give people the right to live. That\u2019s the basic right of everything. And we started it. We adopted a policy which had been in place. The policy that all big police departments use of stop-and-frisk. What happened, however, was it got out of control. And when we discovered, I discovered, that we were doing many, many, too many stop-and-frisks, we cut 95% of it out.", "As\u00a0we wrote\u00a0recently in a deeper dive into Bloomberg\u2019s history with stop-and-frisk, Bloomberg gets to his figure of a 95% cut by comparing the quarterly high point of 203,500 stops in the\u00a0first quarter of 2012\u00a0with the 12,485 stops in the\u00a0last quarter of 2013\u00a0\u2014 a decline that would not have been possible without the numbers ballooning earlier in Bloomberg\u2019s tenure.", "As Bloomberg says, stop-and frisk was put in place by his predecessor, Rudy Giuliani, but the practice multiplied exponentially under Bloomberg. In Bloomberg\u2019s first 10 years in office, the number of stop-and-frisk actions increased nearly 600%, reaching a peak of nearly 686,000 stops in 2011. There were about 192,000 documented stops in 2013, nearly twice as many as there were the year before Bloomberg took office.", "Biden wrongly claimed that it was pressure from the Obama administration that prompted the decline in stops. \u201cLet\u2019s get the order straight,\u201d Biden said.", "Biden: The reason that stop and frisk changed is because Barack Obama sent moderators to see what was going on. When we sent them there to say this practice has to stop, the mayor thought it was a terrible idea we send them there \u2014 a terrible idea. Let\u2019s get the facts straight, let\u2019s get the order straight.", "As Biden suggests, let\u2019s look at the order. In June 2013, the Obama administration\u00a0announced\u00a0that if a federal judge in a class-action case challenging the policy ruled that New York\u2019s application of the stop-and-frisk policy was unconstitutional, then an independent monitor should be appointed to oversee the program. By then, however, the number of stops was already plummeting, from 203,500 in the\u00a0first quarter of 2012\u00a0to 58,088 in the\u00a0second quarter of 2013. That\u2019s a 71% decline in the year-and-a-half before the Obama administration made its first\u00a0official intervention\u00a0in the case.", "Bloomberg said he \u201cdiscovered\u201d that the policy \u201cgot out of control\u201d after conversations with \u201cAfrican-American clergy and businesspeople,\u201d and so he set about to cut the number of stops. The police department in May 2012 announced new training and supervision designed to address concerns about racial profiling in the application of stop-and-frisk. But there were other forces driving the decline: a day before the policy was announced, a federal judge granted class-action status to a lawsuit brought by people who had been stopped. And there was mounting public opposition to the stop-and-frisk program.", "On Aug. 12, 2013, U.S. District Court Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled that the city police department violated the U.S. Constitution in the way that it carried out its stop-and-frisk program, calling it \u201ca form of racial profiling\u201d of young black and Hispanic men. In her opinion, Scheindlin wrote that she was \u201cnot ordering an end to the practice of stop and frisk\u201d and that the practice could continue if the city complied with court-ordered remedies \u2014 including an independent monitor to oversee the program to make sure that it did not violate the Constitution.", "Bloomberg did oppose an independent monitor of the police department, and he fought the lawsuit. He also tried to rebuff efforts by New York\u2019s City Council to create an independent inspector general to monitor the police department. Bloomberg vetoed the bill, but the council overrode the veto.", "Bloomberg continued to defend the stop-and-frisk practice throughout his term as mayor \u2014 and after \u2014 maintaining that the policy led to a decrease in crime. During the debate, Bloomberg made similar justifications, saying that there were 650 murders a year in New York City before he took office, and that the number declined to 300 under his watch. It\u2019s true there were 649 murders in 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office. And the number dropped to 335 in 2013, Bloomberg\u2019s last year as mayor. What Bloomberg did not mention in the debate is that the number of murders continued to decline in his last two years in office even as the number of stop-and-frisk actions dramatically declined. And the number of murders continued to generally decline as Bloomberg\u2019s successor, Bill de Blasio, phased out stop-and-frisk.", "Days before announcing his candidacy for president in November, Bloomberg said that he \u201cshould have acted sooner, and acted faster to cut the stops,\u201d and he apologized for not doing that. He acknowledged that \u201ccrime continued to come down as we reduced stops.\u201d", "Warren falsely accused Bloomberg of \u201cblaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crash of 2008.\u201d He didn\u2019t. He did blame politicians and Wall Street, among others.", "Warren was referring to\u00a0remarks Bloomberg made\u00a0at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 17, 2008 \u2014 at the height of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.", "He was asked about the \u201croot causes\u201d and gave a rambling, six-minute answer that never once mentioned blacks, Latinos or any race or ethnic group. Contrary to the impression left by some recent\u00a0news\u00a0accounts, Bloomberg spread the blame widely among politicians, bankers, the Federal Reserve, home builders and Wall Street firms that he said failed to grasp the risks they were taking in pursuit of profits.", "\u201cIt probably all started back when there was a lot of pressure on banks to make loans to everyone,\u201d he began.", "He said Congress and local government officials pushed to end the practice of \u201credlining,\u201d which Bloomberg described as banks avoiding making loans in \u201cwhole neighborhoods [where] people in these neighborhoods are poor, they are not going to be able to pay off their mortgages.\u201d", "\u201cAnd once you started pushing in that direction, banks started making more and more loans where the credit of the person buying the house wasn\u2019t as good as you would like,\u201d Bloomberg said.", "To be sure, denying credit to \u201cpoor\u201d neighborhoods was often the same thing as denying credit to blacks or other minority groups. But all Bloomberg said in 2008 was that the dominoes started falling when Congress pressed banks to lend to \u201ceveryone.\u201d", "He didn\u2019t stop there. Bloomberg also said \u201cthere was very cheap money\u201d due to Federal Reserve policies. He said that, combined with loosened lending practices, led to overbuilding by developers.", "\u201cThe second problem was that Wall Street \u2026 had looked for a long time for new ways to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cWall Street got into the position where they created so many sophisticated products, my theory is that most people couldn\u2019t understand them \u2014 people who worked in these firms. I don\u2019t know that the management of these companies understood the risks and the volatility.\u201d", "Later in the debate, NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd said Bloomberg\u2019s 2008 remarks \u201cseemed to imply \u2026 that stopping\u00a0redlining has somehow contributed to the financial crisis.\u201d Bloomberg said \u201cthat\u2019s exactly wrong.\u201d", "Bloomberg: I was against it. [The financial crisis] came about because the people who took the mortgages, packaged them and others bought them. That\u2019s where the disaster was. Redlining is still a practice some places and we have to cut it out.", "We can\u2019t say at this point whether Bloomberg ever publicly opposed redlining in 2008 or before. But his 2008 remarks didn\u2019t endorse the practice. He said the crisis grew out of political pressure to make loans to \u201ceveryone,\u201d including those who were poor credit risks.", "While discussing Medicare for All, his plan for a government-run health insurance system, Sanders said high profits reaped by the health care and pharmaceutical industries are driving up U.S. health care costs. The Vermont senator also suggested that campaign contributions have prevented the U.S. from switching to a public system.", "He then added, \u201cAnd those CEOs are contributing to Pete\u2019s campaign and other campaigns up here,\u201d referring to Buttigieg.", "That\u2019s true, but Sanders also has received such contributions.", "We asked the Sanders campaign recently about a similar claim, and it referred us to an Oct. 18\u00a0story\u00a0by Sludge, a website that writes about money in politics. The site reviewed Buttigieg\u2019s third-quarter campaign finance report for contributions from health care executives, and listed 103 such donors \u2014 including five CEOs and four presidents of health care and pharmaceutical companies.", "Combined, the nine top executives gave $14,300 in the third quarter. In all, they\u00a0have given Buttigieg\u2019s campaign $18,050 during the course of the campaign, according to\u00a0Federal Election Commission data.", "The list included one donation from a top pharmaceutical executive,\u00a0Mohammad Azab, president and chief medical officer of Astex Pharmaceuticals. Azab has donated a total of $3,800,\u00a0FEC records show.", "The two largest donations that the Buttigieg campaign received from health care CEOs came from\u00a0Robert Grossman, CEO and dean of NYU Langone Health, an academic medical center based in New York City, and\u00a0Richard Stillwell, CEO of Sound Health Care Association, a Nashville-based company that provides health insurance plans to musicians and other entertainers. Each has donated $2,800, as the Sludge list shows.", "But Sanders has received money from health care CEOs, too. The senator\u2019s campaign received $3,184.60 from seven health care CEOs, according to FEC records. The largest donation came from Muhammad Tahir Javed,\u00a0CEO of Riceland Healthcare\u00a0in Texas, who so far has donated\u00a0$1,250\u00a0to the Sanders campaign.", "When contributions from all health care industry employees are included, not just CEOs, the top two recipients among presidential candidates are Sanders ($3 million) and Buttigieg ($2.8 million),\u00a0according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.", "Even then, the amounts are relatively small compared with the totals that both candidates have raised. As of Dec. 31, the Sanders campaign had raised\u00a0$109 million\u00a0and Buttigieg\u2019s campaign about\u00a0$77 million, according to FEC data.", "Biden said that when Bloomberg was still mayor of New York, he called the Affordable Care Act, which then-President Obama signed into law in March 2010, a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d", "When Bloomberg responded that he had supported Obamacare, Biden again said, \u201cThe mayor said, when we passed it, the signature piece of this administration, \u2018It\u2019s a disgrace.\u2019 They\u2019re the exact words. \u2018It was a disgrace.\u2019 Look it up, check it out. \u2018It was a disgrace.\u2019\u201d", "Biden is right. Bloomberg did call it a \u201cdisgrace\u201d\u00a0at an event\u00a0at Dartmouth College in July 2010, a few months after Obama signed the legislation.", "\u201cWe passed a health care bill that does absolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems in this country. It is just a disgrace,\u201d Bloomberg said at the time. He said Obama \u201cstarted out by pointing out what the big problems were\u201d but \u201cthen turned it over to Congress, which didn\u2019t pay any attention to any of those big problems, and just created another program that\u2019s going to cost a lot of money.\u201d", "\u201cAnd it\u2019s really sad because they say they\u2019ve insured or provided coverage for another 45 million people, except there\u2019s no doctors for 45 million more people,\u201d he continued. \u201cUnless they fix immigration and let people who come here for medical education stay here, those people are just going to do the same thing.\u201d", "In the debate, Bloomberg countered that, prior to those comments, he had expressed support for Obamacare, which is true to an extent. Bloomberg did say that he supported Obama\u2019s goal of universal health care, but he urged members of Congress to include a public health care option, which the legislation that became law did not do.", "\u201cIn \u201909, I testified and gave a speech before the mayors conference in Washington advocating it and trying to get all the mayors to sign on. And I think at that time I wrote an article praising Obamacare, it was either in the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0or the\u00a0Daily News,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cI was in favor of it. I thought it didn\u2019t go as far as we should.\u201d", "In April 2009, Bloomberg\u2019s office issued a\u00a0press release\u00a0about comments he made about health care at the U.S. Conference of Mayors\u2019 meeting the day prior. \u201cPresident Obama has identified critical nonpartisan principles that should guide any health care reform package and I support his push to enact comprehensive health care reform this year,\u201d the press release quoted Bloomberg saying.", "Then, in July 2009, Bloomberg wrote an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0published by the\u00a0New York Daily News\u00a0that said, \u201cThe principles that President Obama has outlined for national health care reform are driven by a goal that I share: universal access to affordable health care.\u201d He also pushed for Congress to include a \u201cpublic health insurance option,\u201d which he noted was an idea that Obama was supporting at the time.", "\u201cIf you like the coverage you have, you keep it. But if you don\u2019t have coverage \u2014 or if you lose your coverage \u2014 you\u2019d have another option. And virtually everyone agrees that a well-managed public option has real potential to provide \u2013 for less money \u2013 the same benefits that private insurers provide,\u201d he wrote.", "And on Nov. 6, 2009, Bloomberg issued\u00a0another statement\u00a0saying that for months he had been asking members of Congress to support a House version of the bill that eventually passed. But, again, he said he was \u201chopeful the final legislation\u201d from the House and Senate \u201cwill include, a meaningful public health insurance option for New Yorkers.\u201d That did not happen.", "CNN\u00a0also points out\u00a0that in a 2013 radio interview cited by Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, the former mayor said of the health care law: \u201cSome parts of Obamacare I don\u2019t think will work, I don\u2019t think is fair, I don\u2019t think is intelligent, whatever. But I don\u2019t have a better answer other than let\u2019s try this.\u201d", "Buttigieg and Klobuchar argued over the senator\u2019s voting record on English as the national language and President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominations.", "Buttigieg:\u00a0You voted to make English the national language. Do you know the message that sends in as multilingual a state as Nevada to immigrants? You have been unusual among Democrats, I think the Democrat among all of the senators running for president most likely to vote for Donald Trump\u2019s judges. \u2026", "Klobuchar:\u00a0In fact, I have opposed, and not supported, two-thirds of the Trump judges, so get your numbers right. And I am in the top 10 to 15 of opposing them.", "In 2007, Klobuchar did\u00a0vote\u00a0for an amendment \u201cto declare English as the national language of the Government of the United States.\u201d She was one of 17 Democrats to vote in favor of the amendment to an immigration bill. The amendment passed, but the overall bill\u00a0didn\u2019t. More recently, Klobuchar has said she wouldn\u2019t support such a policy.", "In June at a presidential forum in Miami, she\u00a0said: \u201cAnd I would not support an amendment any longer, to make English the official language because I understand now what that would mean to people in the community.\u201d And in Las Vegas this month, she again said she was against such legislation,\u00a0according to the Associated Press.", "As for her vote on Trump\u2019s judicial nominations, her campaign points to a calculation showing she has voted for 33.51% of Trump\u2019s nominees for district and circuit courts, which would put her among the top seven Democratic senators in opposition. An earlier tally,\u00a0published in April 2019, by Think Progress called Klobuchar an \u201coutlier\u201d among the presidential field for supporting \u201cmore than 56% of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees who were eventually confirmed \u2014 a higher rate than 32 of the other 46 senators who are members of or caucus with the Democratic Party.\u201d", "The campaign says it used the same methodology as Think Progress to compile the updated tally, which shows Klobuchar\u2019s voting percentage for Trump\u2019s judges declining considerably over the last year. Sanders voted for Trump\u2019s judges 25.53% of the time, and Warren did so 25.00% of the time, according to the campaign\u2019s calculations.", "In saying that he would not increase taxes on small businesses, Buttigieg said \u201cwhat we\u2019ve got to do is level the playing field, where a company like Amazon or Chevron, is paying literally zero on billions of dollars in profits.\u201d", "There were indeed\u00a0reports\u00a0last year, prompted by the\u00a0findings\u00a0of the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, indicating that the two companies and others paid no federal income taxes in 2018. The ITEP more recently\u00a0noted, based on a\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission filing\u00a0for 2019, that Amazon \u201cpaid $162 million of federal income taxes, a bit more than 1 percent of the company\u2019s domestic profits.\u201d", "Even so, the picture isn\u2019t completely clear, since the companies\u2019 tax returns are private under federal law, and such reports instead rely on information from other financial statements.", "The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0noted as much last year and, looking at several years\u2019 worth of Amazon financial statements,\u00a0reported:\u00a0\u201cFrom 2012 through 2018, Amazon reported $25.4 billion in pretax U.S. income and current federal tax provisions totaling $1.9 billion. That is an 8% tax rate\u2014low, but not zero or negative.\u201d", "During a section of the debate focused on climate change, NBC\u2019s Lester Holt asked Bloomberg how he would get China \u2014 the world\u2019s top carbon emitter \u2014 to reduce its emissions, given that Bloomberg\u2019s business is \u201cheavily invested\u201d in the country.", "After saying that he would negotiate with China, and convince the country that action on climate was also in its interest, Bloomberg deflected concern to India.", "\u201cIn all fairness, the Chinese have slowed down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s India that is an even bigger problem. But it is an enormous problem. Nobody\u2019s doing anything about it.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that China\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions have been increasing less rapidly than India\u2019s. But China\u2019s emissions are still rising \u2014 and the nation\u2019s total emissions are much higher than India\u2019s.", "According to a March 2019\u00a0report\u00a0from the International Energy Agency, in 2018, China\u2019s CO2 emissions rose by 2.5%, compared with a 4.8% increase in India.", "China\u2019s total annual emissions, however, are more than four times larger than India\u2019s \u2014 around 9.5 gigatons \u2014 so China\u2019s smaller percentage increase actually accounts for twice as much carbon pollution. And as the report notes, despite the growth, \u201cper capita emissions in India remain low at only 40% of the global average.\u201d", "While both countries are concerning for climate change, China is by far the larger source of emissions.", "The Bloomberg campaign noted in an email to us that China is \u201ctaking steps\u201d to reduce coal use, while India\u2019s coal-fired capacity and population are expected to rise. \u201cTherefore, it seems pretty fair to say \u2013 in terms of forcing \u2018a country to reduce emissions and tackle the climate crisis\u2019 \u2013 that the country that is not already doing it would pose the bigger problem,\u201d the spokesperson said.", "Homeless:\u00a0Sanders again exaggerated when he said the U.S. has \u201chalf a million people sleeping out on the streets.\u201d As\u00a0we\u2019ve written before, the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s most recent annual assessment of the homeless population,\u00a0released Jan. 13, estimated that 211,293 people were homeless and without shelter on the night the census was taken in 2019. Sanders was referring to the total population of homeless people, which HUD estimated at 567,715. But HUD told Congress that about \u201ctwo-thirds (63%) of people experiencing homelessness were staying in sheltered locations.\u201d", "Health Care:\u00a0Sanders also repeated his\u00a0regular claim\u00a0that \u201cdespite spending twice as much per capita, Chuck, twice as much, as any other major country on Earth, we\u2019ve got 87 million who are uninsured or underinsured.\u201d", "The U.S. spends twice as much as every country, except for six,\u00a0according to\u00a0the most recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data, which is for 2018.

According to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005, which generally shields gun makers from civil lawsuits resulting from the misuse of firearms or ammunition, included six exceptions, including cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law. In fact, a Connecticut judge\u00a0said\u00a0last year that a lawsuit the families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting filed against Remington Arms Co. for the way it marketed the assault-style rifle the killer used will go to trial in 2021.", "Dartmouth YouTube Channel. \u201cDartmouth Presidential Lectures: Michael Bloomberg, Mayor of New York City.\u201d Video. 17 Jul 2010.", "\u201cMayor Bloomberg Highlights Need For Comprehensive National Health Care Reform That Can Build Upon New York City\u2019s Successes.\u201d Press release.
