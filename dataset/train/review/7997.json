While it did not include #COVID_19, it may provide a better idea of how long this pathogen can survive outside of the body. \u2060 \u2060 The authors concluded that if this new coronavirus resembles other human coronaviruses, such as its \"cousins\" that cause #SARS and #MERS, it can stay on surfaces \u2014 such as metal, glass or plastic \u2014 for as long as nine days. \u2060 \u2060 This is in comparison to flu viruses which can last on surfaces for only about 48 hours.\u2060 \u2060 But there are some important caveats to consider. Some #coronavirus don't remain active for as long at temperatures higher than 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius). \u2060 \u2060 The authors also found that coronaviruses can be effectively wiped away by common household disinfectants. \u2060 \u2060 For now that is the best information we have.\u2060 \u2060 To follow the continually updated coronavirus dashboard, tap the link in our bio and bookmark the page.\u2060 \u2060 \u2060 \u2060 \u2060", "A post shared by  Medscape (@medscape) on Mar 17, 2020 at 2:29am PDT", "An article published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in March reviewed what other scientists have found about how long human coronaviruses can survive on different surfaces.
