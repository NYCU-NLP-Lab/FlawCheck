["A claim by a Twitter handle @MuralikrishnaE1 has garnered massive traction on social media. His tweet has hypothesized that Rajamma Vavathil, the nurse who was present during Congress President Rahul Gandhi\u2019s birth, was only 13 years old at the time. According to his claim, the present age of Rajamma\u2019s is 62 while Rahul is 49. The user took a jibe at Gandhi by tweeting, \u201cYaha bhi Saala Scam (There is a scam here as well -translated)\u201d. The handle quote-tweeted a tweet by ANI which reported Rahul Gandhi\u2019s meeting with Rajamma Vavathil during a 3-day visit to his new constituency Wayanad.", "Muralikrishna is followed on Twitter by the office of Piyush Goyal.

As per a report published by India Today, Rajamma is a \u201c72-year-old\u201d retired nurse. The Hindu, The Quint, Republic TV and The Asian Age similarly reported her age as 72.", "Furthermore, a detailed report published by The Outlook stated that Rajamma Vavathil, who was then a nurse serving at the Holy Family Hospital, was 23 years old at the time of Rahul Gandhi\u2019s birth in 1970.", "Alt News contacted Rajamma Vavathil to confirm her age during the time when Rahul Gandhi was born. She said, \u201cI was 23 when Rahul Gandhi was born. I am a 72-year-old lady now. It has been 48 years since he was born. The relationship between me and Rahul Gandhi is that he was born in front of me and I call him beta [son]. My date of birth is June 1, 1947. He was born on June 19, 1970. You calculate. I don\u2019t want to be insulted like this. I am not into politics.\u201d Thus, the claim that Rajamma was only 13 years old when Rahul Gandhi was born is factually incorrect.", "Donate Now", "Jignesh is a writer and researcher at Alt News.
