By doing so, the Executive\u00a0Director acted beyond his authority and contrary to longstanding Commission policy and\u00a0precedent that documentary proof of citizenship was not \u201cnecessary for States to assess the\u00a0eligibility\u201d of a voter registration application submitted on the Federal Form. As a result of the\u00a0Executive Director\u2019s actions, and for the first time since Congress created the Federal Form,\u00a0documentary proof of citizenship is now required to register to vote in federal elections in\u00a0Alabama, Georgia, and Kansas.

Ct. 2247, which held that States must \u201caccept and use\u201d the Federal Form as implemented by the EAC. Arizona, Kansas and Georgia thereafter submitted new requests to require documentary proof of citizenship, which the EAC\u2019s prior Executive Director rejected in 2014, based on existing EAC policy, in a formal decision finding that documentary proof of citizenship requirements were inconsistent with the purposes of the NVRA, and were not shown to be necessary by any evidence provided by the States. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the prior Executive Director\u2019s decision and rejected Kansas and Arizona\u2019s subsequent APA challenge (Georgia did not challenge the EAC\u2019s decision).

It also forces Plaintiffs in all affected jurisdictions to expend substantial resources to educate the public about the new requirements, when Plaintiffs have already, in the current election cycle, spent significant time and money to educate voters about existing voter registration rules that now could be changed mere weeks or months before the election. Further, it requires Plaintiffs to divert resources previously used to help voters register to instead assist eligible applicants in securing proper proof-of-citizenship documents in order to exercise their right to vote.", "Attorney General Loretta Lynch's name appeared on page 215 of the suit, on an included summons. \u00a0Lynch did not appear to be a plaintiff in that document:", "Politico\u00a0reported that the DOJ backed \"the issuance of a court injunction blocking a federal official's decision to approve new voter registration forms that allow three states to insist that voters provide copies of documents proving their U.S. citizenship\":", "The Justice Department is representing the commission and Newby in the case and turned heads by agreeing to a preliminary injunction nullifying Newby's action.", "In his order Tuesday, Leon called that step \"extraordinary.\" The judge is an appointee of President George W.

On January 29, 2016, the Executive Director of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) approved the requests of three states\u2014Alabama, Georgia, and Kansas\u2014to modify their state-specific instructions on the National Mail Voter Registration Form (\u201cFederal Form\u201d). However, in deciding to include the states\u2019 documentary proof of citizenship requirements on the Federal Form, the Executive Director did not make the determination that this information was \u201cnecessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration and other parts of the election process.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20508. Because the National Voter Registration Act permits only information satisfying this \u201cnecessity\u201d requirement to be included on the Federal Form, the Executive Director\u2019s decisions are not consistent with the statute.

Under the NVRA of 1993, all individuals registering to vote must swear under penalty of perjury that they are United States citizens.
