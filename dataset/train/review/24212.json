["By Lori Robertson and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on March 5, 2019", "In a two-hour address to the\u00a0Conservative Political Action Conference on March 2, President Donald Trump made questionable and false claims about the fight against ISIS, tariffs and African American income. He also repeated a bevy of claims we\u2019ve debunked before.", "We focused on new claims by the president in this article, but his speech also contained many claims we\u2019ve written about before, including falsehoods on the trade deficit, legislation concerning veterans, military spending, immigration policy and employment.", "In his appearance at the annual CPAC event, Trump told a long story about a general whom he \u201chad to fire\u201d telling him it would take two years to retake 100 percent of the territory once held by ISIS. Trump said \u201cthen I flew to Iraq\u201d where other generals told him, \u201cwe can have it totally finished in one week.\u201d But a few weeks before Trump\u2019s December visit to Iraq,\u00a0Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS Brett McGurk said it would take \u201ca period of months\u201d\u00a0to retake the remaining 1 percent of ISIS-held territory.", "Reuters reported on Feb. 28 that the\u00a0Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by the United States, had indicated it would announce victory over ISIS in one week. That would make McGurk\u2019s estimate correct.", "We asked the White House press office about the president\u2019s comments, but we haven\u2019t received a response. We don\u2019t know what unnamed generals told the president. However, the story as Trump tells it contradicts public statements by McGurk.", "Here\u2019s part of the president\u2019s comments on the topic at CPAC:", "Trump, March 2: But I was told by a general, who I had to fire \u2014 I said, \u201cGeneral, how long before we get 100 percent of the caliphate?\u201d He said, \u201cSir, two years.\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t take it two years.\u201d\u00a0And then I flew to Iraq. \u2026", "So I have Raisin Caine and three other generals, colonels, sergeants. \u2026 And I said to the generals, \u201cListen, we got to get out. I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent, which is what we had left.\u201d \u201cIt won\u2019t, sir.\u201d And I said, \u201cTell me why it won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cIt won\u2019t, sir. If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster.\u201d \u201cOkay, General Raisin Caine, how fast can\u201d \u2014 \u201cSir, we can have it totally finished in one week.\u201d I said, \u201cOne week? I was told two years.\u201d (Laughter.) One week? \u201cThat\u2019s right, sir. We\u2019re only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria. But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over \u2014 from the base that you\u2019re right on, right now, sir. They won\u2019t know what the hell hit them.\u201d \u2026", "And I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t my other generals tell me that? Why didn\u2019t they tell me that?\u201d I said, \u201cDid you tell them that?\u201d \u201cNot our place to say it, sir. They come in from Washington, sir. We have to take orders. You\u2019re the first one to ask us our opinion.\u201d (Applause.) It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. True. True.", "Trump said a general told him it would take \u201ctwo years\u201d to take \u201c100 percent of the caliphate\u201d and he got a very different story from generals in Iraq. But McGurk had said on Dec. 11 \u2014 two weeks before the president\u2019s visit to Iraq \u2014 in a State Department briefing, \u201cBallpark, you\u2019re talking a period of months,\u201d to retake the remaining 1 percent of ISIS territory.", "McGurk said that in early 2016 about 50 percent of the territory ISIS had once held had been reclaimed. \u201cSo if you look at where we are today, I think it\u2019s quite significant. We really are now down to the last 1 percent of the physical territory,\u201d he said. \u201cThe final splotch of red down in what we call the Middle Euphrates Valley, those operations are ongoing, with the Syrian Democratic Forces, supported, of course, by small numbers of coalition forces on the ground.\u201d", "He said that while \u201cthe end of the physical caliphate is clearly now coming into sight, the end of ISIS will be a much more long-term initiative. \u2026 Defeating a physical caliphate is one phase of a much longer-term campaign.\u201d McGurk said a \u201cstabilization effort in Iraq and Syria\u201d would \u201creally take a period of years.\u201d", "CNBC reported that McGurk made similar comments on Dec. 15 in an interview.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re on track now over the coming months to defeat what used to be the physical space that ISIS controlled,\u201d CNBC quoted McGurk telling reporter and anchor Hadley Gamble. \u201cThat will not be the end of ISIS.\u201d", "Four days after that interview,\u00a0on Dec. 19, Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0on Twitter that U.S. troops would be withdrawing from Syria.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve beaten them and we\u2019ve beaten them badly,\u201d Trump said of ISIS.\u00a0A week later, the president and first lady\u00a0visited\u00a0the troops in Iraq, arriving on Dec. 26.", "As we\u2019ve written before on this issue, military experts cautioned against declaring victory against ISIS even if the physical land has nearly been completely retaken.", "McGurk\u00a0and\u00a0Defense Secretary James\u00a0Mattis\u00a0resigned in protest after Trump\u2019s withdrawal announcement.", "As for \u201cGeneral Raisin Caine,\u201d a military affairs reporter for Politico tweeted that\u00a0Air Force Brig. Gen. J. Daniel Caine, who is the deputy commanding general (forward) for Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq, has the nickname \u201cRaisin.\u201d Or perhaps it is \u201cRazin,\u201d as Politico later wrote. We asked the Air Force public affairs office if it would confirm that and comment on whether the conversation in Iraq, as Trump tells it, occurred. We haven\u2019t received a response.", "One last, related point: Trump claimed in his CPAC speech that he gave Mattis his nickname of \u201cMad Dog.\u201d", "Trump, March 2:\u00a0Just like I did with Mattis when I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you a new nickname, because \u2018Chaos\u2019 is not a good nickname.\u201d So we changed his name. Called him \u201cMad Dog.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t working too well. Mad Dog wasn\u2019t working too well.", "Mattis has had the nickname \u201cMad Dog\u201d longer than Trump has been president. A\u00a02006 story in The Atlantic said\u00a0\u201chis admiring grunts\u201d used the moniker. The Military Times found the nickname used two years earlier, in a Los Angeles Times story.", "In discussing the trade war with China, the president went on a long, largely accurate riff about the Great Tariff Debate of 1888, when the two major parties disagreed on how to reduce the budget surplus. (Yes, federal surplus.)", "At the time, prior to the introduction of the federal income tax, import duties accounted for about half of federal revenues. During the\u00a01888 presidential campaign, there was a partisan disagreement over what to do with the budget surplus. There were two schools of thought: \u201c[T]he Democrats proposed a tariff reduction to reduce customs revenue, the Republicans offered higher tariffs to reduce imports and customs revenue,\u201d Douglas A. Irwin, a Dartmouth economics professor, wrote in a paper that analyzed \u201cthe fiscal aspects of the \u2018Great Tariff Debate of 1888.\u2019\u201d", "Trump, March 2:\u00a0We didn\u2019t know what to do with all of the money we were making. We were so rich. And McKinley, prior to being president, he was very strong on protecting our assets, protecting our country. And he made statements that, \u201cOthers cannot come into our country and steal our wealth and steal our jobs, and build their country and not defend our country. We can\u2019t do that. We can\u2019t ever allow that to happen.\u201d \u2026 So the great Tariff Debate of 1888 \u2014 and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted. We built forces up that were incredible. Then, in 1913, they ended tariffs, okay? They ended tariffs. Somebody got stupid and they ended tariffs.", "Republican Benjamin Harrison won the election and signed into law the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which increased tariffs on average to nearly 50 percent, according to the House Office of the Historian. Rep. William McKinley, who would become president in 1897, said high tariffs were needed to protect\u00a0workers\u2019 wages and U.S. industry.", "So, Trump was right about the 1888 tariff debate. But he was wrong when he went on to say, \u201cThen, in 1913, they ended tariffs.\u201d", "Trump was referring to the\u00a0Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913, which reduced but did not eliminate tariffs. It was signed into law by Democratic President Woodrow Wilson.", "\u201cUnder the new schedule, the average tariff on dutiable imports would fall from 40 percent to 27 percent, a decline of about one third,\u201d Irwin, the Dartmouth professor, writes in his book\u00a0\u201cClashing Over Commerce,\u201d a history of the U.S. trade policy. \u201cThe Underwood-Simmons tariff made a substantial across-the-board reduction of about 25 percent in duties on manufactured goods and put a large number of products on the duty-free list, including wool, iron, coal, lumber, meat, dairy products, leather boots and shoes, wood pulp and paper, wheat, and agricultural supplies; the duty on sugar was to be abolished gradually over three years. The share of duty-free imports rose from 54 percent of total imports in 1912 to 69 percent in 1916.\u201d", "In an email to us, Irwin said, \u201cIt did not \u2018end\u2019 tariffs \u2013 but it did reduce them, although they went back up in 1922 and again in 1930 \u2013 the latter with disastrous consequences (the Smoot Hawley tariff).\u201d", "Irwin is referring to the Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act of 1922\u00a0and Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 \u2014 both of which raised tariffs substantially.", "\u201cAfter World War I, Republicans returned to power and in 1922 passed the Fordney-McCumber Tariff, which restored high rates and pushed some to record levels,\u201d Spencer Howard writes in a blog\u00a0for the Herbert Hoover Library and Museum.", "The U.S. Senate Historical Office writes that the Smoot-Hawley Act, which was signed into law by Republican President Herbert Hoover, had disastrous consequences for U.S. trade and Hoover.", "\u201cAs the economists predicted, the high tariff proved to be a disaster,\u201d the U.S. Senate Historical Office writes. \u201cEven before its enactment, U.S. trading partners began retaliating by raising their tariff rates, which froze international trade. The tariff fight solidified Hoover\u2019s ties with Republican regulars, but it shredded his standing among his party\u2019s progressives.\u00a0Most of the progressive Republican senators who had campaigned for Hoover in 1928 wound up endorsing Franklin D. Roosevelt for president in the next election.\u201d", "In reeling off some economic statistics, the president claimed that\u00a0\u201cAfrican American income has reached an all-time high.\u201d It hasn\u2019t \u2014 at least not by the traditional measure of real median household income.", "In September, the Census Bureau released its income and poverty report for 2017.\u00a0The\u00a0median income for black households (Table A-1) was $40,258 in 2017. After adjusting for inflation, that was a decrease of $81 from 2016, which was President Barack Obama\u2019s last year in office.\u00a0(The median figure represents the midpoint \u2014 half of all households earned more, half less.)", "The real median income was also higher in 1999 ($41,192), 2000 ($42,348) and 2001 ($40,902). The chart below from the Census Bureau illustrates the trend over time in 2017 dollars.", "We asked the White House for information supporting the president\u2019s claim about African American income reaching an all-time high on his watch, but we did not get a response.", "As we usually do in fact-checking claims about income, we used the Census Bureau data for all households. Census also provides data by type of household: family households (married couples and households with a parent and at least one child but no spouse) and nonfamily households (female and male). The median income for black family households was $52,384 \u2014 an increase of $358 from 2016 and the highest it has been since at least 1980, which is as far back as the Census Bureau provides data for\u00a0black family households.", "We should also note that Census warns about comparing 2017 median household income data to estimates prior to 2013. Starting then, the Census Bureau redesigned its questions, and the annual survey has picked up some sources of income that were previously missed. Jonathan L. Rothbaum, chief of the Income Statistics Branch, wrote that the redesigned questions resulted in higher household income estimates.", "The president spoke for a little more than two hours, which was plenty of time for him to repeat false and misleading claims he often makes. We include some here, linking to our previous stories:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
