["\u201cDo you know that the gas cylinder you live with in the kitchen is a time bomb, ready to explode any time,\u201d reads a Facebook post from Nigeria, shared more than 180 times. The post was also shared in Kenya.", "It claims that every gas cylinder has an expiry date and those that have \u201cexpired\u201d are unsafe to keep in the house. \u201cThe expiring date is coded on the side of the LPG Cylinder in alphabetical order, A,B,C,D in quarters (sic),\u201d the post explains further.", "Each quarter is said to represent a three-month period (March, June, September and December) followed by a number to indicate the year of expiry.", "However, this numbering system is actually used to indicate a future date for routine inspection.", "Similar Facebook posts were shared here, here, here and here.", "The same claim was published on Youtube (in 2015) and on Twitter (in 2017).", "No expiry date", "The claim was dismissed in 2016 by the Indian Oil Corporation which noted that \u201cthere is no expiry date for LPG cylinders\u201d.", "\u201cThe term expiry normally refers to the shelf life of perishable products which is the recommended time for safe storage and usage of such products within the time frame\u2026 As such there is no expiry date for LPG cylinders,\u201d read the statement.", "A search online also revealed a news report published in 2017 by an Indian publication describing the claim as one that recurs annually in the Asian country.", "Michael Wasike, an engineer at Chemigas, a gas plant in Nairobi, told AFP Fact Check that unlike perishable products which have a shelf life, gas cylinders undergo inspections to make sure that they adhere to the set safety standards.", "\u201cIn Kenya, the cylinders are supposed to be used in the market for eight years, then they are supposed to be inspected afresh,\u201d Wasike said in a phone interview.", "David Tyler, the director of France-based World Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association (WLPGA), explained in an email to AFP Fact Check that during their periodic inspections, gas cylinders undergo \u201cvisual checks for dents, corrosion etc., a date check to ensure the cylinder is not due for requalification, and a tare weight check to ensure the correct amount of LPG is filled into the cylinder\u201d.", "What do the codes mean?", "The Indian Oil Corporation explained in its press statement that the codes imprinted with letters and numbers indicate the next due date for each cylinder to undergo testing or inspection. It does not mean the cylinder automatically expires, nor does it make the gas bottle a \u201ctime bomb\u201d.", "\u201cCylinders marked A 2017 means that they are due for testing in the first quarter (between January and March) of the year 2017. Similarly, B 2017 means that they are due for testing in the second quarter (between April and June) of the year 2017. Similarly C (between July and September) is for the third quarter and D (between October and December) for the fourth quarter,\u201d reads the press release.", "Safety precautions", "Nonetheless, Tyler cautioned that consumers need to be careful when handling LPG cylinders at home and to ensure the regulator has been fitted correctly to the valve and that it, as well as the hose and appliance, are in good condition.", "\u201cConsumers should also make sure there are no leaks by checking all joints with soapy water and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 ensure there is adequate ventilation for complete combustion,\u201d said Tyler.", "AFP Fact Check previously debunked a claim that gas cylinders explode if shaken.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
