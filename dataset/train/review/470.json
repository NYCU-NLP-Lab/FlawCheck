Going backwards is telling seniors that you no longer have your Medicare and your Medicare Advantage. I can\u2019t believe that Senator Baldwin wants to literally throw grandma off the cliff.

Here\u2019s the hitch: Hospitals will be forced to operate under conditions of extreme scarcity, with too little revenue and more patients than ever.\n\nRight now, Medicare shortchanges hospitals, paying them less than the full cost of caring for seniors. But hospitals accept the low payments, because they can shift the unmet costs to younger patients who have private insurance that pays more.\n\nBut in the new scheme, hospitals will be paid at Medicare rates for all their patients, not just seniors (Sec. 611).
