["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on March 14, 2018", "Q: Has Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a warrant for the arrest of George Soros?", "A: No. That rumor has been circulating online for years in various forms.", "FULL ANSWER", "It\u2019s true that Russia in 2015\u00a0banned\u00a0two charities run by the billionaire George Soros.", "Soon after\u00a0that ban was announced, an internet rumor circulated that Russian President Vladimir Putin had issued an arrest warrant for Soros himself. That\u2019s false.", "Facebook users rightly flagged stories about the arrest warrant as potentially false.\u00a0The international police organization, INTERPOL, does not list Soros among those who have warrants out for their arrest.", "The most recent version of the rumor has been circulating with the headline: \u201cPUTIN ISSUES INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANT FOR GEORGE SOROS.\u201d", "The bogus story starts by saying: \u201cRussia has officially declared that Billionaire George Soros is a wanted man in their country, citing him and his organizations as a \u2018threat to Russian national security.'\u201d", "That echoes part of a headline from Russia\u2019s government-run news outlet, RT, which announced the ban on two of his charities this way: \u201cProsecutors ban Soros Foundation as \u2018threat to Russian national security.\u2019\u201d The RT story doesn\u2019t explain why the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation were banned beyond saying they were deemed a \u201cthreat to the foundations of Russia\u2019s Constitutional order and national security.\u201d More important, it says nothing about Soros being wanted for arrest.", "The false story goes on to reproduce part of a piece that ran on a website called Veterans Today in 2016. That piece confused Russia\u2019s ban on the charities with removing Soros from the country, and is largely made-up of a hodgepodge of quotes from a variety of sources.", "For example, it quoted from a Rolling Stone article about the effect that Goldman Sachs has had on the American economy and then, without any evidence, stated: \u201cObviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs.\u201d The Rolling Stone article didn\u2019t mention Soros at all.", "The story also quoted from a post\u00a0on a Russian website during the 2016 presidential campaign that claimed Soros had rigged the outcome of the U.S. election.", "Although there is no truth to the claim that Putin has issued an arrest warrant for Soros, stories with that headline have been shared on Facebook more than 13,000 times.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Sources", "Ablan, Jennifer. \u201cRussia bans George Soros foundation as state security \u2018threat.\u2019\u201d Reuters. 30 Nov 2015.", "\u201cPUTIN ISSUES INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANT FOR GEORGE SOROS.\u201d ViralPoliticsUS.com. 10 Mar 2018.", "\u201cProsecutors ban Soros Foundation as \u2018threat to Russian national security.\u2019\u201d RT. 30 Nov 2015.", "\u201cVladimir Putin to George Soros: Thank God we kicked you out of Russia.\u201d Veterans Today. 17 Aug 2016.", "Taibbi, Matt. \u201cThe Great American Bubble Machine.\u201d Rolling Stone. 5 Apr 2010.", "\u201cGeorge Soros: \u2018Let\u2019s Call the Terrorists a Taxi!\u2019\u201d Journal-neo.org. 7 Aug 2016.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
