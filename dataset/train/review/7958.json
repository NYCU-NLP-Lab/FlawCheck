["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on June 26, 2020 | Updated on August 17, 2020", "Editor\u2019s note, Aug. 14: Joe Biden\u2019s June 23 remarks that President Donald Trump \u201cwants to cut off money for the post office so they cannot deliver mail-in ballots\u201d have been confirmed \u2014 by the president himself.", "In an Aug. 13 interview, Trump admitted that he opposes a coronavirus pandemic relief bill crafted by the House Democrats because it includes funding for the U.S. Postal Service and state election officials \u2014 money that Trump said is needed to allow the Postal Service to handle an expected surge in mail-in voting.", "For an update, see our story, \u201cTrump Proves Biden Right on USPS Funding, Mail-In Ballots.\u201d", "Updated, Aug. 17: We added an update to the original headline to give the new information more prominence. See \u201cMailbag: Our Headline on U.S. Postal Service Story\u201d for more information.", "Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, claimed without evidence that President Donald Trump \u201cwants to cut off money for the post office so they cannot deliver mail-in ballots.\u201d", "The perpetually cash-strapped U.S. Postal Service has been hurt by COVID-19 and is negotiating with the Treasury Department for a $10 billion loan, which the president has said he will not approve without changes in USPS pricing and leadership.", "But a USPS spokesman told us its current financial condition will have no impact on its ability to deliver mail-in ballots this year.", "Biden floated his election conspiracy at a June 23 virtual fundraising event with former President Barack Obama. The former vice president made his remarks about the Postal Service when he was offering suggestions on how to \u201ckeep our democracy strong,\u201d including registering to vote and volunteering to be poll workers. (It starts at about 1:13:00 of the campaign video.)", "Biden then said this (at 1:14:10): \u201cMaking sure we tell the American public what the president is doing, saying he wants to cut off money for the post office so they cannot deliver mail-in ballots.\u201d", "We can find no instance of Trump saying he wants to thwart the Postal Service\u2019s ability to deliver mail-in ballots, and the Biden campaign hasn\u2019t provided us with any.", "It is true that Trump has been waging a relentless and frequently misleading\u00a0campaign against states expanding the use of mail-in ballots for this year\u2019s elections, because of the coronavirus pandemic.", "It is also true that the Postal Service is losing more money than usual because of COVID-19 and has requested an infusion of cash, and it is not clear to what extent Trump will help. During negotiations with Congress over the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, the Trump administration reportedly opposed Democratic efforts to provide funding to help bail out the U.S. mail system.", "But Trump has been a frequent critic of the Postal Service, and there\u2019s no evidence that his current stance toward the U.S. postal system is related to the presidential election.", "The CARES Act, which Trump signed March 27, didn\u2019t give the Postal Service everything it wanted, but the law provided two forms of relief: deferred payments of the employer share of Social Security and the ability to borrow up to $10 billion from the Treasury Department.", "The Postal Service, in its most recent quarterly financial report, said deferring Social Security payments will save the organization an estimated $1.6 billion this year.", "Obtaining access to the $10 billion line of credit will be trickier.", "As is customary with such loans, the terms and conditions of the loan must be mutually agreed upon by the treasury secretary and the Postal Service \u2014 giving Trump leverage over an organization that he has long criticized for losing money. Since 2007, the Postal Service reports that it has cumulative net losses of $83.1 billion through March.", "At an April 24 bill signing, Trump criticized the Postal Service for not charging Amazon and other online retailers more for package delivery. He said the Postal Service \u201cshould raise the price of a package by approximately four times\u201d and threatened to block the $10 billion loan unless it raises rates.", "At the bill signing, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he agreed that rates should be increased. He also added that \u201cwe are going to put certain criteria for our postal reform program as part of the loan.\u201d Two weeks later, the Postal Service\u2019s board of governors installed a new postmaster general \u2014 Louis DeJoy, a Republican fundraiser and Trump ally.", "But Trump\u2019s criticism of the Postal Service and how much it charges Amazon isn\u2019t new. The president has had a long-running feud with Amazon\u2019s CEO and founder, Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post \u2014\u00a0a frequent target of Trump\u2019s false claims of \u201cfake news.\u201d", "Although he has been criticized for trying to\u00a0kill\u00a0or\u00a0privatize\u00a0the Postal Service, Trump has acknowledged its\u00a0unique place\u00a0in the United States. \u201c[Y]ou could never replicate the post office,\u201d he said at an\u00a0April 29 press conference. \u201cThe post office is massive. But they\u2019ve got places and little sections of our country that no company could ever go to. That took hundreds of years to build the post office.\u201d", "The president\u2019s latest critical comments about the Postal Service are in line with statements he has made for years.", "Also, the Postal Service told us that the financial impact of COVID-19 isn\u2019t as dire as it initially projected, and that the organization will be able to deliver mail-in ballots this year.", "In April, then-Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan warned that \u201cthe COVID-19 pandemic will increase the Postal Service\u2019s net operating loss by more than $22 billion dollars over the next eighteen months.\u201d", "At the time, the Postal Service had asked Congress for $25 billion in emergency appropriations and $25 billion in loans from the Treasury Department to continue operating, according to a Congressional Research Service report.", "But David Partenheimer, a Postal Service spokesman, told us in an email that conditions have improved since Brennan\u2019s April 10 statement.", "\u201cThus far mail volume has drastically declined, but not as significantly as we originally predicted based upon the data we had from the first three weeks of the pandemic, and package volume has been growing exponentially,\u201d Partenheimer said. \u201cThe recent trends indicate that our 2020 financial performance will be better than our early scenarios predicted, but the pandemic will nevertheless have an extremely detrimental impact on the financial condition of the Postal Service.\u201d", "In a sign of its improved condition, the Postal Service reported a net loss of a whopping $1.2 billion in April, but a more modest $225 million in May, according to its monthly financial reports.", "Overall, USPS has reported a net loss of $3.1 billion from March through May \u2013 about $459 million more than it had for that same period in 2019, according to its unaudited monthly financial reports.", "Partenheimer said that the mail service will continue through the 2020 election.", "\u201cRegarding our role in elections, our current financial condition is not going to impact our ability to deliver election and political mail this year,\u201d Partenheimer said.", "The spokesman referred us to the second quarter report from March that said the Postal Service \u201cexpects that it will have sufficient liquidity to continue to operate through at least May 2021\u201d through a combination of loans and \u201cprioritizing payments,\u201d such as paying employees ahead of funding retirement and retiree health plans.", "As we\u2019ve explained, the president has certainly been critical of USPS, suggesting some conditions on a potential loan to the service, and he has made several false and misleading statements in his campaign against mail-in ballots. But Biden conflates the two issues to make the unsupported claim that Trump is \u201csaying he wants to cut off money for the post office so they cannot deliver mail-in ballots.\u201d There\u2019s no evidence Trump ever said such a thing.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
