["Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford does not have kind words for the state\u2019s $500 limit on individual campaign contributions.\n\nHe\u2019s called the cap archaic, emasculating\u00a0and ineffective, saying lawmakers bypass the $500 per election threshold by raising unlimited amounts of money from loosely regulated political committees.\n\nWeatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, says increasing the limit on individual campaign contributions will make Florida\u2019s campaign finance system more transparent.\n\n\"We have the second-lowest contribution limit in the entire country,\" Weatherford said\u00a0in driving home the point to news editors and reporters in Tallahassee on Jan. 30, 2013.\n\nLater that day, Weatherford unveiled House legislation\u00a0that would increase the individual donation limit\u00a0to $10,000 and get rid of the political committees that Weatherford says have been prone to abuse.\n\nWe decided to circle back to Weatherford\u2019s comment about Florida\u2019s lower-than-most contribution limit.\n\nWeatherford is referring to the maximum amount a person can contribute to a candidate for state office per an election. According to the Florida Department of State, a \"person\" in campaign finance terms is defined broadly to include \"an individual or a corporation, association, firm, partnership, joint venture, joint stock company, club, organization, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate or other combination of individuals having collective capacity.\"\n\nSo each \"person\" can contribute $500 for a primary and $500 for a general election, or $1,000 total. The same person can also contribute another $1,000 for a business they own. Or if they own 10 businesses, they can contribute an additional $10,000. And so on.\n\nWeatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy directed us to a breakdown of campaign limits\u00a0across states by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Duffy said Florida is actually tied for the second-lowest limit, with Maine being the state with the lowest limit ($350).\n\nBut it\u2019s not a simple apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nFlorida\u2019s $500 limit -- or $1,000 if you include the primary and general election -- is the same for all state races (House, Senate, Cabinet and governor), but limits in other states vary according to the race. In Connecticut, for instance, individual donations max out at $3,500 per election for gubernatorial candidates (more than Florida), $1,000 for state Senate races (the same) and $250 for state House races (and less).\n\nSome states have different contribution limits for election years and non-election years. And instead of counting donations for each election, like Florida, some states strictly look at donation tallies per calendar year.\n\nPoint being, it\u2019s pretty complicated. So we went to the experts.\n\nNCSL senior fellow Jennie Bowser provided us a list of 12 states that have the same or lower contribution limits as Florida in certain situations. (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana and Wisconsin).\n\nA few examples, from the NCSL:\n\n* Candidates for Legislature in Delaware can receive a total of $600 in contributions (counting the primary and general election).\n* Candidates for Legislature in Montana can receive a total of $320 in contributions (counting the primary and general election).\n* Candidates for Legislature in Colorado can receive a total of $400 in contributions (counting the primary and general election).\n\nIn each case, that compares to $1,000 in Florida.\n\nWeatherford\u2019s point would be closer to accurate if he were talking solely about contributions to a candidate for governor, Bowser said. Alaska\u2019s limit is the same as Florida\u2019s as long as the total amount is given in two separate contributions, each in a different calendar year. Arizona\u2019s $872 limit is the lowest.\n\nOur ruling\nWeatherford claimed Florida\u2019s direct campaign contribution limit is the second-lowest limit in the country.\n\nFlorida\u2019s limit ($500 per election) is low compared to some states, though it\u2019s not that low when you consider that people can make multiple contributions using business entities. But even still, Weatherford errs in trying to make a sweeping comparison because states don\u2019t have an across-the-board limit.
