A few other individual users and Facebook pages/groups circulated the same earlier this year.", "There are certain observational hints that call the bluff of the fake e-paper clip. First, it does not include a date and second, has some serious grammatical flaws. In the first paragraph, the article addresses CM Kejriwal as \u201c\u0915\u0947\u091c\u0930\u0940 (Kejri)\u201d which is uncharacteristic of a mainstream newspaper. In the subsequent paragraph, a statement by Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif is not written in the form of a direct quote. As one reads further, similar slights can be identified. However, the most significant indicator of the falseness of the clip is the fact that it says nothing about Kejriwal\u2019s quote; it is only mentioned in the title.", "Alt News found the possible origin of the fake clip.
