This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country.\"", "During the press event Trump also once again referred to the debunked claim that prior to 9/11 that he had issued a warning that the U.S. needed to \"take out\" Osama bin Laden, declaring:  \u201cI don\u2019t get any credit for [my warning] ...

But here we are.\u201d", "All of that verbal wrangling prompted some Trump critics to point out that after U.S. forces had finally run Osama bin Laden to ground, Trump had declared President Obama did not deserve congratulations for the feat because it was \"Navy SEALS [who] killed bin Laden\" and not Obama himself.  Those criticisms in turn prompted questions about whether Trump critics were correct in stating that Trump had really said such a thing.", "In short, the answer those questions is \"yes,\" Donald Trump did say such a thing.
