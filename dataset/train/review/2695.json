["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 29, 2020", "Viral text posts are advancing the groundless claim that George Floyd\u2019s arrest and death in Minneapolis were \u201cstaged\u201d to incite \u201cracial tensions.\u201d\u00a0But they offer no evidence to support that conspiracy theory.", "Text posts of a nearly 1,000-word screed shared by thousands on Facebook are baselessly suggesting that the arrest and death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, were \u201cstaged.\u201d", "The posts have circulated in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death on May 25. Floyd, a black man, was declared dead shortly after he was detained by police. A\u00a0video of the arrest shows the 46-year-old repeatedly saying that he could not breathe as an officer, a white man, kneels on his neck.", "\u201cThe Floyd event was staged,\u201d the posts claim.", "Like many conspiracy theories, what follows is a long list of claims and unrelated events to argue that a secret plot with political motives is at play. But none of the evidence cited supports the contention that the \u201cevent\u201d was \u201cstaged.\u201d", "The posts begin by suggesting \u201cat the very least the \u2018possibility'\u201d that the death was a \u201cfilmed public execution of a black man by a white cop, with the purpose of creating racial tensions and driving a wedge in the growing group of anti deep state sentiment from comon people.\u201d", "It goes on to imply the case is tied to other events \u2014 including former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s controversial remark in which he said if black voters couldn\u2019t choose between him and President Donald Trump, \u201cYou ain\u2019t black\u201d \u2014 with no factual backing to make those connections. It further ties the Floyd case to what it deems \u201cthe COVID-19 fear campaign\u201d falling apart.", "Lt. Bob Kroll, president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, dismissed the conspiracy theory in an email to us, saying there was \u201cnothing staged.\u201d", "In a phone interview, Joseph Uscinski, an associate professor of political science at the University of Miami who studies conspiracy theories, told us that the theory \u201chas a series of common tropes in it \u2014 and one of them is that these things can\u2019t be a coincidence.\u201d", "It \u201cappeals to people\u2019s willingness to look for intentionality rather than to understand that sometimes things just happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAs shocking as it might seem, we have to realize it\u2019s the same stuff we see all the time\u201d in such conspiracy theories.", "One unsupported element in the posts suggests the filming of Floyd\u2019s death was planned, claiming that the \u201conly goal that there appeared to be was exactly what happened: \u2018To be filmed brutally killing a black man\u2019.\u201d", "But in reality, the viral, 10-minute video of Floyd\u2019s arrest that sparked an outcry was filmed because a 17-year-old woman walking by the arrest noticed that Floyd couldn\u2019t breathe and began recording.", "\u201cI was walking my cousin to the store and I just see him on the ground and I\u2019m like what is going on? I pull my camera out, this man cannot \u2026 breathe at all,\u201d Darnella Frazier said in a video the next day.", "The posts also suggest \u201c[t]here is substantial video evidence to arrest at least one officer now\u201d but that there is \u201ca political advantage not to!\u201d", "On May 29, however, as the posts were circulating, officials announced the arrest of Derek Chauvin, who was identified as the police officer kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a press conference that Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.", "The posts also cite the fact that \u201ca fake Facebook page supposedly belonging to the officer\u201d surfaced with a \u201cpicture of the cop with a red ballcap that says \u2018Make America White Again.'\u201d", "It\u2019s true that a since-deactivated Facebook profile under the name \u201cDerek Chauvin\u201d posted a photo of a man wearing a \u201cMake Whites Great Again\u201d hat \u2014 which went viral as users erroneously identified the photo as that of the officer. As we explained when debunking that claim, the person in the photo is actually a man known for creating fake accounts and deceiving people.", "Misinformation often flows following tragic, high-profile events. But the falsehood referenced in these posts isn\u2019t proof that the arrest and death were planned.", "Another groundless claim in the posts is that George Soros, the billionaire known for funding liberal causes, is tied to the Minneapolis incident: \u201cYou can draw your own conclusions, but this appears to have all the earmarks of George Soros. Please open your eyes!!!!\u201d", "The posts offer no evidence that Soros has anything to do with the Floyd case. Soros has become the subject of many conspiracy theories.", "The posts also attempt to raise eyebrows by referencing the police car\u2019s license plate: \u201cFINALLY\u2026.\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f this entire scene plays out with the cop car and license plate that says \u2018POLICE\u2019. The plate was perfectly framed for maximum subliminal impact.\u201d", "As we\u2019ve explained, though, many Minneapolis police cars use that license plate because, under Minnesota state law, police vehicles that are clearly marked are not required to display numbered license plates.", "In short,\u00a0there\u2019s plenty of innuendo in the popular Facebook posts \u2014 but they offer no evidence for the outrageous claim that Floyd\u2019s arrest and death were \u201cstaged.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
