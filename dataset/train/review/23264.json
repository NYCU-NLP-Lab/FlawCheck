["The claim was published here on a New Zealand-based Facebook page on July 20, 2020. The post has been shared more than 126 times.", "The Facebook post's caption states in part: \u201cNASA has recently added a new star sign to the Zodiac family - welcome to the team Ophiuchus.\u201d", "A meme included in the post lists the corresponding birth dates for the 12 astrological signs of the zodiac, with an additional one, \u201cOphiuchus\u201d, purportedly designated for people born on or between November 29 and December 17.", "The zodiac was drawn up some 3,000 years ago by the Babylonians, an ancient civilisation, to illustrate the constellations that lie along the same path as that of the Sun, according to NASA.", "A similar claim\u00a0about the purported new star sign have also been shared on Facebook\u00a0here and here\u00a0in July 2020. The same hoax was shared thousands of times after it was published\u00a0here\u00a0on Facebook in 2016. It was also shared here, here and here on Twitter in 2016.", "The claim, however, is\u00a0false.", "NASA refuted the claim\u00a0in this July 17, 2020, Twitter post, which states in part: \u201cNo, we did not change the zodiac. When the Babylonians invented the constellations [zodiac signs] 3,000 years ago, they chose to leave out a 13th sign.\u201d", "The space agency had previously clarified the confusion about \"Ophiuchus\" in this September 2016 blog post: \u201cHere at NASA, we study astronomy, not astrology. We didn\u2019t change any zodiac signs. Astronomy is the scientific study of everything in outer space. Astrology, meanwhile, is something else. It\u2019s the belief that the positions of stars and planets can influence human events. It\u2019s not considered a science.\u201d", "NASA said the Babylonians picked 12 constellations in the zodiac and assigned each of them to a specific month on their 12-month calendar. \u201cAccording to the Babylonians\u2019 own ancient stories, there were 13 constellations in the zodiac. So they picked one, Ophiuchus, to leave out,\u201d NASA added.", "The agency explained here that even though ophiuchus was omitted by the Babylonians for the sake of a \u201ctidy match with their 12-month calendar\u201d, it nonetheless aligned with the sun for about 18 days each year.", "Misinformation about a 13th star sign has circulated online since at least 2011, as reported by the BBC here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
