Most likely the timing of the video's spread (i.e., during the NFL playoffs) and its use of football imagery caused some social media users to presume it was intended to be a Super Bowl ad.", "Indeed, Mr. Phillips confirmed for us that this video originated with him and was not something to be aired during the Super Bowl:", "You are correct that [the video] will not air during the Super Bowl. You also are correct that I am responsible for it.", "The video in question is a pastiche which features wildly cheering football fans set against several terribly real facts about the dangers presented by pit bulls.
