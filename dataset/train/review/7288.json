["About this rating", "At least four companies have announced intent to manufacture synthetic or fake rhino horn genetically identical to its real counterpart.", "Conservation and wildlife groups almost universally rejected the idea, as it's unclear whether producing fake rhino horn will decrease demand for real rhino horn, and it's uncertain whether the synthetic product can be legally sold under extant anti-poaching laws.", "On 9 July 2016, the Facebook page \"The Medical Facts\" published the image and explanation shown below, reporting the development of synthetic rhino horn as an anti-poaching measure:", "A biotech startup has managed to 3-D print fake rhino horns that carry the same genetic fingerprint as the actual horn. The company plans to flood Chinese [the] Chinese rhino horn market at one-eighth of the price of the original, undercutting the price poachers can get and forcing them out eventually.", "The International Rhino Foundation (IRF) and Save the Rhino International (SRI) issued a joint statement after \"monitoring the progress of four US-based companies that have announced their intentions \u2014 with varying degrees of success \u2014 to produce synthetic or bio-fabricated rhino horn, and occasionally also other products including e.g. elephant ivory, lion bones or pangolin scales.\" In that statement, both groups expressed their opposition to the introduction of fake rhino horn to international markets:", "We are opposed to the development, marketing and sale of synthetic rhino horn [because]:", "o Selling synthetic horn does not reduce the demand for rhino horn or dispel the myths around rhino horn and could indeed lead to more poaching because it increases demand for \u201cthe real thing\u201d", "o More than 90% of \u201crhino horns\u201d in circulation are fake (mostly carved from buffalo horn or wood), but poaching rates continue to rise annually.", "o Synthetic horn could give credence to the notion that rhino horn has medicinal value, which is not supported by science.", "o Users buy from trusted sources and value \u201cthe real thing.\u201d", "o The availability of legal synthetic horn could normalise or remove the stigma from buying illegal real horn.", "o It will take time to develop synthetic horn and meanwhile the poaching crisis continues.", "o How can consumers and law enforcement officials distinguish between legal synthetic horn that looks real, and illegal real horn?", "o Companies benefitting from making synthetic horn have shown very little commitment to use their profits to help the core problem of rhino poaching; besides which, those profits would meet only a tiny fraction of the total rhino protection costs that would remain to be met as long as demand reduction campaigns falter, as they would with the marketing of synthetic horn.", "o Finally, the manufacture / marketing / sale of synthetic horn diverts funds and attention from the real problem: unsustainable levels of rhino poaching.", "A December 2015 National Geographicarticle covered the efforts of one such biotechnology outfit producing synthetic rhino horn (Pembroke) and outlined some conservationist concerns about the unintended consequences of such a venture:", "\u201cI frankly don\u2019t see that it\u2019s any better, to be honest,\u201d says Susie Watts, a consultant for WildAid and co-chair of the Species Survival Network Rhino Working Group, referring to Pembient\u2019s move to put faux powder on the back burner. While she\u2019s aware that people buy rhino horn jewelry, Watts has never heard of rhino horn cell phone cases and chopsticks.", "But opposition to Pembient\u2019s synthetic horn plans extends beyond the possible new market it could create. \u201cThere\u2019s very little, if any, relief on wild populations when we see commercial farming develop or commercial trade of a protected species,\u201d says Douglas Hendrie, manager of the wildlife crime and investigations unit for conservation group Education for Nature - Vietnam. \u201cThe wild trade continues right alongside.\u201d", "Patrick Bergin, CEO of the African Wildlife Foundation, also believes that inserting fake horn into the market could counteract efforts to educate people about why they shouldn\u2019t buy wild horn, a strategy most activists push as the best way to reduce demand.", "\u201cIf you start to nuance that message with some rhino horn is good, some of it is bad, some of it is legal, some of it is illegal,\u201d he says, \u201cyou lose people and lose the clarity of the message.\u201d", "There\u2019s also concern that fake horn could increase the workload for law enforcement in countries already struggling to contain the illicit trade. According to Hendrie, Vietnam doesn\u2019t have the enforcement capacity to regulate the black market along with the legal one.", "A February 2016 followup article presented a five-point set of objections to the introduction of genetic copies of rhino horn to the market, filed with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by the Center for Biological Diversity:", "Additionally, U.S Fish & Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Deputy Chief Ed Grace commented:", "Experience demonstrates that efforts to 'flood the market' with products produced from protected wildlife\u2014either by producing synthetic alternatives or raising animals in captivity for harvest\u2014often fail to achieve their stated goal. Such efforts often create more demand from consumers, even as products from wild animals and plants continue to command a premium over synthetic or farmed alternatives. ... We also have significant concerns about injecting products into the market that would make it harder for law enforcement to detect poached and trafficked wildlife products, or allow criminals to disguise the source of illegal products by commingling them with these alternatives.", "In short, it's true that at least four biotechnology firms have engaged in some form of development of synthetic material genetically identical to rhino horn. Although progress in that area was initially hailed as a potential anti-poaching measure, conservation groups and wildlife officials have since expressed strong skepticism that the overall effects on the rhinoceros population of selling such material wouldn't be deleterious.  Members of both groups have espoused positions opposing the introduction of fake rhino horn to any market, citing anticipated demand uptick and burdens on already taxed enforcement agencies.", "Actman, Jani. \u00a0 \"Can Fake Rhino Horn Stop the Poaching of an Endangered Species?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 National Geographic. \u00a0 2 December 2015.", "Neme, Laurel. \u00a0 \"Petition Seeks Ban on Trade in Fake Rhino Horn.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 National Geographic. \u00a0 10 February 2016.", "Save the Rhino International. \u00a0 \"Joint Statement by the International Rhino Foundation and Save the Rhino International.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 July 2015.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
