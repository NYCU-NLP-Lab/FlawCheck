["According to a tale currently spreading across Canadian social media, sex traffickers have devised a new tactic in order to abduct their victims. Criminals, the rumour goes, are placing a $100 bill wrapped with a red ribbon\u00a0on parked car door handles. They\u00a0are laced with a debilitating agent in order to incapacitate victims once they touch the bill, leaving them vulnerable to abduction.", "In all cases, the Facebook posts mention that the information \u201cis shared from a friend,\u201d or a relative of a friend, however AFP has found no instances of anyone telling the story from a personal point of view.", "A copied and pasted version of the post has been shared across Canada, partly because the text specifies that this tactic is used at the Northgate Mall, a common name for shopping centers in North America. Northgate Mall is also the name of the first mall in the United States, opened in 1950 in Seattle.", "In Canada, viral versions of the same post mention the Northgate Village, a mall in Burnaby, a suburb of Vancouver in British Columbia, the Northgate Centre in Edmonton, and the Northgate Shopping Centre in Winnipeg. In the United States, identical versions of the story were shared from Revere, near Boston, Cincinnati, in the midwestern state of Ohio and in the Pacific Northwest.", "However, nothing suggests that such abduction tactics are being used\u00a0in any of those cities, or elsewhere in North America in 2020.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it around quite a lot on social media. We\u2019ve not been able to verify this. Police haven\u2019t received any reports of that,\u201d Cheryl Voordenhout, spokesperson for the Edmonton Police Department, told AFP. Following AFP\u2019s inquiry, the Edmonton Police Department released an official statement on the matter.", "\u201cNothing of that sort has been reported here in Winnipeg,\u201d Winnipeg Police Service media officer Ally Siatecki told AFP in an email. This information was corroborated by Mitch Natividad, the Northgate Shopping Centre building manager, who wrote that there was \u201cnothing to worry because nothing like that has ever happened to our mall.\u201d", "\u201cWe are aware of these social media posts and to date we are unable to locate a report or investigation related to the complaint being outlined in the posts,\u201d the Burnaby Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) told AFP in a statement regarding the Northgate Village mall.", "The Burnaby RCMP advised, \u201cWe caution people to think twice, do some research and if they are concerned about whether this occurred or not to contact police before sharing these posts.\u201d", "A Google News search for \u201cNorthgate Mall abduction,\u201d also reveals nothing akin to the viral story.", "The available data on child abductions further refutes the idea that strangers generally loom in public spaces in the hope of kidnapping children. In Canada and in the United States, the majority of child abductions are carried out by a child\u2019s relative.", "According to this data from Canada\u2019s National Centre for Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains, only 27 children were abducted by strangers out of 42,233 reports of missing minors in 2018. The report added\u00a0that 92 percent of missing minor reports were removed from the list within a week, and that 73 percent of cases are runaways.", "Abductions by strangers \u201care so rare that when they do happen, the impact is great and that\u2019s why people are so fearful of stranger abduction,\u201d Karen Chymy, director of operations for MissingKids.ca, a resource center for missing children, told AFP.", "AFP Fact Check has debunked similar stories, including false reports of thwarted abductions at Canada\u2019s Wonderland and of a child\u2019s abduction at an Ontario mall.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
