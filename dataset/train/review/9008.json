As a State Rep in 1978, @SherrodBrown voted for stricter removal standards and then enforced them as Secretary of State! #Hypocrites,\" the Ohio GOP tweeted June 12.", "Brown faces a re-election challenge from U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci.", "We found that Brown did vote for the law cited by the Ohio GOP, but the tweet miscasts Brown\u2019s longstanding policy on voter registration and takes the 1978 vote out of context.", "In 1977, Democrats, including Brown, passed Senate Bill 125, which set rules for voter registration statewide. At the time, many counties had no registration requirements. This bill specifically eliminated \"failure to vote as a reason for the cancellation of registration.\"", "That same year, Republicans got a constitutional amendment on the ballot that ended same-day registration and also stated if a person failed to vote at least once in four years, then the person must re-register.

Again, Brown voted in favor of this bill.", "We didn\u2019t find any evidence from 40 years ago explaining Brown\u2019s rationale at the time for voting for these bills.

Maddock said that Brown had to follow state law.", "But he did have the power to try to grow the voter rolls, so he circulated voter registration forms just about everywhere, which included convincing McDonald\u2019s to print voter registration forms on tray liners.", "Brown convinced other businesses, including banks, utilities and a telephone company, to mail out the registration forms. The state also distributed registration forms at welfare offices, lottery outlets and homeless shelters, in addition to public schools and government offices.", "\"If government can find you to make you pay taxes, if government can find you to draft you under the Selective Service System, then government can work a little harder to find you to register to vote,\" Brown said in 1988.", "The Washington Post wrote in 1985 that Ohio\u2019s registration activity was \"probably the most intensive and wide-ranging in the nation.\"", "The Republicans said that Brown enforced removal standards as secretary of state.
