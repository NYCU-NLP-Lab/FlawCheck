["Some Scranton, Pennsylvania, residents suffered a longer-than-expected wait to cast their votes due to issues with ballot-scanning machines on Election Day. Social media posts and reports from officials noted at least two incidents that delayed voters due to problems with\u00a0the machines.", "A video shared on the \u201cReal news for the people\u201d Facebook page at 2:04 p.m. Tuesday showed what appears to be a poll official addressing a crowd. He\u00a0informed\u00a0them that due to unspecified problems with machines, voters would have to utilize other options to\u00a0cast\u00a0ballots in Pennsylvania\u2019s general election.", "The social media post containing the video, titled \u201cBREAKING: Elections workers are now claiming voter machines are down in Scranton, Pennsylvania,\u201d was credited to Mike Coudrey.", "USA TODAY reached out to Real news for comment. The Facebook page said it had obtained the video from Coudrey's Twitter account.\u00a0USA TODAY has also reached out to Coudrey for comment. The video he posted on Twitter Tuesday afternoon has been viewed more than a million times.", "Fact check:Poll watcher turned away at Philadelphia polling station in misunderstanding", "In the video, the election official calls out \"9-1\" and \"9-2,\" apparently referencing Scranton polling districts 9-1 and 9-2. The building, later identified as the Scranton Cultural Center, was designated as the new polling location for those districts by the Lackawanna County Board of Elections during an Oct. 29 meeting.", "The original polling location for districts 9-1 and 9-2 was the United House Apartments, a senior living high rise which was damaged by an Oct. 25 fire that killed at least one resident and displaced over 100 others.", "In the video, the apparent official informs that crowd that they can either wait for the machines to be fixed, leave and return to vote later or fill out their ballot and place it in an emergency slot, where it could be scanned once the machines were operational.", "The crowd, including the person filming the video, expressed frustration with the delay. Numerous people interrupted the official\u2019s speech, provoking the man to shout,\u00a0\u201cMay I have your attention,\u201d in an attempt to control the unruliness.", "\u201cI\u2019m to just wait around and wait for these machines to be fixed, so that\u2019s what\u2019s possibly going on right now,\u201d the unidentified individual who filmed the video says at the start of the clip.", "Fact check:'Nothing wrong' with Kentucky county's voting Nov. 3, clerk says", "A Lackawanna County Department of Elections staff worker later stated that the problem was \u201cvery minor,\u201d and that it was \u201cresolved quickly.\u201d The worker acknowledged that the department had received calls regarding social media posts referencing the incident, but noted that the problem was only \u201ctemporary.\u201d", "Election officials could not confirm exactly how long the polling machines in the video were down, however, they agreed the outage in 9-1 and 9-2 was resolved quicker than a similar issue at Kennedy Elementary School, which housed\u00a0districts 20-2 and 20-3.", "According to Kathy Bufford, judge of electors at Kennedy Elementary School on the south side of Scranton, the issue stemmed from the polling location\u2019s two ballot-scanning machines having been programmed for the opposite district.", "Bufford said that the problem took an hour and half to figure out, and a technician from the Board of Elections eventually fixed the machines. However, one of the machines jammed on a paper ballot, resulting in further delays.", "Bufford said the site was not fully operational until 9:30 a.m., two-and-a-half hours after it was meant to open.", "Lackawanna County community affairs director Joseph D\u2019Arienzo later stated that the initial programming issue was resolved in 45 minutes.", "Despite the discrepancy between Bufford and\u00a0D\u2019Arienzo's timeline on the fix in districts 20-2 and 20-3, it's agreed upon that 9-1 and 9-2 were resolved more quickly.", "By the time the video was posted as \"BREAKING,\"\u00a0poll workers had resolved both issues hours before.\u00a0As of 5:30 p.m. Real news for the people had not posted an update about the fixed machines.", "In the early evening, Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti tweeted that precincts 20-2 and 20-3 would remain open until 8:45 p.m. on Tuesday to accommodate voters for the 45 minutes that the ballot scanners were down.", "Fact check:Bricks in Detroit are for construction projects, not to incite violence", "While voting machines did go down\u00a0in several polling districts in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the morning on Nov. 3, all machines were up and running in under 2.5 hours. A video\u00a0about the problem shared on Facebook that afternoon and labeling \"BREAKING\" was shared several hours after the issues were fixed. We rate this claim PARTLY FALSE because the timing of the post misrepresents when the issue occurred.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
