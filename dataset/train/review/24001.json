Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted a video that showed people being asked to locate any country on an unlabeled world map \u2014 with each person failing at that seemingly simple task:", "Cruz's added commentary in his tweet, which began with \"This is Bernie\u2019s base,\" implied \u2014 if not directly asserted \u2014 that the persons shown in the video were supporters of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders:", "This is Bernie\u2019s base \u2014 the same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great because free stuff is cool & they have no idea how many countries have tried it and utterly failed. The antidote: facts, truth & substance.", "However, the video tweeted by Cruz was taken from a comedy segment taped for the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\u201d late night talk show back in 2018, before Sanders entered the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. More important, as Kimmel himself stated in response to Cruz's tweet, the persons shown in the video were randomly selected off the street and were not identified as Democrats or Sanders supporters in the segment \u2014 no one involved with the show questioned them about, or was aware of, whatever political affiliations they might have held.", "Kimmel's crew then revisited that subject for his Feb. 26, 2020, show and compiled a clip of persons who explicitly identified themselves as Republicans (or as non-Sanders supporters) failing at the task of correctly identifying a single country on a world map:", "Dicker, Ron. \u00a0 \"Americans\u2019 Grasp of Geography Hits New Low (Trust Us) on \u2018Jimmy Kimmel Live.\u2019\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 HuffPost. \u00a0 13 July 2018.", "Moran, Lee. \u00a0 \"Jimmy Kimmel Asks Republicans To Name a Country on a Map and It Doesn\u2019t Go Well.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 HuffPost. \u00a0 27 February 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
