["\u201cTonight while I was in Missouri, Antifa scumbags came to our place in DC and threatened my wife and newborn daughter. They screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open our door,\u201d Hawley tweeted on the evening of January 4.", "The tweet was shared more than 71,000 times on Twitter, and as a screenshot on Facebook.", "Some websites amplified the senator\u2019s claims, including Gateway Pundit with the headline\u00a0 \u201cVIOLENT LEFTIST MOB Swarms and Attacks Senator Hawley\u2019s DC Home,\u201d and RF Angle with an article titled \u201cAntifa Attacks GOP Sen. Josh Hawley\u2019s Wife and Infant At Home.\u201d", "However, the claims vastly exaggerate the events of January 4.", "A group of about a dozen activists from the left-wing coalition group ShutDownDC gathered for a \u201cVigil for democracy\u201d in front of the senator\u2019s home in the Virginia town of Vienna, a suburb of Washington, DC, \u201caround 7:20 pm\u201d local time on January 4.", "\u201cWe walked very nicely down the sidewalk to his house. We had one megaphone, that\u2019s it,\u201d Nadine Bock, a member of ShutDownDC who took part in the vigil, told AFP by phone.", "\u201cWe chanted slogans around respecting the election, respecting democracy, following the constitution. We did not pound on his door,\u201d she added.", "Hawley\u2019s wife briefly came outside holding her baby, exchanged a few words with the protesters and went back inside. Bock said that protesters did not utter any threats, while Hawley said that they \u201cscreamed threats.\u201d", "Vigil attendees drew slogans with chalk on the sidewalk outside Hawley\u2019s home, and left a copy of the Constitution in front of the door.", "At 7:45 pm, three police officers arrived at the home, and found that \u201ceverything was pretty controlled,\u201d Vienna Police Department spokesman Juan Vazquez told AFP by phone.", "Vazquez said that the officers told the protesters they were violating town code and Virginia law about noise as well as picketing in front of someone\u2019s home. \u201cThey agreed to disperse within 15 minutes\u201d once they were told about the violations, Vazquez said. The protesters were only given a verbal warning before leaving.", "The entire event was streamed live on YouTube, and the footage corroborates Bock and Vazquez\u2019s versions.", "Hawley has been one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters in his refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election, which Democrat Joe Biden won.", "He was the first senator to say that he would object to the certification of the Electoral College votes on January 6. At least 12 Republican senators and 100 Republican\u00a0members of the House of Representatives joined opposition to the usually procedural count.", "The count was halted after Republican lawmakers contested the validity of the results. Not long after, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.", "ShutDownDC, which includes local anti-racist and environmentalist groups, embraced Hawley\u2019s characterization of the vigil attendees as \u201cAntifa,\u201d short for anti-fascist, a mostly unstructured ideology opposed to fascism online and in public spaces.", "The group\u2019s description came under intense public scrutiny during anti-racist protests across the US in 2020, leading Trump to vow to label Antifa a terrorist group despite its lack of organized chapters or coordinated activity.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
