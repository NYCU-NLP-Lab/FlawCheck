However, the diet won\u2019t affect cellular pH since pH is highly regulated by the cellular system. Viruses like SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID19, depends on cellular pH to reproduce. Certain drugs may affect cellular pH and therefore help in killing the virus but diet does not. Furthermore, the foods described in the rumour were not exactly alkaline. It is more important to eat healthy and balanced foods, and by doing so, it will help the body immunity.\u201d", "Associate Professor\u00a0Dr Chan Yoke Fun, a virologist and senior lecturer at the Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, told AFP by email on April 10, 2020 that consuming alkaline foods would have no impact on the virus if someone becomes infected with it. \u201cSARS-CoV-2 is extremely stable at pH 3 to 10 and will not be readily destroyed at those pH,\u201d she said. \u201cTherefore, if we are infected, the virus will still multiply despite whatever pH of food or water you consume.\"", "Dr Cory Couillard, a risk communication consultant from the WHO, also told AFP by email on April 17, 2020, that there is not\u00a0\u201csufficient data\u201d to prove \u201can alkaline diet can protect specifically against COVID-19 or not\u201d.", "\u201cHowever, eating a healthy and nutritious diet helps your immune system to function properly,\u201d he said. \u201cFruits and vegetables are an important part of eating healthy.
