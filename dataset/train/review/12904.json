["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on May 26, 2020", "President Donald Trump wrongly claimed that a House Democrat from Pennsylvania voted for Nancy Pelosi as House speaker after promising that he would not vote for her.", "In fact, Rep. Conor Lamb kept his promise. Lamb voted for Rep. Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts to be speaker.", "Lamb, a Marine and former federal prosecutor, won a close March 2018 special election in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District \u2014 a conservative-leaning district that Trump won by 20 percentage points in 2016. In November 2018, Lamb repeated his victory, winning a regular general election for a full two-year term in the newly constituted 17th district and helping the Democrats capture control of the House.", "Trump \u2014 who campaigned against Lamb in the 2018 special election, calling him \u201cLamb the Sham\u201d at one rally \u2014 reengaged with Lamb over the weekend.", "First, the president misspelled the Democrat\u2019s name \u2014 referring to him as \u201cConnor Lamm\u201d \u2014 in a tweet on May 25 that he later deleted. A day later, Trump sent up the same tweet with the correct spelling of Lamb\u2019s name, but with the same false claim about the Democrat voting for Pelosi to be speaker.", "Sean Parnell is an American Hero. Conor Lamb has proven to be an American fraud, and a puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi. He said he would NOT vote for her for Speaker, and did. Will kill 2A. Voted to impeach (on nothing). A TOTAL & COMPLETE Sean Parnell Endorsement! https://t.co/v1OnY0MI8m", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2020", "Lamb responded with a wordless tweet that \u2014 correctly \u2014 noted that he had in fact kept his promise with an image of a Jan. 3, 2019, headline that simply read, \u201cConor Lamb upholds promise not to vote Nancy Pelosi as speaker.\u201d", "pic.twitter.com/98E0p5TLlk", "\u2014 Conor Lamb (@ConorLambPA) May 25, 2020", "The story, which ran on the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\u2018s website TribLive.com, noted that Kennedy \u201ccampaigned in Western Pennsylvania for Lamb when he was running in a special election in early 2018 to replace Rep. Tim Murphy.\u201d Kennedy had received only one vote for speaker.", "Pelosi became speaker with 220 votes. Fifteen Democrats, including Lamb, didn\u2019t vote for her.", "As for the other claims in Trump\u2019s tweet, Lamb did vote to impeach the president on both articles of impeachment.", "But Trump spins the facts when he says Lamb will \u201ckill 2A,\u201d a reference to the Second Amendment.", "Lamb does support universal background checks \u2014 as most Americans do \u2014 for all firearm sales. But the Democrat also has voiced support for the Second Amendment. In a February 2019 press release, Lamb said:\u00a0\u201cWe all share the same goal to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them, while fully protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding, responsible Americans.\u201d", "The Cook Political Report rates Lamb as \u201clikely\u201d to win again in 2020.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
