We\u2019ve rated that claim False and Pants on Fire, depending on how he says it. Testing is a way to measure progress against the coronavirus, but the key indicator of progress is whether the percentage of tests that come back positive declines as more tests are done.", "With a positivity rate of about 7%, the United States ranks in the middle of the pack, doing better than countries such as Mexico and Argentina, but worse than just about every country in Europe, as well as Canada and Australia.", "Trump said that the United States\u2019 COVID-19 \"numbers are better than almost all countries.\" The White House pointed to one number to back that up \u2014 the number of deaths relative to the number of known cases. But the source it cited said that wasn\u2019t a good measure of the threat of the disease.", "By other yardsticks, the United States is doing worse than many countries, including many major developed economies.", "It has a higher death rate in relation to its population, the virus is known to have reached a larger share of the population, and the percentage of tests that come back positive is higher than in many other nations.", "We rate this claim False.", "FactBase, Donald Trump Delivers a Campaign Speech on the Economy in Wisconsin, Aug. 17, 2020", "Oxford University - Our World in Data, Case fatality rate, Aug. 18, 2020", "Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, Mortality analysis, Aug. 17, 2020", "Oxford University - Our World in Data, Coronavirus cases, Aug. 17, 2020", "Oxford University - Our World in Data, Share of positive tests, Aug. 17, 2020", "PolitiFact, Fact-checking Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Oshkosh, Aug. 17, 2020", "Statement, White House press office, Aug. 18, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
