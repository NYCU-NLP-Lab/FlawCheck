The posts at CountyNewsroom.info appear to exist to goad readers into clicking on them because a familiar county name is used.", "When users get to the site, however, pornographic malware can be downloaded onto their computers. We won\u2019t be linking to any of the stories for that reason.", "The site made a minimal attempt to look official, using the CountyNewsroom.info domain and listing the author of the posts as \"Police.\" The graphics used evoke breaking news from a real media outlet, and can change from post to post. Some of the articles have comments posted expressing sympathy for the victims, although it\u2019s not entirely clear if those comments are real or not.", "There is no contact information on the website, but it is registered to an administrator in Tbilisi, Georgia.

Their wives and children, aged 1, 3, 6, 7 and 12 years old, were trapped and died in the fire. The men were severely burned on their hands and faces trying to rescue their families, but had to be restrained by authorities.", "\"Words can\u2019t describe what that was like when we arrived on scene,\" a law enforcement official identified only as Officer Dan Williams was quoted in the posts. \"It was very horrific seeing them trying to get their families out, us trying to help get their families out. Like I said, the van went up in flames very, very quickly.\"", "The two men were airlifted to an unspecified hospital, the article said.", "While that particular accident is fake, the framework of the article has been taken from a real-life tragedy in June 2016 near Gorman, Calif. Some, but not all, of the details were changed.", "Two California men named Aaron Hon Wing Ng, 34, of San Francisco and Wei Xiong Li, 45, of Daly City were involved in a nighttime accident that happened as described in the fake post.
