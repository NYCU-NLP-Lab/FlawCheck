(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)", "State Treasurer John Chiang has made boosting California\u2019s supply of affordable housing a key talking point during his run for governor.", "Chiang, one of several Democratic candidates in the 2018 race, claimed at a recent campaign event in Santa Monica that he\u2019s helped greatly expand that supply.", "\"Since I\u2019ve been the state treasurer, we\u2019ve increased the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent,\" Chiang said in a Facebook live video on August 13, 2017, joined by Congressman Ted Lieu.", "Chiang made a similar assertion in a Facebook post one month later.", "California\u2019s struggle to build enough affordable housing is well documented:\u00a0Estimates place the state's affordable housing shortage at 1.5 million residences.", "We wanted to know, however, whether Chiang was right about the pace of this construction upswing\u00a0and whether he left anything out.", "We set out on a fact check.", "Our research", "Chiang took office as treasurer in January 2015.", "We asked his office for information supporting his statement about the 80 percent growth in construction since that time.", "It provided data showing the number of low-income housing units constructed -- or rehabilitated -- by developers receiving one of two types of federal tax credits.", "That combined number jumped from nearly 14,000 units in 2014 to about 25,500 in 2016 -- an increase of about 83 percent, which tracks with Chiang\u2019s statement.", "These tax credits are awarded by the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, headed by Chiang, and are a catalyst for building affordable housing.", "Matt Schwartz, president of the nonprofit California Housing Partnership, told us these credits are the driving force for as much as 95 percent of the state\u2019s affordable housing construction each year. One type can cover more than half the cost of developing a unit while the other can cover a quarter of the cost, Schwartz said.", "Schwartz clarified that these tax credits are only used on affordable rental properties.", "The treasurer\u2019s data seems like a fair starting point for tracking affordable housing construction.", "But given that some of the construction was for rehabilitation -- something Chiang did not make clear in his statement -- we wanted a deeper look at the data.", "How many rehabs?", "We found rehab projects accounted for more than half of the construction in 2014 and more than 60 percent of construction in 2016.", "\"Most of the rehabilitations are of existing affordable housing units. That\u2019s different than actually adding brand new units to the housing stock. That quote (from Chiang) is not spliced in a way that that\u2019s obvious,\" said Carol Galante, a professor of affordable housing at UC Berkeley.", "A treasurer\u2019s office fact sheet promotes the same 80 percent increase in affordable housing units, but clarifies that those are \"built or rehabilitated.\"", "SOURCE: California Treasurer's Office", "Not just a coat of paint", "Representatives for the treasurer told us they\u2019ve always interpreted the term \"building, construction\" as including both new and rehabilitated units.", "Mark Stivers, who heads the state tax credit allocation committee, said rehabs involve far more than \"just slapping paint\" on an old apartment. The use of the federal tax credit for rehabilitation, he said, locks in that unit at an affordable rate for 55 years through a deed restriction.", "Schwartz, of the nonprofit housing partnership, added that rehabilitation is a key part of preserving California\u2019s limited affordable housing stock.", "He added that Chiang has shown strong leadership in expanding affordable housing in the state.", "Our ruling", "California State Treasurer John Chiang recently claimed he\u2019s helped boost \"the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent\" since he took office in 2015.", "Data from the treasurer\u2019s office show an 83 percent increase in the construction -- and rehabilitation -- of affordable housing units from 2014 through 2016.", "But Chiang\u2019s claim omits the fact that less than half were new units added to the housing supply. The majority were rehabilitation projects on existing homes. Experts told us such improvements help preserve affordable housing, but don\u2019t necessarily expand it.", "A fact sheet on the treasurer\u2019s website gets the details right.", "But Chiang's statement in a campaign video and later in a Facebook post leave out this important context.", "For this reason, we rate Chiang\u2019s claim Half True.", "HALF TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.", "PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 California governor's race through\u00a0our Tracking The Truth series.", "Hear a claim you want fact-checked?
