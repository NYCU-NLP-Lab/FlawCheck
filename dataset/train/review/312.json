They also sent us material showing cuts that happened during the Obama-Biden administration.", "But Biden was talking about what Trump is proposing to do today, and the best place to resolve the accuracy of that lies in the latest budget documents.", "Based on a broad definition of support for local law enforcement, Biden has a point.", "At the Justice Department, support for state, local and tribal law enforcement flows through the Office of Justice Programs. Or, to be totally accurate, that\u2019s how the administration would like it to be after some program reshuffling.

In FY 2021, the Trump administration requested $1.51 billion \u2014 a reduction of $380 million.

That money wouldn\u2019t be needed in FY 2021.)", "In addition, the Trump budget proposed a separate $170 million cut and reorganization of a community policing initiative, Community Oriented Policing Services, that dates back to the days of President Bill Clinton.", "After all the moving around of programs, the net reduction is $515 million.

There is no question that Trump proposed a $170 million cut for the program that subsidizes community police initiatives, Community Oriented Policing Services. Beyond that, the Justice Department offers a wide range of programs.
