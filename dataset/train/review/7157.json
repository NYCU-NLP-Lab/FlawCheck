Who's with me!?", "Hehehehe", "While some forum members found this \"joke\" funny, others reported the meme to the FBI:", "Spreading instructions on public forums and social media sites to get people hurt is terrorism and will get you years in prison.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
