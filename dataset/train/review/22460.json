["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "A new Barack Obama\u00a0campaign video narrated by Tom Hanks portrays the president\u2019s bailout of General Motors and Chrysler as courageous and successful \u2014 with loans repaid by car companies.\n\n\"Because of the tough choices the president made, the stage was set for a resurgent U.S. auto industry,\" Hanks says in the 17-minute highlights reel of Obama\u2019s presidency, titled The Road We\u2019ve Traveled.\n\n\"With business booming, (GM and Chrysler) repaid their loans,\" he later concludes.\n\nIt\u2019s a claim we\u2019ve heard before from the CEOs of GM and Chrysler in 2010 and 2011. At the time, we rated their claims Half True.\n\nBut it\u2019s been months since we\u2019ve looked at this question, so we thought we\u2019d ask again.", "We\u2019re not checking the overall merit of the government\u2019s efforts to support the car companies, which relies on opinion. Instead, we\u2019re checking some of the facts marshaled by filmmakers. In another item, we checked whether auto bailout money had run out by the time Obama took office. We rated that Mostly True. And here we\u2019ll check whether GM and Chrysler \"repaid their loans\" from U.S. taxpayers.", "The bailouts\n\nWe reached out to the car companies, consulted a detailed accounting of Bush and Obama administration rescues kept by the Pulitzer-winning ProPublica, consulted the U.S. Treasury and reviewed other reports and fact-checks on this topic.\n\nThe story begins in late 2008, when the U.S. economy was crashing. By early December, GM and Chrysler told the government they couldn\u2019t get the credit they needed to survive, threatening more than 1 million jobs, according to a report from the\u00a0Congressional Oversight Panel.\n\nPresident George W. Bush\u2019s administration provided the auto companies with short-term funding from the Troubled Asset Relief Program \u2014 remember TARP? \u2014 support that was continued under Obama with additional loans that financed the companies\u2019 bankruptcy reorganizations.\n\nThe\u00a02009 report predicted, \"Although taxpayers may recover some portion of their investment in Chrysler and GM, it is unlikely they will recover the entire amount.\" In September 2011, the Treasury reported that it expected the auto bailouts to \"cost the taxpayer just under $24 billion.\"\n\nHow does this square with the statement that the companies have \"repaid their loans\"?\n\nSome government money was offered as loans \u2014 but much more was used to purchase stock. Meanwhile, during restructuring, GM and Chrysler were divided into \"old\" and \"new\" companies. And the car companies' consumer finance arms also received aid in the effort to avoid shutdowns.\n\nOur tally of ProPublica\u2019s work on\u00a0General Motors,\u00a0GMAC,\u00a0Chrysler\u00a0and\u00a0Chrysler Financial Services\u00a0shows that of $80 billion spent by taxpayers on the entire bailout, we\u2019re still waiting on nearly $40 billion, a number confirmed by the Treasury Department. At some point, selling taxpayers\u2019 stock in GM and GMAC may earn back a chunk of the rest. But all of it? The story\u2019s not over yet.", "What part of that was loans? Let's look at each automaker.\n\nChrysler\n\nThe government\u2019s bailout of \"Chrysler\" actually involved government infusions totaling more than $12 billion to three companies. One was the automaker prior to its bankruptcy reorganization, the old Chrysler. One was the reorganized company, Chrysler Group. And the third was the company that provided consumer auto loans, Chrysler Financial Services.\n\nJust two of the three have satisfied their government obligations. But the film's \"repaid\" rhetoric reflects solely the Chrysler Group \u2014 the new Chrysler. What\u2019s the larger story?\n\n\u2022 Since Chrysler Group LLC was formed in June 2009, it has repaid its U.S. loans of $5.1 billion \"in full, with interest, six years early,\" according to a fact-sheet from Katie Merx, financial communications manager for the reorganized company. \u00a0(The Treasury also says so.) Another chunk of money bought the government a small ownership stake in the new company, but that\u2019s already been bought by Fiat. So, the Chrysler Group, the entity that arose out of the bankruptcy, has repaid its loans and has shed government ownership.\n\n\u2022 Chrysler Financial Services, now TD Auto Finance, has paid off its loan of $1.5 billion \u2014 and taxpayers made $22 million on the deal, according to the Treasury Department and ProPublica.\n\n\u2022 But the amount taxpayers loaned to Chrysler before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 \u2014 the entity now dubbed \"Old Carco\" \u2014 was chalked up as a loss by the federal government. That\u2019s a $1.3 billion loan that will never be repaid. (The old company is still grinding through liquidation, but the government doesn\u2019t expect to collect any more.)\n\nSo, new Chrysler has \"repaid its loans,\" as has Chrysler Financial Services. But old Chrysler was lent $1.3 billion that won\u2019t be repaid. Even so, taxpayers have fared better than most folks thought \u2014 a government official suggested in 2009 that $7 billion might be lost.\n\nInstead, most taxpayer money has been restored, and the new company says it has added more than 9,000 jobs.\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nGM\u2019s story is even more dramatic.\n\nIts $67 billion bailout also involved three companies, the old GM, the GM that emerged out of bankruptcy reorganization and auto financing arm GMAC, which is now Ally Financial.\n\n\u2022 The new company received $6.7 billion in secured loans. In April 2010, GM repaid them with interest \u2014 and touted it had \"repaid our government loan, in full, with interest, five years ahead of the original schedule.\" But billions of dollars more had been converted to a 61 percent stake in the new company, said James Cain, financial news manager for GM. That stake is now down to 32 percent of the company\u2019s common stock. The question is how much that stock will earn taxpayers to offset $27 billion not yet recouped from old and new GM. A third of GM\u2019s entire stock value as of March 19, 2012, was just $13 billion. (Check its current market capitalization.)\n\n\u2022 The former GMAC still has substantial government ownership \u2013 more than 70 percent of its common stock is held by taxpayers, according to the Treasury Department \u2014\u00a0but no loans. According to ProPublica, there\u2019s more than $11 billion left on the GMAC ledger. So it\u2019s not yet clear how taxpayers will fare.\n\n\u2022 Old GM got nearly $1 billion in loans, and the Treasury Department has so far squeezed $136 million out of the company as it is liquidated in bankruptcy court. But it\u2019s not clear how much taxpayers will ultimately recoup.\n\nGM has certainly used the reboot to roar back into the marketplace. Its sales, along with those of its Chinese affiliates, were No. 1 in the world in 2011. (Aided the fact that its main competitor, Toyota, grappled with an earthquake, tsunami and floods.) But we\u2019re not measuring the bailout\u2019s success \u2014 merely the question of loan repayment.\n\nAs with Chrysler, new GM has repaid its \"loans,\" while old GM may fail to repay $850 million. Unlike Chrysler, the government still owns a third of GM and more than 70 percent of the former GMAC \u2014 stock that taxpayers can hope will one day earn enough to make them whole.", "Our ruling\n\nSo the Obama campaign is echoing a claim from GM and Chrysler that the auto companies \"repaid their loans.\" But for both companies, that\u2019s some careful framing that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Loans represent about 20 percent of the bailout. Meanwhile, the statement is only fully true of the new automakers. A look at the entire bailout shows loans to the old car companies that may never be repaid, plus outstanding stock investments in GM and the former GMAC.", "The new companies, which got about 85 percent of the loans, have repaid them all.", "In our lengthy discussions about this claim, we considered everything from Mostly True to Mostly False. We\u2019re not weighing Obama\u2019s courage or the bailout\u2019s success. We can say the claim the current companies \"repaid their loans\" is accurate but leaves out important details and context. On the larger bailout, it\u2019s too early to say how taxpayers will make out. This statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate the claim Half True.", "Obama for America, \"The Road We've Traveled,\" March 15, 2012, via YouTube\n\nEmail interview with Kara Carscaden, deputy press secretary, Obama campaign, March 16, 2012\n\nEmail interview with James Cain, manager, financial news, General Motors Co., March 16, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Katie Merx, financial communications manager, Chrysler Group, March 16, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Matt Anderson, spokesman for Treasury Department, March 20, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Troy Gravitt, director of communications, Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, March 21, 2012\n\nInterview with Paul Kiel, lead bailout reporter for ProPublica, March 16, 2012\n\nInterview with Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman for\u00a0Edmunds.com, March 21, 2012\n\nCongressional Oversight Panel, \"September Oversight Report: The Use of TARP Funds in the Support and Reorganization of the Domestic Automotive Industry,\"\u00a0Sept. 9, 2009\n\nPolitiFact, \"CEO says GM has repaid government loans in full,\" April 27, 2010 (Half True)\n\nPolitiFact, \"Are auto companies paid up with American taxpayers?\" May 26, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, \"CEO says Chrysler Group is now square with the American taxpayer,\" May 26, 2011 (Half True)\n\nFactCheck.org, \"Chrysler Paid in Full?\" June 6, 2011\n\nFactCheck.org, \"Romney Wrong on Deficits, Auto Bailout,\" June 9, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, \"President Barack Obama says that after bailout, GM is now the world's top automaker,\" Jan. 25, 2012\n\nAssociated Press, \"FACT CHECK: An Obama campaign film comes with some fiction; GOP rivals stretch energy claims,\" March 16, 2012, via Washington Post\n\nProPublica, \"Automotive Industry Financing Program,\" accessed March 16, 2012\n\nProPublica, Eye on the Bailout: Auto Companies, accessed March 16, 2012", "ProPublica,\u00a0Eye on the Bailout: Auto Companies: Chrysler, accessed March 16, 2012", "ProPublica,\u00a0Eye on the Bailout: Auto Companies: Chrysler Financial Services, accessed March 16, 2012", "ProPublica, Eye on the Bailout: Auto Companies: General Motors, accessed March 16, 2012", "ProPublica,\u00a0Eye on the Bailout: Auto Companies: GMAC (now Ally Financial), accessed March 16, 2012", "ProPublica, \"Gov\u2019t official suggests much of Chrysler loan won\u2019t be repaid,\" May 7, 2009", "Treasury Department, Initiatives: Financial Stability: Programs, accessed March 19, 2012\n\nTreasury Department, \"Office of Financial Stability \u2014 Troubled Asset Relief Program: Fiscal Year 2011,\" accessed March 19, 2012\n\nTreasury Department, \"Daily TARP Update,\" March 16, 2012\n\nTreasury Department, \"Chrysler Repays Outstanding TARP Loans,\" May 24, 2011\n\nTreasury Department, \"Treasury Exits Investment in Chrysler Group LLC,\" July 21, 2011\n\nOffice of the Special Inspector General, Troubled Asset Relief Program, Quarterly Report to Congress, April 20, 2009\n\nOffice of the Special Inspector General, Troubled Asset Relief Program, GMAC letter to SIGTARP, June 2, 2009\n\nOffice of the Special Inspector General, Troubled Asset Relief Program, \"Additional insight on use of Troubled Asset Relief Program funds,\" Dec. 10, 2009\n\nOffice of the Special Inspector General, Troubled Asset Relief Program, Quarterly Report to Congress, Jan. 26, 2012\n\nNew York Times, \"U.S. Agrees to a Stake in GMAC,\" Dec. 29, 2008\n\nNew York Times, \"GM gets first part of government bailout,\" Jan. 1, 2009\n\nABC World News, \"General Motors Pays Back $8 Billion to Taxpayers Ahead of Schedule,\" April 21, 2010\n\nAssociated Press via ABC News, \"Chrysler to Sever US Government Ties,\" June 3, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
