During an Aug. 8 interview on WRVA Radio in Richmond, he was dismissive of calls for stronger background checks\u00a0in the wake of fatal mass shootings this year in Virginia and other states.", "\"Criminals don\u2019t go through background checks,\" he said. \"I think it\u2019s like 3% go through a background check - 3%. Ninety-seven percent get the guns on the street.\"", "We fact-checked Van Cleave\u2019s claim.", "Democrats in Virginia\u2019s General Assembly and in Congress are calling for tighter background checks. Virginia and federal laws require all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling firearms - to run computerized checks to see if buyers have disqualifying criminal or mental health records. But gun sales between individuals not in the business - say, neighbors or hobbyists - are exempt.", "President Donald Trump has recently said he supports stronger background checks, but has not specified what changes he favors.", "Van Cleave told us his 3% statistic comes from a 2016 survey of 24,848 state and federal prisoners by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. The bureau reported its findings in January 2019.", "Of the inmates, 21% said they used or possessed a firearm while committing the crime that put them in prison, or about 5,200 of the sample, according to our calculation (the study did not break down its percentages into numbers of inmates). Of the prisoners\u00a0who used or possessed a gun during the crime:", "Now, let\u2019s focus on the 10% who bought their guns from a retailer. They\u2019re important because the researchers identify them as the prisoners who were likely to have taken criminal background checks before they got their guns.", "Of that group of about 520 retail buyers, around 360 - or 69% - said they bought the gun using their own name. And about 350 of the retail buyers - or 67% - said they underwent a background check using their real name. (The survey doesn\u2019t cite reasons why they passed the check, but perhaps they didn\u2019t have criminal records at the time).", "Here\u2019s another way of expressing the finding: About 350 of 5,200 inmates who possessed or used a gun during their crime - or 6.7% - said they went through a background check, using their real name.", "Our ruling", "Van Cleave said, \"Criminals don\u2019t go through (gun) background checks. I think it\u2019s like 3% go through a background check.\"", "He was referring to results from a 2016 survey of 24,848 state and federal inmates by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. About 5,200 of the prisoners said they possessed or used a firearm during their crime. Of that armed group, about 350 - or 6.7 percent - said they went through a background check to get the\u00a0gun.", "Van Cleave slightly understates the percentage of gun-toting criminals who went through background checks, but the gist of his claim - that very few of them did - is sound.", "We rate his statement Mostly True.", "Philip Van Cleave, Interview on WRVA Radio (-2:50 mark), Aug. 8, 2019.", "Van Cleave, email, Aug. 8, 2019.", "Bureau of Justice Statistics, \"Source and Use of Firearms Involved in Crimes: Survey of Prison Inmates, 2016,\" January 2019.", "National Rifle Association, \"Background checks: No impact on criminals,\" Jan. 11, 2019.", "Giffords Law Center, Background Checks, accessed Aug. 12, 2019.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
