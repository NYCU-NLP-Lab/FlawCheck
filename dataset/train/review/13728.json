Violators face a maximum 10 years in prison and $2,500 fine.", "Lucas\u2019 bill would also make it a felony for people to gather \"with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons by drilling, parading, or marching with any firearm, any explosive or incendiary device, or any components or combination thereof.\" It comes after the August 2017 white supremicist rally in Charlottesville\u00a0that left one counterprotestor dead and others injured.", "Adams wrote that the bill, in addition to banning a father from teaching his son how to hunt with a rifle, \"would also criminalize all firearms training classes, including concealed carry classes.\"", "He added, \"The law would instantly transform all martial arts instructors into criminal felons.\"", "In fact, the legislation would do none of these things.", "Lucas\u2019 bill, as we noted, adds to the list of illegal acts and Virginia\u2019s paramilitary laws.
