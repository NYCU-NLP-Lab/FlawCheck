["Congressional redistricting in Ohio has turned two veteran incumbents from the same side of the aisle, Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich, into Democratic primary opponents in the new 9th District.\n\nEach has a long record to boast, or defend, in what amounts to a fight for survival -- as shown by a 30-second TV ad for Kaptur that Kucinich says misrepresented his voting record on job creation, veterans' care and prescription drug benefits for seniors.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio previously looked at two of the claims -- \"When Marcy Kaptur brought home $42 million for new manufacturing jobs, Dennis Kucinich voted no\" \u00a0and \"When Kaptur helped get $15 billion more for veterans care, Kucinich voted no.\" We rated both Half True.\n\nNow we'll look at a third statement: \"When Kaptur fought for the Democrats' prescription drug benefit for seniors, Kucinich voted no.\"\n\nThe ad cites as its source the role call vote on the Stenholm Amendment to Congressional Resolution 290 of March 23, 2000.\n\nYes, that is 2000.\n\nBill Clinton was in the White House, John McCain had just ceded the race for the Republican presidential nomination to George W. Bush, anxiety over Y2K had passed, unemployment was at 4 percent and the federal budget showed a surplus.\n\nMuch credit for the latter was claimed by a Republican congressman named John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee. Now Ohio's governor, he was bringing his last budget resolution to the floor -- and, touching on a topic raised frequently in more than 14 hours of debate, promising a prescription drug plan for seniors by the end of the year.\n\nAccording to the Kaptur campaign, Kucinich voted against the prescription drug plan offered by conservative Democrats in their alternative budget proposal, the Stenholm Amendment, at a time \"when there was no alternative with a chance.\"\n\nKucinich voted for another Democratic plan that failed. He would have considered the Stenholm plan a \"halfway measure,\" Kaptur's campaign spokesman said -- \"He wanted the perfect, not the good.\"\n\nKucinich's campaign answered that he voted against the Stenholm Amendment advanced by \"Blue Dog\" Democrats \"because it it also included about $4 billion more in military spending than even the Republicans had proposed.\n\n\"He supported and voted for the budget plan advanced by the Democratic leadership of the House, which included $40 billion over fiscal years 2001 through 2005 and $155 billion through fiscal year 2010 for a Medicare prescription drug benefit and premium and cost-sharing protections,\" Kucinich's campaign spokesman added. Kaptur, incidently, also voted for that plan.\n\nIn fact, the House considered and rejected five budget proposals before passing the resolution offered by Kasich, according to the Congressional Record's account of floor proceedings and the Congressional Research Service:", "Both voted against the budget resolution advanced by Kasich, which passed 211-207.\n\nThat brings us back to the claim in the ad: \"When Kaptur fought for the Democrats' prescription drug benefit for seniors, Kucinich voted no.\"\n\nWe think that claim isn\u2019t accurate on a number of counts.\n\nKucinich did in fact vote no when Kaptur voted yes on one budget proposal. But labeling that proposal as \"the Democrats\u2019 prescription drug benefit for seniors\" is inaccurate. It was one of four Democratic proposals and not leadership\u2019s plan (which Kucinich and Kaptor both supported. \u00a0\n\nIt is misleading to imply that Kucinich\u2019s no vote was a vote against a prescription benefit. His vote came on a resolution encompassing the entire $1.8 trillion federal budget that contained, among many things, the prescription benefit Kaptur\u2019s ad cites..\n\nUltimately, a dozen years later, the question of whether the plan Kaptur\u2019s ad touts was better is moot. The Spratt Amendment supported by both Kucinich and Kaptur actually won more votes than the Blue Dog proposal that Kaptur backed but Kucinich opposed, but neither was going to win passage \u00a0from the House's Republican majority.\n\nWe rate Kaptur\u2019s ad claim False.", "The Plain Dealer, \"Tension between congressional candidates Kucinich, Kaptur on full display at City Club debate,\" Feb. 20, 2012\n\nMarcy Kaptur campaign, \"No,\" Feb. 20, 2012\n\nEmail from Andy Juniewicz, spokesman for the Dennis Kucinich campaign, \u00a0Feb. 19, 2012\n\nEmail from Steve Fought, spokesman for the Marcy Kaptur campaign, Feb. 21 and 22, 2012\n\nCongressional Research Service, \"Appropriations for FY2001: An Overview,\" Sept. 22, 2000\n\nCongressional Record, V. 146, Pt. 3, pp. 3438-3557, March 23, 2000\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population 16 years and over, 1977 to date, accessed Feb. 29, 2011\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, month-by-month unemployment statistics from 2000 to present, accessed Feb. 29, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
