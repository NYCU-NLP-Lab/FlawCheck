["The November 1, 2019,\u00a0post from a Facebook page called Blue Millennials says: \u201cAfter cutting $1.4 trillion in taxes for the super rich, Republicans just admitted they will not be funding the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which provides care for 9 million children.\u201d", "Below is a screenshot of the misleading post:", "The post originated from a Facebook page called Occupy Democrats, which states on its profile that\u00a0its mission is to \u201cdefeat President Trump\u2019s supermajority in 2018 and send him packing in 2020.\u201d", "The Occupy Democrats page shared the meme on December 20, 2017.\u00a0When the meme was originally posted, federal funding for CHIP had expired on September 30, 2017 --\u00a0the first time since the program\u2019s 1997 creation.", "However, the post making the claim in 2019 is false; bills passed in the months following the lapse of the federal funding for CHIP\u00a0secured funding for the program through to September 30, 2027.", "CHIP,\u00a0created in 1997,\u00a0covers services including routine checkups and immunizations\u00a0for eligible children in the US.", "The program is funded jointly by the federal government and state governments.", "On September 30, 2017, federal funding for CHIP expired\u00a0for the first time since the program's launch in 1997.", "On January 22, 2018, Congress approved a temporary funding bill that ended a three-day government shutdown. Part of that continuing resolution extended funding for CHIP.", "On February 9, 2018, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, further extending funding for CHIP. Through the Helping Ensure Access for Little Ones, Toddlers, and Hopeful Youth by Keeping Insurance Delivery Stable (HEALTHY KIDS) Act and the Advancing Chronic Care, Extenders, and Social Services (ACCESS) Act, CHIP is currently funded through to\u00a0September 30, 2027.", "Those bills changed certain requirements for CHIP put into place under the Affordable Care Act\u00a0(ACA).", "The ACA had provided states with extra funding\u00a0to help pay for CHIP. This\u00a0federal matching rate\u00a0decreased on October 1, 2019. States are now responsible for about a third of the cost of the program, with the federal government paying the remainder, according to University of Southern California (USC)\u00a0health policy researcher Dr.\u00a0Gregory Stevens.", "The ACA also included a \"maintenance of effort\" provision,\u00a0according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. That provision\u00a0required states to maintain their existing income eligibility and enrollment standards for CHIP.", "However, starting in October 2019,\u00a0states are only required to offer CHIP coverage to children living at or below 300 percent of the\u00a0federal poverty line. In 2019, this is an annual income of $75,250\u00a0for a family of four in all states and the District of Columbia,\u00a0except Hawaii or Alaska.", "Thirteen states, including Alabama, New York and Pennsylvania, which\u00a0had more generous eligibilty\u00a0standards for CHIP,\u00a0are now allowed to tighten the pool of eligible children to only those living at or below 300 percent of the federal poverty line if they choose to do so.", "This could result in a reduction in the number of children covered but Dr. Stevens told AFP by email, \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a relatively small number of children, in part because of the populations of the states that are included in that 13, but also because children above 300 percent were a small portion of CHIP to begin with.\u201d", "This search of bills proposed in the 116th Congress (2019-2020) does not show any legislation attempting to end funding for CHIP.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
