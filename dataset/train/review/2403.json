In reality, the image showed a helicopter spraying hot water. It was taken years ago in Sweden.", "As Fox News broadcasters pushed the misleading narrative that frozen wind turbines were to blame for Texas\u2019 crippled energy system, Fox Nation host Lara Logan suggested that fossil fuels were coming to the rescue. Helicopters, she claimed, were spraying turbines with oil to defrost them.", "\"The reality is here that you\u2019re flying helicopters, using fossil fuels, to put oil on wind turbines to defrost them,\" Logan said Feb. 19 on the Fox News program \"Outnumbered.\"", "Logan\u2019s claim echoed online rumors, widely debunked, that claimed a photo showed a helicopter spraying chemicals on a frozen wind turbine in Texas.", "\"Oh the irony,\" said one of many Facebook posts sharing the photo. The post featured a screenshot of a tweet that read: \"A helicopter running on fossil fuel spraying a chemical made from fossil fuels onto a wind turbine made with fossils fuels during an ice storm is awesome.\"", "The photo, from years ago, actually shows a helicopter defrosting a turbine with hot water in Sweden. \"This is our helicopter back in 2015,\" Mats Widgren of Alpine Helicopters, the Swedish company responsible for the photo, told the Associated Press.", "The same photo appeared in Swedish news articles from that year, and also in two separate Alpine Helicopters presentations on airborne de-icing methods for wind turbines. The Swedish company heated the water with an oil burner, but it did not spray chemicals.", "Despite those facts, social media posts claiming the photo showed Texas spread widely. They were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But PolitiFact found no proof that such a practice was taking place in Texas.", "Fox News did not offer comment for this fact-check.", "A spokesperson for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages more than 90% of the state\u2019s electric load, said she had not heard of such rumors until PolitiFact reached out.", "While frozen wind turbine blades can be manually de-iced, the extreme weather would have made it difficult to do so in Texas, where several airports were closed during the storm, said Jim Krane, an energy studies fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute.", "\"No one I\u2019ve asked in the Texas wind industry has heard of any aircraft de-icing of wind turbine blades,\" said Krane, who recently wrote about the need to winterize Texas\u2019 energy system.", "\"Most wind turbines here don\u2019t have any de-icing equipment, since it\u2019s rare to have need for them here,\" added Daniel Cohan, an associate professor in civil and environmental engineering at Rice University, and a colleague of Krane\u2019s.", "RWE Renewables Americas operates more than a dozen wind farms in Texas. Its Roscoe Wind Farm, a few hours west of Fort Worth, has more than 600 turbines.", "The company said Feb. 18 that icing and grid issues put part of its onshore wind fleet out of service. But spokesperson Matt Tulis denied using helicopters in the way Logan described.", "\"We are not using helicopters to spray oil on our turbines to defrost them,\" Tulis told PolitiFact. \"We don\u2019t apply any kind of de-icing agent to the turbine or turbine blades.\"", "Turbines in places that regularly see low temperatures are often designed to withstand the cold. Some have ice-resistant coatings or heaters built into the blades.", "Those technologies used elsewhere in the world allow wind turbines to produce electricity at temperatures as low as 22 degrees below zero, Krane and his colleagues at the Baker Institute wrote for Forbes. But they make turbines pricier.", "Manual de-icing, which can be done by aircraft-based sprayers or by technicians who climb up the turbine towers, can involve chemicals, Krane and his team wrote in the article.", "After a rare blast of Arctic air hit Texas, Fox News hosts repeatedly claimed\u00a0that frozen wind turbines were solely or mostly to blame for\u00a0the power outages around the state.
