["About this rating", "On 13 January 2016 the military satire site Duffel Blog published an article titled \"Pentagon Spends $10 Million On Powerball Tickets With Hopes Of Bolstering F-35 Program,\" initially asserting:", "The Department of Defense\u00a0announced today that it\u00a0has\u00a0purchased five million Powerball tickets at a cost of $2\u00a0per ticket, with an aim of providing a funding windfall to the F-35\u00a0Joint Strike Fighter\u00a0program.", "\u201cThis is a minor fiscal gamble, but the Pentagon is always willing to lay out a few extra bucks in order to ensure we continue to have the most advanced military in the world,\u201d said Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, flashing a giddy smile. \u201cDaddy needs a new pair of shoes, and a dozen new F-35s for the Navy\u2019s Pacific Fleet.\u201d", "Satirical elements of the piece were far more apparent as the article continued:", "A reporter brought to Carter\u2019s attention that the jackpot only totals $1.5 billion dollar jackpot if the Pentagon elects\u00a0to take the annuity paid out over 29 years, and the\u00a0alternative lump sum payment would amount to\u00a0less than $900 million.", "\u201cWell, shit,\u201d said Carter. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense in taking a 29-year annuity when the F-35 will be obsolete by that time and on the auction block to Iran and Saudi Arabia. But the lump sum payment would still buy three or four\u00a0F-35s today, I believe.\u201d", "The reporter then pointed out the IRS would take almost half of the lump sum payout, leaving the Pentagon with around $500 million. They\u00a0also noted the Navy\u2019s F-35C variant costs $337 million per unit, leaving the Pentagon able to buy less than two F-35s for the Navy.", "\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you guys would even question this,\u201d said a visibly frustrated Carter. \u201cThat would still be two more F-35s than we had previously, with a capital\u00a0expenditure of only\u00a0ten million dollars in Powerball tickets.\u00a0That\u2019s a steal.\u201d", "Duffel Blog's \"About\" page is written in a similar style, subtly referencing the fact that its content isn't meant to be taken seriously. However, unlike most self-described \"satire\" sites, Duffel Blog aimed to amuse, not confuse, readers:", "Since 1797, Duffel Blog has been serving the men and women of the American military with insightful commentary and hard-hitting journalism.
