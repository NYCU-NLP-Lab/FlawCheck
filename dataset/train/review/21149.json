She received one contribution \u2014 $2,300 in 2007 \u2014 from one family member.", "The opioid addiction crisis, along with the billions earned by the maker of OxyContin, are being invoked in a race that could help determine whether Republicans keep control of the U.S. Senate.", "The target is four-term GOP incumbent Susan Collins of Maine.

One provision in that law aims to hold drug distributors and manufacturers accountable for stopping delivery of drugs on suspiciously high orders by pharmacies and stopping the diversion of drugs.
