["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "\"A billion here, a billion there,\" goes a quip about federal spending that's often attributed to the late Sen. Everett Dirksen, \"and pretty soon you're talking real money.\"\n\nPretty soon, or eventually, you're talking trillions -- which is what the national debt reached in the 1980s, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nOn Sept. 4, 2012, the accumulated debt topped $16 trillion.\n\nLooking to put perspective on the size of what he called \"a dangerous milestone,\" Sen. Rob Portman released a list of things the money could do.\n\nFor example, he said, it's \"enough to buy both the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds 1,918 times.\"\n\nAs fans of baseball, as well as fact checking, PolitiFact Ohio decided to see if Portman\u2019s quip was fair or foul.\n\nWe checked with his staff, and they referred us to Forbes, which is famous for its money-related lists. Among them is its compilation of Major League Baseball team values. We dug in.\n\nThe Indians were ranked 26th of the 30 teams -- below Toronto and above Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Tampa Bay and Oakland -- with a value of $410 million.\n\nThe Reds were ranked 24th, with a current value of $424 million.\n\nAt the top end, by the way, were the Yankees at $1.8 billion, followed by the Dodgers at $1.4 billion and the Red Sox at $1 billion.\n\nWith pencil and paper in hand, we checked the math.\n\nWith a combined value of $834 million, by our calculation, the Tribe and the Reds could be bought 19,184 times for $16 trillion -- 10 times more than Portman\u2019s release claimed. Unless, of course, the Dolan family and Bob Castellini, owners of the Indians and the Reds, respectively, \u00a0held out for more.\n\nWhile we were at it, we wondered how football would rate, because Forbes also compiled a list of NFL team values.\n\nThey ranked the Cleveland Browns 21st of the 32 franchises at $987 million, which Forbes called \"the present value of the transaction\" in which Jimmy Haslam is buying the team from Randy Lerner for $1.05 billion.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals were 26th, at $871 million.\n\nSixteen trillion would cover the $1.858 billion combined price of the Browns and Bengals 8,611 times.\n\nWith that, let\u2019s check the score.\n\nPortman\u2019s staff readily acknowledged their their baseball calculation error when we pointed out the lowball estimate. Somewhere in the proccess they dropped a zero. (For the record, 16 trillion has 12 zeroes, which was more than our pocket calculator could handle.)\n\nBut Portman's point was that $16 trillion is a whopping amount of money, and on that count he is accurate\n\nWhether it matches the value of the two baseball franchises 1,918 times or 19,184 times, it\u2019s still a whopping amount of money. Correcting the math error only makes that point more forcefully.\n\nAnother way to look at it is he was correct in saying that you could, theoretically, buy the Indians and the Reds 1,980 times with $16 trillion -- but you'd still have $14.3 trillion left to play with.\n\nThat\u2019s additional information that provides clarification.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly True.", "Sen.
