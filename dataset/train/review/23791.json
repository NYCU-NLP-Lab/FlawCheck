Biden owns two homes and had some lucrative years in the private sector.", "Trump also falsely claimed Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, and his running mate, Kamala Harris, didn\u2019t send\u00a0him best wishes when he was stricken with COVID-19. They did.", "Trump, Oct, 15: And then you look at the way Joe Biden lives. He lives on a politician\u2019s salary for his whole life. 47 years, right? And he lives in these beautiful houses all over the place. I haven\u2019t seen him, but he\u2019s a politician and you\u2019re not supposed to live like you\u2019ve made $20 million a year. So he\u2019s corrupt as hell and everyone knows it.", "It is true that Biden, who has long cited his middle-class identity and his roots in working-class Scranton, Pennsylvania, has had a long career in public life. The Delaware Democrat was elected to the U.S. Senate at age 29 in 1972, and served until January 2009, when he began the first of two terms as vice president. He left office in January 2017 and has found some lucrative opportunities since, as many political figures do after they leave government work.", "In August 2019, Forbes estimated that Biden and his wife Jill were worth $9 million. The magazine said their wealth included two Delaware homes valued at $4 million combined, cash and investments worth around $4 million, and a federal pension worth more than $1 million.", "The magazine said that when Biden stepped down as vice president, he filed a financial disclosure form listing assets and liabilities worth somewhere between negative $897,000 and positive $489,000. But over the next 23 months, according to Forbes, citing tax filings, the couple made $15 million.", "Forbes said Joe Biden received $2.4 million in speaking fees and $1.8 million from book tour events.

The Washington Post detailed Biden\u2019s post-government income in a June 2019 story on how he \u201creaped millions in income since leaving the vice presidency.\u201d", "While Trump is right that Biden spent many years on a government salary, the former vice president has had some very lucrative years in the private sector. Biden doesn\u2019t have houses \u201call over the place.\u201d He has two, including a vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. And there is no evidence he earned money through any kind of corruption.", "At the rally, Trump also referred to the fact that the Biden campaign had announced on Oct. 15 that Harris\u2019 communications director and a member of her flight crew had tested positive for COVID-19. Harris canceled her campaign travel through Oct. 18 as a result.", "Trump, Oct. 15: But we worry about [Harris]. I\u2019m very concerned about her, because as you probably just heard just before I walked out, two of the people that travel with her, her chief of staff and somebody else in the plane with her all the time, they have been tested positive for COVID- 19. So we extend our best wishes, right? Right? Yes? We extend our best wishes. We extend our best, which is more than they did to me. But that\u2019s OK. That\u2019s OK.", "In fact, both Biden and Harris had made the gesture. Harris did so via Twitter on Oct. 2, the same day Trump revealed he and the first lady had tested positive, wishing the president and First Lady Melania Trump \u201ca full and speedy recovery.\u201d", "Doug and I join Joe Biden and Dr. Biden in wishing President Trump and the First Lady a full and speedy recovery.
