Burke was defeated by Republican Gov. Scott Walker.", "Campaigning for Mary Burke in Milwaukee on Oct. 24, 2014, Bill Clinton reflected on his presidency, sizing it up against Ronald Reagan's.", "\"The thing I'm proudest of was that, as compared with President Reagan's term, we created 45 percent more jobs,\" Clinton said during a speech for Burke, who 10 days later lost her bid to unseat Gov. Scott Walker.", "He continued:", "\"But 100 times -- listen to this -- 100 times as many people worked their way from poverty into the American middle class. That\u2019s the way this economy should work.\"", "Clinton made the same claim a month earlier on CNN.", "One-hundred times as many? Now, that\u2019s a statistic begging to be checked.", "Background on the issue", "Clinton, a Democrat,\u00a0was elected in November 1992 and served two terms, from January 1993 to January 2001.", "Reagan, a Republican, was elected in November 1980 and also served eight years, from January 1981 to January 1989.", "Clinton\u2019s spokesman cited census figures showing that there was a net decrease of nearly 7.7 million people living in poverty from 1993 to 2000.
