Kim Reynolds would divert money from public school systems that need it now more than ever.", "The push comes after Reynolds highlighted school choice in January during her\u00a0Condition of the State Address. She argued that parents need flexibility when deciding where their children go to school, especially during a pandemic, but also because available services might vary dramatically from one public school district to another.", "\"School choice shouldn\u2019t be limited to those who have the financial means or are lucky to live in a district that\u2019s confident enough to allow open enrollment,\" Reynolds said during her Jan. 12 address.", "Republicans quickly announced their support and the\u00a0Iowa Senate\u00a0passed\u00a0SF 159\u00a0on Thursday, Jan. 28. The Iowa State Education Association, a prominent Iowa teachers\u2019 union, launched a\u00a0campaignagainst the bill and the\u00a0Iowa-Nebraska NAACP\u00a0argued that it disproportionately would disadvantage low-income families of color while hampering desegregation efforts.", "Another opponent was\u00a0Christina Blackcloud, a Democratic activist from Tama, Iowa, who lost a bid last fall to unseat state Rep.

To answer that, we followed the money.", "The Iowa bill would give financial aid for private school tuition and other education costs to a student who otherwise would attend a public school determined by the federal\u00a0Every Student Succeeds Act\u00a0as needing \"comprehensive support and improvement.\" The private school also would have to accept the student for enrollment.", "The financial aid would come from a Student First Scholarship Program that the bill would establish. That program would be funded by depositing into an account created for a student opting to attend a private school a portion of the per-pupil state funding that youth\u2019s school district would have received to educate the student.", "A\u00a0report\u00a0from the state\u2019s Legislative Services Agency estimates that Iowa\u2019s public school districts would lose $2.1 million that is diverted to private schools in 2023 if the governor\u2019s plan passes.", "The state money is raised through a combination of sources, including property taxes. The bill limits spending that money to \"qualified educational expenses,\" which include tuition but also fees for tests such as advanced placement exams.", "Students opting out of their local public school could use state money to attend either private schools or charter schools. But those schools may or may not be considered corporations.", "Technically,\u00a0corporations\u00a0are a group of individuals legally allowed to act as a single entity, and both public school districts and public charter schools are referred to as corporations in\u00a0Iowa law.

She declined to clarify what she meant when describing private and charter schools as \"corporations.\"", "Charter schools\u00a0are privately run, publicly funded schools. Many are managed by outside organizations, which the Iowa bill calls \"education service providers,\" that can be both for-profit and not-for-profit.

The other 65 percent are independently managed.", "In general, though, there\u2019s no indication of how many charter schools in Iowa would be run by for-profit companies if Reynolds\u2019 plan passes, especially as the plan would make forming charter schools much easier. That holds true for private schools as well.", "Blackcloud said, \"The school voucher bill that Republicans are trying to ram through the Iowa Legislature would give your education tax dollars to corporations in the hopes they will magically fix education.\" In its current form, SF 159 reallocates money that normally would be spent in public school systems, instead supporting students attending nonpublic schools. That money would be handed over to schools that, under Iowa law, are considered corporations. But, other not-for-profit options will exist, too, for nonpublic schooling.
