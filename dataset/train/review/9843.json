["Nearly 50 years have passed since Neil Armstrong walked on the moon and yet conspiracy theories that the moon landing was fake seem to be timeless.", "\"Am I missing something?\" reads the text of an April 23 Facebook post showing a photo of the bottom of \"Neil Armstrongs (sic) Space Boots\" and another photo of \"Neil Armstongs (sic) footprint.\"", "The boots look relatively smooth while the footprint has a tread\u2014they don\u2019t match.", "But this post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "What the theory fails to take into account are the so-called \"lunar overshoes\" the astronauts wore when they actually rested their feet on the moon\u2019s surface. These overshoes are what left the footprint that is being scrutinized in this post.", "First, let\u2019s look at the photo of the footprint.", "Apollo 11 carried cameras for collection data and recording the moon landing mission. The photo of the footprint in question was taken by astronaut Buzz Aldrin, not Armstrong. And, according to a series of images on the Lunar and Planetary Institute\u2019s website, it\u2019s a photo of Aldrin\u2019s own footprint, not Armstrong\u2019s. The institute, perhaps aware of this particular conspiracy theory, also draws readers\u2019 attention to another image of Aldrin descending onto the moon.", "The soles of Aldrin\u2019s boots and the footprint match. Armstrong left a similar footprint with the same kind of tread.", "That\u2019s because while the photo of his space suit is authentic (you can see lots of images of it here, including the soles of his shoes) \u00a0both Armstrong and Aldrin wore these lunar overshoes that were left behind.", "According to a 2017 Forbes story, Armstrong and Aldrin abandoned about 100 tools, gear and pieces of trash on the moon\u2019s surface. \"NASA wanted the mission to bring back as many samples of lunar rocks and dust as possible,\" the story says, \"which meant the crew needed to leave behind everything they didn\u2019t actually need for the trip back to earth.\"", "Moon landing conspiracy theories endure, but so do the first footprints on the moon\u2019s surface. There\u2019s no wind to blow them away, according to NASA, and they\u2019ll be there for a million years.", "We rate this Facebook post as False.", "Facebook post, April 23, 2019", "NASA, July 20, 1969, \"One Giant Leap for Mankind,\" July 20, 2017", "Lunar and Planetary Institute, Apollo 11 Mission, visited May 6, 2019", "Getty Images, Apollo 11 Mission Leaves First Footprint on Moon, July 20, 1969", "NASA, Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal: Neil Armstrong\u2019s flown suit, visited May 6, 2019", "Forbes, \"The Apollo 11 astronauts left a lot of junk on the moon,\" July 20, 2017", "New Mexico State University, Lunar Legacy Project, visited May 6, 2019", "Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Pressure suit, A7-L, Armstrong, Apollo 11, flown, visited May 6, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
