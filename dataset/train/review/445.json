["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on May 31, 2019", "Another manipulated video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is circulating on Facebook. She did not slur her words during a speaking engagement at the Commonwealth Club of California.", "A week after a manipulated video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi swept the internet, a similar doctored video has been posted online.", "This time, it\u2019s a clip taken from video of Pelosi\u2019s appearance at the Commonwealth Club in California on May 29, where she commented on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s public statement made earlier that day about the Russia investigation.", "Like the earlier video, the clip has been slowed down, making it sound like Pelosi is slurring her words. The clip has been viewed more than 28,000 times on Facebook, where it has prompted comments like, \u201cWhy SHE ALWAYS DRUNK ??????? Omg !!!!!! Stay off the cameras \ud83c\udfa5!!!!! It\u2019s embarrassing to watch you slurrrrrrr yourrrr woorrrds!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "But Pelosi doesn\u2019t drink alcohol, as we were told by her office last week and in 2010. And she didn\u2019t slur her words at the Commonwealth Club.", "The clip was slowed down by about 70 percent, estimated Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who specializes in digital forensics.", "\u201cThis one\u2019s even more exaggerated than the last one,\u201d Farid said, but the type of manipulation is the same. It\u2019s easy to do with any standard video and audio editing software, he said.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a simple fake that\u2019s quite effective,\u201d Farid said, since a viewer seeing the video clip \u2014 without also seeing the original \u2014 could easily think that Pelosi is fumbling over her words. However, when compared to the original, it\u2019s clear that the clip has been altered.", "In the manipulated clip, Pelosi is shown speaking for nine minutes and 21 seconds about Mueller. It only takes her about seven minutes to make those same remarks in the original video posted on YouTube by the Commonwealth Club. That video is embedded below:", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

But that doesn\u2019t mean we should give up on them.\u201d Poynter.org. 30 May 2019.", "Special Counsel Robert Mueller Statement on Russia Investigation. C-SPAN. 29 May 2019.", "Farid, Hany. Professor, University of California, Berkeley.
