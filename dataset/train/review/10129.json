["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on August 11, 2016 | Updated on August 15, 2016", "In Miami, Hillary Clinton falsely claimed that \u201cmy\u00a0opponent in this race, his campaign officials\u201d have called Zika \u201can insignificant issue.\u201d That was said by an unpaid local supporter of Donald Trump, not \u201ccampaign officials.\u201d Trump himself has called Zika a \u201cbig problem.\u201d", "At the Borinquen Medical Center in Miami on Aug. 9, Clinton\u00a0mentioned\u00a0the first cases of Zika transmitted\u00a0on U.S. soil in Wynwood, a neighborhood of Miami. As of Aug. 3, there have been six locally acquired cases of Zika in Florida,\u00a0in addition to 322 travel-associated cases\u00a0of the virus, according to the CDC.", "Florida is the only state with locally acquired cases of Zika. But throughout the U.S., there have been more than 1,800 travel-associated cases.", "The Zika epidemic, which first began in Brazil in May 2015, was declared\u00a0a global public health emergency by the World Health Organization in\u00a0February 2016. The virus\u00a0can lead to birth defects, including an abnormally small head and often incomplete brain development, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently\u00a0confirmed.", "Clinton\u00a0expressed\u00a0disappointment with Congress\u2019 failure to pass legislation for emergency funding to combat the Zika epidemic before going on recess\u00a0in mid-July. Congress is not slated to return until early September, but she\u00a0urged \u201cRepublican leaders\u201d in Congress\u00a0\u201cto call people back for a special session and get \u2026 a bill that is focused on combating Zika passed.\u201d", "She then criticized Trump and his campaign\u2019s position on Zika.", "Clinton, Aug. 9: I disagree with those who say that Zika is an insignificant issue. My opponent in this race, his campaign officials have said that, and I think that does a grave disservice because when you come here to a health clinic that is working so hard to get people to come in, to get tested, working with the health departments, working with sanitation departments, working with people to try to go after and prevent a population of mosquitoes from growing, this is something we need to take seriously, and I certainly do.", "We contacted Clinton\u2019s campaign to ask whom specifically Clinton\u00a0was speaking\u00a0about when she referred to Trump\u2019s \u201ccampaign officials.\u201d Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed us to a comment made by an individual named Juan Fiol in June.", "Fiol told\u00a0the Boston\u00a0Globe, \u201cWe have bigger mosquitoes to squash than Zika \u2014 like ISIS, the national debt, Iraq, and Afghanistan. \u2026We have a wall to build to keep the illegals out. We have so many other issues that are more important than this.\u201d He also called Clinton \u201csophomoric\u201d for \u201ctaking on such an insignificant issue.\u201d", "First off, Fiol is one person, but Clinton referred to the plural, \u201ccampaign officials.\u201d", "Second, and more important, Fiol is not a Trump \u201ccampaign official.\u201d", "The Globe referred to Fiol\u00a0as \u201cTrump\u2019s vice chairman of Miami-Dade County.\u201d But Karen Giorno, Trump\u2019s Florida chief strategist and senior political adviser, told us by email, \u201cMr. Fiol is not the vice chair of Miami-Dade County.\u201d She said he is \u201can unpaid supporter.\u201d", "We checked and Fiol doesn\u2019t appear on the payroll in Trump\u2019s July\u00a02016 campaign finance report,\u00a0and he was not\u00a0reimbursed for any campaign expenses. His name is not mentioned at all in the report\u2019s 9,274 pages. He\u2019s also not included\u00a0on a list of the Trump campaign\u2019s staffers and advisers, nor on a similar list\u00a0specific to Florida.", "In fact, on Aug. 10, Fiol posted\u00a0to his Facebook page, \u201cNo rain, volunteering,\u201d along with a picture of himself and two people wearing Trump hats. He tagged the photo as being taken at the BB&T Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which hosted\u00a0a Trump rally on Aug. 10.", "We contacted Fiol himself through Facebook\u00a0and email, but he has yet to respond.\u00a0We also reached out to Trump\u2019s national press secretary, Hope Hicks, to ask about Fiol\u2019s position and responsibilities with regard to Trump\u2019s\u00a0campaign, but she did not respond.", "Schwerin at Clinton\u2019s campaign also referred us to Miami Herald and CNN\u00a0articles from Aug. 3 regarding Trump\u2019s comments about Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s handling of the state\u2019s Zika problem. Both news organizations quoted Trump as saying, \u201cFirst of all, you have a great governor who\u2019s doing a fantastic job, Rick Scott, on the Zika. And it\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s a big problem.\u201d", "When the local CBS reporter asked Trump if Congress should return\u00a0for an emergency session to approve Zika funding, Trump said, \u201cI would say that it\u2019s up to Rick Scott. \u2026 It depends on what he\u2019s looking to do, because [he] really seems to have it under control in Florida.\u201d", "Giorno also told us by email, \u201cMr. Trump has joined Governor Scott in calling for immediate funding to fight the spread of Zika in Florida including the 10,000 Zika preparedness kits already requested. This remains an issue not isolated to Florida but one that is of concern nationally warranting a more robust response by the federal government.\u201d", "In other words, she added, \u201cMr. Fiol\u2019s remarks do not represent the views of Mr. Trump on Zika.\u201d", "While Trump\u2019s comments on Zika are limited, he has called it a \u201cbig problem,\u201d not an\u00a0\u201cinsignificant issue.\u201d And Fiol, who did say the epidemic was insignificant, isn\u2019t a Trump campaign official, but a volunteer.", "So Clinton was wrong\u00a0when she\u00a0claimed that \u201cmy opponent in this race, his campaign officials\u201d have called Zika \u201can insignificant issue.\u201d", "Update, Aug. 15: Fiol returned our email and told us, \u201cI am an unpaid supporter, I speak for myself and not Trump.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/50c1ec40-550a-4da3-bdf1-5e0e5386d31e", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
