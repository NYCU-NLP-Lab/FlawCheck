["About this rating", "The COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic of early 2020 -- as all such outbreaks do -- generated conspiracy theories that the virus was man-made, and even possibly deliberately released onto a defenseless population.  The following examples provide just a small sampling of theories that followed in the wake of the disease's spread:", "Obama sold the virus to Chinese president Xi Jinping during his administration, as Jinping wanted to \"experiment\" with it.  Obama would have HAD to know about it, as he would have had to sign the paperwork allowing such a lethal virus to leave the USA.\n\nThis is a custom-designed virus that only attacks humans (as no animals or other living things have been affected) ... intended for the sole reason of \"thinning the herd\" so the Illuminati can further their cause(s).\n\nThe coronavirus was designed virus by the Chinese to destroy ONLY humans, solely to be used on the USA for its complete takeover.

COVID-19 is the name of the coronavirus disease caused by a particular virus, so a tank car marked to display that it was carrying 'COVID-19' would be akin to a package bearing a label indicating that it contained 'DIABETES.'
