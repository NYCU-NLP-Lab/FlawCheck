["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the daily press briefing on Aug. 14, 2018. (AP/Andrew Harnik)", "During a testy White House daily briefing that included discussion of former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman and her new tell-all book, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders offered a series of favorable statistics about the economy under President Donald Trump.", "At one point, Sanders said, \"This president, since he took office, in the year and a half he\u2019s been here, has created 700,000 new jobs for African-Americans. \u2026 When President Obama left, after eight years in office \u2014 eight years in office \u2014 he had only created 195,000 jobs for African-Americans. President Trump in his first year and a half has already tripled what President Obama did in eight years.\"", "Sanders recounted the numbers under Trump accurately, but she vastly undercounted the number under Obama, leading to a misfire on the comparison between the two presidents.", "We turned to statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government\u2019s official source of employment data.", "First, a technical note. BLS uses two different surveys to create its familiar monthly employment report. When measuring how many jobs are created or lost nationally from month to month, economists generally turn to the bureau\u2019s survey of business establishments rather than the bureau\u2019s survey of households, because the establishment survey is considered more accurate for counting employment level.", "However, the establishment survey doesn\u2019t break down data by race, so we had to turn to the data from the household survey, which does include a racial breakdown.", "Here\u2019s a graph of what we found:", "The good news for Sanders is that she\u2019s on target in describing the increase in African-American employment under Trump. From January 2017 to July 2018, the figure rose by 708,000, or essentially what Sanders said.", "The bad news for Sanders is that she dramatically undershot the amount of the increase under Obama.", "From January 2009 to January 2017 -- the eight-year period under Obama that she referred to -- African-American employment rose by just shy of 3 million. That\u2019s vastly larger than the 195,000 she credited Obama with creating during that span.", "Sanders\u2019 error dramatically alters the comparison between the two presidents. Rather than Trump tripling Obama\u2019s increase in African-American employment, it is actually Obama who in eight years quadrupled the increase Trump oversaw in a year and a half. And Obama had to deal with the fall-out from the Great Recession during that period. (We should note, as we usually do, that presidents are not entirely responsible for job growth under their watch. Underlying economic trends tend to carry more weight that any particular president\u2019s policies.)", "After we finished our reporting, the White House's Council of Economic Advisers sent a tweet\u00a0that said, \"Apologies for @WhiteHouseCEA's earlier miscommunication to @PressSec.\"", "Per @PressSec briefing today: pic.twitter.com/uQzsAkOH2i", "The tweet included a screenshot of data for the intended talking point -- \"minority employment changes 20 months after a presidential election.\" For Obama's first term, according to the chart, African-American employment fell by 636,000, compared to a gain of 848,000 for Trump. However, Obama's first 20 months were dominated by the recession, unlike Trump's, making the comparison dubious.", "The chart also offered the number for the first 20 months of Obama's second term, but it was only modestly below the gain under Trump -- 831,000.", "Later, Sanders herself tweeted, \"Correction from today\u2019s briefing: Jobs numbers for Pres Trump and Pres Obama were correct, but the time frame for Pres Obama wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry for the mistake, but no apologies for the 700,000 jobs for African-Americans created under President Trump.\"", "But her comparison in the tweet still didn't make much sense. To come up with the 195,000 figure, she added together\u00a0the numbers for the first 20 months of Obama's first and second terms -- a disjointed period of time heavily influenced by the recession -- and compared it to the first 20 months of Trump's.", "Correction from today\u2019s briefing: Jobs numbers for Pres Trump and Pres Obama were correct, but the time frame for Pres Obama wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry for the mistake, but no apologies for the 700,000 jobs for African Americans created under President Trump https://t.co/EXGvbliwlS", "Sanders said, \"President Trump in his first year and a half has already tripled what President Obama did (for African-American employment) in eight years.\"", "Sanders dramatically undercounted African-American employment gains under Obama. In reality, the correct Obama-Trump comparison shows the opposite of what Sanders indicated: African-American employment gains under Obama were four times higher than the gains to date on Trump\u2019s watch. The White House's Council of Economic Advisers later tweeted a correction and apology.", "As is our policy, we rate the original statement False.", "Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House daily press briefing, Aug. 14, 2018", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, African-American employment data, accessed Aug. 14, 2018", "Council of Economic Advisers, tweet,\u00a0Aug. 14, 2018", "Sarah Huckabee Sanders, tweet, Aug. 14, 2018", "Email interview with Jed Kolko, chief economist for Indeed.com, Aug. 14, 2018", "Email interview with Gary Burtless, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Aug. 14, 2018", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
