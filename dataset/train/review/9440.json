["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on January 28, 2019", "There is no evidence that \u201c18 million illegal immigrants\u201d received \u201cgovernment checks\u201d during the government shutdown this month, contrary to Facebook posts.", "Immigrants in the country illegally are not eligible for most federal benefits.", "But viral posts on social media distort that fact by claiming millions of unauthorized immigrants have been receiving money from the government, even amid the partial government shutdown that caused hundreds of thousands of\u00a0federal workers to go without pay.", "\u201c18 Million Illegal Immigrants got their government checks this month\u2026\u201d the Facebook posts read, \u201cFederal workers \u2026 let that sink in.\u201d", "That vague claim offers no support for its assertion, and we could find no evidence to back it up.", "Michael Fix, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, told FactCheck.org that the notion of that many unauthorized immigrants receiving benefits was \u201cimplausible to say the least.\u201d", "First of all, Fix said in an email, many\u00a0estimates\u00a0figure there to be somewhere around 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country.", "The numbers fluctuate: In a 2018\u00a0report, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said that there were about 12 million immigrants in the country illegally as of January 2015. The Pew Research Center, meanwhile,\u00a0found\u00a0the number had dropped to about 10.7 million in 2016. One recent\u00a0study\u00a0suggested much higher numbers \u2014 with a\u00a0mean estimate of 22.1 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. \u2014 but some, including Fix and his colleagues, have\u00a0contested its methodology and findings.", "What\u2019s more, Fix said, \u201cunauthorized (immigrants) have for decades been barred from all cash and in-kind public benefit programs \u2014 and applications for those programs have been screened through the SAVE,\u201d referring to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system. He also noted that they are \u201cbarred from federal employment\u201d and that \u201capplications for employment for federal positions are themselves screened\u201d through the E-Verify system.", "Many of the public-benefit restrictions on unauthorized immigrants were codified in a 1996 welfare reform law known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act.", "The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2016\u00a0report\u00a0that such immigrants are not eligible for programs including SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program); Supplemental Security Income;\u00a0Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; and Medicaid.", "Some exceptions: treatment under Medicaid for emergency medical conditions, temporary in-kind emergency disaster relief and\u00a0immunizations. Immigrant children are also not barred from accessing public education.", "But none of this lends credence to the unsupported claim that\u00a0\u201c18 million illegal immigrants\u201d are receiving \u201cgovernment checks.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Fix, Michael.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
