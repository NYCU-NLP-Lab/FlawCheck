Gordon and Alan Baldridge, a 2000 New York Times Q&A says that \"two courting bulls often follow the same cow, forming tightly knit trios that remain intact right up to the moment of conception.\"", "The idea that any extra males held the mating whales together to brace them has been \"mostly dismissed as a misinterpretation of what is going on in a process that is difficult to study,\" according to the Times.", "Different whale species behave differently.

Kraus told us that when female whales remain with their blowholes upright and swimming forward, they may be ensuring that only males fit enough to keep up and hold their breath for long periods of time can mate with her.

In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, it is often observed that when a blue whale pair is joined by a third whale \u2014\u00a0usually a male \u2014 the trio starts coursing, racing high out of the water involving vigorous surface displays causing explosive splashes and bow waves. This behavior can either end with the intruding male leaving the pair or the primary escort being replaced by the intruding male.\"", "Rob Williams, chief scientist with Oceans Initiative, told us that back in the 1980s, there was a theory of mating trios including \"helpers\" among gray whales. \"But I think even the authors noted that was speculation,\" Williams said. \"I\u2019m not aware of any genetic evidence emerging over the last 30 years that those third whales are actually helpers.\"", "Philip Clapham, former program leader of the Cetacean Assessment and Ecology Program and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, was blunter when we asked him about the Facebook post.", "\"The idea that one male holds up a mating pair is complete and utter bulls---,\" he said.", "In some species of whales, multiple males compete for the same female,\" he told us.
