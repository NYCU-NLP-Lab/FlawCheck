["The video retweeted by Trump -- who said he used hydroxychloroquine and has repeatedly touted it -- is from a July 27, 2020 press conference held by a group calling themselves \u201cAmerica\u2019s Frontline Doctors,\u201d who stood wearing white lab coats but without social distancing or any form of facial covering in front of the US Supreme Court.", "The tweet is the latest example of Trump making or promoting questionable claims about the coronavirus, which has left more than 149,000 people dead in the United States as of July 29, and comes just days after the president struck a more sober tone on the pandemic.", "Referring to the doctor featured in the video he helped spread, Trump said at a July 28 briefing: \u201cI thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her.\u201d", "The roughly 40-minute press conference -- an event supported by a conservative political group\u00a0-- repeatedly cited the alleged benefits of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that the World Health Organization (WHO) said in June could be ruled out as a treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.", "The \u201cAmerica\u2019s Frontline Doctors\u201d website, which is now offline, said \u201cAmerican life has fallen casualty to a massive disinformation campaign\u201d and warned that \u201cif Americans continue to let so-called experts and media personalities make their decisions, the great American experiment of a Constitutional Republic with Representative Democracy, will cease.\u201d", "Dr. Stella Immanuel, who can be seen in the preview of the since-removed video retweeted by Trump, said during the press conference that she had successfully treated more than 350 COVID-19 patients.", "\u201cThe result has been the same. I put them on hydroxychloroquine, I put them on zinc, I put them on Zithromax, and they are all well,\u201d said Immanuel, a Houston-based physician who said she was familiar with hydroxychloroquine from treating malaria patients in Nigeria.", "\u201cI came here to Washington, DC to tell America: Nobody needs to get sick. This virus has a cure. It is called hydroxychloroquine, zinc and Zithromax,\u201d she said.", "No medical study backs up her claim of a cure. As of July 29, more than 662,000 people have died worldwide from COVID-19.", "Asked about Immanuel\u2019s remarks, Dr. Julian Leibowitz, an expert in coronaviruses who is a professor of microbial pathogenesis and immunology at Texas A&M\u2019s College of Medicine, told AFP by email that \u201cmultiple studies have shown this to be wrong.\u201d", "Dr. Shelley Payne, director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas at Austin, agreed.", "\u201cThese are not cures for the virus. There is no evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective either as a treatment or prophylactic,\u201d she said by email.", "And Dr. Benjamin Neuman, an expert in coronaviruses who chairs the Biological Sciences department at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, said via email that \u201cHydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin have, separately and together, done well in a few small studies that generated a lot of hope.\u201d", "But \u201cboth clearly and reproducibly failed to work beyond a reasonable doubt in larger studies\u201d needed to determine if they were in fact effective, he said.", "Immanuel however declared that \u201cany study that says hydroxychloroquine doesn\u2019t work is fake science,\u201d and dismissed those calling for more extensive research on the subject as \u201cfake doctors.\u201d", "She also said that, \u201cYou don\u2019t need (a) mask. There is a cure\u201d -- contradicting advice from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the use of cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus.", "The WHO says on its website that \u201cthere is currently no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID-19,\u201d and that \u201cthe misuse of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness and even lead to death.\u201d", "And in June, the US Food and Drug Administration revoked the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) allowing hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile to be used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients.", "The \u201cFDA determined that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA,\u201d it said.", "\u201cAdditionally, in light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use.\u201d", "Despite this, another doctor at the press conference, ophthalmologist Richard Urso, said that \u201cthis drug is super safe -- it\u2019s safer than aspirin, MOTRIN, Tylenol,\u201d and that the issue in studies that found otherwise was that they used too high a dose.", "Neuman disputed that assertion. \u201cThese studies used a variety of doses including large doses in order to try to find some effect from hydroxychloroquine, but were unable to substantiate any positive effect,\u201d he said.", "\u201cIt would be nice if hydroxychloroquine worked the way people want it to work, or if we could collectively will such a thing to happen, but as we have seen with COVID-19, the biology of infectious disease is not swayed by wishful thinking.\u201d", "Not all claims made at the press conference centered on hydroxychloroquine.", "Dr. Bob Hamilton, a California pediatrician, urged a reopening of schools shuttered by the pandemic.", "\u201cOur kids are not really the ones who are driving the infection, it is being driven by older individuals. And yes, we can send the kids back to school, I think, without fear,\u201d he said.", "\u201cWe need to normalize the lives of our children. How do we do that? We do that by getting them back in the classroom,\u201d Hamilton said, adding that \u201csecurity measures\u201d could be taken.", "But Payne said: \u201cChildren may not be the drivers, but they can be infected and some deaths have occurred in children. We don\u2019t know if they will pass it on to their teachers, since schools have been closed since the early days of the pandemic.\u201d", "And Neuman noted that\u00a0\u201ca rising number of infections among toddlers and young children has been reported across the US.\u201d", "Dr. Simone Gold, who was listed as the founder of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Frontline Doctors\u201d on its website, questioned the importance of COVID-19 case statistics.", "\u201cThe only number that I think is worth paying any attention to, and even that number is not so helpful, is mortality, because that\u2019s a hard and fast number,\u201d she said in response to a question from a member of the small in-person audience about how people can get the \u201cright information.\u201d", "\u201cSo the case number is almost irrelevant, and that\u2019s because there\u2019s a lot of inaccuracies with the testing,\u201d Gold said.", "This, however, is inaccurate.", "\u201cIt is important to know the number of infections and their distribution. This will help the epidemiologists determine how easily the disease spreads and whether we... will approach herd immunity in some areas, although it appears that we are far below that level of infection at this point,\u201d said Payne.", "And \u201ctesting is becoming more widespread and is sufficiently accurate to diagnose most infections.\u201d", "Regarding the testing claim, Neuman said: \u201cI worry that we will see a drop in testing that is voluntary, spurred on by outdated and inaccurate statements like these that encourage people not to get tested.\u201d", "Although speakers concentrated on medical issues, the press conference for the July 27-28 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Frontline Doctors Summit\u201d in Washington was ultimately a political event.", "The right-wing\u00a0Tea Party Patriots Foundation\u00a0funded and\u00a0helped organize the summit,\u00a0the overall theme of which was to \u201chelp ease the fears of Americans about reopening the economy and schools by highlighting treatment options, dispelling myths and lies, etc.\u201d", "Tea Party Patriots co-founder\u00a0Jenny Beth Martin\u00a0spoke at the press conference, telling\u00a0Americans that they should contact their elected representatives and say \u201cthat you want to know why you\u2019re not able to get access to a drug that doctors are telling you will help end this and help us reduce the number of hospitalizations and reduce the number of deaths.\u201d", "Hamilton meanwhile took aim at teachers\u2019 unions in his remarks, saying: \u201cThe barrier to getting our kids back in school is not gonna be the science, it\u2019s going to be the national unions\u201d that \u201care gonna demand money.\u201d", "And Urso said that the \u201cpolitical situation has driven the fear\u201d of hydroxychloroquine.", "Representative Ralph Norman, a Republican congressman from South Carolina, spoke at the beginning of the press conference.", "\u201cI appreciate these physicians taking the time to come out and tell us the truth about the cures and the things that we can do to lessen the pandemic,\u201d he said in remarks primarily focused on reopening schools.", "Norman stressed in a statement on July 28 that he was \u201cjust there to talk about schools\u201d and did not know what Immanuel planned to say.", "But he also decried the removal of footage of her remarks by social media companies, saying in the statement: \u201cDon\u2019t silence her just because what she said was objectionable! That\u2019s un-American!\u201d", "Social media companies are working to remove footage of the press conference from their platforms.", "Twitter said that \u201ctweets with the video are in violation of our COVID-19 misinformation policy,\u201d Facebook said it includes \"false information about cures and treatments for COVID-19,\u201d and YouTube said: \u201cWe have removed the video for violating our COVID-19 misinformation policies.\u201d", "But the footage is still circulating online despite these efforts -- something that also occurred with \u201cPlandemic,\u201d another video that peddled falsehoods about COVID-19, which AFP fact checked here.", "Zarine Kharazian of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which focuses on identifying and exposing disinformation, said that social media platforms seem to have moved faster against the video of the press conference than they did with \u201cPlandemic.\u201d", "But \u201cthe video was already viewed at least 14 million times before it was removed, and copies are still circulating online,\u201d she said by email.", "And \u201cthis video went more viral than Plandemic, in terms of pure views. Plandemic received about 8 million views over several days,\u201d Kharazian said.", "AFP Fact Check has debunked more than 570 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
