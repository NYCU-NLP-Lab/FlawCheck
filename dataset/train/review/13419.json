["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on December 9, 2019", "A long-circulating headline on social media misleadingly tells users that Democrats chose to \u201cvote down\u201d a health records system for veterans while approving the same for immigrants who cross the border illegally. The bill in question did not affect veterans.", "The Democratic-controlled House in late September passed a bill largely along party lines that would create new requirements for the Department of Homeland Security regarding medical screenings of immigrants who cross the border illegally \u2014 including the implementation of an electronic health records system.", "In the more than two months since the House passed the bill, it hasn\u2019t moved forward in the Republican-controlled Senate. But the prospect of the records system has continued to draw ire online thanks to a misleading headline that has ricocheted on social media.", "The headline, circulating on a YouTube video from an account called Top Stories Today, offers a grossly distorted take on what the bill does: \u201cDems Vote To Enhance Med Care for Illegals Now, Vote Down Vets Waiting 10 Years for Same Service.\u201d", "In reality, the legislation at the center of the report that follows didn\u2019t concern veterans\u2019 medical care.", "The headline is lifted directly from an article on the conservative website the Western Journal, whose original story serves as the script for the YouTube video. The video has been posted on partisan Facebook pages in recent days \u2014 and has been shared by thousands of users from there \u2014 and its total views have climbed to more than 191,000.", "The bill, H.R. 3525, is known as the \u201cU.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening Standards Act.\u201d It was sponsored by Rep. Lauren Underwood, a Democrat from Illinois.", "Part of the bill requires DHS to research and recommend \u201cinnovative approaches\u201d to improve the medical screening of immigrants who cross the border illegally \u2014 especially of children, pregnant women, the elderly and other \u201cvulnerable populations.\u201d", "The next portion covers the electronic records system requirement. It reads:", "H.R. 3525: Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Chief Medical Officer of the Department, shall establish within the Department an electronic health record system that can be accessed by all departmental components operating along the borders of the United States for individuals in the custody of such components.", "Underwood has described her legislation as one to \u201caddress the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border\u201d and has said it \u201cbuilds upon ongoing DHS efforts to improve electronic medical recordkeeping by directing the agency to establish an electronic health record system that can be accessed by all departmental components operating along U.S. borders.\u201d", "U.S. Customs and Border Protection is reportedly already developing such an electronic health records system, but the bill would expedite that process by setting a 90-day deadline.", "The bill itself makes no mention of veterans \u2014 but House Republicans opposing the legislation connected the proposed electronic records system to an unrelated, existing project to overhaul the electronic health records system used for veterans.", "Here\u2019s the background on that: In June 2017, then-Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin announced the agency would change its electronic health records system to the same system as the Department of Defense. The goal, according to the VA, is to create \u201ca new system that will link in with the Department of Defense\u2019s patient records and unify all VA facilities on one system.\u201d", "The VA awarded a contract a year later to Cerner, a health IT company, and referred to the project as \u201cone of the largest IT contracts in the federal government, with a ceiling of $10 billion over 10 years.\u201d The total estimate is now more than $16 billion. The system will be \u201cfully interoperable\u201d \u2014 meaning that \u201cpatient information from different doctors, pharmacies, labs, etc. will be stored in the same language, in the same place, and in a format that is quickly accessible and easy to use,\u201d the department notes. \u201cThis benefits Veterans by eliminating the cumbersome manual transfer of records when service members transition from their military careers and when Veterans see multiple providers both inside and outside the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) system.\u201d", "Before the final vote on Underwood\u2019s bill to require the electronic records system at the border, Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee introduced a \u201cmotion to recommit\u201d the bill \u2014 a last-minute legislative maneuver to amend a bill \u2014 that called for pushing back the electronic records system\u2019s implementation until September 2027. He cited the estimated completion date of the new VA system.", "\u201cAll this amendment does is ensure that our veterans get this service first,\u201d Green said on the House floor.", "Democrats rejected the argument: House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said that the motion was a delay tactic that wouldn\u2019t do \u201ca single thing\u201d for veterans\u2019 health care.", "Green\u2019s motion to recommit the bill failed, and the bill ultimately passed. Some Republicans continued to muddy the waters: Rep. Tim Burchett tweeted a video and wrote \u201cAmendment to give VETERANS same healthcare as ILLEGALS fails. Are you kidding me? We are so out of wack.\u201d", "That\u2019s grossly misleading since, as we said, the proposed amendment would not \u201cgive\u201d veterans any type of \u201chealthcare\u201d \u2014 and the new records system for veterans was already underway.", "Two days after the House passed H.R. 3525, the Western Journal published its article under its misleading headline: \u201cDems Vote To Enhance Med Care for Illegals Now, Vote Down Vets Waiting 10 Years for Same Service.\u201d The Top Stories Today video under the same headline appeared on YouTube a day after that, and both have festered online in the more than two months since.", "\u201cThe bill gives the DHS 90 days after the bill receives final approval to get the job done,\u201d claims the speaker in the video, reading from the original Western Journal article. \u201cIn contrast, the Veterans Administration has been working for years to implement an EHR system for veterans.\u201d", "That\u2019s misleading \u2014 as an updated version of the Western Journal article now makes clear by noting that the VA does have an electronic health records system already (albeit with some limitations).", "Susan Carter, a VA spokeswoman, also confirmed in an email that the agency already uses an electronic health records system \u2014 known as Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture, or VISTA.", "Likewise, Genevieve Morris, who briefly served as chief health information officer for the VA\u2019s Office of EHR Modernization, told FactCheck.org that \u201cthe claim that [the bill is] giving to illegal immigrants something that the veterans don\u2019t have is not accurate at all.\u201d", "Morris was previously the principal deputy national coordinator for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In that role, before taking the formal position with the VA, she was detailed to the VA and helped finalize the contract with Cerner for the new records system. Morris said the 10-year timeline is necessitated by the scope of the project: \u201cThere is literally no way to do the VA implementation faster.\u201d", "\u201cWhen you are transitioning the largest health care system in our country \u2026 to a new system, it requires significant data mapping, significant data transferring, significant data training,\u201d she said.", "Carter, the VA spokeswoman, also said that \u201c[d]eployment of any new electronic health record system is a complex process that must be done carefully and deliberately to ensure continuity of care.\u201d", "Morris \u2014 who resigned from her position at the VA in August 2018 and now owns a health IT consulting firm and is running for Congress as a Republican in Maryland\u2019s 2nd District \u2014 said comparing the VA\u2019s overhaul and the proposed system at the border \u201cis not a fair comparison\u201d due to the VA\u2019s scale.", "While the proposed bill\u2019s deadline for the electronic health records system at the border is \u201cprobably not very realistic\u201d and lawmakers are right to want to know the costs and the return on investment, Morris said, such a system could benefit those working at the border, and taxpayers, since access to immigrants\u2019 medical records across government facilities can prevent duplicate services.", "\u201cYou\u2019re trying to enable the people who are working in those facilities to better do their job and ensure that we\u2019re not adding to our own cost of taxpayer dollars,\u201d she said. Immigrants \u201creceive safer care and are less likely to have adverse effects\u201d \u2014 and end up in costly emergency situations \u2014 \u201cbecause their data is readable, findable, and shareable. It doesn\u2019t change the actual healthcare services they get in those facilities.\u201d", "In short, the text and video reports distort the facts in claiming that Democrats \u201cvote[d] down vets waiting 10 years for same service.\u201d", "As we said, the motion to recommit would not have had an effect on the project underway to implement the new electronic health records system for veterans \u2014 which has received continued funding from Congress. The department\u2019s Office of Electronic Health Record Modernization received $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2019, which it said allows the \u201cVA to maintain fidelity to the planned implementation schedule for the new electronic health record (EHR) system, beginning with the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) sites in the Pacific Northwest.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Former chief health information officer for Veterans Affairs Office of EHR Modernization. Phone interview with FactCheck.org. 6 Dec 2019.", "U.S. House. \u201cH.R. 3525, U.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening Standards Act.\u201d (as approved by the House 26 Sep 2019)", "\u201cVA Signs Contract with Cerner for an Electronic Health Record System.\u201d Press release, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 17 May 2018.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
