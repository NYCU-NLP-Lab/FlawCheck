["By Sydney Schaedel", "Posted on June 28, 2017", "Q:\u00a0Did President Donald Trump sign an executive order that prevents immigrants living in the U.S. without legal permission from receiving welfare?", "A: No. Some bogus websites have twisted the facts about a draft executive order that Trump has not signed.", "Did President Trump sign an executive order that stops illegals from collecting welfare benefits?", "No. The fact is that those living in the U.S. illegally are already ineligible for federal benefits with a few exceptions.", "But a story published on several unreliable websites in February falsely claimed that President Donald Trump \u201csigned an executive order that prevents illegals from using welfare.\u201d Skeptical Facebook users flagged a shorter version of the story published June 19 on President45DonaldTrump.com as possibly fake news.", "Both versions claim that \u201cPresident Trump signed an executive order according to which any illegal who lives on welfare will be sent home\u201d and that \u201cAmerica will no longer accept people who come here to live on our expense.\u201d", "The stories misrepresent a Jan. 31 Washington Post article that said \u201cthe Trump administration is considering a plan to weed out would-be immigrants who are likely to require public assistance, as well as to deport \u2014 when possible \u2014 immigrants already living in the United States who depend on taxpayer help.\u201d The Post story was about legal immigrants, not those living in the U.S. illegally.", "The Post made it clear that the order was only a draft and hadn\u2019t been signed.", "Washington Post, Jan. 31: The Trump administration is considering a plan to weed out would-be immigrants who are likely to require public assistance, as well as to deport \u2014 when possible \u2014 immigrants already living in the United States who depend on taxpayer help, according to a draft executive order obtained by The Washington Post.", "A second draft order under consideration calls for a substantial shake-up in the system through which the United States administers immigrant and nonimmigrant visas, with the aim of tightly controlling who enters the country and who can enter the workforce, and reducing the social services burden on U.S. taxpayers.", "The drafts are circulating among administration officials, and it is unclear whether President Trump has decided to move forward with them or when he might sign them if he does decide to put them in place. The White House would not confirm or deny the authenticity of the orders, and White House officials did not respond to requests for comment about the drafts Monday and Tuesday.", "According to the draft text \u2014 which is dated Jan. 23 \u2014 the order would, among other things, \u201cdeny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge; identify and remove, as expeditiously as possible, any alien who has become a public charge and is subject to removal; and seek reimbursement from all sponsors of immigrants for the costs of federal means-tested public benefits provided to sponsored immigrants.\u201d", "Federal law already states that \u201can individual who is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible to the United States and ineligible to become a legal permanent resident.\u201d That\u2019s according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which defines a public charge as \u201can individual who is likely to become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or institutionalization for long-term care at government expense.\u201d", "The draft order says that has been the rule \u201cfor over a century,\u201d but claims that \u201cpast administrations in recent years have failed to enforce this policy.\u201d", "In addition, federal law says that an immigrant in the country illegally \u201cis not eligible for any Federal public benefit\u201d with few exceptions. They can only receive emergency medical care; short-term, non-cash emergency disaster relief; limited testing and treatment for communicable diseases; in-kind community programs like soup kitchens or crisis counseling, as specified by the attorney general; and limited housing or community development assistance to those already receiving it in 1996.", "Yet, one version of the viral stories claims, without evidence, that \u201cFormer President Barack Obama allowed illegals in America to apply and get on welfare.\u201d", "Trump did declare at a campaign-style rally on June 21 that \u201cI believe the time has come for new immigration rules which say that those seeking admission into our country must be able to support themselves financially and should not use welfare for a period of at least five years.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd we\u2019ll be putting in legislation to that effect very shortly.\u201d", "That would presumably be in addition to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, which President Bill Clinton signed in 1996. It blocks many legal immigrants from receiving a range of federal benefits for five years.", "Trump\u2019s\u00a0proposed FY 2018 budget, which was\u00a0released\u00a0in May, calls for controlling\u00a0the cost of benefits paid to immigrant-headed households. But it offered no details on how that would be accomplished beyond reducing the number of refugees, curbing illegal immigration and increasing merit-based legal immigration.", "But Trump has not \u201csigned an executive order that prevents illegals from using welfare.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "\u201cPresident Trump Signed An Executive Order That Prevents Illegals From Using Welfare.
