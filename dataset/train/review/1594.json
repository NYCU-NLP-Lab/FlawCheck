Dennis Kucinich took to the floor of the House last month to warn against proposed austerity measures. The Cleveland Democrat said such spending cuts would repeat the mistakes of the Great Depression.\n\n\"Poor and middle-class Americans know all about the fiscal cliff,\" he said, because \"they've been getting pushed off it for years.\"\n\nAmong examples he cited: \"Fourteen million Americans' mortgages are greater than the value of their homes.\"\n\nThe recession officially ended more than three years ago. Are so many homeowners still \"underwater\" in their mortgages, even in an economic recovery from the collapse of the housing bubble in 2008? PolitiFact Ohio asked Kucinich's staff for more information.\n\nThey referred us to the Zillow online real estate database. Its Negative Equity Report, produced on a quarterly basis, shows the percent of homeowners who owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth.\n\nAccording to the third quarter Zillow Negative Equity Report, issued last month, 28.2 percent of U.S. homeowners with a mortgage are under water, which is down from 30.9 percent in the first quarter of 2012.\n\nThe actual number of homeowners in negative equity, owing more than their homes are worth, declined about 1.3 million in the third quarter, to slightly more than 14 million.\n\nThe situation may be \u00a0improving, but more than a quarter of homeowners with mortgages remain underwater.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, Kucinich\u2019s statement rates as True.", "Rep.
