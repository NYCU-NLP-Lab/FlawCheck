["Author Ta-Nehisi Coates, left, and Actor Danny Glover, right, testify about reparation for the descendants of slaves during a House subcommittee hearing. (AP)", "Author Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose 2014 essay is credited with restarting debate over reparations for slavery, testified at a hearing before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on June 19.", "Arguing that reparations is a matter of \"making amends and direct redress,\" Coates made a claim about wealth that we want to check, saying:", "\"The typical black family in this country has one-tenth the wealth of the typical white family.\"", "What we found is that he is citing the most respected and most recent authority on the racial wealth gap.", "Reparations, if eventually enacted, would likely include a formal apology for America\u2019s history of slavery, as well as some form of financial compensation to descendants of slaves.", "Wealth is often confused with income, and while the two often go hand in hand, they are different. Income is how much money a person makes from a job or investments. Wealth is the value of everything a person owns after factoring in debt.

But the report said \"the long-standing and substantial wealth disparities\" between families of different racial and ethnic groups \"have changed little in the past few years.\"", "The report offered a couple of possible explanations for the gap:", "\"Well over half of white households are homeowners (73%), compared with just under half of black\" households.", "White households \"tend to be older, more highly educated, more likely to have received an inheritance and less likely to be a single parent.\"", "A February 2019 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, however, drew a different picture.", "\"We find that the income gap is the primary driver behind the wealth gap and that it is large enough to explain the persistent difference in wealth accumulation.\"", "Coates said, \"The typical black family in this country has one-tenth the wealth of the typical white family.\"", "The best way to measure typical wealth is with the median net worth, and the most recent figures are for 2016.
