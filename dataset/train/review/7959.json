On 21 June, the Daily Mail reported:", "This is the bizarre moment a baby's relatives are forced to wrestle their child away from a French priest who slapped it during its baptism. The clergyman hit the child in the face with his left hand after he lost his temper when the child would not stop crying during the ceremony.\u00a0 The outraged man and woman watching on, who appear to be his parents, react in shock and step in to snatch their baby back.", "It is not known when the footage was filmed but it was captured in a church where the ceremony was conducted in French.", "In the video, a priest can be seen holding a crying baby next to a baptismal font, and attempting to calm and comfort him or her. However, he becomes increasingly frustrated by the child's screams, and at one point slaps the child in the face, shouting \"Du calme!\" (\"Relax!\") The adults surrounding the baby are visibly shocked by this, and make efforts to take the child back from the priest's arms.", "The priest holds the baby even closer to him, at one point appearing to cover the child's face with his hand, saying \"Tu vas te calmer\" (\"You're going to relax.\") The video ends with a man, possibly the baby's father or godfather, pulling the child away from the priest \u2014 but even then, the priest struggles to hold on to the baby:", "\ufeff\nThe video is authentic.
