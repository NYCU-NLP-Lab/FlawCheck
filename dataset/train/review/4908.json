The bureau analysis accounts for those credits that would be claimed by individual income filers, but not those who would get the credits through corporate tax returns. So the Democratic plan would increase the tax burden for those filers, but it\u2019s not connected to the individual income tax process.)", "Nygren says the Republican tax cut plan is \"better for working, middle-class families,\" citing as support the percentage of tax cuts going to Wisconsin residents with incomes under $100,000.", "The numbers are accurate, so far as they go.
