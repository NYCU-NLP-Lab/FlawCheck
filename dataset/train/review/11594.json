(AP)", "U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wouldn\u2019t reveal just how high he\u2019d raise income taxes on the rich during the Iowa presidential debate, but he guaranteed it wouldn\u2019t be as much as it has been in the past.", "In order to pay for making college tuition-free for Americans, Sanders said that Wall Street owed the middle class for bailing it out during the recent financial crisis. He said he would demand \"that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.\"", "\"Well, let\u2019s get specific, how high would you go?\" CBS News moderator Nancy Cordes asked. \"You\u2019ve said before you\u2019d go above 50 percent. How high?\"", "\"We haven\u2019t come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent,\" Sanders answered.", "Was the top income tax rate under Eisenhower an astronomical 90 percent? We decided to check the ledgers on that figure.", "Before we go further, let\u2019s review what the marginal tax rate means. It\u2019s the tax rate that\u2019s applied to the last dollar earned. The U.S. tax system is based on brackets. The top marginal tax rate applies to the highest bracket.

(It was 92 percent the year he came into office.)", "What does it mean, though? For the duration of Eisenhower\u2019s presidency, that rate affected individuals making $200,000 or more per year or couples making $400,000 and above per year.", "In 2015 dollars, that's roughly $1.7 million for an individual and $3.4 million for a couple.", "Today the tax brackets\u00a0are adjusted for inflation, but are exceptionally lower than in Eisenhower\u2019s day. The top rate in 2015 is 39.6 percent, applied to single people making $413,200 or more per year, or married couples filing jointly making $464,850 or more annually. If we went back to 1954, single people making the equivalent of $413,200 would be in a 72 percent tax bracket, while a couple making $464,850 would end up in a 75 percent bracket.", "What\u2019s the highest income tax bracket ever put in place? In 1944-45, during World War II, couples making more than $200,000 faced an all-time high of 94 percent.", "Our ruling", "Sanders said income tax rates under Eisenhower were as high as 90 percent.", "A look through the records shows that top earners in the eight years of Eisenhower\u2019s presidency paid a top income tax rate of 91 percent.
