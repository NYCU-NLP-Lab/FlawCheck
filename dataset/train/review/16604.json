Of course, he caved.", "The article then presents a fabricated quotation from the president of Harvard University.", "The story is entirely false: Malia Obama was not arrested in Chicago, she has not been suspended from Harvard, she is not facing trial, and the president of Harvard University is Drew Gilpin Faust, not the fictional \"Harmon Finklestein\". This is just the latest in a series of fabricated, fake stories revolving around Malia Obama, which has included false claims that she lost an internship following her (fictional) arrest, and that she had been expelled from Harvard.", "Our Land of the Free is a satirical web site that describes itself as publishing exclusive fake stories:", "...We make no guarantee that what you read here is true.
