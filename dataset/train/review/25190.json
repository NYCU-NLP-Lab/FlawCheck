["About this rating", "On 2 May 2016, disreputable web site\u00a0American News\u00a0published an article with a sensational\u00a0title\u00a0(\"Obama To Replace National Bird The Bald Eagle With THIS\"). \u00a0Despite the clickbait claim,\u00a0the text of this\u00a0article made\u00a0no such argument:", "According to recent reports, our nation is about to get a new animal\u2014and it\u2019s quite a departure from the bald eagle, which has been the sole symbol of the United States for 234 years.", "Reports indicate that the National Bison Legacy Act has just been passed by Congress, and is expected to pass through the Senate next week. The act denotes the bison as America\u2019s national mammal and a \u201chistorical symbol of the United States.\u201d", "The eagle will reportedly still represent the nation, but it will no longer be the sole animal doing so. If passed, the bison will join the bald eagle, the oak, and the rose as a symbol for our country.", "Despite the title, the\u00a0actual story was primarily\u00a0based on factual information. The National Bison Legacy Act, which\u00a0designated the bison as the national mammal of the United States, was\u00a0passed by Congress at the end of April 2016. But while this legislation will give the United States its first national mammal, it will have no effect\u00a0on the bald eagle's status as the United States'\u00a0national bird,\u00a0nor as its\u00a0national symbol.", "The text of the bill stated that the\u00a0purpose of the\u00a0National Bison Legacy Act is to adopt \"the North American bison as the national mammal of the United States.\" The legislation made no mention of\u00a0changing or replacing the bald eagle's status.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
