The password hashes leak was a little more contained and impacted a subset of 6.6 million users - all the other users were using Facebook/Google for login - we don\u2019t have any password information for those accounts.", "Five days earlier, Patidar said in another post that users' credit card and payment information had not been affected by the data breach.", "The party responsible for the attack said in an interview that they reported a \"vulnerability in the company's infrastructure\" to Zomato after discovering it in 2016 but did not get the response, saying, \"It does not justify the pain I caused to them, but it is a reason.\"", "The hacker also reportedly posted the data for sale on a \"dark web\" site, alongside a sample of around 50 accounts.
