But does the ad really capture the whole story?", "Turns out, much of what the CFG claims in the ad launched in July is easily backed up by evidence in the 2013\u00a0case.", "Vukmir\u2019s 2013\u00a0lawsuit", "The Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) sued Vukmir in 2013\u00a0for violating an open records request.", "At the time, Vukmir was second vice-chairwoman of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). The conservative nonprofit is comprised of state legislators and members of the private sector.", "The CMD filed a request for records after an ALEC conference in Oklahoma City in May 2013. It resulted in the release of nine documents, but the CMD suspected there were more.", "The CMD, a progressive watchdog organization based in Madison, was no stranger to requesting records from ALEC. They run a website called ALEC Exposed that targets the organization and its pro-corporation values.", "And Brendan Fischer, former lawyer for the CMD, said ALEC had been difficult with releasing records in the past. But one of the main reasons the CMD filed the lawsuit was due to a disclaimer that ALEC put at the bottom of their documents.", "The disclaimer stated: \"Because this is an internal ALEC document, ALEC believes that it is not subject to disclosure under any state Freedom of Information or Public Records Act.\"", "Fischer said this made it difficult to believe they only had nine documents from the meeting.", "The assumption proved correct during the settlement when\u00a0both parties agreed to have Vukmir\u2019s emails searched by an independent party in the presence of a staffer from the center.", "The independent party found a \"significant number\" of documents in Vukmir\u2019s email.

Vukmir handed over the missing documents. Her legal team racked up $15,000 in fees, which was paid for by the state.", "Jess Ward, Vukmir\u2019s campaign manager, did not address the case directly but said it is \"nothing more than an attempt by Leah\u2019s opponents to attack her stellar record of saving taxpayers billions.\"", "The campaign ad", "The claim about Vukmir\u2019s lawsuit is the second made in the CFG Action video, after the statement that Vukmir sought leniency for a fellow lawmaker convicted of sexual assault.

It is standard practice for a politician to have their legal fees paid for by the state.", "But in Vukmir\u2019s case, challenging open records laws could have changed the way all legislators respond to records requests.
