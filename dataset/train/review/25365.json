["About this rating", "In July 2017, NASA opened applications for the job of Planetary Protection Officer, a role primarily concerned with preventing contamination from Earth to other planets.", "While the job does have a mandate to prevent extraterrestrial contamination from entering Earth\u2019s biosphere, most of the job involves working with missions to design systems that prevent them from accidentally bringing life with them to other worlds.", "On 2 August 2017, USA Today reported on a NASA job posting for a \u201cplanetary protection officer\u201d in a way that \u2014 while sure to boost page views \u2014 took serious liberties with the nature of, and need for, the position advertised. Several other web sites reprinted the USA Today article, using headlines like \u201cNASA is Hiring Someone to Protect Earth from Aliens,\u201d which stated:", "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is currently looking for someone with a secret security clearance to ensure alien life, or \"organic-constituent and biological contamination\" doesn't make its way back in a space ship.", "While this statement is technically true, it misrepresents of the nature of the work performed by the planetary protection officer -- the most significant aspect of which is to prevent other planets and space objects from becoming contaminated by us.", "The NASA job posting makes this clear:", "This position is assigned to Office of Safety and Mission Assurance for Planetary Protection. Planetary protection is concerned with the avoidance of organic-constituent and biological contamination in human and robotic space exploration.", "NASA maintains policies for planetary protection applicable to all space flight missions that may intentionally or unintentionally carry Earth organisms and organic constituents to the planets or other solar system bodies, and any mission employing spacecraft, which are intended to return to Earth and its biosphere with samples from extraterrestrial targets of exploration. This policy is based on federal requirements and international treaties and agreements.", "And on their web site, the Planetary Protection Office also describes the two-way nature of the job:", "Planetary protection is essential for several important reasons: to preserve our ability to study other worlds as they exist in their natural states; to avoid contamination that would obscure our ability to find life elsewhere \u2014 if it exists; and to ensure that we take prudent precautions to protect Earth\u2019s biosphere in case it does.", "Typically, planetary protection is divided into two major components: forward contamination, which refers to the biological contamination of explored solar system bodies; and backward contamination, which refers to the biological contamination of Earth as a result of returned extraterrestrial samples.", "This NASA position, and the concept of planetary protection in general, is far from new. The role of planetary protection officer dates back to 1963, when the organization formed a position they dubbed the planetary quarantine officer. This position was later reorganized to carry out NASA\u2019s commitment to principles set forth in the 1967 \u201cTreaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies,\u201d which says:", "States Parties to the Treaty shall pursue studies of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, and conduct exploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination and also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the introduction of extraterrestrial matter and, where necessary, shall adopt appropriate measures for this purpose.", "By law, the position of planetary protection officer has a term-limit -- three years with an option to extend the post by two years -- necessitating regular job announcements. Given that NASA deals with classified defense projects, it is not shocking that the job would come with security clearance, either.", "The current planetary protection officer, Catharine Conley, spoke to Scientific American about the duties of her job:", "The purpose is explicitly to protect the activities that humans want to do. Initially that would be science, but other things will be done in the future as well. If you wanted to drill into an aquifer on Mars, it would be in the interest of future colonists that you keep the drilling clean because organisms can grow in the aquifer and change the conditions so that it is no longer available. We've seen that happen on Earth. That would be really unfortunate.", "Speaking in the forward of a NASA-published history of planetary protection, Conley described a personal experience that illustrated the importance of planetary protection:", "My interest in planetary protection is much more personal. As part of my laboratory\u2019s research on muscle atrophy, my first spaceflight experiment was flown on the last mission of the Space Shuttle Columbia that tragically disintegrated during reentry on 1 February 2003. Surprisingly, when we opened our recovered hardware several months after the accident, many of our experimental animals had survived the crash.", "Inadvertently, our research had demonstrated that, if properly shielded, even multicellular animals could survive a meteoritic-style entry event, one of the key steps required for the natural transport of living organisms between planetary bodies. This recognition makes it even more critical that we don\u2019t carry life from Earth with us on missions to search for life elsewhere\u2014otherwise, if we find some, we might not be able to tell the difference!", "To be fair to USA Today, the job does involve protecting Earth from any potential biological contamination brought back home from space as well. For example, the upcoming Mars 2020 Rover mission has floated the idea of caching samples on the surface of the planet for later return to Earth by another mission. Such proposals must be evaluated by and designed in conjunction with the planetary protection officer to make sure nothing biologically native to Mars would contaminate Earth.", "However, the majority of missions in NASA\u2019s immediate future are either Earth-observing missions or robotic missions to Mars or potentially far off rocky moons like Europa that will not return to Earth. That means much of the job will entail designing strategies to prevent the potential for contamination to these places from Earth, and not \u2014 as lightly suggested by USA Today \u2014 serving as an intergalactic \u201cMen in Black\u201d agent.", "May, Ashley. \u00a0 \"NASA Is Hiring Someone to Protect Earth from Aliens\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 USA Today. \u00a0 2 August 2017.", "NASA Office of Planetary Protection. \u00a0 \"Overview.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 3 August 2017.", "Phillips, Charles, R. \u00a0 \"The Planetary Quarantine Program: 1956-1973\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NASA History Office. \u00a0 1974.", "U.S. Department of State. \u00a0 \"Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 27 January 1967.", "Biba, Erin. \u00a0 \"Meet NASA\u2019s One and Only Planetary Protection Officer\"", "Meltzer, Michael. \u00a0 When Biospheres Collide.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2011. \u00a0 9780160863272", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
