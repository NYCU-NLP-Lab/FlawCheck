It\u2019s little more than two pages listing facts about immigration and urging Congress to take up the issue, and to include \"earned legal residency accompanied by a clear path to citizenship.\" It rehashes similar legislation also approved by bipartisan majorities in 2013.", "So claiming Nelson voted for a bill that included support for a pathway to citizenship is accurate, as the resolution clearly spells out. But calling the resolution \"pro-amnesty\" is harder to prove.", "In response to questions from PolitiFact, Seaman\u2019s campaign sent a two-page letter arguing that a pathway to citizenship is equal to amnesty, as \"citizenship is a measure of permanent legal relief targeted at a specific group of people.\"", "Use of the word \"amnesty\" in immigration policy is contentious, and there\u2019s no agreed upon metric by which the word should be used.", "PolitiFact did look into use of the word \"amnesty\" by Republicans critical of President Barack Obama\u2019s proposed immigration policies in 2011 and 2012, but it\u2019s much more difficult due to differences in the 1,200-page immigration bill in 2013 and the two-page resolution approved by lawmakers in 2015.", "In general, amnesty is defined as granting permanent immunity from punishment for a group of people who have broken the law.", "It\u2019s true that granting citizenship to people not legally in the country would prevent punishments like deportation and broadly serve as \"amnesty\", but the resolution is just so vague that it\u2019s difficult to call it \"pro-amnesty.\"", "A 2011 PolitiFact check found that use of the politically\u00a0charged word is \"debatable and so charged it should come with a lot more explanation.\"", "The resolution additionally doesn\u2019t really do anything other than, in the words of one supporter, \"send a strong message to Congress\" to take up immigration reform.", "Nelson didn\u2019t answer multiple calls seeking comment, but neither candidate played much of a role on any of the 2015 bills that could have actually affected the undocumented immigrant community.", "Both lawmakers voted for a successful measure making it easier for immigrants with temporary legal status to get a teacher\u2019s license in Nevada.", "And neither Seaman nor Nelson played a role in a measure prohibiting contractors from hiring unauthorized immigrants, which failed to pass out of committee.", "Ultimately, there just isn\u2019t a lot that state-level lawmakers can do on immigration policy outside of \"symbolic\" gestures like the immigration reform resolution, as it\u2019s almost entirely a federally managed issue.", "Nevada did approve driver authorization cards for people not legally in the country in 2013, but neither Seaman nor Nelson was in office at the time.", "It\u2019s worth noting that Seaman appears to have voted for the resolution during an earlier committee meeting, according to legislative records requested by PolitiFact. A video of the meeting is online, but it\u2019s difficult to tell if she\u2019s present during the voice vote.", "That isn\u2019t necessarily an endorsement, as many lawmakers will vote to get legislation out of committee to the floor so more lawmakers can weigh in. Seaman\u2019s campaign manager claims she was not in the room during the vote.", "Our ruling", "Seaman says Nelson voted \"yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging\u00a0Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country.\"", "To be clear, the \"bill\" was actually a resolution that holds no teeth. It calls for\u00a0a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country. But it's too vague to blankly say\u00a0it falls under the \"amnesty\" umbrella, and just doesn\u2019t mean much in the grand scheme of the immigration debate.", "We rate the claim Mostly True.", "Phone interview with Susan Furlong, Assembly Chief Clerk, April 5, 2016", "Email interview with Ryan Hamilton, Victoria Seaman for Senate District 6 campaign manager, March 31, 2016", "Las Vegas Sun, \"Three immigration bills to watch at the Nevada Legislature,\" May 19, 2015", "Fox News Latino, \"Nevada bill aims to extend teaching licenses to more DREAMers,\" Feb. 10, 2015", "Associated Press, \"Nevada has top share of unauthorized immigrants,\" November 18, 2014", "Roll Call, \"Immigration Bill Officially Dead: Boehner Tells Obama No Vote This Year, President Says,\" June 30, 2014", "Las Vegas Review-Journal, \"DMV: Nevada has issued 20,000-plus driving cards in first six months,\" June 29, 2014", "PolitiFact, \"Jim DeMint and other Republicans say Obama immigration plan is amnesty,\" June 20, 2012", "PolitiFact, \"Congressman tweets Obama pro- \"amnesty\" during State of the Union,\" Feb. 1, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
