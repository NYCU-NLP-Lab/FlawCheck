U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis earlier handed down a 47-month sentence in a separate case tried in Virginia.", "In his remarks outside the D.C. courthouse, Downing said, \"Judge Jackson conceded that there was absolutely no evidence of any Russian collusion in this case. So that makes two courts. Two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with any Russians.\"", "Observers on the scene were having none of it.", "\"That\u2019s not what she said!\" said someone as Downing continued speaking. \"You guys aren\u2019t lawyers, man, you\u2019re liars!\"", "Wow -- Manafort's attorney, Kevin Downing, is shouted down outside the courthouse after he falsely claims \"2 courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with any Russians.\"\"Liar!

That\u2019s not right", "If Trump could get a federal judge \u2014 or two \u2014 to give their imprimatur to that assertion, it would be a persuasive talking point.", "But that\u2019s not what Jackson said. (We are awaiting an official court transcript of her remarks from the bench; until then, we\u2019re relying on media accounts of what she said.)", "In her remarks from the bench, Jackson made a point of pushing back against the \"no collusion\" argument she read in the defense\u2019s sentencing memorandum.", "\"The \u2018no collusion\u2019 refrain that runs through the entire defense memorandum is unrelated to the matter at hand,\" she said, adding, \"The \u2018no collusion\u2019 mantra is simply a non sequitur.\"", "She also said, \"The \u2018no collusion\u2019 mantra is also not accurate, because the investigation is still ongoing.\"", "So, contrary to Downing\u2019s remarks, Jackson didn\u2019t give Manafort a clean bill of health on alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Instead, she said it wasn\u2019t at issue in the cases that reached her courtroom.", "So what about Downing\u2019s assertion that another court had also given its stamp of approval to the \"no collusion\" argument?
