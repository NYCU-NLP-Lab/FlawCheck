Emergency supplies \u2014 including water, cots and tarps \u2014 were in short supply because weeks earlier they had been diverted from Puerto Rico to help victims of Hurricane Irma.", "\u201cIn response to Hurricane Irma impacts, FEMA distributed more than 80 percent of its inventory for selected commodities from the Caribbean Distribution Center warehouse [in San Juan, Puerto Rico],\u201d FEMA\u2019s report said. \u201cHurricane Maria struck before supplies were replenished.\u201d", "But Trump\u2019s praise for his administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria largely drew criticism from some because of the high number of estimated deaths attributed to the storm.", "On Aug. 28, the Milken Institute School of Public Health released a report estimating that there were 2,975 \u201cexcess deaths in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria\u201d over about a six-month period, from September 2017 through the end of February 2018.", "\u201cThe President keeps adding insult to injury and I think his words are despicable,\u201d\u00a0San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz told CNN.\u00a0\u201cHe says he has done a good job when 3,000 people have died.\u201d", "On Sept. 13, Trump rejected Puerto Rico\u2019s official estimate in two early morning tweets.", "3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000\u2026", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2018", "\u2026..This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2018", "Let\u2019s get some of the easy stuff out of the way, beginning with the president\u2019s criticism of the Democrats and the report\u2019s methodology.", "It\u2019s not true that the higher death estimate \u201cwas done by the Democrats in order to make [Trump] look as bad as possible.\u201d It was an independent study commissioned by Puerto Rico and undertaken by researchers at George Washington University\u2019s\u00a0Milken Institute School of Public Health.", "In February, Puerto Rico announced that the Milken Institute School of Public Health would lead a study of \u201cdeaths associated with Hurricane Maria after its passage through the Island.\u201d", "At the time, Puerto Rico had estimated that there were 64 deaths caused by Hurricane Maria, but the estimate was considered low because of the lingering effects that the hurricane had on the island. For example,\u00a0nearly half of Puerto Rico\u2019s residents were still without power at the end of the year \u2014 more than three months after the devastating storm had passed.", "\u201cThe methodology will seek to analyze all data available related to mortality, including death certificates, to determine how many more deaths than usual could be related to the hurricane,\u201d Puerto Rico said in announcing the study.", "Trump also misrepresented the study\u2019s methodology, claiming it counted deaths \u201cfor any reason, like old age.\u201d", "The researchers did an \u201cexcess mortality study,\u201d which takes into account the usual number of deaths that could be expected from September 2017 through February 2018. The 2,975 figure is the estimated number of \u201cexcess\u201d deaths that researchers say occurred during that time.", "Table 1 of the report shows the number of \u201cobserved,\u201d \u201cpredicted\u201d and \u201cexcess\u201d number of deaths during the post-hurricane period. There were 16,608 \u201cobserved\u201d deaths and 13,633 \u201cpredicted\u201d deaths \u2014 meaning that 2,975 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d were \u201crelated to Hurricane Maria.\u201d", "The \u201cpredicted\u201d number of deaths was based on \u201cpast mortality patterns,\u201d including deaths and population, from 2010 to 2017. People dying of \u201cold age,\u201d as Trump put it, would be part of the \u201cpredicted\u201d number, not the \u201cexcess\u201d number.", "The 2,975 figure is not an exact count of hurricane-related deaths. But the researchers said they are 95 percent confident that the number of direct and indirect deaths falls between\u00a02,658 and 3,290.", "In his tweet, the president ignored the number of indirect hurricane-related deaths that occurred after the storm, as opposed to those directly caused by the storm.", "Trump recalled that when he visited Puerto Rico after the hurricane there were \u201canywhere from 6 to 18 deaths\u201d caused by the storm. That\u2019s not wrong.\u00a0Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island on Sept. 19, 2017, and\u00a0Trump visited Puerto Rico on Oct. 3, 2017. At the time, he was told that the death toll stood at 16. He said to those in attendance that they should be \u201cvery proud\u201d of the number of deaths compared with those caused by Hurricane Katrina.", "\u201cIf you look at the \u2014 every death is a horror,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering \u2014 nobody has ever seen anything like this.\u201d", "After all this time, however, we now know that the death toll was much higher than 18. As we said, the official death toll as of February was 64 deaths \u2014 but even then the number was considered too low.", "In an April report, the National Hurricane Center said the death toll in Puerto Rico was \u201chighly uncertain\u201d and there could be hundreds of direct and indirect hurricane-related deaths.", "\u201cIn Puerto Rico, the death toll is highly uncertain and the official number stands at 65, which includes an unknown number of indirect deaths,\u201d the report said. \u201cIt should be noted that hundreds of additional indirect deaths in Puerto Rico may eventually be attributed to Maria\u2019s aftermath pending the results of an official government review.\u201d", "Katrina is a good example of the uncertainty associated with documenting deaths from hurricanes.", "For example, the National Hurricane Center in December 2005 \u2014 several months after the storm \u2014 issued a report on Katrina that put the death toll at 1,833 (about 1,500 directly related to Katrina and several hundred indirectly) in five states. That estimate was based on \u201creports to date from state and local officials in five states.\u201d (That figure has since been revised down to 1,100.)", "Other research has produced different numbers.", "Louisiana State Epidemiologist Raoult Ratard co-authored a study with researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and concluded, in a paper published in August 2008, that there were 971 Katrina-related deaths in Louisiana and 15 deaths among Katrina evacuees in other states. (A follow-up study also co-authored by Ratard revised the number to 1,170.) Both studies analyzed death certificates and autopsy reports as well as the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team\u2019s confirmed victims database for the two months immediately after the storm. Drowning was the most common cause of death (40 percent), followed by injury and trauma (25 percent) and heart conditions (11 percent).", "But in a phone interview, Ratard told us that methodology might not be the best to use to gauge storm-related deaths in Puerto Rico.", "The storms in Louisiana and Puerto Rico are \u201ctwo different situations,\u201d Ratard told us, and so comparing the methods used to track deaths doesn\u2019t make sense. In Louisiana, many people evacuated shortly after the storm, making it difficult for researchers to track long-term effects of the storm. And so, he said, they stuck to documenting what happened during the flood and the immediate aftermath.", "In Puerto Rico, the situation was different, Ratard said. No one could evacuate. So it\u2019s entirely appropriate, he said, to look at the mortality rates in the months after the storm and compare them to similar periods in past years.", "\u201cI can see why they used the methods they used,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Puerto Rico, it was easier to document the long-term impact.\u201d", "\u201cMy impression is that they have a valid point in estimating the long-term effects\u201d in Puerto Rico, he said. From what he knows about the research, he said, \u201cit sounds reasonable to me.\u201d", "Although Trump ignores the indirect deaths attributed to Hurricane Maria, the National Hurricane Center is interested in indirect deaths and makes an attempt to count them.", "In August 2016,\u00a0Edward N. Rappaport, the deputy director of the NHC, and B. Wayne Blanchard, then with FEMA, wrote about indirect deaths in the journal of the American Meteorological Society. They wrote that \u201cdirect deaths do not tell the whole story. They do not include the important class of\u00a0indirect fatalities\u2013casualties that, while not directly attributable to one of the physical forces of a tropical cyclone, would not be expected in the absence of the storm. These losses can occur in significant numbers.\u201d", "John Mutter, professor of earth and environmental sciences and of international and public affairs at Columbia University, has studied the impact of natural disasters and the death toll of Hurricane Katrina. Mutter told us that it\u2019s difficult to measure the death toll from hurricanes for several reasons, including deciding when to start counting and when to stop, and whether various deaths should be considered hurricane-related. \u201cA lot of people die from the exacerbation of preexisting conditions,\u201d particularly the elderly, he said.", "People also go missing, and a lot of people can die in the aftermath. But how long should the \u201caftermath\u201d be?", "\u201cThere are no rules about this,\u201d Mutter said, \u201cno uniform standard on when you start or when you stop.\u201d", "But both of the experts we interviewed said the methodology used by the researchers at the Milken Institute School of Public Health was reasonable \u2014 contrary to the president\u2019s tweet questioning the high death toll estimate, the methodology used by the researchers and the motivation of the Puerto Rico government in seeking the best estimate.", "Mutter\u00a0said the study was using \u201ctried and true methodologies\u201d to get an estimate, which will have some admitted uncertainty. Such statistical models are often used in estimates of civilian casualties in conflicts, he said.", "In a statement, the Milken Institute School of Public Health stood by its \u201cstate-of-the-art mathematical model\u201d and the findings that it produced. Hurricane Maria was \u201ca very deadly storm\u201d and \u201cthe number \u2013 2,975 \u2013 is the most accurate and unbiased estimate of excess mortality to date,\u201d it said.", "It\u2019s not clear what Trump meant when he wrote, \u201cI was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico.\u201d We didn\u2019t receive a response to emails we sent to the White House for clarification.", "The federal government certainly has appropriated billions of dollars in disaster relief for Puerto Rico. In June, the Puerto Rico newspaper\u00a0El Nuevo D\u00eda\u00a0reported\u00a0that \u201cpromised federal allocations\u201d for the U.S. territory \u201ctotal about $31.6 billion,\u201d according to its analysis. The majority of that \u2014\u00a0about $20 billion\u2014 was awarded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development through its Community Development Block Grant \u2014 Disaster Recovery Program.", "At the time, El Nuevo D\u00eda noted that the amount appropriated by the government was about one-third of the\u00a0$94.4 billion\u00a0that Puerto Rico estimated in November it would need to rebuild. Then, in August, the island increased its request to Congress to\u00a0$139 billion.", "In addition to those federal funds, Trump\u2019s inauguration committee\u00a0announced\u00a0late last September that it was donating $3 million to three different charities involved in the hurricane relief efforts. That was not long after the Associated Press\u00a0reported that the committee, which had raised $107 million for Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremonies, had not donated any of its leftover money to charity, as it had pledged to do.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
