["About this rating", "In 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin opened a theme park named Patriot Park that showcases Russian military strength and history.", "The name \"Military Disneyland\" is a nickname \u2014 the park has nothing to do with Disney.", "In 2016, \"at a time of heightened patriotism and military rhetoric in the wake of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea\" according to The Guardian, Russian President Vladimir Putin officially opened a \"vast military theme park\" just outside of Moscow. At the time, Putin said that the park was part of Russia's \"military-patriotic work with young people.\" In 2017, officials announced plans to build a model of the German Reichstag, which Soviet Troops stormed in the 1945 Battle of Berlin, so that \"youth army soldiers can storm not just any building, but a concrete place.\u201d As reported by Atlas Obscura in 2015, the park is essentially a large military installation:", "The park covers more than 4,000 hectares, much of it taken up by military vehicles. There are more than 268 Soviet-era aircraft on display, including helicopters, and an armored vehicle section with around 350 tanks from various countries. Some of these can be taken for a virtual spin in the park\u2019s military training simulators. Also, keep an eye out for a few intercontinental ballistic missiles.", "For kids and adults of a warmongering nature, there\u2019s also the Military Tactical Games Center. Here, the whole family can do some fun military-grade exercises before engaging in a simulation of urban warfare with airsoft guns and replicas of famous buildings (the park is supposedly building a replica of the Reichstag for kids to invade). At the shooting range, meanwhile, visitors can unleash their inner Rambo with a variety of weapons. Children can even take a quick class in sabotage.", "\"Military Disneyland\" is an American nickname for the park, and this one presents a very different vibe than an actual Disneyland. The park's actual name in English \"Patriot Park\" (\u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a) or the \"Military-Patriotic Park of Culture and Recreation of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation\" (\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e-\u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b \u0418 \u041e\u0442\u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0421\u0438\u043b \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439).
