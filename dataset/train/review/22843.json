["About this rating", "Cayenne pepper powder is produced from capsicum peppers and contains capsaicin, the chemical responsible for a pepper\u2019s spiciness. It is also, according to some corners of the internet, extremely popular as an herbal remedy for just about every ailment under the sun. One particularly dubious claim regarding cayenne pepper comes from the website of David Wolfe, which is already well-known as a safe harbor for flawed scientific premises.", "In a widely shared article first published in February 2016 and titled \u201cHow to Stop Serious Bleeding in 10 Seconds!\u201d the website asserted the following treatment for stopping bleeding:", "If a person applies cayenne pepper to an open wound, it will stop bleeding. This even works for deep cuts that are a serious cause for concern ... Cayenne pepper returns blood pressure to normal so that clotting is easier. It can be used on any cut to stop bleeding and can be applied topically or taken orally.", "Credible evidence provided in support of this assertion was scant. Citing a dead \u201ceHow\u201d link, the website \u201ccayenne-pepper.info\u201d, and an herbal remedy book originally published in the 1970s, the article made two broad claims about how cayenne pepper might affect bleeding.", "The first claim was that cayenne pepper can stop bleeding when it is put directly in an open wound: \u201cCayenne pepper ... can be used on any cut to stop bleeding and can be applied topically or taken orally,\u201d the article reads. Though the mechanism was not clearly explained on DavidWolfe.com, other sources making similar claims suggest that \u201ccapsicum is so \u2018hot\u2019 that it has an ability to actually cauterize a wound in some cases\u201d or that \u201cit also brings blood to the area to which it is applied and therefore can enhance your healing [because] blood circulation brings nutrients and oxygen and is imperative to the process of tissue healing.\u201d", "The second claim suggests that cayenne pepper can stop bleeding when it is ingested orally. Quoting the website \u201ccayenne-pepper.info\u201d, the Wolfe article repeated the claim that \u201cwhether the bleeding is internal or external, a teaspoon of cayenne taken orally in a glass of hot water will stop the bleeding quickly.\u201d Wolfe\u2019s article suggested that the mechanism for both oral ingestion and the aforementioned topical application was the same: that the capsaicin \u201cequalizes\u201d blood pressure. The article maintained that capsaicin \u201creacts with the body to equalize the blood pressure, meaning an extra gushing of pressure will not be concentrated in the wound area as it normally is,\u201d adding that \u201cblood will quickly clot when the pressure is equalized.\u201d", "None of that is how any of this works.", "The notion that the heat perceived by a human who experiences cayenne pepper in an open flesh wound could cauterize that wound is absurd. Capsaicin does not actually create heat, but rather it binds to a specific pain receptor in a way that mimics the sensation of pain and heat. Cauterization, the process of burning (or freezing) skin with metal or chemicals to stop bleeding and prevent infection, requires actual heat, cold, or specific acids that produce chemical burns, none of which is provided by cayenne pepper powder.", "It is for related reasons that capsaicin has been investigated as a possible topical pain reliever. Several studies have shown the chemical is capable of reducing pain, likely through a process that involves depleting the chemicals responsible for sending pain signals after they are overstimulated. A reduction in pain, however, is significantly different than a reduction in bleeding.", "The top Google search results for the vaguely medical-sounding phrase \u201cequalize blood pressure\u201d are links to the very same articles about capsaicin\u2019s ability to stop bleeding that we are working to debunk. However, in the herbal remedy world, the term appears most commonly to mean \u201clowering or raising [blood pressure] to normal levels,\u201d according to the 2001 book Herbal Remedies: A Quick and Easy Guide to Common Disorders and Their Herbal Treatments.", "The effect capsaicin has on blood pressure is a complicated and poorly understood area of science, and various studies suggest it has an ability to both raise or lower blood pressure depending on how and/or when it is administered. The potential ability for capsaicin to raise or lower blood pressure, however, is wholly irrelevant to the issue of wound healing, according to Lawrence Fine, a scientist with the Division of Cardiovascular Science at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. \u201cI am unaware of any science information [holding] that any change within the normal range of blood pressure will affect wounding healing,\u201d he told us via email.", "With the mysterious \u201cequalizing blood pressure\u201d mechanism squarely behind us, we can attempt to make sense of the claim that \u201cblood circulation brings nutrients and oxygen and is imperative to the process of tissue healing.\u201d Blood\u2019s role in transporting oxygen and other important chemicals within the human body is obvious and not controversial. However, specific chemicals (not scientific platitudes) are associated with the process of coagulation. \u201cClotting is easier\u201d after ingesting cayenne pepper, Wolfe\u2019s article suggested without evidence.", "\u201cI\u2019m unaware of any scientific data to support the claim that cayenne pepper can stop bleeding,\u201d Donna Di Michele, the Deputy Director of the Division of Blood Diseases and Resources at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, told us via email. \u201cCapsicum, which is a species of pepper, is sometimes listed as a food or supplement that may increase the likelihood of bleeding in individuals who are so predisposed, particularly when on an anticoagulant,\u201d she said, adding that some uncertainty in this area of research still exists.", "Indeed, this is perhaps the most perverse part of Wolfe's clickbait: the fact that the purported remedy he selected for curtailing bleeding time may in fact be associated with the risk of increasing the time it takes to stop bleeding.", "Crofton, Katherine. \u00a0 \"How to Stop Serious Bleeding in 10 Seconds!\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 DavidWolfe.com. \u00a0 Accessed 3 January 2018.", "eHow. \u00a0 \"How Does Cayenne Pepper Stop Bleeding?\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Archived 14 December 2011.", "Wolfe, Frankie Avalon. \u00a0 The Complete Idiot's Guide to Herbal Remedies.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Penguin, 1999. \u00a0 ISBN 1101222166.", "Reschke, Glenn. \u00a0 \"Learn About the Specific Health Benefits of Cayenne Pepper and How It Can Help You.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CayennePepper.info. \u00a0 Accessed 8 January 2018.", "Srinivasan, K. \u00a0 \"Biological Activities of Red Pepper (Capsicum annuum) and Its Pungent Principle Capsaicin: A Review.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr., \u00a0 July 2016.", "Pickering, Gis\u00e9le et al. \u00a0 \"Localized Neuropathic Pain: An Expert Consensus on Local Treatments.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Drug Design, Development, and Therapy. \u00a0 13 September 2017.", "Hershoff, Asa and Andrea Rotelli. \u00a0 Herbal Remedies: A Quick and Easy Guide to Common Disorders and Their Herbal Treatments.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Penguin, 2001. \u00a0 ISBN 0895299496.", "Yang, Dachun et al. \u00a0 \"Activation of TRPV1 by Dietary Capsaicin Improves Endothelium-Dependent Vasorelaxation and Prevents Hypertension.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Cell Metabolism. \u00a0 4 August 2010.", "Drugs and Lactation Database (NIM). \u00a0 \"Capsicum.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 7 January 2018.", "Heck, A.M. et al. \u00a0 \"Potential Interactions Between Alternative Therapies and Warfarin.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy. \u00a0 July 2000.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
