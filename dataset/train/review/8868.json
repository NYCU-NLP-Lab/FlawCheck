["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on March 22, 2019 | Updated on March 25, 2019", "A popular meme attributes an ageist and inflammatory remark to a supposed Democrat from New York, but there is no trace of any elected officials by the name Jenna Tull.", "We\u2019ve debunked a number of viral memes that have attempted to tie erroneous quotes to well-known political figures.", "But the latest example to gain traction on Facebook takes aim at a woman who doesn\u2019t appear to exist.", "The meme claims that a \u201crecording has been found of Democrat, Jenna Tull, of New York\u201d that contains an inflammatory quote: \u201cAmericans should be euthanized when they hit 70. They just become too dumb\u2026and think of the money we\u2019d save!\u201d", "Including a photo of a smiling, blonde-haired woman, the meme implores people to share \u201cso people know and we can get rid of her!\u201d", "The meme implies the individual is an elected official or at least a Democrat of some degree of prominence, and such a quote would no doubt be perilous to one\u2019s career. But there is no Jenna Tull from New York in Congress or in the state Legislature, and we could find no trace of local Democratic elected officials by that name, either. (The name may be a play on words.)", "Instead, reverse image searches show that the image used in the meme is of a\u00a0businesswoman whose Ireland-based company, THEYA Healthcare, makes bras for breast cancer patients and other health care garments.", "Christopher Blair, the founder of a self-described satirical publication known as America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, confirmed in an email to FactCheck.org that his publication produced the meme. It\u2019s far from the first time his work was erroneously spread as if real.", "The publication recently changed how it distributes its content. A March 10 post on the publication\u2019s Facebook page indicated that \u201ceverything that comes from this page will be branded and 100 percent transparent.\u201d Old content \u2014 including the Tull meme \u2014 was removed, and the page began applying a \u201csatire\u201d mark on its new content.", "\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s still circulating illustrates why. No matter how ridiculous we think something is, there\u2019s a potato out there willing to believe it,\u201d Blair said. \u201cThe meme was, obviously, meant to be a fairly puerile joke.\u201d", "The meme confused and deceived some. A number of readers asked us about the meme\u2019s veracity, and several users who came across it contacted an actual woman named Jenna Tull from Indianapolis on Facebook.", "Tull, a 34-year-old self-described socialist who makes\u00a0podcasts, told FactCheck.org that her Facebook posts are public in part because she wants to publicly show her support for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 2020 presidential campaign. But she was confused when several individuals she didn\u2019t know began commenting on her posts and sending her messages referencing the supposed quote from the meme.", "\u201cPeople started saying that I said this\u2026totally ridiculous thing,\u201d she said.", "\u201cAre you the same Jenna Tull that said that all people should be euthanized when they turn 70 because they start getting too dumb? And who decides what is dumb, a mind numbingly stupid person like you?\u201d one user commented. \u201cThis is the socialist/communist mindset to remove anyone including babies that they consider an inconvenience. Of course those in charge never take the time to examine how useless they are.\u201d", "Tull said she and a friend tracked down the meme and eventually traced the image back to THEYA; she was relieved to learn that the meme invoking her name did not also use her image.", "Still, the episode left Tull \u201cdisheartened for our country and society,\u201d she said.", "\u201cI just don\u2019t understand. We have unlimited resources and people still can\u2019t Google something,\u201d Tull added.\u00a0Instead, \u201cpeople are continuing to misuse the Internet to spread hate and to troll.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Update, March 25: We added a response from Blair confirming that the meme originated with America\u2019s Last Line of Defense.", "Blair, Christopher. Founder, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. Email to FactCheck.org. 23 Mar 2019.", "\u201cOur Story.\u201d THEYA Healthcare. Accessed 21 Mar 2019.", "Tull, Jenna. Phone interview with FactCheck.org. 21 Mar 2019.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
