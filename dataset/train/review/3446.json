Today, when I was supposed to reach there, some honoured their word and stayed back as agreed. However, some other youth, who had perhaps been influenced by other forces, began to ransack the venue. Our leaders had already reached there by then, and only I was to arrive via helicopter. However, the protesters began thronging the helipad in large numbers. Out of concern for the escalating law and order situation, I ordered my helicopter to land in Karnal instead.\u201d", "Live : \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u0915\u0949\u0928\u094d\u092b\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0938 \u0915\u094b \u0938\u0902\u092c\u094b\u0927\u093f\u0924 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f https://t.co/n4ehZk3NzQ", "\u2014 Manohar Lal (@mlkhattar) January 10, 2021", "Two major news outlets, Dainik Jagran and News18, therefore incorrectly reported that the reason for the cancellation of CM Khattar\u2019s Kisan Mahapanchayat was bad weather.
