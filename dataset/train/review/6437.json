The first was an article on the popular Washington, D.C., news site, Politico. It was written in March 2013, before Kingston announced he was running for the U.S. Senate. The article was about Broun \"yanking much of the congressional delegation to the right and throwing their votes and the support of leadership into a daily flux.\"", "The Politico article reported that Kingston admitted that Broun\u2019s rightward leanings were changing his voting pattern.

Furthermore, Congressman Gingrey has voted countless times not to raise the debt ceiling -- a hard stance he took long before announcing his candidacy for U.S. Senate. The will of his constituency has always been, and will always be, the only bellwether for his judgement as a public servant.\"", "To sum up, Broun said in the article that fellow congressmen Gingrey and Kingston have \"even changed votes to what I voted, multiple times.\"", "Broun\u2019s case against Gingrey is a matter of perception.", "In Kingston\u2019s case, it boils down to who do you believe?
