The accompanying post claims it is \"the cancer of a woman that was extracted through surgery\".", "The person holds what appears to be\u00a0a garlic clove close to the dish, seemingly causing the\u00a0black blob\u00a0to move away. The test is repeated with a ring, which seems to attract the substance.", "\"Placing a garlic clove next to the cancer, the cancer moves away from it, trying to keep its distance. Upon placing gold next to the cancer, it is drawn towards the gold and keeps coming closer to it,\" the post reads.", "\"Those who have cancer please be advised to avoid wearing gold so as to avoid the cancer's deteriorating and worsened effects on the body. On the other hand, please keep on consuming garlic. Please keep on forwarding this.

Epidemiological studies indicate some associations of Allium vegetable consumption with decreased risk of cancer, particularly cancers of the gastrointestinal tract,\u201d Herbst said.", "Recent studies suggest high garlic and onion consumption could also protect against other cancers such as prostate, breast and lung cancer - read this medical journal for more.", "However,\u00a0\"it is absolutely irrational to think that there is a silver bullet to treat all cancers especially because of the complexity of the disease,\u201d said Imran Keeka, a South African doctor based in\u00a0Kwa-Zulu Natal province.", "Keeka has been a specialist in Chinese medicine for almost two decades - with a special interest in integrative oncology.
