["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on June 4, 2020", "Democratic politicians have criticized President Donald Trump for the use of \u201ctear gas\u201d to disperse protesters near the White House on June 1 before Trump walked to St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church to pose for photos with a Bible. The president countered, \u201cThey didn\u2019t use tear gas.\u201d", "U.S. Park Police says officers used \u201cpepper balls,\u201d not \u201ctear gas.\u201d It\u2019s true pepper balls, which contain a pepper spray-like irritant, have a different makeup than another chemical typical referred to as \u201ctear gas\u201d (and which USPP specifically says it didn\u2019t use). But some sources consider pepper spray a type of tear gas, while others say both chemicals have the same effect on people.", "According to the Scientific American and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pepper spray is a type of \u201ctear gas\u201d or \u201criot control agent.\u201d", "Dr. Ranit Mishori, senior medical adviser for Physicians for Human Rights and a Georgetown University professor of family medicine, told us in an email: \u201cTear gas and pepper spray both belong to a class of crowd-control weapons known as chemical irritants.\u201d The chemical makeup is different, but the impact on people is similar. \u201cDuring a protest, it is impossible to tell what chemical is being used as the clinical manifestations are the same.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s reelection campaign has claimed the media was \u201cfalsely reporting\u201d that U.S. Park Police used \u201ctear gas,\u201d and in a Fox News Radio interview on June 3, Trump said the stories about clearing out the protesters with \u201ctear gas\u201d were \u201cfake. They didn\u2019t use tear gas. They didn\u2019t use. They moved them out.\u201d", "Trump didn\u2019t mention the \u201cpepper balls.\u201d Both chemical irritants cause, according to Mishori, \u201csometimes severe irritation to mucous membranes (e.g eyes, mouth, nasal passages, lungs), causing people to experience burning sensations on the skin and in the eyes, tearing, coughing, sneezing, difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, disorientation.\u201d", "LISTEN: President @realDonaldTrump calls out the Fake News for falsely reporting that the USPP used tear gas pic.twitter.com/OtDLBZ1TTn", "\u2014 Team Trump (Text TRUMP to 88022) (@TeamTrump) June 3, 2020", "The incident occurred June 1. Shortly before Trump delivered remarks in the Rose Garden, U.S. Park Police began clearing out protesters in Lafayette Square, just north of the White House.", "The Park Police Acting Chief Gregory T. Monahan said in a statement: \u201cAt approximately 6:33 pm, violent protestors on H Street NW began throwing projectiles including bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids,\u201d which caused USPP to issue \u201cthree warnings over a loudspeaker\u201d and then clear the area. Reporters who were on the ground have said they didn\u2019t see projectiles being thrown, or described the crowd as \u201cpeaceful\u201d or \u201clargely peaceful.\u201d", "Regardless of the impetus, USPP used force to move the protesters, including, as can be seen in multiple videos, loud flashes, smoke and officers on horseback.", "At about 6:50 p.m., Trump ended his speech, saying, \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going to pay my respects to a very, very special place.\u201d He and other administration officials then walked to St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, across the street from Lafayette Square, where Trump posed for photos while holding up a Bible.", "Trump has been criticized for the chain of events. \u201cWhen peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people\u2019s house, the White House \u2014 using tear gas and flash grenades \u2014 in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,\u201d presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, said.", "Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris also said in a June 2 press conference, \u201cAnd then last night I watched as President Trump, having gassed peaceful protesters just so he could do this photo op, then he went on to teargas priests who were helping protesters in Lafayette Park.\u201d", "Trump has said he didn\u2019t order the removal of the protesters. \u201cNow, when I went, I didn\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, move them out.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know who was there. I figured I was going to walk over the church very nearby,\u201d Trump told Fox News Radio. In a press briefing on June 3, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Attorney General William Barr ordered the clearing of the area the morning of June 1 \u201cto expand the perimeter by one block on each side,\u201d adding that Barr was \u201csurprised\u201d it hadn\u2019t been done yet when he got to the White House and told officers in the \u201clate afternoon\u201d to do it.", "In an interview with former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for Newsmax, Trump described the photo op as a spontaneous event and downplayed any use of force to remove protesters. \u201cThe military moved them back. I guess they just reported there were no, what would you call them, the rubber bullets or whatever. There was none of that used. They just moved them back,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know until just shortly before that I was going there. Somebody suggested it, and I said, \u2018Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s walk.\u2019 We walked from the White House and I think everything was handled pretty well.\u201d", "There are many unanswered questions about the events. We\u2019ll focus on the disagreement over whether \u201ctear gas\u201d was used, as many media outlets that covered the incident reported.", "In Monahan\u2019s statement, he said: \u201cNo tear gas was used by USPP officers or other assisting law enforcement partners to close the area at Lafayette Park.\u201d After a reporter with Washington, D.C.\u2019s WUSA9 TV reported on the canisters he said he picked up off the street after they were launched on June 1, USPP updated its statement to say it and \u201cand other assisting law enforcement partners\u201d didn\u2019t use those \u201cOC Skat Shells,\u201d either. Such shells contain Oleoresin Capsicum \u2013 an irritant derived from pepper plants.", "But Monahan said USPP did use \u201csmoke canisters and pepper balls.\u201d USPP spokesman Sgt. Eduardo Delgado told us: \u201cWe did not use CS or chlorobenzalmalononitrile, commonly referred to as \u2018tear gas\u2019 which is often used as a non-lethal option in law enforcement. I am unaware of the brand of pepperball used.\u201d", "Thomas Kearney, associate dean and professor in the\u00a0Department of Clinical Pharmacy at the\u00a0University of California San Francisco and co-author of a 2014 study on pepper spray injuries, told us he didn\u2019t have knowledge about these particular \u201cpepper ball\u201d devices, but that the USPP \u201cwas probably referring to an OC containing lacrimator. Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) is the active ingredient of peppers and activates the TRPV1 pain receptor. Whereas CS & CN have different receptors and were more toxic,\u201d he said in an email, referring to chloroacetophenone.", "He said he believed the terms were used \u201cinterchangeably- tear gas vs lacrimator.\u201d A \u201clacrimator,\u201d of course, is a substance that produces tears, and both CS and OC do that.", "In a November 2018 article, titled \u201cHow Tear Gas Works: A Rundown of the Chemicals Used on Crowds,\u201d the Scientific American said tear gas agents \u201ccan be classified into two broad categories\u201d based on the pain receptors they activate. CS, the chemical Delgado said USPP didn\u2019t use, is the first category of \u201cTRPA1-activating agents,\u201d which also include \u201cCR gas (dibenzoxazepine) and CN gas (chloroacetophenone, also used in bear spray),\u201d Scientific American said.", "\u201cThe second category of tear gas agents are pepper sprays and activate the TRPV1 pain receptor,\u201d the article said. \u201cThese are mostly derived from capsaicin, the spice compound in chili peppers. There are two compounds in common use in this category: OC gas, a concentrated solution of natural capsaicin, and PAVA, a mix of synthetic capsaicin also used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\u201d", "Dr. Rohini Haar, an emergency physician, epidemiology lecturer and research fellow at the Human Rights Center at the University of California Berkeley\u2019s School of Law, echoed Kearney\u2019s comment that the pepper sprays aren\u2019t as toxic as the CS/CN chemicals. The pepper spray category \u201chas fewer chemical or allergic reactions, but it\u2019s also an oil so it\u2019s much harder to get off and can last longer,\u201d Haar, also an adviser for Physicians for Human Rights who has studied\u00a0injuries caused by these agents, told Scientific American. \u201cIt can also cause corneal abrasions if you\u2019re shooting it directly into someone\u2019s eyes.\u201d", "The CDC calls these agents \u201criot control agents\u201d in a fact sheet, saying they are \u201csometimes referred to as \u2018tear gas'\u201d and \u201care chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.\u201d The CDC mentions \u201cpepper spray\u201d as one of those agents. \u201cRiot control agents are used by law enforcement officials for crowd control and by individuals and the general public for personal protection (for example, pepper spray).\u201d", "Mishori told us the difference between the pepper balls and CS \u201cis in the chemical makeup, but the physiological effects are similar, in terms of the chemical irritation. Pepper balls are fired from rifles and can also cause severe harm due to traumatic projectile injuries when the \u2018balls\u2019 or canisters fired at protesters hit people in the head, neck, or face. Such injuries can cause blindness, for example, if the eyes are hit.\u201d", "She criticized the use of these agents, saying they are called \u201cnon-lethal\u201d but severe injuries and even deaths have been documented. \u201cDeploying chemical irritants against peaceful protestors in a public park to clear a path for President Trump to pose for photos was an egregious, dangerous, and excessive abuse of force,\u201d Mishori said.", "In a 2018 report, Physicians for Human Rights found: \u201cA systematic review of medical literature documenting the health effects of chemical irritants identified 5,131 people who suffered injuries; two of these people died and 70 suffered permanent disabilities.\u201d The canisters were the cause of one of the deaths and several injuries.", "Kearney\u2019s 2014 study reviewed 10 years of pepper spray exposures reported to a poison control system (from 2002 to 2011) and found \u201ca low 1 in 15 potential risk for more severe adverse health effects in persons exposed to pepper spray that warranted a medical evaluation. The risk was highest when used for training of law enforcement personnel and involved severe ocular symptoms.\u201d", "Chemical irritants are actually banned from use in war by the Chemical Weapons Convention, Mishori and Kearney said, but the convention includes an exception for \u201c[l]aw enforcement including domestic riot control purposes.\u201d Trump signed legislation last year that banned the commercial exportation of certain riot-control devices to Hong Kong police. The list of \u201ccovered munitions\u201d included \u201cpepper balls.\u201d", "Trump may object to the term \u201ctear gas\u201d because it may connote a harsher tactic than using \u201cpepper balls\u201d or \u201cpepper spray.\u201d But Mishori said it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to discern which chemical was being used during the protest, since they cause the same health impacts. The president\u2019s claim that law enforcement \u201cdidn\u2019t use tear gas,\u201d without mentioning the pepper balls, leaves the false impression that no chemical agents were used. The USPP has admitted they were.", "It\u2019s also unclear whether other law enforcement entities used chemical irritants. When we called the National Guard Bureau press office about this, a spokesman referred us to Defense Secretary Mark Esper\u2019s statement that \u201cNational Guard forces did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas into the crowd.\u201d", "Nathan Baca, an investigative reporter with WUSA9 TV, reported that WUSA crews also picked up canisters that contained a \u201cCS agent\u201d on June 1, but USPP told the station it didn\u2019t use those canisters, either. We don\u2019t know if those canisters could have been used before the June 1 incident, as there were some type of chemical agents used on prior nights.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
