["About this rating", "On 10\u00a0March 2016, Politicalo\u00a0published an article\u00a0reporting that\u00a0Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2016 election, said he\u00a0would\u00a0use nuclear weapons on Mexico if they refused to build and pay for a border wall:", "In a Donald Trump administration, the U.S. military will be so strong that Mexico won\u2019t dare to go to war over the wall Trump wants to build between the two countries. On MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, \u201cWould you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall?\u201d \u201cTrust me Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexico\u2019s not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isn\u2019t playing with us with war,\u201d Trump responded Wednesday. One of Trump\u2019s signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials\u2019 emphatic insistence that they\u2019ll never cough up the dough.", "\u201cBecause nobody every messes with the American military, everybody knows that, the whole world knows that,\u201d the billionaire businessman added. \u201cWe have the single most powerful military machinery in the history of the world, on the entire planet. To go head-on against such an adversary is suicide, and they know that. That\u2019s how I know they\u2019re bluffing, because nobody is willing to commit suicide just to prove a point. And my point is, I\u2019m going to make Mexico pay for that wall, and when I\u2019m done building it, I\u2019m going to get on top and play Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u2018Born In The USA\u2019 to them, just for the hell of it. You just don\u2019t mess with the U.S., and that\u2019s that\u00a0...\u00a0Let me tell you, we\u2019ve had a similar problem with disobedience back in World War II. And you know how we fixed it? We nuked Japan, and then they surrendered very shortly. So, I think that\u2019s a pretty definitive message, and that\u2019s the hard way. Now, I\u2019ve said before that political correctness is what\u2019s killing this country, and I\u2019m standing by it. However, since I\u2019ve never been a warmonger, I\u2019m trying to tell them nicely that the ball is in their court. If they agree to pay, we\u2019ll have no problem. If they don\u2019t and they start acting up, well, we\u2019ll just have to watch a re-run of the Japanese episode.\u201d", "Comments attributed to Trump in the first paragraph were authentic, and came from\u00a0an\u00a0MSNBC appearance by the candidate in early March 2016:", "On MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, \u201cWould you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall?\u201d", "\u201cTrust me, Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexico\u2019s not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you.
