["By Robert Farley", "Posted on October 12, 2020", "A Trump campaign ad uses a clip of Dr. Anthony Fauci praising federal public health officials \u2014 saying that he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine that \u2026 anybody could be doing more\u201d \u2014 and makes it seem like Fauci was personally complimenting the president. Fauci himself says the ad lifted his words \u201cout of context.\u201d", "Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has at times been critical when President Donald Trump has strayed from the guidance of public health officials. For example, Fauci has criticized some states for opening too quickly per Trump\u2019s encouragement. He has also criticized the president\u2019s mixed messages on wearing masks, and his insistence on holding large, densely packed rallies.", "The new Trump ad begins with images of a masked Trump leaving Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and returning to the White House, as the narrator says: \u201cPresident Trump is recovering from the coronavirus and so is America.\u201d", "The narrator later says, \u201cPresident Trump tackled the virus head-on, as leaders should.\u201d It then immediately cuts to a clip of Fauci on camera saying, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that \u2026 anybody could be doing more.\u201d", "Fauci\u2019s comment came in an interview with Fox News host Mark Levin in late March.", "Levin, March 23: Dr. Fauci, let me ask you a question. You\u2019ve been doing this a long time. Have you ever seen this big of a coordinated response by an administration to such a threat, a health threat?", "Fauci: Well, we\u2019ve never had a threat like this and the coordinated response has been, there are a number of adjectives to describe it. Impressive, I think, is one of them. I mean, we\u2019re talking about all hands on deck, is that I, as one of many people on a team, I\u2019m not the only person, since the beginning that we even recognized what this was, I have been devoting almost full time on this, almost full-time.", "I\u2019m down at the White House virtually every day with the task force. I\u2019m connected by phone throughout the day and into the night. When I say night, I\u2019m talking 12, 1, 2 in the morning. I\u2019m not the only one. There\u2019s a whole group of us that are doing that. It\u2019s every single day. So I can\u2019t imagine that under any circumstances, that anybody could be doing more. I mean, obviously we\u2019re fighting a formidable enemy, this virus. This virus is a serious issue here.", "Though the ad implies Fauci was talking about Trump, Fauci never mentioned the president.", "\u201cIn my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate,\u201d Fauci said in an Oct. 11 statement to CNN. \u201cThe comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials.\u201d", "In an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Oct. 12, Fauci said he thought the Trump campaign ought to take the ad down.", "\u201cI think it\u2019s really unfortunate and really disappointing that they [officials in the Trump campaign] did that,\u201d Fauci added. \u201cAnd to take a completely out of context statement and to put it in which is obviously a political campaign ad, I thought was really very disappointing.\u201d", "In an Oct. 11 statement to NBC News, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh pushed back, responding: \u201cThese are Dr. Fauci\u2019s own words. The video is from a nationally broadcast television interview in which Dr. Fauci was praising the work of the Trump administration. The words spoken are accurate, and directly from Dr. Fauci\u2019s mouth.\u201d", "Trump later echoed that, writing on Twitter, \u201cThey are indeed Dr. Fauci\u2019s own words. We have done a \u2018phenomenal\u2019 job, according to certain governors. Many people agree\u2026And now come the Vaccines & Cures, long ahead of projections!\u201d", "They are Fauci\u2019s words, but they are presented in a way to make it seem that Fauci was talking specifically about Trump and his response to the coronavirus when he says, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine \u2026 anybody could be doing more.\u201d", "However, in the context of the interview \u2014 as confirmed by Fauci himself \u2014 he is referring to the efforts of federal public health officials. Even though they are members of the Trump administration, that is not the same thing as praising Trump\u2019s response, which has occasionally been at odds with the guidance of public health officials on everything from reopening states safely to wearing masks and holding rallies.", "Since early April, public health officials with the Trump administration have been \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar recently put it, in support of the public wearing masks when social distancing is not possible. But as we have written, Trump has repeatedly raised doubts about the science, noting that health experts who now advocate public mask-wearing were once opposed to it.", "In July, Fauci said the president\u2019s mixed messages on wearing masks were \u201cnot helpful.\u201d", "\u201cBut I can tell you, you\u2019d have to say it\u2019s not helpful if people get signals about not wearing masks when we are trying to get people to universally wear masks,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cMy feeling about what we should do with masks is very, very clearly understood by everyone including those in the White House.\u201d", "Fauci also took issue with Trump repeatedly promoting the drug hydroxychloroquine, even though members of the administration\u2019s coronavirus task force, including Fauci, warned that scientific studies did not support using the drug to treat COVID-19.", "\u201cWe know that every single good study \u2014 and by good study I mean randomized control study in which the data are firm and believable \u2014 has shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of COVID-19,\u201d Fauci said in July.", "As the president encouraged and prodded states to lift restrictions on business closures, Fauci faulted some states for opening too quickly, in contradiction of federal guidelines.", "\u201cThere are some times when despite the guidelines and the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently, some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly,\u201d Fauci said in July.", "Fauci singled out Florida as an example, saying, \u201cCertainly Florida I know, you know, I think jumped over a couple of checkpoints.\u201d", "Trump repeatedly praised early-opening states, such as Florida, even when some failed to meet the federal guidelines for reopening safely.", "Fauci also has been critical of Trump\u2019s insistence on holding densely packed campaign rallies, two of them indoors, where many attendees didn\u2019t wear masks.", "In mid-June, as Trump was gearing up for an indoor rally in Tulsa, Fauci was asked if he would attend a Trump rally. \u201cI\u2019m in a high-risk category. Personally, I would not. Of course not,\u201d Fauci, who\u2019s 79, said.", "In September, \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d host  Gayle King asked Fauci if the prevalence of attendees at Trump rallies not wearing masks was frustrating him. Fauci responded, \u201cWell, yes it is. And I\u2019ve said that often. That situation is, we want to set an example, because we know, we know, that when you do four or five typical kind of public health measures \u2014 masks, physical distance, avoiding crowds, making sure you do most things outdoors versus indoors \u2014 those are the kind of things that turn around surges, and also prevent us from getting surges.\u201d", "\u201cAnybody who has been listening to me over the last several months knows that a conversation does not go by where I do not strongly recommend that people wear masks,\u201d he said in an interview on Sept. 30 on ABC News\u2019 \u201cStart Here\u201d podcast.", "Fauci has at other times been complimentary of Trump\u2019s willingness to follow the advice of federal public health officials in his administration. For example, on April 13, Fauci said that when he and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, approached Trump about directing strong mitigation, the president\u2019s response was, \u201cYes, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d", "But as we said, Trump has not always been on the same page with federal public health officials. So when Fauci praises public health officials, saying he couldn\u2019t imagine \u201canybody could be doing more,\u201d that\u2019s not the same as praising Trump, as the Trump ad suggests.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
