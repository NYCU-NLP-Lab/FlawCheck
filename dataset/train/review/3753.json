["A Facebook post claiming the second wave of the Spanish flu killed significantly more people than the first has garnered the attention of a public worried by the potential future of COVID-19.", "The post, which more than 46,000 people have shared, reads:\u00a0\u201cPeople are so ready to get back to life forgetting that in 1918 the second wave of the Spanish flu reportedly killed 20-50 million. The first wave only killed 3-5 million. History does indeed repeat.\u201d", "USA TODAY reached out to the author of the post with a request for comment but did not receive a response.", "The conversation surrounding the influenza pandemic of a century ago\u00a0is not unique to social media users. Experts have drawn similar comparisons between the two pandemics in an attempt to better contextualize and understand the COVID-19 crisis.", "But many of these comparisons fail to emphasize the more stark realities of the 1918 pandemic. Less-advanced health care systems and medical technology, the lack of an intergovernmental world health agency and an ongoing world war contributed to it becoming\u00a0known as the worst pandemic in human history.", "Fact check:Why is the 1918 influenza virus called 'Spanish flu'?", "Researchers have continued to investigate the Spanish flu. Its exact death toll and case fatality rate\u00a0\u2014 the total number of deaths out of the total number of recorded cases \u2014are unknown because of incomplete and inaccurate records in some less-developed regions.", "\"In 1918, death certificate recording and epidemiology was really in its infancy,\"\u00a0Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, explained in a recent NPR article. \"We didn't have all of that data. And there were many parts of the world that were not connected to other parts of the world. So you weren't able to get data from some of the resource-poor areas that existed at that time.\"", "Alex Navarro\u00a0is\u00a0the assistant director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan. He's researched the effects of the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics for more than a decade. Despite the presence of death records in the United States, \u201cIt\u2019s really just a guess,\" he said.", "Navarro said influenza was not a reportable disease at the start of the 1918 pandemic, so it was difficult to know whether a person died of pneumonia or pneumonia caused by influenza.", "Estimates range between 17.4 million and 100 million deaths worldwide.", "Those figures come from a series of studies, including a 2018 study in the American Journal of Epidemiology, a 2002 study published in the John Hopkins University Press and a 1991 study from the Bulletin of the History of Medicine.", "\u201cWhat data there are tend to be inconsistent and of questionable validity, accuracy and robustness,\u201d the 2002 study reads.", "The claim about the Spanish flu happening in multiple waves is correct, although the number of waves is still subject to debate. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0shows\u00a0three waves on its\u00a0website, although Navarro said \u201cthere\u2019s generally considered to be four waves.\u201d", "These waves started in March 1918 and ended in the summer 1919, according to the CDC. Some believe a fourth wave happened\u00a0in select regions in 1920.", "It is true that the majority of U.S. deaths\u00a0occurred during the fall 1918, the second wave of the pandemic, although exact death counts for each wave are unknown. The CDC calculated about\u00a0675,000 total deaths in the United States. Of those, about 195,000 happened during the second wave in October of 1918. That is\u00a0roughly 28% of all U.S. deaths.", "Experts state the second wave was more severe because of genetic mutation, wartime movement and because it was \u201cmore likely to be accompanied by bacterial pneumonias,\u201d per the 1991 study.", "Experts are still debating the Spanish flu's case fatality rate.", "A 2006 CDC article says the Spanish flu\u2019s case fatality rate was around 2.5%, which would mean 2.5% of people infected died. But as science writer Ferris Jabr pointed out recently in Wired, the 2.5%\u00a0figure is likely not accurate.", "Many experts say 2.5% is too low. And the figures many media outlets and academics frequently reference \u2014 2.5% case fatality rate, 500 million infected people, 50 million to 100 million deaths \u2014 are contradicting.", "\u201cIf the Spanish flu infected 500 million and killed 50 to 100 million, the global CFR (case fatality rate) was 10 to 20 percent. If the fatality rate was in fact 2.5 percent, and if 500 million were infected, then the death toll was 12.5 million,\u201d Jabr said in the Wired article. \u201cThere were 1.8 billion people in 1918. To make 50 million deaths compatible with a 2.5 percent CFR would require at least 2 billion infections \u2014 more than the number of people that existed at the time.\u201d", "The Facebook claim considers total deaths, not the case fatality rate, although the case fatality rate is unknown in part because experts don\u2019t have an exact understanding of the Spanish flu's mortality.", "Because of the absence of complete and accurate records on the number of deaths during the Spanish flu pandemic and a lack of consensus on the length and number of the waves, it\u2019s impossible to know how many people died during each.", "For comparison to the war raging at the time, World War I had 8.5 million casualties among armed forces. It is estimated there were at least 13 million civilian casualties, though that is uncertain.", "We rate this claim to be PARTLY FALSE. Experts agree the Spanish flu occurred in multiple waves and that the second wave was significantly more deadly than the others. But it is false to attribute a specific number of deaths to each wave. Because of the lack of comprehensive medical records from 1918-20, there is not enough evidence to conclude an accurate number of deaths in any of the waves of the pandemic. Further, the CDC estimates 50 million people died overall in the pandemic, not just in the second wave.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.\u00a0You can\u00a0subscribe to our print edition, ad-free app or electronic\u00a0newspaper replica here."]
