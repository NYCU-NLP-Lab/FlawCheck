["\u201cDon\u2019t talk on the phone while on charge\u201d warns the video, shared more than 50,000 times on Facebook and more than 600,000 times on TikTok. It has spread in the United States, Canada, Nigeria, and the Philippines.", "\u201cIf someone is talking on the phone while the phone is charging, the electric waves will come through your body\u201d warns the video\u2019s narrator.", "Martyn Allen, technical director at Electrical Safety First, a charity in the UK, confirmed to AFP that the tool used in the video is a non-contact voltage indicator, commonly known as a voltage stick.", "Using the stick, the video participants establish that \u201cpower\u201d can be found in a phone charger when it is plugged into the mains and also when it is connected to a mobile phone while charging. The detector then lights up and sounds an alert when placed on the arm of someone holding the phone to his face while it charges. The alerts stop once the charger is unplugged.", "\u201cBottom line, don\u2019t charge your phones while talking\u201d the narrator concludes.", "\u201cThe video is grossly misleading,\u201d Andrew Wood, who chairs the Department of Health and Medical Sciences at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, told AFP by email, adding that \u201cany cable with a connection to the mains (and not connected to any appliance) would do the same.\u201d", "\u201cThere is nothing special about the phone in this regard,\u201d he said.", "Eric Yeatman, head of Imperial College London\u2019s Electrical and Electronic Engineering department, confirmed this, and added that other appliances would see a similar result.", "\u201cA phone charger has a unit at the wall end that converts dangerous mains voltage to harmless low voltage DC which travels along the lead and into your phone,\u201d he said.", "According to Yeatman, a \u201ctiny amount\u201d of the mains frequency may be picked up by a voltage stick but is \u201cgenerally harmless.\u201d", "\u201cThis is true for anything you hold while it\u2019s plugged into the wall, like a kitchen hand blender,\u201d which would likely yield results similar to those shown in the video if it were subject to the same test, said Yeatman.", "Allen added that a voltage stick like the one used in the video would even react to a balloon that had been rubbed on fabric.", "Some low-quality phone chargers or faulty batteries could represent a small risk of electrocution, burns or fire, none of which appears relevant to the claim in this video.", "\u201cIf you have a cheap knock-off charger then the mains leakage is likely higher, but still not causing you any harm unless it fails completely, in which case you could be electrocuted,\u201d Yeatman said. He said he was not aware of that ever happening.", "\u201cThe bigger danger from cheap chargers is that they fail and catch fire,\u201d said Yeatman.", "Costas Constantinou, Professor of Communication Electrodynamics at the University of Birmingham said by email that the only theoretical danger is \u201cif the integrated battery pack of the mobile phone was damaged it would present an elevated burn hazard during charging.\u201d", "He added there are well-documented instances of the potential fire hazard posed by lithium-ion batteries, the ones used in mobile phones, \u201cbut those have absolutely nothing to do with the erroneous claims of the post in question.\u201d", "Allen, of Electrical Safety First, concluded that \u201cthe only sensible advice is to not charge your phone while in the bath, otherwise there is little to no evidence to back up the claim that using your phone while it charges is dangerous.\u201d", "According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) \u201ccurrent evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields\u201d like the one detected by the voltage stick in the video.", "Regarding the risks of mobile phone use more generally, the US Food and Drug Administration\u00a0concluded that \u201cthe weight of nearly 30 years of scientific evidence has not linked exposure to radio frequency energy from use of cell phones to health problems.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
