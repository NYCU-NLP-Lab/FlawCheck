["Conspiracy theorists who claimed former President Donald Trump would reveal a cabal of deep-state pedophiles have been searching for new explanations that align with that\u00a0belief after his term officially concluded Jan. 20.", "One proposes that the U.S. military picked up the baton from Trump, making the baseless claim that President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration was faked and that the military is in control of\u00a0Washington.", "The conspiracy theory QAnon predicts the mass arrest of a \u201csatanic cult\u201d of pedophiles and cannibals during an event called \u201cThe Storm.\u201d Some Democratic politicians and left-leaning celebrities are believed to be elite cult members, USA TODAY has reported.", "More:What is QAnon?", "In a Facebook post that has been shared hundreds of\u00a0times, a user\u00a0wrote that Trump \u201cstepped away for a short time to let the military run the show.\u201d", "\u201cThe \u2018go\u2019 decision, when it comes, will be made by our trusted generals and not by President Trump or his cabinet,\u201d the poster wrote Feb. 1 in a message that draws from a 3-year-old post on the 4chan imageboard.", "The post\u00a0also claims that Trump sent a message to followers via a photo of the former president staring at a picture of former President Abraham Lincoln, who he wrote \u201cused the military to save the Republic.\u201d", "The user did not respond to a request for comment.", "While the\u00a0post claims that the U.S. military is \u201cin control,\u201d the U.S. Constitution names the president as commander in chief over the military.", "Two scholars selected by the National Constitution Center wrote that \u201call agree\u201d the commander in chief clause has two purposes: \u201cit ensures civilian superintendence over the military \u2013 and, as such, the subordination of the military to civilian (and democratically accountable) control ...\u00a0(and) it places such civilian superintendence in the hands of a single person.\u201d", "That means President Joe Biden controls the military.", "Congress certified Biden as the winner of the 2020 election on Jan. 6 after a pro-Trump mob broke into the U.S. Capitol in a riot that initially disrupted the counting of Electoral College votes.
