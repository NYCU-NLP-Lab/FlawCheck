Steve Rothman from shouting these nine words during a recent debate on the House floor:\n\n\"The Republicans just voted last year to end Medicare.\"\n\nDemocrats have been making similar claims since the Republican-controlled House signed off in April 2011 on a Medicare reform proposal advanced by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin). Rothman (D-9th Dist.) made that accusation -- and then repeated it -- during a Feb. 8 debate about extending the payroll tax cut.\n\nBut repeating a falsehood still doesn\u2019t make it right, Congressman.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey found that Ryan\u2019s plan would dramatically restructure Medicare, but it wouldn\u2019t eliminate the program. Also, the proposed changes would not affect current Medicare beneficiaries or others who turn 65 years old before 2022.\n\nOur PolitiFact colleagues have issued False or Pants on Fire rulings to versions of this Medicare claim in nine separate fact-checks, ultimately designating it as the 2011 Lie of the Year. Two other fact-checking groups -- FactCheck.org and The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker -- also said the claim was inaccurate.\n\nRothman spokesman Aaron Keyak said in an email that the congressman stands by his statement.\n\n\"Right now, every senior citizen is guaranteed comprehensive medical care under Medicare,\" Keyak wrote. \"The Republican plan authored by Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI), and approved by the House Republican Majority on April 15, 2011, would end this guarantee for everyone under age 55 and replace it with a voucher system that would cover only a portion of the cost of buying health insurance.\"\n\nLet\u2019s explain how the Ryan proposal would change Medicare.\n\nUnder the traditional Medicare program, which is available to anyone 65 or older, the government pays health care providers directly for services. Beneficiaries must bear the cost of deductibles and coinsurance.\n\nRyan called for converting the Medicare program to a privatized system, starting with people who turn 65 years old beginning in 2022. Under that system, the government would provide \"premium support payments\" to help beneficiaries purchase private health insurance.\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, most beneficiaries would pay more for health care through the proposed program than under the current Medicare system.\n\nIn April 2011, the House approved a budget resolution containing Ryan\u2019s proposal, but the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate later rejected it.\n\nNow, let\u2019s point out two problems with Rothman\u2019s claim.\n\nFirst, Ryan\u2019s proposal would not affect current Medicare beneficiaries or people who were at least 55 years old by the end of 2011 and later sign up for Medicare.\n\nSecondly, Medicare would still exist under the proposal, just in a very different form. Federal dollars would still be subsidizing people\u2019s health care.\n\nThe Ryan plan \"would potentially have major changes in how Medicare operates and who bears the financial costs of the program, but it would not literally do away with the program,\" Thomas Oliver, a professor of Population Health Sciences at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, said in an email.\n\nJoel Cantor, director of the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University, agreed that the Ryan plan would maintain a Medicare program, but told us the proposal \"would end the government program that most people think of when we say \u2018Medicare.\u2019\"\n\n\"Bottom line, in my view, is that the quote from Cong. Rothman is hyperbole, but has (a) thread of truth,\" Cantor said in an email, later adding that the congressman\u2019s \"comment is an over-statement of the impact of the Ryan plan on Medicare.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a speech on the House floor, Rothman repeated a claim that\u2019s been debunked many times before: \"The Republicans just voted last year to end Medicare.\"\n\nRepublicans approved a dramatic restructuring of the Medicare program, but that plan would not \"end Medicare.\" The program would remain in existence, and the proposed changes would not affect current beneficiaries or others who turn 65 years old before 2022.\n\nWe rate the statement False.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "C-SPAN, Congressman Steve Rothman speaks during House session, Feb. 8, 2012", "Congressional Record, Remarks by Congressman Steve Rothman, Feb. 8, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, Lie of the Year 2011: 'Republicans voted to end Medicare', Dec. 20, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, Democrats say Republicans voted to end Medicare and charge seniors $12,000, April 20, 2011", "FactCheck.org, DCCC Dials Wrong Number, June 13, 2011\n\nThe Washington Post, Mediscare Redux: Is McConnell holding debt ceiling hike hostage to Ryan Medicare plan?, June 13, 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Long-Term Analysis of a Budget Proposal by Chairman Ryan, April 5, 2011\n\nHouse Concurrent Resolution 34 for Fiscal Year 2012 Budget, passed the House on April 15, 2011\n\nNew York Times, House Approves Republican Budget Plan to Cut Trillions, April 15, 2011\n\nEmail interview with Joel Cantor, Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University, Feb. 14-15, 2012\n\nInterview with Judith Feder, Georgetown Public Policy Institute, Feb. 14, 2012\n\nPhone and email interviews with Thomas Oliver, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Feb. 14-16, 2012\n\nInterview with Robert Blendon, Harvard School of Public Health, Feb. 15, 2012", "Email interview with Aaron Keyak, a spokesman for Congressman Steve Rothman, Feb. 15, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
