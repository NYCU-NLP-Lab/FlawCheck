["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on November 19, 2020", "A congressman and conservative news outlets are spreading the baseless claim that the U.S. Army seized an election software company\u2019s server in Frankfurt, Germany, that could supposedly prove there was fraud in the 2020 election. There was no such seizure \u2014 and the company doesn\u2019t even have a server in Frankfurt.", "Bogus claims about voter fraud in the U.S. election have gone international.", "A falsehood that the U.S. Army seized a computer server in Frankfurt, Germany, has been circulating on social media. This server could supposedly prove that votes for President Donald Trump were switched in favor of President-elect Joe Biden.", "But the Army has conducted no such raid, and the company supposedly involved doesn\u2019t have offices in Frankfurt and wouldn\u2019t have had that kind of information.", "Still, the falsehood has been spread by Rep. Louie Gohmert, of Texas, and the two conservative TV news outlets recently promoted by President Donald Trump \u2014 Newsmax and One America News.", "Gohmert first made the claim during a video call broadcast on Facebook on Nov. 12 entitled \u201cGlobal Prayer For US Election Integrity.\u201d The host of the call, conservative evangelical leader Jim Garlow, began by referencing at least two other election-related conspiracy theories. One is based on the idea that there is a secret supercomputer called \u201cHammer\u201d that switched votes away from Trump. That\u2019s total bunk, as we reported. The other theory claims the voting machine manufacturer Dominion was involved in switching votes. That\u2019s not true either, although Trump has given the claim widespread attention by tweeting about it. We wrote about that, too.", "Gohmert\u2019s claim appears to be related to both of those debunked theories.", "\u201cI had information from some of our former intel people that there was extremely compelling evidence that could be gleaned from Scytl,\u201d Gohmert said on the call, referring to the election software company. He claimed Scytl had offices in Frankfurt and \u201cwas responsible for aggregating all the information from all the [voting] machines and whatnot\u2026 that information as to how many votes were switched from Republican for Democrat would have been easily established from the information that Scytl gathered.\u201d", "But that\u2019s not what Scytl does in the U.S. We\u2019ll explain more on that later.", "Gohmert went on to say, \u201cIt turns out, I don\u2019t know the truth, I know that there was a German tweet in German saying that on Monday, U.S. Army forces went into Scytl and grabbed their server. There are some that believe this is the U.S. intelligence that manipulated all this in order to cover their own rear ends.\u201d", "There is no evidence to support that claim. The Army has said that it conducted no such raid, and Gohmert\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for more information. It\u2019s worth noting that Gohmert didn\u2019t include that claim in a letter he signed on Nov. 13 with eight other congressmen asking the attorney general to investigate Scytl.", "Despite a lack of evidence, the suggestion that there was a raid and a seized server has appeared on Facebook, Instagram\u00a0and Twitter. Some of those posts also feature an electoral map shown on OAN that supposedly reflects the results on the seized server. OAN attributed the map to Manga Anantatmula, a defeated Republican congressional candidate in Virginia who didn\u2019t respond to our request for comment. The map shows Trump winning 410 electoral votes, including California\u2019s 55 electoral votes. Biden had a 29% lead over Trump in California as of Nov. 19, according to the secretary of state\u2019s unofficial count.", "Also, Scytl doesn\u2019t have offices in Frankfurt. The company, which is based in Spain, has a U.S. subsidiary that handled all of its U.S. election work in 2020, according to a fact sheet it posted in response to the viral claims.", "\u201cWe do not tabulate, tally or count votes in the US. We do not provide voting machines in the US. We did not provide online voting to US jurisdictions for the US elections. We do not have servers or offices in Frankfurt. The US army has not seized anything from Scytl in Barcelona, Frankfurt or anywhere else,\u201d the fact sheet said.", "The company also described the kind of work that it did conduct in the 2020 election. That work fell into four categories: visual displays of independently counted votes on election night, called election night reporting systems; electronic ballot delivery systems for overseas military voters; online training for election workers; and websites with information for voters on where and how they could vote and what kind of identification they may need to bring to the polls.", "The first two categories may be the source of some of the false claims\u00a0about Scytl\u2019s role in the election.", "The company explained that its election night reporting systems are online displays for vote tallies that have been counted by local election officials. The vote counting is done on equipment that\u2019s unrelated to Scytl. Once election officials tabulate the votes, they upload the results to Scytl\u2019s system, which then displays them online. The servers that run it are based in the U.S. \u201cScytl does NOT tabulate, tally or count any votes,\u201d the company wrote.", "Similarly, the electronic ballot delivery system offered by the company is an online platform tailored to the state that uses it. \u201cEach state has different laws and regulations regarding who can request their ballot through this system, and how that ballot can be returned,\u201d the company explained. The system does not allow online voting and it does not count votes. The servers that run it are in the U.S.", "According to another release from the company, 95 of the 3,142 counties in the U.S. used its election night reporting system to display the results in their counties online and seven states used it to provide statewide results. Three states used Scytl\u2019s electronic ballot delivery system in the 2020 election.", "Scytl is also among the 25 original members of the Election Infrastructure Subsector Coordinating Council, which works with federal and state agencies to keep elections secure.", "So, there\u2019s no evidence that the U.S. Army seized a server from Scytl that would prove election fraud. In fact, both the Army and Scytl have said that\u2019s not true.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
