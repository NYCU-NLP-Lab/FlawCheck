["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on May 14, 2019", "Sen. Kamala Harris acknowledges that a 2010 state truancy law she sponsored resulted in some parents being jailed. But she misleadingly claims that jailing parents was\u00a0an \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of the law.", "In fact, the law added\u00a0Section 270.1 to the California Penal Code to allow prosecutors to fine and/or jail a parent \u201cwho has failed to reasonably supervise and encourage the pupil\u2019s school attendance.\u201d Under the law, which was signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Sept. 30, 2010, a parent could face up to a year in jail and $2,000 fine. The law took effect in 2011.", "Harris, a Democratic candidate for president, was San Francisco District Attorney from 2004 to 2011. As district attorney, she launched a three-stage program to lower the San Francisco United School District\u2019s truancy rates in 2006. If the first two stages \u2014 education and intervention \u2014 failed, then parents could be prosecuted.", "\u201cParents of truant children who do not change course in Stage 2 are subject to prosecution,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said\u00a0in a brochure that describes the initiative. \u201cParents must report to a specialized Truancy Court we created that combines close court monitoring with tailored family services. We have SFUSD and Children and Family Services on hand to resolve underlying issues such as transportation, unstable housing, substance abuse, mental health, neglect or unresolved special education needs. Parents who are continually reluctant to send their children to school are subject to fine or imprisonment.\u201d", "The brochure said that 20 parents in San Francisco were prosecuted for truancy in 2008. We don\u2019t know how many were prosecuted in all, but the Los Angeles Times writes that no one was jailed. \u201cHarris issued citations to parents whose children missed more than 50 days of school, but none of them were put in jail,\u201d the Los Angeles Times wrote in an April 17 story.", "However,\u00a0as the San Francisco District Attorney, Harris sponsored a state Senate bill \u2014 SB 1317 \u2014 that was introduced by state Sen. Mark Leno, who is also from San Francisco. The state bill was modeled on her truancy initiative in San Francisco, and did result in some parents being jailed.", "Los Angeles Times, April 17:\u00a0Harris took that advocacy statewide, sponsoring a 2010 law to make it a misdemeanor for parents whose young children miss more than 10% of school days a year without a valid excuse. Parents could be punished with a maximum $2,000 fine, up to a year in county jail or both.", "In an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Harris said her initiative improved school attendance in San Francisco and \u201cnot one parent was sent to jail.\u201d Host Jake Tapper then asked about the state law that she sponsored.", "Tapper, May 12: Well, you pushed for a statewide law, right, a statewide truancy law.", "Harris: And the state\u2026", "Tapper: And people were thrown into jail under that law.", "Harris: Not by me.", "Tapper: Not by you, but you supported the law.", "Harris: I supported the law that \u2014 this is what I supported, and our initiative was that in the \u2014 and here\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re going to get in the weeds, but give me the patience of time to explain it.", "When I was looking at the issue of truancy, I realized that, when we define truancy, we defined it as three or four unexcused absences, you\u2019re truant. I was seeing kids that were missing up to 80 days of a 180-day school year. So, my point was, why isn\u2019t the education code recognizing that?", "What ended up happening is, by changing the education code, it also changed \u2014 it, by reference then, was in the penal code. And then that was an unintended consequence.", "And if I could do it over again, I would have made sure that it would not have increased penalties or the ability to prosecute anywhere in the state to prosecute parents, because that was never the intention. And it was never anything that I did.", "The possibility of jailing parents was not an \u201cunintended consequence,\u201d and the bill did not just change the education code. It also created a new section to the\u00a0California Penal Code, as we have already noted.", "Harris knew this, of course.", "After taking\u00a0the oath of office\u00a0as the California attorney general in January 2011, Harris said in her inaugural address that she was \u201cputting parents on notice\u201d that they could face \u201cthe full force and consequences of the law\u201d if their kids miss too many days of school.", "Harris, Jan. 3, 2011:\u00a0We know chronic truancy leads to dropping out, which dramatically increases the odds that a young person will become either a perpetrator or a victim of crime. Folks, it is time to get serious about the problem of chronic truancy in California. Last year we had 600,000 truant students in our elementary schools alone, which roughly matches the number of inmates in our state prisons. Is it a coincidence? Of course not.", "And as unacceptable as this problem is \u2013 I know we can fix it. In San Francisco, we threatened the parents of truants with prosecution, and truancy dropped 32 percent. So, we are putting parents on notice. If you fail in your responsibility to your kids, we are going to work to make sure you face the full force and consequences of the law.", "In 2013, her office issued the first statewide report on truancy. In a press release about the report, her office described the 2010 state law as \u201ccombining meaningful services with smart sanctions in the California Penal Code.\u201d", "California attorney general\u2019s office, Sept. 30, 2013: The initiative also served as a model for SB 1317 (Leno), which defined \u201cchronic truancy\u201d for the first time under state law and established the initiative\u2019s model of combining meaningful services with smart sanctions in the California Penal Code.\u00a0 The bill was sponsored by then-District Attorney Harris and was enacted in law in 2010.", "The 2013 report itself urged district attorneys to jail parents \u201cin only the\u00a0most extreme cases,\u201d because \u201cit is both traumatic for children and families and costly for taxpayers.\u201d It\u00a0provided\u00a0no statistics on prosecutions, but it said that on average \u201cdistrict attorneys reported prosecuting 3 [to] 6 Section 270.1 cases per year.\u201d It provided one example, saying the Kings County district attorney used \u201cPenal Code 270.1\u201d to jail \u201ca mother whose two elementary school children had a combined 116 absences in a single school year.\u201d (The report links to a news story that says the woman was sentenced to 180 days in prison.)", "We don\u2019t know how many people have been arrested, fined or jailed since the 2010 state law went into effect. The state attorney general\u2019s office does not keep such data, and referred us to local jurisdictions. In a March story on Harris and the impact of the law,\u00a0HuffPost provided some county-level data. It said, for example, that Kings County \u201chas charged 19 misdemeanors under Harris\u2019 law in the past four years, and at least two mothers have been sentenced to jail.\u201d", "We asked Harris\u2019 campaign about her use of the phrase \u201cunintended consequences\u201d regarding the imprisonment of some parents under the law. It referred us to comments that she made on April 17 to Pod Save America.", "But Harris gave PSA some of the same answers that she gave to Tapper.", "Harris said the educational code did not adequately deal with chronic truancy cases. She even repeated her claim that imprisonment was an \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of the state law.", "She also said the arrests were \u201cnot under my watch,\u201d and that she had \u201cno control\u201d over the arrests \u2014 even though she sponsored the state law that allowed for the arrests, and her office provided guidance to local district attorneys on when prosecutions should and should not be made.", "\u201cMy regret is that I have now heard stories where, in some jurisdictions, DAs have criminalized the parents. And I regret that that has happened,\u201d Harris told the PSA host, Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama. \u201cAnd the thought that anything that I did could have led to that, because that certainly was not the intention \u2014 never was the intention.\u201d", "That\u2019s some serious spinning. Harris said she has \u201cnow heard stories\u201d about parents being jailed, but as we said her first statewide report on truancy contained an example of a parent being jailed under the state law. It gave advice on when to prosecute and not prosecute cases. A year later, the attorney general\u2019s\u00a02014 report\u00a0on truancy said that \u201cprosecution should be a last resort\u201d \u2014 but it did not say imprisoning parents should never be done.", "Clearly, the state law intended for some parents to be jailed for their children\u2019s chronic truancy, despite Harris\u2019 claim that jailing parents was an \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of the law. She may regret the law, but she can\u2019t redefine it.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
