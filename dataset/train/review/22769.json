It\u2019s defined as \"the crime of using dishonest methods to take something valuable\" from someone or something; and as the intentional use of \"dishonest means to deprive another\" of money, property or a legal right.", "Are errors made in the programs Johnson cited -- people who aren\u2019t eligible still getting benefits, or getting more than they should?", "Sure -- tens of billions of dollars worth per year.", "But in terms of fraud, there\u2019s no evidence the rate in the four programs is anywhere near 20 or 25 percent.", "Johnson\u2019s response", "When we asked for evidence to back Johnson\u2019s claim, Johnson policy advisor Patrick McIlheran told us the senator meant error rates in the various programs, not actual fraud.", "\"The former is of interest to taxpayers, the latter is a matter for prosecutors,\" McIlheran said in an email.", "The next day, however, Johnson conceded he had erred -- even though he continued to use the term fraud.", "In a statement, Johnson said that when he made his claim, he was \"primarily referencing fraud\" in the Earned Income Tax Credit program.", "But, he added:", "\"I made too broad a generalization to other mandatory spending programs based on reports in the press and from colleagues that are not supported by other inspector general reports. I strive hard to convey accurate information that is fully supportable, and I was mistaken in making this overly broad generalization,\" the statement read.", "\"This inaccuracy, however, should not detract from the larger point I was trying to make: Fraud is a significant and serious problem.\"", "Johnson cited a U.S. Government Accountability Office report which said that in 2011, federal agencies estimated that $115.3 billion in improper payments were attributable to 79 programs spread among 17 agencies.", "The error rate was 4.7 percent.", "So, the senator admits his claim is false; let\u2019s see just what the numbers are.", "Before we review each of the four programs Johnson singled out, it\u2019s important to note the difference between fraud and error rates.", "As Malcolm Sparrow, a specialist in corruption control at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, told PolitiFact National, fraud and improper payments are far from identical.", "\"There is a serious problem with conflating these different types of overpayment,\" he said.", "We found that reviews done by federal agencies, as well as by independent offices such as inspectors general and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, do not cite rates of fraud. Rather, they document or estimate error rates -- how often benefits in various programs are overpaid or underpaid.", "Such improper payments can include instances of actual fraud, but by and large they cover errors, which can be made by government workers, service providers such as physicians, and by the benefit recipients themselves. Some of the errors could be intentional, such as a taxpayer claiming a credit he isn\u2019t eligible for, but the nature of fraud makes it very difficult to quantify.
