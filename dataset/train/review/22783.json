It is merely a way to provide a sense of Yellowstone\u2019s threat level compared to other volcanoes in the USA.\"", "It\u2019s also important to note that the assessment is not an indicator of which volcanoes are most likely to erupt, according to USGS. It\u2019s also not a ranking of the most active volcanoes (and \"active\" means that a volcano has erupted in the past 11,650 years).", "Rather, assessments gauge the relative risk a volcano poses to people and property. So if a volcano erupts but no one is living on it, it has a very low threat because no people or property are at risk, according to USGS.
