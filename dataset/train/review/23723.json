["The claim was posted on Facebook here on April 2.", "The post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cIn 1918 telecommunications radio waves were deployed. (Spanish flu. )\n\t1940s radar technology was deployed.( Influenza epidemic. )\n\t2003 3G was deployed. (SARS epidemic. )\n\t2009 4G was deployed. ( H1N1 epidemic. )\n\t2019 5G being deployed. ( COVID 19 epidemic. )\u201d", "The post also includes a text image that repeats the claim about viral outbreaks -- the Spanish flu of 1918-1919, the 1950s influenza pandemic, the SARS\u00a0epidemic of 2002-2003, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the 2019 novel coronavirus\u00a0pandemic -- and innovations in telecommunications technologies. \u201cAny good and great investigator will tell you there is no such thing as a coincidence,\u201d the text image adds.", "Below is a screenshot of the misleading post:", "The claim circulated online as conspiracists promoted a theory that COVID-19 is\u00a0linked to the development of 5G, the fifth generation of wireless communications technologies, which has been rolled out around the world since 2019.", "As the hoax circulated,\u00a05G masts and cellular broadcasting towers were vandalised\u00a0in the UK and the Netherlands.", "The false claim was shared hundreds of times by Australian social media users. For example, it was published in an anti-5G Facebook group with nearly 60,000 members here and elsewhere on the platform here and here; as well as on Twitter here, here and here.", "-- 5G and novel coronavirus pandemic --", "There is no scientific evidence to suggest that 5G wireless networks caused COVID-19 or have had any adverse effects on human health, according to several experts.", "\u201cViruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks,\u201d the World Health Organization (WHO) stated.", "Dr\u00a0David Robert Grimes, an Irish cancer researcher, also refuted that claim, stressing the impossibility of mobile networks spreading the virus.", "\u201cThere is no conceivable way there is a link between 5G and COVID-19, and zero reason these daft claims should be given any serious consideration,\u201d he told AFP in an email on April 20. \u201cThere is absolutely no known way that viruses can travel on radio waves, and anyone pushing that claim has a dubious grasp of biology, physics, and medicine.\u201d", "Grimes explained the only difference between\u00a05G and the current 4G network is a slightly higher frequency. The frequency increase and the use of milimetre waves, AFP reported here, help\u00a0to eliminate latency and improve download speeds.", "The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), a government agency charged with monitoring and regulating radiation exposure, added in a statement that radio wave exposure from 5G has not been shown to \u201caffect the immune system or cause any other long term or short term health effects.\u201d", "-- Telecommunications\u00a0technology and viruses --", "Like 5G, there is also no evidence to suggest that past generations of wireless communication technologies caused viral outbreaks.", "\u201cModern telecommunications uses radio-frequency light -- this has been used for decades and is far less energetic than ever visible light that illuminates our world. The overwhelming biophysical and epidemiological data we have to date says that these technologies have no measurable impact on our physical health,\u201d Dr. Grimes explained.", "Grimes added that there is \u201csimply no biophysical basis to any of the claims conspiracy theorists make, and they don't deserve the oxygen of publicity\u201d.", "The WHO also reported that past generations of mobile phone networks have not posed risks to human health.", "\u201cFrom all evidence accumulated so far, no adverse short\u00a0or long-term health effects have been shown,\u201d the agency said of wireless mobile networks in a statement in 2006 -- a time when mobile phone technology first became \u201ccommonplace around the world\u201d.", "\u201cFurther, radio and television broadcast stations have been in operation for the past 50 or more years without any adverse health consequence being established,\u201d the WHO added.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
