["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on November 8, 2019", "For the second year in a row, President Donald Trump inaccurately attributed California\u2019s rash of wildfires to poor forest management. He also falsely said other states don\u2019t have \u201cclose to the level of burn\u201d as California.", "Most of the Golden State\u2019s latest blazes aren\u2019t in forests, experts explained, and therefore aren\u2019t the types of fires that would benefit from better forest management. Wildfires also aren\u2019t limited to California, even if the state gets more attention for them. So far this year, for example, wildfires in Alaska have burned nearly 10 times as much land as those in California.", "Trump\u2019s comments began on the morning of Nov. 3, as firefighters in California were battling numerous fires across the state, including the Kincade Fire west of Sacramento and the Getty Fire in Los Angeles.", "In a series of three tweets, the president attacked California Governor Gavin Newsom, saying he had done a \u201cterrible job of forest management\u201d and that he \u201cmust \u2018clean\u2019 his forest floors,\u201d adding, \u201cYou don\u2019t see close to the level of burn in other states.\u201d", "The Governor of California, @GavinNewsom, has done a terrible job of forest management. I told him from the first day we met that he must \u201cclean\u201d his forest floors regardless of what his bosses, the environmentalists, DEMAND of him. Must also do burns and cut fire stoppers\u2026..", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2019", "\u2026.putting these massive, and many, fires out. Great firefighters! Also, open up the ridiculously closed water lanes coming down from the North. Don\u2019t pour it out into the Pacific Ocean. Should be done immediately. California desperately needs water, and you can have it now!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2019", "Within hours, Newsom replied via tweet: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in climate change. You are excused from this conversation.\u201d", "Later in the day, the president again blamed the fires on \u201cbad\u201d management and criticized the governor, telling reporters on the South Lawn that \u201cit\u2019s always California. Never \u2014 it\u2019s rarely somebody else or someplace else.\u201d", "Trump, Nov. 3: [Y]ou\u2019ve got fires eating away at California every year because management is so bad. The governor doesn\u2019t know \u2014 he\u2019s like a child. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. And I\u2019ve been telling this for two years: They\u2019ve got to take care of it. Every year, it\u2019s always California. Never \u2014 it\u2019s rarely somebody else or someplace else.", "Wildfires, of course, do happen elsewhere. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, an average of 61,375 human-caused wildfires occur every year across the U.S., of which approximately 7,500, or 12%, are in California.", "And contrary to Trump\u2019s claim that other states don\u2019t have \u201cclose to the level of burn\u201d as California, other states often outrank California in terms of acres burned. As of Nov. 5, more than 2.5 million acres had gone up in flames in Alaska this year, compared with fewer than 300,000 in California.", "Figures reported to the fire center show that in 2017, both Nevada and Montana had more burned land than California, and in 2016 Oklahoma did. In 2015, Alaska had the most scorched land \u2014 more than 5 million acres \u2014 followed by Washington.", "Even in 2018, when California\u2019s 1.8 million burned acres totaled more than any other state, other states racked up substantial acreage as well, including Nevada, with more than 1 million acres, and Oregon, with nearly 900,000 acres.", "Of the 198 largest U.S. wildfires between 1997 and 2018, agency statistics show that 49 occurred in Alaska, 26 were in Idaho, and 23 were in California.", "California, then, is by no means the only state with wildfires. Still, it is true that California is highly susceptible to wildfires and is home to some of the most costly and destructive fires.", "California\u2019s high risk, experts said, is explained by natural climate features and its massive population.", "\u201cThere are lots of areas that have as many or more fires than California,\u201d said University of Utah fire scientist Philip Dennison. \u201cThe difference with California is [that] it has a very large population.\u201d With 40 million people, he added, just about any fire that starts will impact someone, which is far less true in other, less populated Western states.", "University of California, Los Angeles climate scientist Daniel Swain also pointed to the Golden State\u2019s climate and geography, which he said \u201csets it completely apart from any other region in the United States\u201d and leaves it more susceptible to extreme wildfire than virtually anywhere else in the nation.", "The state, he said, goes for a long time without rain \u2014 a period that coincides with high temperatures in the summer \u2014 and then seasonal winds come in during autumn when vegetation is very dry. \u201cWhen the vegetation is as explosively flammable as it is in California toward the end of the dry season,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s surprisingly easy to spark a wildfire.\u201d", "\u201cCalifornia also has far more people living in high risk wildfire zones than any other state in the country,\u201d Swain added. \u201cGiven these facts, it\u2019s quite clear why the overall human exposure to wildfire risk is greater in California than in other states.\u201d", "As we explained last year, forest management techniques, including tree thinning and prescribed fires, can be helpful to reduce the severity of some wildfires. But these strategies aren\u2019t effective for all ecosystems \u2014 and as with 2018, the latest fires in California aren\u2019t in traditional forests.", "\u201cIt is true that a historical policy of \u2018total fire suppression\u2019 in federal forests during much of the 20th century led to a lack of beneficial, low-intensity fire,\u201d said Swain, referring to a longstanding practice of quickly snuffing out wildfires across much of the West. \u201cIn those regions, present-day wildfires tend to burn more intensely than they would have in a more natural setting.\u201d", "But, he added, that\u2019s not the situation for the latest fires. Southern California\u2019s fires are burning \u201calmost exclusively\u201d in dry brush and grasses, he said, while the landscape around the Kincade Fire is a patchwork of forest, brush and grass. The forest that is there, he noted, is largely not coniferous, which is the main type of forest \u201cwhere the historical legacy of fire suppression is most relevant.\u201d", "Dennison told us that weather conditions, too, limit the impact that management would have, and that \u201ccleaning\u201d the forest floor, as Trump suggested, \u201cwouldn\u2019t help with the recent fires.\u201d", "\u201cThere are places where fuel management is appropriate to reduce the risk of ignition or to make fire easier to control,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the high wind situations that we saw over the last couple of weeks, there\u2019s not much you can do.\u201d", "Indeed, California\u2019s current spate of wildfires coincides, as it did in 2018, with dry, hot weather and extreme winds, known as the Santa Ana winds in the south and the Diablo winds in the north. The conditions make it easy for fires to start, and once ignited, to quickly spread.", "Tinderbox conditions, of course, still need a spark, and in California, the culprit is usually a person or something related to humans, such as a downed power line.", "Climate change, too, may be a factor in making fires more severe, because more hot weather can further dry out already dry vegetation, Swain said, and precipitation declines may delay the start of the rainy season.", "\u201cRecent years (2017, 2018, and 2019) have each featured an unusually late onset of the rainy season in California and unusually late seasonal occurrence of extreme fire weather conditions,\u201d he said, \u201cconsistent with expectations of autumn drying and warming due to climate change.\u201d", "At the same time, it\u2019s worth noting that the link between climate change and fire risk is variable, and depends on location. Alexandra Syphard, a senior research scientist at the nonprofit Conservation Biology Institute, said that for interior forests, there is a significant relationship between temperature and precipitation and an increased risk of fires \u2014 and in those forests, there\u2019s \u201ca very good chance\u201d climate change could be exacerbating blazes. But in Southern or coastal California, that link is less clear.", "In a 2016 study she co-authored, Syphard found little or no statistical relationship between climate and fire severity at low-elevations or in Southern California. One reason for that, she said, could be that if conditions are already ripe for a fire, climate change can\u2019t make it much worse.", "In a subsequent study, Syphard, who is also chief scientist for a wildfire-focused insurance company, found that in places where there isn\u2019t a strong relationship between climate and fire activity, there usually is a strong human presence. \u201cWhat that suggests is that human influence at minimum can scramble the relationship between fire and climate,\u201d she said, and possibly override it.", "This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that climate isn\u2019t important, Syphard said, but it does suggest that there are proactive measures people can take to reduce wildfire risk, such as plugging gaps in roofs or putting screens on vents to prevent embers from igniting homes, as well as not continuing to build in the most fire-prone areas along the wildland-urban interface.", "\u201cBy talking only about climate you\u2019re missing part of the equation,\u201d she said. \u201cClimate is something that requires action, but by attributing everything to climate it is playing down things that we could do otherwise.\u201d", "Finally, fire experts were mystified by Trump\u2019s suggestion to \u201copen up the ridiculously closed water lanes coming down from the North.\u201d", "\u201cUsing water in rivers or irrigation canals isn\u2019t practical for keeping large areas from burning,\u201d explained Dennison.", "Syphard agreed that firefighting efforts were not being hampered by a lack of water in the state. \u201cAdding more water,\u201d she said, \u201cis not going to improve the situation.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
