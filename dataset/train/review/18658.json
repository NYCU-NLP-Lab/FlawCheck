["The Delhi Commission for Women (DCM) has recently been reported to have rebuked BJP Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel for putting up posters of Kashmiri women inside his residence. On August 8, Goel had tweeted an image of a hoarding which carried a photograph of a woman in traditional Kashmiri garb. The hoarding flashed the catchphrase \u2013 \u201c\u0927\u093e\u0930\u093e 370 \u0915\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0924\u0947\u0930\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0930\u093e\u0928\u093e .\u201d This loosely translates to \u2013 \u201cArticle 370 gone and you\u2019re all smiles.\u201d", "\u0927\u093e\u0930\u093e 370 \u0915\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0924\u0947\u0930\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0930\u093e\u0928\u093e pic.twitter.com/enYlpUBmks", "\u2014 Vijay Goel (@VijayGoelBJP) August 8, 2019", "As it turns out, an old photograph from a blog post was lifted and affixed to the poster.
