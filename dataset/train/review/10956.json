It is commonly practised in schools as well.", "Moreover, this is not the first time a political leader took an oath extending their arm in front. A 2018 image shows Congress president Rahul Gandhi with Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia (former Congress member) making a similar gesture.", "World War researcher and The Times of India editor Manimugdha Sharma elaborated on the practice of oath-taking in India and its possible linkages to the Nazi salute, if any. \u201cThe answer will have to be a bit complex. This style of salute originates from the American Pledge of Allegiance that was started in the late 19th century. The Italian fascists most likely took it from the Americans and modified it, and the Nazis took it from the fascists [Italians] \u2013 Hitler himself said that he took it from Il Duce (Benito Mussolini). But after the Second World War, the Americans had to abandon the salute due to its Nazi association and modify it to the present version where the right hand is kept over the heart. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when Indians started using this for oath-taking, but my guess is from the National Pledge that was instituted in the early 1960s. That again was inspired by the American Pledge of Allegiance,\u201d he told Alt News.", "Sharma, author of \u2018Allahu Akbar: Understanding the Great Mughal in Today\u2019s India\u2019, added, \u201cIt must be said, however, that Hindu nationalism borrowed heavily from European nationalist movements, mostly those of the fascist kind. And therefore, a lot of things started or adopted by the European fascists became part of the iconography of Hindu nationalist groups. After a while, these became divorced from their original contexts. That this style of oath-taking became popular in India after it was abandoned everywhere else or became a punishable offence only goes on to show how divorced Indian public consciousness was from fascism and the horrors it produced. Nationalism is still not a problematic term in India, and even its exclusivist forms are not frowned upon outside liberal circles when globally it raises worries. Linking Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration of oath on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel with the Nazi salute is surely smart Twitter behaviour. But academically speaking, it\u2019s lazy work. It would be wrong to assume that the Prime Minister is doing that just because the Nazis did so. In our schools and colleges, we have been taking similar oaths in a similar way for ages now.\u201d", "Congress leader Jairam Ramesh and others selectively criticised PM Modi whereas the oath-taking gesture that reminds many of the \u2018Seig Heil\u2019 salute has been used across India for decades.", "Donate Now", "\ud83d\ude4f Blessed to have worked as a fact-checking journalist from November 2019 to February 2023.", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
