["By Lori Robertson, Jessica McDonald and Robert Farley", "Posted on March 3, 2020", "Democrats have criticized President Donald Trump for his administration\u2019s response to the new coronavirus, making claims about cuts to public health programs and the silencing of government experts. But they haven\u2019t always gotten their facts right:", "It\u2019s true that the president\u2019s proposed budgets have included funding cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 but Congress hasn\u2019t enacted those cuts.", "Sometimes Democrats accurately have said Trump \u201ctried to cut back on the CDC,\u201d as Sen. Amy Klobuchar said in the Feb. 25 debate in South Carolina. Former Vice President Joe Biden used harsher language in saying in a CNN town hall on Feb. 26 that Trump \u201ctried to defund the CDC.\u201d The president proposed reducing the CDC budget \u2014 some years by double-digit percentages \u2014 not completely defunding it.", "But Democrats, including Biden, also have dropped the qualifier \u201ctried\u201d from their claims, saying uncategorically that Trump had reduced the CDC funding. On ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on March 1, Biden said: \u201cThey\u2019ve cut the funding for the CDC.\u201d", "\u201cAnd he has defunded \u2014 he had defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don\u2019t have the organization we need,\u201d former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg said in the Feb. 25 debate. In a statement issued the same day, Bloomberg said Trump \u201chas slashed funding of the CDC and other essential health agencies.\u201d", "As we\u2019ve written before, a president\u2019s budget proposal is more a statement of priorities than anything Congress would vote to enact. In fact, Republican Sen. Mike Enzi, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,\u00a0said that he wouldn\u2019t hold a hearing on Trump\u2019s latest fiscal 2021 budget, adding,\u00a0\u201cCongress doesn\u2019t pay any attention to the president\u2019s budget exercise.\u201d", "Dara Lieberman, director of government relations for the nonprofit, nonpartisan Trust for America\u2019s Health, told us: \u201cThe administration has proposed, but Congress has for the large part rejected, cuts to \u2026 CDC\u2019s budget.\u201d", "Democrats are free to criticize the president\u2019s proposals, and they have.\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a Feb. 27 news conference: \u201cThe Trump budget called for slashing almost $700 million from the Center for Disease Control, and this was the budget which came out after we knew about the coronavirus threat.\u201d", "The fiscal 2021 budget proposal did call for a $693.3 million reduction to the CDC\u2019s funding compared with what was enacted for fiscal 2020, according to this CDC budget document. That would be a 9% reduction in the CDC\u2019s budget. The president\u2019s budget proposal was released on Feb. 10, after the COVID-19 outbreak began and the first U.S. case was confirmed on Jan. 20.", "But the president has proposed cuts to the CDC in past budgets that Congress did not enact. It\u2019s misleading at best to claim Trump \u201cslashed funding,\u201d when his proposals haven\u2019t taken effect. For instance, Trump\u2019s fiscal 2020 budget proposal would have reduced CDC funding by $750.6 million, compared with what was enacted for fiscal 2019 (see the \u201cprogram level\u201d line in the linked document). But Congress passed, and Trump signed, a budget that increased CDC funding by $420 million.", "For fiscal 2019, Trump put forth a $1.36 billion cut to CDC\u2019s funding in his budget proposal, but what ended up being enacted was a $261.6 million increase over what was passed the year before. The president proposed a 19.4% reduction, but Congress enacted a 3.7% increase.", "For fiscal 2018, Trump\u2019s first full budget proposal as president, he proposed a 17% reduction in funding for the CDC, but what Congress enacted amounted to a 2.3% drop in funding for the annualized 2018 continuing resolution.", "After Congress enacts a budget and passes appropriation bills, the CDC creates an operating plan for the funding. Below is a chart of CDC operating plans since fiscal 2016, which ended Sept. 30, 2016, nearly four months before Trump took office. The fiscal 2017 budget would have been enacted under former President Barack Obama; however, Congress passed continuing resolution appropriation bills for that fiscal year after Trump took office.", "The CDC\u2019s operating budgets, not adjusted for inflation, show the CDC funding has gone up a bit under Trump.", "The Trust for America\u2019s Health 2019 report on funding of the public health system includes a chart on CDC funding adjusted for inflation, and that shows a small overall decrease, of $460 million from fiscal 2016 to 2019, or $170 million from fiscal 2017 to 2019. (See Figure 2.) However, that chart notes that a comparison with 2019 funding requires accounting for a transfer of CDC funds to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. After making that adjustment, and another for one-time laboratory funding that boosted the 2018 budget, the report says the CDC had \u201cflat funding in inflation-adjusted dollars\u201d from 2018 to 2019.", "The 2020 CDC operating plan shows an increase from 2019 of 7%, adjusted for inflation, according to the Trust for America\u2019s Health.", "Overall, the group\u2019s report says there has been a \u201cchronic underfunding\u201d of the public health system in the U.S., but that began before Trump took office and has continued.", "One area of concern is funding for the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which was created by the Affordable Care Act. The ACA, which said the fund would back \u201cexpanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs,\u201d set the annual appropriation for the fund at $500 million for fiscal 2010, increasing to $2 billion for 2015 and thereafter. However, Congress, and the secretary of Health and Human Services, has used some of this appropriation for other programs and expenses.", "The PPHF \u201chas been repeatedly cut and used to pay for other legislation,\u201d the Trust for America\u2019s Health report says.", "For instance, in 2013, the HHS secretary used nearly half of the PPHF funding for implemention of the ACA\u2019s insurance marketplace, according to a 2017 Congressional Research Service report. Under Trump, Congress passed, and he signed, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which repeals $1.35 billion in PPHF appropriated funding over 10 years.", "The actual funding for the PPHF has amounted to about half of the $2 billion annually called for in the ACA since 2015, the Trust for America\u2019s Health report shows (see Figure 3). But since that has been the case for several years, the overall CDC funding doesn\u2019t show a cut from year to year.", "As we said, Trump has proposed cuts, every year, to the CDC, but they haven\u2019t been enacted by Congress. In his fiscal 2021 budget, he also proposed reduced funding for global health programs and funding to the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization. The president defended the proposed cuts when asked about them in a Feb. 26 press conference on the coronavirus.", "\u201cWe can get money and we can increase staff,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe know all the good people. It\u2019s a question I asked the doctors before. Some of the people we cut, they haven\u2019t been used for many, many years. And if \u2014 if we have a need, we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money \u2014 and I\u2019m a business person \u2014 I don\u2019t like having thousands of people around when you don\u2019t need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly.\u201d", "Some experts told the Washington Post that it\u2019s not that easy to staff up quickly during a crisis. Employment at the CDC has declined by 591 positions, or 5.4%, from December 2016 through March 2019, the most recent data available from the Office of Personnel Management.", "As for increased funding to respond to the coronavirus, the administration has asked Congress for $2.5 billion, but Democrats said that was too little. Trump said in his press conference: \u201cIf they want to give more, we\u2019ll do more.\u201d", "The Biden campaign also pointed to news reports in 2018 that the administration wouldn\u2019t renew expiring funding for the Global Health Security Agenda, a program in which the CDC works with other countries \u201cto strengthen public health systems and reduce the risk of infectious disease outbreaks.\u201d Most of that program\u2019s funding was a one-time, five-year appropriation that was expected to run out at the end of September 2019. But we haven\u2019t been able to confirm to what extent the CDC ended up cutting back on the program. We\u2019ll update this story when we have more information.", "Biden also claimed in the CNN town hall that Trump \u201ctried to defund the NIH.\u201d It\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s fiscal 2018 budget proposal called for a reduction in funding for the National Institutes of Health, but Congress instead increased the NIH budget, as several news organizations reported at the time.", "Similarly, Trump\u2019s proposal for fiscal 2020 included reduced funding for NIH, but what Congress enacted was an increase from the previous year.", "Numerous Democrats denounced the Trump administration\u2019s coronavirus response by pointing to the disbanding of a team within the White House dedicated to coordinating a response to a pandemic.", "Bloomberg first drew attention to the move in the Democratic\u00a0debate\u00a0in South Carolina.", "Bloomberg, Feb. 25:\u00a0And one of the great problems today, you read about the virus, what\u2019s really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago. So there\u2019s nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing.", "The next day in a CNN town hall he mentioned it again,\u00a0saying, \u201cNumber one, he fired the pandemic team two years ago.\u201d", "Biden also noted it in a CNN town hall\u00a0event\u00a0that aired two hours after Bloomberg\u2019s, and in an\u00a0appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on March 1, he said, \u201c[W]e set up an entire mechanism as to how to deal with future outbreaks of pandemic diseases. They [Trump administration officials] eliminated that office when they came in play.\u201d", "The Trump administration did indeed eliminate a key position that would have been involved in pandemic response.", "The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported that former National Security Adviser John Bolton\u00a0dissolved\u00a0the NSC\u2019s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense in May 2018 in a reorganization effort. That\u2019s when Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer, who was senior director of the office, left his post. He was not replaced.", "As a\u00a0report\u00a0by the bipartisan think tank\u00a0Center for Strategic & International Studies\u00a0explains, the Global Health Security and Biodefense directorate \u201cpooled NSC staff focused on domestic and international biodefense and health security issues\u201d and was designed \u201cto plan for and oversee rapid, efficient, government-wide responses to global health security threats.\u201d", "President Obama had instituted the unit in 2016 following a yearslong Ebola outbreak\u00a0in West Africa. Trump appointed Ziemer, who had been\u00a0coordinator\u00a0of the\u00a0President\u2019s Malaria Initiative\u00a0under both President George W. Bush and Obama, to head the office in\u00a0April 2017.", "Ziemer departed abruptly a little over a year later just as a new\u00a0Ebola\u00a0outbreak was starting in Congo. He now serves\u00a0as senior deputy assistant administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance at USAID.", "Tom Bossert, a former White House homeland security adviser who helped\u00a0develop\u00a0the administration\u2019s biodefense strategy and was the\u00a0designated lead\u00a0for coordinating the American response to a biological crisis, was also\u00a0reportedly\u00a0pushed out when Bolton took over. Bossert resigned in\u00a0April 2018, a day after Bolton started as national security adviser. Three anonymous sources told\u00a0the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0that Bolton requested his resignation.", "Contrary to some recent\u00a0news\u00a0reports, Bossert was\u00a0replaced\u00a0with a\u00a0series\u00a0of people, but the job of coordinating a pandemic response does not appear to have followed. When Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0his coronavirus\u00a0task\u00a0force\u00a0on Jan. 29, he did not name current homeland security adviser Julia Nesheiwat in any capacity.", "Just because Ziemer\u2019s position was discontinued does not mean everyone who was part of the team was fired or that all of the functions of the directorate ceased. According to reporting by the\u00a0Atlantic\u00a0and the\u00a0Washington Post, some team members were shifted to other groups, and others took over some of Ziemer\u2019s duties. An NSC spokesman at the time said that the administration \u201cremains committed to global health, global health security and biodefense, and will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure.\u201d", "But the lack of someone in the White House to coordinate the response to a widespread disease outbreak in the U.S. is something\u00a0numerous\u00a0experts\u00a0and\u00a0groups\u00a0at the time had cautioned against.", "In a November 2019\u00a0report, the Center for Strategic & International Studies recommended restoring the global health security position on the NSC as one of seven key changes to better protect the American public from global health threats.", "\u201cIt remains unclear who would be in charge at the White House in the case of a grave pandemic threat or cross-border biological crisis,\u201d the report reads, noting that such leadership is \u201ccritical in navigating challenging political issues like quarantines and travel bans and in communicating to and reassuring the American public.\u201d", "\u201cThe authorities currently in place at HHS are insufficient to address these critical, complex, and often urgent interagency demands,\u201d the report continues. \u201cIn addition to coordinating the interagency process, a global health security and biodefense directorate at the NSC can reform fragmented programs and ensure higher efficiencies, strengthened accountability, and better spending of scarce resources.\u201d", "We reached out to the White House press office, but we haven\u2019t received any information on the NSC staffing.", "Biden went too far when he claimed that Trump is \u201cmuzzling\u201d government scientists and \u201chasn\u2019t allowed his scientists to speak\u201d about the coronavirus.", "It\u2019s true that government scientists were told to clear their public appearances through a newly created coronavirus task force. But scientists, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have since made numerous public appearances to talk about the epidemic.", "Biden\u2019s comments stem from a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story\u00a0on Feb. 27 that said the White House moved \u201cto tighten control of coronavirus messaging by government health officials and scientists, directing them to coordinate all statements and public appearances with the office of Vice President Mike Pence, according to several officials familiar with the new approach.\u201d", "The day before, Trump had\u00a0tapped\u00a0Pence to head up the administration\u2019s coronavirus response.", "According to the\u00a0Times\u00a0story, \u201cDr. Fauci has told associates that the White House had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.\u201d", "That led to charges from some Democrats that Trump was attempting to politicize the response to the epidemic after government scientists had contradicted him on several points earlier in the week. (For example, as\u00a0we wrote, Trump\u2019s claim in a Feb. 26 press conference that the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is \u201cgoing very substantially down, not up\u201d was contradicted by the CDC, which said to expect more cases. And while Trump said the U.S. \u201cwill essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner,\u201d Fauci said a vaccine at best won\u2019t be ready for \u201ca year to a year-and-a-half.\u201d)", "A day after the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story was published, Biden\u00a0alleged\u00a0during a Feb. 28 CNN interview that \u201cthe experts are not allowed to speak, the president has silenced them.\u201d", "Biden specifically cited Fauci, who Biden noted has worked for multiple administrations.", "\u201cYou need to let the experts speak,\u201d\u00a0Biden said\u00a0on CNN. \u201cI was told, I heard on the news this morning, Dr. Fauci is not allowed to speak publicly. What is this all about? No one takes the president\u2019s word for these things. At a minimum, he exaggerates everything. And the idea that he\u2019s gonna stand there and say everything\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry. Who\u2019s gonna believe that? Let the experts speak like we did in our administration.\u201d", "According to the\u00a0Washington Post, Fauci told lawmakers during a House briefing that day, Feb. 28, that he was not being \u201cgagged\u201d or \u201cmuzzled,\u201d though he did cancel appearances on some Sunday talk shows after Pence was tapped to lead the coronavirus response.", "According to the Post, Fauci told House members \u201cthat the change was necessary because such appearances must always be cleared, and the clearance process restarted after Pence was named Wednesday to head the response.\u201d", "\u201cLook, he said to everybody: \u2018I am not being muzzled. I want to clear that up,\u2019\u201d Democratic Rep. Mark Takano told the Post\u00a0about the exchange. \u201cBut that when the vice president took over, he was already booked. They said: \u2018Look, stop. We want to just reevaluate everything. So don\u2019t go on those programs yet.\u2019\u201d", "Biden\u2019s campaign also pointed to comments by Democratic Rep.\u00a0John Garamendi\u00a0in\u00a0an appearance on MSNBC. Garamendi, who was also in that briefing said,\u00a0\u201cInsofar as I can repeat what [Fauci] said, he said, \u2018I was not muzzled. However, I was to go on the Sunday talk shows, five of them. The vice president\u2019s office then took over the control of this situation and told me to stand down, not to do those shows.\u2019 Now you can draw your own conclusions whether he was muzzled or not, but clearly he was scheduled to do Sunday talk shows and he was told not to proceed with that.\u201d", "Later that day, Fauci appeared on\u00a0MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball with Chris Matthews\u201d\u00a0and said the situation was \u201ccompletely misconstrued.\u201d Fauci also was interviewed by\u00a0Politico\u00a0that same day, Feb. 28, and he talked about striking a balance between telling the truth and not butting heads with the president.", "\u201cYou should never destroy your own credibility. And you don\u2019t want to go to war with a president,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cBut you got to walk the fine balance of making sure you continue to tell the truth.\u201d", "The following day, Feb. 29, Fauci again addressed the controversy in a White House\u00a0press conference\u00a0when a reporter asked about reports that he was being \u201cmuzzled.\u201d", "\u201cSo let me clarify,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI have never been muzzled ever, and I\u2019ve been doing this since the administration of Ronald Reagan. I\u2019m not being muzzled by this administration. What happened \u2014 which was misinterpreted \u2014 is that we were set up to go on some shows, and when the vice president took over, we said, \u2018Let\u2019s regroup and figure out how we\u2019re going to be communicating.\u2019 So I had to just stand down on a couple of shows and resubmit for clearance. And when I resubmitted for clearance, I got cleared. So I have not been muzzled at all. That was a real misrepresentation of what happened.\u201d", "In a\u00a0teleconference\u00a0after Trump\u2019s press conference, another government scientist, Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, provided further updates on the virus.", "Nonetheless, Biden continued to press the line of attack that Trump \u201cshould let the scientists speak\u201d and that Trump was \u201cmuzzling the scientist.\u201d", "Biden, ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d March 1: And, look, right now you have this president, hasn\u2019t allowed his scientists to speak, number one. He has the vice president speaking, not the scientists who know what they\u2019re talking about, like Fauci. \u2026 They should let the scientists speak. \u2026", "I see no preparedness other than a political talking points, putting someone in charge who is not a scientist \u2026 and muzzling the scientist.", "Fauci did not appear on any of the Sunday political talk shows. Instead, Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar went on the shows to talk about the epidemic and the administration\u2019s response.
