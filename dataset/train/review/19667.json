["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on November 3, 2020", "A story circulating on social media deceptively claims \u201cBad Things Are Happening in PA.\u201d It overstates the significance of a video that shows a Republican poll watcher being denied access to a Philadelphia polling place on Election Day, and it falsely claims that there was an illegal political sign at another city location.", "A deceptive story started circulating on Election Day with a headline claiming: \u201cBREAKING: Bad Things Are Happening In PA; Poll Watcher TURNED AWAY, Voting Locations Have \u2018Biden-Harris\u2019 Signs.\u201d", "The headline overstates the significance of an incident at one polling place on the morning of Nov. 3 and falsely claims that there was an illegal political sign at another location. It appeared on a site called TrendingPolitics \u2014\u00a0a self-described pro-Trump website that we\u2019ve written about before. The story that followed warned readers to \u201cbe on guard\u201d and stoked fear, saying, \u201cdon\u2019t let anyone steal your vote.\u201d", "But it doesn\u2019t provide evidence that warranted such warnings. We\u2019ll first address the claim about a Republican poll watcher being \u201cturned away,\u201d which is true, but it was the result of a misunderstanding \u2013 not an indication of fraud.", "The support for the claim that a poll watcher was \u201cTURNED AWAY\u201d came from a video posted on Twitter by a Trump supporter named Will Chamberlain. He posted the video with, \u201c#StopTheSteal,\u201d a hashtag used largely by those who claim that Democrats are trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election.", "By 4:30 p.m., the original video had more than 34,000 likes and had been promoted by the Trump campaign and\u00a0major right-wing figures, such as Steve Bannon, as well as having been featured on several dubious websites.", "But the video and accompanying stories overstate what happened.", "The poll watcher was Gary Feldman, a Republican committeeman who told us in a phone interview that he was going to that location, in South Philadelphia, to collect information about how many voters had been there so far. He went to several other polling places during the day, estimating that he went to one per hour.", "\u201cI had no other troubles during the day,\u201d Feldman told us.\u00a0\u201cThat was the only place that denied me.\u201d", "He guessed that he would have been inside the polling place for about five minutes, if he had been allowed.", "\u201cHe was denied entry, at least initially,\u201d Kevin Feeley, spokesman for the city commissioners, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview. \u201cHonestly, it was a mistake.\u201d", "The poll worker who initially rejected Feldman was under the impression that the ward number on the poll watcher\u2019s certificate had to match the polling location, Feeley explained.", "In the video, Feldman tells two poll workers, \u201cI have a citywide watcher\u2019s certificate.\u201d One of the poll workers responds, \u201cIt\u2019s not for this location.\u201d", "But, according to Philadelphia County\u2019s guide for election officials, \u201cWatchers are only permitted to be issued one Certificate for one Election District, but are permitted to use that Certificate to watch in ANY Ward/Division in Philadelphia.\u201d", "Both Feeley and Jane Roh, spokeswoman for the district attorney, said the rule had recently been changed, but neither specified when.", "The DA\u2019s office \u201ccontacted the workers there to make sure they were clear on the rules,\u201d Roh said by email.", "The other claim in the story \u2014 that there were \u201cillegal\u201d Biden-Harris campaign signs at another Philadelphia polling place \u2014 is just wrong.", "A. Benjamin\u00a0Mannes, a columnist for the conservative website Newsmax, tweeted a picture of a sign favoring Democrats outside of a Northeast Philadelphia polling place.", "That, too, was highlighted by the Trump campaign. Mike Roman, the campaign\u2019s director of Election Day operations, retweeted it with the phrase, \u201cBad things are happening in Philly.\u201d (Trump first coined that phrase in the Sept. 29 presidential debate, when he claimed poll watchers had been removed from a polling place in Philadelphia \u2014 a Democratic\u00a0stronghold in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Although that\u00a0hadn\u2019t actually happened, the president\u00a0declared: \u201cBad things happen in Philadelphia.\u201d)", "But the DA\u2019s election task force investigated the claim and found: \u201cThis polling place is located in an interior room and the sign in question is further than 10 feet from it. This tweet is deliberately deceptive.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
