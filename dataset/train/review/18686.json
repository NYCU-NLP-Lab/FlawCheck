This pattern, he said, broke down after 1968, with worker productivity consistently rising but the value of the minimum wage declining.", "\"The distinction between inflation and productivity is an important one,\" Baker wrote. \"If the minimum wage rises in step with inflation, we are effectively ensuring that it will allow minimum wage earners to buy the same amount of goods and services through time, protecting them against higher prices. However, if it rises with productivity, that means that, as workers are able to produce more goods and services per hour on average, minimum wage earners will be able to buy more goods and services through time.\"", "In the post, Baker calculated that if the minimum wage had risen in step with productivity growth since 1968, \"it would be over $24 an hour today.\"", "Baker told PolitiFact that \"the inflation adjustment can be calculated in different ways, but I can't see any way you get to $20 an hour in 2021.\"", "Biden said that \"if we kept (the minimum wage) indexed to inflation, people would be making $20 an hour right now.\"", "Indexing the minimum wage to inflation would have produced a wage today between $8.98 and $12.27, depending on which year you started the indexing.
