OUR HEALTH AUTHORITES [sic] TELL US: Drink 8 glasses per day.", "\u201cBoth toothpaste and tap water contain fluoride from the waste systems of the phosphate fertilizer industry.", "\u201cThese chemicals (90% of which are sodium fluorosilicate and fluorosilicic acid) are classified as hazardous wastes contaminated with varius [sic] impurities and known to cause cancer, infertility, brain degradation, and bone loss\u201d", "However, experts say the claim is false.", "Matt Hopcraft, an associate professor at the Melbourne Dental School, told AFP via email on November 24, 2020, that one would have to consume very high levels of toothpaste and tap water for the fluoride in it\u00a0to be toxic.", "Hopcraft explained that a toxic dose of fluoride is 5mg per kilogram of body weight, meaning that for a 70kg adult, it would amount to 350mg of fluoride.", "\u201cTap water in Australia where it is fluoridated is generally around 1 part per million (ppm), so a 250ml glass of water would have 0.25mg fluoride. An adult would need to drink 1400 glasses to reach a toxic dose! An infant would need to drink 200 glasses,\u201d he said.", "In adult toothpaste, Hopcraft added, there is 1000-1500 ppm of fluoride, and kids toothpaste generally has around 400-500 ppm.", "\u201cSo adult toothpaste will have ~0.22mg in a pea sized amount to brush teeth, and a child\u2019s\u00a0about \u00bd of that,\u201d he said.", "\u201cTo reach a toxic dose for a 10kg infant, they would need to eat half a tube of adult toothpaste. The toxicity warning on the label is related to that level of consumption \u2013 it\u2019s not saying that the normal amount of toothpaste is toxic.\u201d", "Additionally, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council stated in a Q&A on water fluoridation that it \u201cfound no evidence that community water fluoridation at current Australian levels causes human health problems\u201d.", "\u201cThe NHMRC Nutrient Reference Values for Australia and New Zealand identifies 10 milligrams per day as the upper level of fluoride intake for an average-sized adult. To meet or exceed this level of intake means drinking at least 10 litres per day of water with fluoride at current Australian levels,\u201d the document reads.", "\u201cHowever, regardless of any fluoride content in the water, this is a dangerously high level of water intake and is not recommended because of the risk of water overloading, even for people such as athletes, outdoor workers, military personnel and those living in hot and humid climates, who may approach this level of consumption occasionally.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
