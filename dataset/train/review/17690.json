["A photo has been shared in multiple Facebook posts that claim it shows a young girl pulling her father in a rickshaw to honor him after she passed her exams. The claim, however, is missing context; the image shows a travel blogger posing for a photo with an unrelated rickshaw driver in Calcutta, India.", "The photo has been shared more than 5,900 times since it was published on Facebook here on December 7, 2020.", "\u201cThis girl topped the new batch recruited to the Indian Administrative Service. This is how she showed her father to the world,\u201d the Sinhala-language text superimposed on the image reads.", "The Facebook post\u2019s caption translates as: \u201cBe ashamed if you cannot acknowledge your father in front of others\u201d.", "The image was also shared alongside similar claims on Facebook here, here and here.", "The claim, however, is misleading.", "A reverse Google image search found that the photo in fact shows a travel blogger called Shramona Poddar posing in Calcutta, India.", "Poddar posted the image on her Instagram page here on April 25, 2018. The photo is credited to another Instagram user named Bhaskar Chal.", "Below is a screenshot comparison of the image published in the misleading posts (L) and the photo published on Instagram (R)", "In the Instagram post\u2019s caption, Poddar explains that she tried hand-pulling a rickshaw to understand how strenuous the job is.", "\u201cI realized though there's a lot of mechanism involved, it wasn't a piece of cake at all,\u201d the caption reads.", "Bhaskar Chal, the photographer credited in Poddar\u2019s post, also confirmed the story behind the photo and denied that it shows a father and daughter.", "\u201cThe claim that the man sitting in the rickshaw is her father and that she is an IAS topper and so on the story goes is so not true,\u201d Chal told AFP on Instagram on February 1, 2021.", "\u201cIn fact, to give the picture more depth, the owner himself was asked to sit in the rickshaw,\u201d he said.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
