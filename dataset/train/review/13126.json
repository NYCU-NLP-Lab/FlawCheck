(We reached out to Jones through the media contact form on his Infowars.com website and did not hear back.)", "For this fact-check, we consulted three email batches Jones could be talking about -- the emails Hillary Clinton made public during her time as secretary of state (search the government database), the leaked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta (search the Podesta emails), or the leaked emails of the Democratic National Committee (search the DNC email database).", "Jones claimed the \"Democratic Party is sending emails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party saying, \u2018We\u2019re losing the public. Minorities are getting into the free market. We (Democrats) want to keep people in their mother\u2019s basement as baristas.\u2019\"", "There are 15 emails in the DNC email database that mention the word \"Soros,\" and five of those come from Politico email newsletters. Of the remaining 10, five reference news coverage and one is text of a speech from Trump referencing Soros (\"Forget Soros, leave him alone, he\u2019s got enough problems.\")", "The other four are from May 22, 2016, and discuss a mobile application someone was building to support the Democratic nominee. The developer of the application was looking for funding for the project, including from Soros.", "We also searched under Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundation or OSF. We found four additional emails, the most interesting of which appears to be a communications officer for OSF trying to schedule a tour of the White House.", "We did find an email, which Infowars has written about, that Soros sent to Clinton while she was secretary of state (see the email).", "The 2011 email is about unrest in Albania, which included a series of anti-government protests amid corruption charges.", "In the email, Soros asks Clinton to bring \"the full weight of the international community\" to try and ease tensions in the country. Soros writes that he is particularly concerned of the actions of Albania\u2019s prime minister and that Soros has heard of videotape showing national guard members firing on demonstrators.", "Infowars also has written about a 2014 email from Podesta\u2019s account in which Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Clinton would only attend a fundraiser for a Soros-supported group, America Votes, \"to make Soros happy.\"", "The most recent emails leaked from Podesta\u2019s account are from March 2016, and seem to be related to a meeting between Soros and Podesta.", "\"In general I think George is more interested in talking about policy than the campaign per se, though I can\u2019t imagine you won\u2019t spend some time on politics,\" Soros aide Michael Vachon wrote (read the email). \"In a separate email I will send you George\u2019s latest thinking on the migration crisis, which he is spending a lot of time on. His other big preoccupation these days is Ukraine. Both the migration crisis and Ukraine are part of his view of Europe as falling apart, and the US as ultimately not doing enough to prevent the political disintegration of its most important ally.\"", "Here\u2019s the bottom line: Whatever the emails say about Soros\u2019 access to top Democrats, including Clinton, they don\u2019t say anything akin to what Jones claimed.", "It\u2019s a bit easier to triangulate what Jones was talking about when he said, \"Remember even Hillary said that. \u2018What are we going to do to keep control of them. Keep them in the dark, keep them desperate.\u2019 \"", "He\u2019s likely referring to leaked audio of a February 2016 Clinton fundraiser in which Clinton was talking about the supporters of Bernie Sanders. Infowars wrote about this, too.", "Here is what Clinton said (bold emphasis is ours):", "Clinton: \"Some are new to politics completely. They\u2019re children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents\u2019 basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don\u2019t see much of a future. I met with a group of young black millennials today and you know one of the young women said, \"You know, none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college. And we don\u2019t believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance.\" So that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics. And so if you\u2019re feeling like you\u2019re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn\u2019t pay a lot, and doesn\u2019t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. So I think we should all be really understanding of that and should try to do the best we can not to be, you know, a wet blanket on idealism. We want people to be idealistic. We want them to set big goals. But to take what we can achieve now and try to present them as bigger goals.\"", "You can listen to the comments here, courtesy of the Intercept, but you can see how Jones distorts Clinton\u2019s comments.", "Jones said Democrats wanted to keep \"people in their mother\u2019s basement as baristas,\" to \"control them,\" \"keep them desperate.\"", "But Clinton was talking about people new to politics who grew up at a time when opportunities were difficult to find. She never once discussed controlling or keeping people desperate. Clinton did face criticism for describing Sanders supporters as people living in their parents\u2019 basement, but that\u2019s not what Jones was saying.", "Jones said, \"if you go back to the Wikileaks, from over a year ago, the Democratic Party is sending emails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party saying, \u2018We\u2019re losing the public.

Clinton did describe supporters of Bernie Sanders as working as baristas or living in their parents\u2019 basements.
