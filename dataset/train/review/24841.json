["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on August 24, 2020 | Updated on August 27, 2020", "On six separate occasions, President Donald Trump has claimed that Europe\u2019s excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic is 33% to 40% higher than America\u2019s. But that\u2019s only possible when cherry-picking numbers or ignoring Europe\u2019s larger population.", "It\u2019s a meaningless comparison anyway, experts say, given differences in population age and density, a later arrival of the coronavirus on American shores, and a still raging epidemic in the U.S.", "The president recited the misleading statistic in three consecutive press briefings, starting on Aug. 11, when he said, \u201cEurope has experienced a nearly 40% higher excess mortality rate than the United States.\u201d", "The following day, he dropped the caveat of \u201cnearly,\u201d and declared that \u201cEurope has experienced a 40% higher excess mortality than the United States.\u201d And on Aug. 13, he iterated the point again.", "Trump then repeated the claim for a fourth time on Aug. 17 in a speech in Mankato, Minnesota, after touting a decline in the fatality rate for the elderly.", "\u201cEurope by contrast has experienced a 40% higher rate of excess mortality than the United States,\u201d he said, before referencing Minnesota Republican Rep. Tom Emmer. \u201cThink about that, you don\u2019t hear those stories, they don\u2019t tell you that Tom, do they? You don\u2019t hear that in Congress, right?\u201d", "Then, in a fifth reprisal during an Aug. 19 briefing, Trump lowered the number. \u201cExcess mortality in Europe this year is 33% higher than the United States \u2014 evidence that the tragic cost of this virus is higher in other Western nations,\u201d he said. Trump then repeated the lower figure in an Aug. 23 briefing.", "The recurring statistic is part of a larger effort to cast the U.S.\u2019s experience with the coronavirus in a better light than that of its European counterparts. But, as we have written, Trump has erred on these types of comparisons before, falsely claiming that the U.S. per capita death rate is lower than \u201cmost\u201d of Western Europe and leaving the misleading impression that America is doing better than other countries experiencing recent upticks in cases.", "It\u2019s unclear how the president arrived at his 40% higher excess mortality figure. We asked the White House repeatedly for a source for the statistic and for more information on how it was being calculated, such as how Europe was being defined, but we did not receive a reply.", "So we dug into available estimates of excess mortality and also asked experts at the University of Oxford, Janine Aron and John Muellbauer, who had written a primer on excess mortality for the website Our World in Data.", "The data we found do not support the president\u2019s claim \u2014 at least not in any fair comparison of excess mortality. And an independent analysis triggered by our query revealed that when the most comparable part of the U.S. is stacked up against the hardest-hit countries in Europe, America fares worse \u2014 not better \u2014 on measures of excess mortality.", "First, it\u2019s useful to explain what excess mortality is and why it\u2019s important during a pandemic such as COVID-19. As the Our World in Data primer details, excess mortality refers to the actual number of deaths, regardless of cause, minus a \u201cnormal\u201d or expected number of deaths during a given time period. Because reporting of COVID-19 deaths may be spotty and incomplete, especially early on, statisticians can instead look at excess mortality to get a sense of the impact of the virus.", "As Aron and Muellbauer write, \u201cExcess mortality data can be used to draw lessons from cross- and within-country differences and help analyse the social and economic consequences of the pandemic and relaxing lockdown restrictions.\u201d", "Not all of the excess deaths during a pandemic period are from people who succumbed to COVID-19, although many of them likely are. Excess mortality also captures the indirect effects of the pandemic, including people who may have died from other causes because they avoided seeking medical attention or from overwhelmed hospitals, as well as increases in suicide.", "Similarly, excess mortality factors in the benefits of pandemic conditions, such as a reduction in deaths from car accidents as well as fewer deaths from other communicable diseases that may have declined as a result of COVID-19-inspired physical distancing and other public health measures.", "As a first crude approximation, we turned to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes estimates of excess mortality during the pandemic. According to the agency\u2019s calculations, between Feb. 1 and Aug. 8, there have been between 174,930 and 235,728 excess deaths across the country, for a midpoint value of 205,329 deaths.", "In comparison, through week 33 of this year, or Aug. 16, 204,634 excess deaths occurred in 24 European countries or parts of countries, according to estimates by EuroMOMO, a group monitoring mortality trends in Europe.", "The two numbers \u2014 which are about equal \u2014 are meaningless on their own, but when adjusted for population, there are 665 excess deaths per million people for the covered European area, compared with 622 excess deaths per million in the U.S., using the midpoint value.", "That works out to Europe having around 7% more excess deaths per capita than the U.S. The percentage rises as high as 26% if the lower U.S. value is used, and the roles reverse \u2014 with the U.S. having a 7% higher excess mortality rate than Europe \u2014 if the upper-end CDC estimate is used.", "The comparison is by no means perfect. The time ranges for the calculations differ; the two estimates aren\u2019t using the same methodology, and the data do not capture all of Europe. As Muellbauer told us, the estimate favors the U.S. because the areas of Europe in the EuroMOMO network tend to include those most affected by the virus and omit countries that weren\u2019t hit as hard.", "Still, the result suggests that Trump is off-base to claim Europe\u2019s excess mortality is 33% to 40% higher than America\u2019s. The only plausible way to get close to such a number requires one to select the lower-bound of the CDC estimate, and Trump would still be exaggerating.", "For a better approximation, we also compiled data from the Human Mortality Database, which has been tracking weekly death counts for 29 countries \u2014 including most of Europe and the U.S. \u2014 as a result of the pandemic.", "At Muellbauer\u2019s suggestion, we used the visualization tool to pull data for the number of excess deaths in 2020 for each country over the same time period, using the same reference years of 2015-2019 whenever possible (Germany\u2019s reference range was 2016-2019). We chose to analyze deaths through June 21 (week 25) because that was the latest available data for France \u2014 and would make the fairest comparison for the U.S. (Slovenia was excluded because it lacked data past week 13.)", "Over the Jan. 1 through June 21 period, we found the U.S. had 183,570 excess deaths, while Europe had 242,739. Using the sheer numbers, Europe\u2019s raw excess mortality is 32% higher than the U.S.\u2019s \u2014 similar to Trump\u2019s downwardly revised claim of 33%.", "But if that is the origin of Trump\u2019s statement, it\u2019s a distortion because it doesn\u2019t account for the larger population of Europe, or the fact that compared with the expected number of deaths, Europe\u2019s rate of excess mortality is in fact lower than that of the United States.", "Indeed, by this analysis, U.S. mortality is 13.3% higher than normal, versus just 10.1% for Europe.\u00a0In other words, compared to what is expected, Europe\u2019s death rate is not as elevated \u2014 and in fact, America\u2019s excess mortality rate is 32% higher\u00a0than Europe\u2019s, not the other way around.", "While we sought to answer the question of how America\u2019s excess mortality fares in comparison with Europe\u2019s, experts cautioned that the comparison itself was misguided.", "Calling Trump\u2019s claim of 40% higher excess mortality \u201chighly suspect,\u201d Aron and Muellbauer said the fundamental concern is that the U.S. is very different from Europe.", "\u201cWhether he means all of Europe or particular countries, President Trump is not comparing like-for-like,\u201d they said in an email. \u201cFirst, the U.S. as a whole has a much larger, younger, less dense population with a rather smaller fraction living in big cities than the major European countries, and we know that big cities and older populations suffered much worse excess mortality. Second, the pandemic is still raging in many states in the South and the West so that it is premature to compare the whole of the U.S. with the main European countries.\u201d", "A better comparison, Aron and Muellbauer said, is to see how well the Northeastern U.S. stacks up with the major European countries, since the timing of the pandemic and population characteristics, including population density, are more similar.", "In an analysis shared with FactCheck.org\u00a0and subsequently\u00a0posted\u00a0to the Our World in Data website,\u00a0the two economists calculated P-scores, or the percentage of excess mortality, during the 11 peak weeks of the pandemic for a variety of Western European countries and the Northeastern U.S., which includes Maine, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.", "The duo found mortality to be 76% higher than normal in the Northeastern U.S. \u2014 well above the level of any other European country. Spain was closest, with a 55% increase, followed by England and Wales (54%), Scotland (41%), Italy (40%), Belgium (38%), the Netherlands (30%), Sweden (28%), France (22%) and Germany (6%).", "On a per capita basis, the Northeastern U.S. had 142 excess deaths per 100,000 people \u2014 again more than any of the analyzed European countries. Spain had the highest per capita excess mortality in Europe, with 103 excess deaths per 100,000.", "All plausible measures of excess mortality, they said, are \u201csubstantially worse\u201d in the Northeast than in the worst-affected countries in Europe. \u201cThis is despite the later arrival of the pandemic in the Northeast,\u201d they added, \u201cwhich gave U.S. policy-makers three more weeks warning than European countries such as Italy and Spain.\u201d", "Moreover, Aron and Muellbauer expect that as more time elapses, the U.S. is likely to fare worse in comparison with Europe because of its larger ongoing epidemic.", "Other than cherry-picked or misleading figures, we find no evidence to back Trump\u2019s claim, and using a more appropriate comparison with Europe shows that the opposite is true \u2014 that even with multiple advantages, the U.S. has experienced a higher rate of excess mortality.", "Update, August 27: We updated the article to include a link to Aron and Muellbauer\u2019s full analysis,\u00a0available\u00a0on the Our World in Data website.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
