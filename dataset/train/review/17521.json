["One of the posts, shared more than 4,300 times and archived here, claims \u201cthis is the most horrific court ruling affecting all dogs and their guardians' rights in the United States we've ever seen\u201d.\u00a0It adds that \u201cyour dogs are now fair game for any cop who does not like you, your dog, dogs in general, or who is scared of dogs.\u201d", "The article also alleges \u201ccops can legally kill your dogs for the sole act of being a dog. If your dog moves, it is dead. If your dog barks, it is dead. If your dog does anything but sit silently in the other room, it is dead.\u201d", "Similar posts have also been shared elsewhere on Facebook by animal rights groups and anti-police pages. We archived some here, here, here and here.", "On April 16, 2013, police\u00a0shot and killed two pit bulls while searching a home for drugs in\u00a0the US state of Michigan, as court documents show.", "The dogs\u2019 owners, Mark and Cheryl Brown, sued the police over the killings but lost the case.\u00a0They launched an appeal against the ruling.", "AFP reviewed the 25-page final ruling (PDF below)\u00a0and could find no evidence of the judge giving police officers the right to shoot dogs for not sitting silently.", "The Battle Creek Police Department argued its officers had been forced to kill the pit bulls because of their aggressive behaviour.", "The force\u00a0referred to its \u201cPolicy on Response to Resistance and Firearms\u201d which defines a vicious dog as \u201can animal of the canis familaris species which, when either unmuzzled or unleashed, or when not confined to the premises of the owner, menaces a person in a manner which an ordinary and reasonable person would conclude to be an apparent attitude of attack\u201d.", "In his ruling (screenshot below), judge Eric Clay concluded that\u00a0\"a\u00a0police officer\u2019s use of deadly force against a dog while executing a warrant to search a home for illegal drug activity is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment when, given the totality of the circumstances and viewed from the perspective of an objectively reasonable officer, the dog poses an imminent threat to the officer\u2019s safety\u201d.", "The judgment was made \u201cgiven the totality of the circumstances\u201d involved in this particular case. Therefore, it does not apply to any and every dog as suggested in the viral claims.", "The ruling sparked anger on social media and added further fuel to an ongoing debate over US police shootings of dogs.", "A year before the shooting, law enforcement trade magazine Police ran a story asking \u201cCan police stop killing dogs?\u201d, citing cases of canine shootings by officers.", "Following the Brown verdict, Quartz published an article with the headline \u201cUS police shoot dogs so often that a Justice Department expert calls it an \u2018epidemic\u2019\u201d. And in 2017, The Atlantic wrote that \u201cdog shootings warrant national attention\u201d and indicated a \u201cpersistent problem in law enforcement\u201d.", "Rebecca Wisch, associate editor at the Michigan State University Animal Legal & Historical Center, told AFP that US police shooting dogs remained an issue in 2020.", "Wisch said there was \u201cnot necessarily one specific law that protects police officers who shoot dogs while discharging their duties.\u201d", "Instead, each state has a legal test whether the circumstances of a particular situation give an officer qualified immunity for shooting a dog.", "\u201cIt is a relatively complicated concept that hinges on whether the actions are of a discretionary function or whether they are part of an official policy of the policy agency. The analysis is also based on whether the officer acted reasonably at the time of the incident,\u201d Wisch said.", "She explained it was difficult for dog owners to prove that a police officer acted improperly by shooting their dog, adding that \u201cvery few cases are found in favour of the plaintiff-owners\u201d.", "However, one such case led to a $250,000 settlement from the city of Detroit, after its police officers shot three dogs in a marijuana raid in 2016.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
