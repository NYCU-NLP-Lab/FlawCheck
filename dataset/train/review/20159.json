["The video, which we've archived here, is headlined,\u00a0\"Victoria Falls Are Almost Bone Dry\".\u00a0It was published\u00a0on September 26, 2019 and features an unknown woman who claims to be on the Livingstone, Zambia side of Victoria Falls. She refers to the UNESCO World Heritage site as \"the Victoria Rocks\" and asks people to\u00a0\"pray for rain\".", "\u201cOh my goodness, I\u2019m in Livingstone by the Victoria Falls, well now I call it the Victoria Rocks, this is what is remaining. We definitely don\u2019t have enough water,\u201d she says.", "It led to some social media users responding\u00a0with various pictures and explanations\u00a0as evidence that the situation, while troubling, had\u00a0been exaggerated and offered an incomplete picture. See posts here and here.", "One of the worst droughts in decades", "Southern Africa is grappling with one of its\u00a0worst droughts in decades, as described by AFP in reports on food insecurity in Zambia and Zimbabwe\u00a0from October and November, 2019.", "The Zambian side of Victoria Falls has borne the brunt, as the country's President Edgar Lungu said in a tweet on October 1.", "These pictures of the Victoris Falls are a stark reminder of what climate change is doing to our environment and our livelihood.\n\t\tIt is with no doubt that developing countries like #Zambia are the most impacted by climate change and the least able to afford its consequences. pic.twitter.com/a6X0V2TrEQ", "However, water volumes in\u00a0the world\u2019s largest waterfall are typically affected by seasonal rainfall. Tourism website\u00a0Go2Africa says, \u201cthe best time to visit the spectacular Victoria Falls is from February to May, directly after the region\u2019s summer rains\u201d.", "In light of the intial claims, local tourism bodies took\u00a0to social media with the hashtag\u00a0#VictoriaFallsIsNotDry.", "Signs of improvement are already evident. The Zambezi River Authority (ZRA)\u00a0shares\u00a0data on the flow measurements carried out daily at eight out of eleven stations in the Kariba reservoir. This includes Victoria Falls as one of the key stations on the river -- and according to their measurements, the lowest flows recorded were during the 1995/96 season.", "The line graph shows that the water flow in November 2019 did\u00a0reach\u00a0low\u00a0levels not seen since 1995.", "However, the ZRA also said\u00a0the last flow measurement recorded at Victoria Falls on December 2 had increased during the week under review before closing at 227 cubic meters per second. For comparison, the reading on the same date in 2018\u00a0was 220 cubic meters per second.", "These data hinted at\u00a0what local authorities, especially those in Zimbabwe, had been saying all along -- Victoria Falls would start seeing improved water flow in due course.", "This is not the first time tourism authorities have tried to disprove claims that the falls were drying up, as seen in this 2015 video from a tourism operator.", "On December 4, 2019, Shelley Cox, co-founder of sustainable travel agency\u00a0Africa Conservation Travel\u00a0gave\u00a0AFP\u00a0a live tour of Victoria Falls using\u00a0WhatsApp video call to show that water was flowing.", "\"Some of the reports or the majority of images and videos have only showcased the Eastern Cataracts section closest to Zambia. It's given the perception that that is what the entire stretch of the Victoria Falls looks like,\" she told AFP.", "At that stage already, the section depicted on social media as being dry -- which represents about a third of Victoria Falls in size -- was seeing water start to flow. According to Cox, who\u00a0has worked at the Falls for three years, this will\u00a0increase as the region gets deeper into the rainfall season.", "\"The challenge when it's been framed in such a [narrow] way is that people who have been considering travelling, start to question whether or not they want to spend money to come and see a cliff,\" she said.", "In this statement\u00a0from December 10,\u00a0the African Travel and Tourism Authority says it acknowledges the impact climate change is having on a global scale, but\u00a0adds that in the case of Victoria Falls\u00a0seasonal weather patterns and the resultant water flow were being ignored.", "The tourism authority\u00a0goes on to explain why Zambia sees less water flowing in the dry season, mainly owing to the variance in topography across the\u00a0span of Victoria Falls, which is lower on the Zimbabwean side.", "\"Historical data provided by the Zambezi River Authority, who monitors the water level flows in the region daily, provide evidence that the annual mean water levels of the river have in fact been lower in at least six prior examples of a period spanning 1914 to the current date period,\" the statement said.", "\"For those who have been alarmed by the recent reports and somewhat sensationalised headlines, the good news is that the current records from the Zambezi River Authority are showing that water levels are once again on a consistent rise.\"", "Is climate change affecting Victoria Falls?", "The impact of climate change on the Victoria Falls remains unclear.", "However, this academic study, which looked at 40 years' worth of data from the Zambia Meteorological Department, noted that there had been \"a statistical significant change in temperature\" in Livingstone, although \"no statistically significant change in annual average rainfall\" in the town.", "The study recommended that tourism authorities plan actively for the impact of climate change on the Falls, while urging further research.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
