["The photo, which shows browning foliage next to a smart meter on the side of a residential property, was published in this Facebook post on May 3, 2020.", "A smart meter is a device that digitally measures energy use and\u00a0wirelessly sends\u00a0recordings\u00a0to energy providers, according to the Australian Energy Regulator. The devices differ from past meters in that they do not need to be\u00a0checked manually.", "The post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cWho was saying that it's safe to stand or being your anything that's 5G with the no radiation. Take a look at this picture below after a Smart metre [sic]\u00a0was installed at a house just in case for the people who can't notice half the tree is burnt closer to the meter.\u201d", "Below is a screenshot of the misleading post:", "The\u00a0image was shared alongside similar claims\u00a0on Facebook here and here, and on\u00a0Twitter here. It\u00a0was also shared with a similar claim in French, German and Portuguese posts.", "However, the claim is misleading.", "Dr. Ken Karipidis, the assistant director of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency\u2019s Assessment and Advice Section, refuted the claim, saying there is \"no established evidence\" to support the assertion.", "\u201cSmart meters and other wireless telecommunications sources emit low-level radiofrequency electromagnetic energy, which are also called radio waves,\u201d Karipidis told AFP via email on May 6, 2020. \u201cThere is no established evidence that low level radio wave exposure from smart meters and other wireless telecommunications can adversely affect plants.\u201d", "Karipidis added that the type of plant discolouration seen in the Facebook photo is\u00a0\u201clikely caused by other environmental conditions or other factors.\u201d", "A 2013\u00a0report\u00a0published by Washington State University in the US noted that plant browning, like that seen in the Facebook photo, can be caused by\u00a0winter desiccation.", "\u201cPlants may become desiccated (dehydrated) on sunny, cold winter days when the ground and roots are frozen,\u201d\u00a0 the report stated.", "\u201cThe plant is unable to take up sufficient moisture from the frozen soil to replace water lost through the leaves and stems. Damage usually occurs on the south and southwest side of the plant which receives the most direct sunlight.\u201d", "Other factors that can discolour plants includes drought, flooding, salinity, soil compaction and improper planting, another\u00a0report\u00a0from the\u00a0University of Saskatchewan in Canada noted.", "The misleading posts' claim\u00a0that radiation from 5G mobile phone technology can be harmful to human health has also been previously debunked\u00a0by AFP.", "Rodney Croft, a professor at the University of Wollongong and a member of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, told AFP in April that there are no\u00a0\u201cadverse health effects caused by exposure to 5G\u201d.", "\u201c'Radiation\u2019 refers to both ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, and although ionizing radiation (such as from X-rays or nuclear reactions) can cause serious health effects such as cancer, non-ionizing radiation at the levels related to 5G cannot cause any health effects,\u201d he said in an email.", "Croft added that international regulations \u201crestrict 5G exposures to levels\u201d that cannot cause harm.", "AFP also debunked a separate hoax that falsely claimed viral outbreaks are linked to new telecommunication technologies, including 5G.
