More often than not, the front cameras of mobile phones act as mirrors. This means that photographs shot using a front camera appear laterally inverted, or reversed. For instance, when you raise your right arm in front of a mirror, the reflection appears to show that the same arm is raised. However, this is not really the case because you are facing yourself in the mirror and not standing in the same direction. Essentially, your front and back are reversed so right is left and left is right.", "While on some phones, photographs taken on the front camera are flipped by default, on others, one can turn off \u2018mirror image\u2019 in the camera settings.", "The man who clicked the selfie with Chauhan must have kept \u2018mirror image\u2019 switched-on in his camera settings, which is why it appears that Chouhan\u2019s left arm is injured. However, if you flip the image, it is evident that the right, and not the left, arm is plastered.", "The photo-montage below also makes it evident that the right arm is plastered.", "In conclusion, two images \u2013 one shot with a back camera and the other shot with a front camera \u2013 were shared to claim that BJP MLA Shivraj Singh Chouhan plastered different arms at different times during the day.
