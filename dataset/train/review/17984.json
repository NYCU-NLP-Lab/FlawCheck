["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on January 23, 2019 | Corrected on January 25,2019", "In arguing for border wall funding, President Donald Trump claimed \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that only 2 percent of those apprehended crossing the border and released pending immigration hearings appear in court. Actually, Trump administration officials put the figure at about 50 percent, while immigration experts say it is even higher.", "The president made his remarks on\u00a0Day 24 of the partial government shutdown, which began because Congress would not agree on Trump\u2019s request for\u00a0$5.7 billion in funding for a proposed border wall. The president was speaking\u00a0at the\u00a0American Farm Bureau Federation\u2019s annual convention in Louisiana.", "Trump, Jan. 14:\u00a0Somebody comes into our country, they touch one foot on the ground, and we have to catch them. It\u2019s called, \u201ccatch.\u201d We then take their names and we bring them to a court \u2014 can you believe this? \u2014 and we release them.\u00a0 \u2026\u00a0And they go into our country, and then you announce \u2014 these are the laws \u2014 then you say, \u201cCome back in three years for your trial.\u201d Tell me, what percentage of people come back? Would you say 100 percent? No, you\u2019re a little off. Like, how about 2 percent? (Laughter.) And those people, you almost don\u2019t want, because they cannot be very smart. (Laughter.) Two percent. Two percent. Two percent come back. Those two percent are not going to make America great again, that I can tell you. (Laughter and applause.) Crazy.", "It is important to note first that most people apprehended at the border are quickly returned to their home country.", "In an August 2018 report, the Department of Homeland Security said that 52 percent of the 479,000 people apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol for crossing the border illegally in 2014 were returned to their home countries within three days. (See tables 2 and 3.)", "\u201cOverall, DHS repatriated 65 percent of aliens encountered in 2014, with the majority (80 percent) of these repatriations occurring as expedited removals or reinstatements of previous removal orders,\u201d according to the DHS report, which tracked the enforcement outcomes over time for people trying to cross the Southwest border legally and illegally in 2014.", "(Figure 1, shown to the left, shows that the vast majority were repatriated, remained in removal proceedings or were granted relief by the end of fiscal year 2017.)", "Mexican nationals, in particular, \u201care often immediately processed and removed,\u201d as are those with criminal records, the report said.", "\u201cExisting enforcement measures are highly efficient at repatriating Mexicans, convicted criminals, and single adults who do not seek humanitarian relief,\u201d according to the report, which noted that 97 percent of those with criminal records were repatriated.", "However, DHS has criticized\u00a0current laws and court rulings that favor the release of unaccompanied children and families from noncontiguous countries until their immigration status can be resolved in court \u2013 a process that can take years. The DHS report said that more than half of those from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador who were apprehended at the Southwest border in 2014 remained in the U.S. after three years, and about half of all those apprehended from those countries were unaccompanied children and families.", "But we found no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim that only 2 percent of those released return for court hearings, and no one from the administration provided us with any evidence, either.", "We contacted the Department of Homeland Security, which referred us to the White House. Hogan Gidley, the White House deputy press secretary, promised to respond \u201cin a minute,\u201d but never did.", "However, two administration officials testified about the subject before Congress, and both officials put the figure for no-shows at around 50 percent \u2014 not 2 percent.", "At an Aug. 16, 2018, hearing, Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, questioned\u00a0James McHenry, director of the Justice Department\u2019s\u00a0Executive Office for Immigration Review, specifically about unaccompanied children who are released and then fail to show up at immigration hearings.", "\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out\u00a0how many that we actually know are showing up to hearings or are still engaged in the process,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cDo you have a number on that at all?\u201d", "\u201cThe\u00a0closest estimate we have is the in\u00a0absentia\u00a0rate, the number who receive an order of removal for not showing up at the hearing,\u201d McHenry replied. (In absentia is Latin for \u201cin the absence.\u201d)", "McHenry said \u201ca little over 50 percent\u201d of cases involving unaccompanied children crossing the Southwest border are decided in absentia. A chart on the website of the Executive Office of Immigration Review, which McHenry heads, shows the in absentia rate in fiscal year 2018 for unaccompanied alien children, or UACs, was 50 percent.", "Similarly,\u00a0Matthew T. Albence, executive associate director for Enforcement and Removal Operations at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told senators at a Sept. 18, 2018, hearing that 53 percent of cases involving \u201cfamily units encountered at the Southwest border in FY 2014\u201d were decided in absentia.", "One immigration expert told us Trump\u2019s 2 percent figure is \u201chighly unlikely.\u201d", "\u201cAs usual, I have no idea where he is getting his figures from and would suggest it is highly unlikely. This is so because those who are processed through the border are released from detention on an ankle monitor and have to follow a number of different procedures to help track them, all found to be highly effective alternatives to detention,\u201d said\u00a0Ayodele Gansallo, an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who is a senior staff attorney with the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society of Pennsylvania.", "Lenni B. Benson, who teaches immigration law at New York Law School, also questioned the 50 percent figure cited in congressional hearings by Trump administration officials.", "In a phone interview, Benson said the fact that a deportation order is issued in absentia does not mean that the person will be or should be deported. Too often, she said, noncitizens don\u2019t know when to appear in court because they are given inadequate notices to appear.", "Benson cited the case of Wescley Fonseca Pereira, who was ordered removed in absentia because he missed a removal hearing in 2007. The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in June that Pereira\u2019s notice to appear was inadequate because it lacked both time and location. In the majority opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the Department of Homeland Security \u201calmost always serves noncitizens with notices that fail to specify the time, place, or date of initial removal hearings,\u201d and instead state that the time, place and date are \u201cto be determined.\u201d", "The government acknowledged in a court filing that \u201calmost 100 percent\u201d of \u201cnotices to appear omit the time and date of the proceeding over the last three years.\u201d", "If given inadequate notice, noncitizens may seek to reopen their immigration proceedings, even though a deportation order was filed against them in absentia. Benson argued that the 50 percent figure cited by the Trump officials is \u201cinflated,\u201d because it is a snapshot in time.\u00a0In other words, some who failed to show up and received a deportation order in absentia may\u00a0nevertheless\u00a0continue to work through the judicial system.", "When asked about the best available data on case outcomes, several immigration law experts referred us to\u00a0a study published last year\u00a0in the California Law Review that analyzed government data from immigration court cases initiated between 2001 and 2016.", "The study \u2014 led by Ingrid Eagly, an immigration law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles \u2014 found that \u201c[f]amily members released from custody attended all of their hearings in 86% of cases\u201d during the 15 years covered by the study period. The percentage was slightly lower \u2014 81 percent \u2014 for nonfamilies. (See figure 15.)", "One group in particular \u2014 families seeking asylum \u2014 had a very high rate of showing up for court hearings.\u00a0\u201cWe find that family members seeking asylum who were released from detention attended their hearings in 96% of cases that began in family detention since 2001,\u201d the study found.", "The president frequently complains about what he calls \u201ccatch and release.\u201d Last year, he claimed only 3 percent of those released show up in immigration court, while on other occasions he has said the released immigrants \u201cnever show up\u201d in court or \u201cnobody ever shows up.\u201d But there is no evidence to support any of these claims.", "Correction, Jan. 25: This story was updated to correct the school affiliation of\u00a0Lenni B. Benson, who teaches immigration law at New York Law School, not New York University.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
