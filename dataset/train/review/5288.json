["The White House press conference was the president\u2019s first public appearance in more than 36 hours, and came after a day punctuated by tweets that showed displeasure as his Democratic rival Joe Biden moved closer to victory.", "During a 17-minute address Trump made a series of inaccurate comments about the November 3 election and its conduct. He left without taking questions.", "AFP breaks down what he said.", "\u201cIf you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us,\u201d Trump said.", "Vote counting is ongoing. The president seemed to be drawing a contrast between early\u00a0counts that gave him a lead, and later tallies that saw his advantage diminish.", "In several key states, including Pennsylvania, which Trump must win to be re-elected, in-person ballots were counted straight after polls closed.", "But as ballots sent by mail or deposited at official drop boxes --\u00a0steps taken because of the coronavirus pandemic -- were counted, the president's lead eroded. In-person and mail-in voting are both legal.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been talking about mail-in voting for a long time. It\u2019s really destroyed our system. It\u2019s a corrupt system and it makes people corrupt even if they aren\u2019t, by nature. But they become corrupt. It\u2019s too easy,\u201d Trump said.", "The president has consistently railed against mail-in voting, saying it would cause a \u201crigged\u201d election. But US officials and international observers have said there has been no fraud.", "\u201cThey\u2019re finding ballots all of a sudden.
