["About this rating", "As of mid-November, as COVID-19 cases rose to the highest levels ever in the U.S., store items that were difficult to find at the beginning of the pandemic were once again sold out in some stores in some locations. These products included toilet paper, paper towels, disinfecting wipes, hand sanitizer, and other cleaning supplies.", "The fact that these products may be sold out in one store or location doesn't necessarily mean that inventory fell to the same low levels over the entire country. Further, the Consumer Brands Association doesn't expect the these items to become as scarce in late 2020 as they were in March.", "It's not yet known how shoppers will react to the rise in COVID-19 cases and resulting lockdowns in the coming weeks.", "Snopes is still fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Cleaning supplies have remained level at 16%. Before the pandemic, 5% to 7% of consumer goods were typically out of stock, IRI said.", "While some stores may be out of sought-after items, some shoppers have discovered that Amazon Fresh, a grocery delivery service from Amazon, seems to have kept at least one of the most coveted items in stock throughout 2020: Clorox and Lysol disinfecting wipes.", "It is not yet known if the rise in coronavirus cases in late 2020 will cause inventory shortfalls as severe as those seen in mid-March for paper products, cleaning supplies, and other items. However, as of mid-November, the Consumer Brands Association doesn't expect end-of-the-year levels to fall as low as they did in the spring.", "Jordan Liles is a Senior Reporter who has been with Snopes since 2016.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
