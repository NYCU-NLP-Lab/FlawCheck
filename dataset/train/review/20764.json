Scientists are still trying to figure out the source of COVID-19, but there is no evidence that the outbreak began because of meat consumption.", "According to the CDC, COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus similar to MERS and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). All three originate in bats, and the recent COVID-19 outbreak suggests a \"likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\"", "Early in the outbreak, many patients in the virus epicenter of Wuhan, China, had connections to a large seafood and live-animal market, which suggested animal-to-person spread.
