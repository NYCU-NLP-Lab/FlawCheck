Kaepernick said he wasn't standing to protest social inequality; he ultimately kneeled for the anthem through the team\u2019s 16 regular-season games after sitting through the anthem during some pre-season games. ESPN reported in March 2017 that Kaepernick, no longer a 49er, intended to stand for the anthem in the 2017 season.", "The 2016 Morning News story noted that every Cowboys player had stood for the anthem at the team\u2019s season opener that week.

In every way, we support -- it's almost ridiculous to be saying it -- the people that for generations and generations have given it all up so we can get out here and show off in front of millions of people on television. We respect that so much. That's the real business.", "\"The forum of the NFL and the forum on television is a very significant thing. I'm for it being used in every way we can to support the great, great contributors in our society and that's people that have supported America, the flag, and there's no reason not to go all out right there. For anybody to use parts of that visibility to do otherwise is really disappointing.\"", "After Abbott posted his August 2017 tweet, the Dallas newspaper both took note of the Uconservative web post and pointed out that its reporters previously found no basis to\u00a0reports of Jones saying he\u2019d fire any player who didn\u2019t stand for the anthem.", "On Oct. 7, 2016, the paper reported that Jones \"never made those or other alleged comments and the episode as described never happened.\" That post followed on Snopes.com, a venerable fact-checking website, debunking a Facebook post suggesting Jones had addressed players about standing for the anthem.", "Seeking factual elaboration, we made an inquiry to Abbott\u2019s press office and also emailed a spokesman for the Dallas Cowboys.
