Since prayer wasn\u2019t banned at schools before Trump\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s not possible that he returned prayer to schools.", "The story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Both guidance documents explain that students may pray when not engaged in school activities or instruction and that teachers in their official capacities can\u2019t encourage or discourage prayer, or actively participate in prayer with students.", "We sent a copy of the 2003 and 2020 guidance documents to Richard Layton, associate professor of religion at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Layton found no significant shift in the legal terrain. He found modest differences, most notably that the 2020 document expands on reporting requirements related to complaints.", "\"This seems to be potentially a mechanism that will support more aggressive intervention into state and local educational policies/practices,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, the main purpose of the new guidelines seems to be to advertise to Christian communities that the administration will advocate for them.\"", "The ACLU concluded that both the 2003 and 2020 guidance documents \"affirm a core constitutional protection: School officials are prohibited from imposing their faith on students.\"", "The Freedom From Religion Foundation concluded that the guidance \"reiterates the state of law.\"", "To be clear, religion has not been banned from public schools. In 1962, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that school-sponsored or state-organized prayer violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

But that guidance didn\u2019t return prayer to schools. It's nearly the same as a 2003 guidance that explains when students can pray at school of their own initiative. For decades, school-sponsored prayer has been banned, but that doesn\u2019t ban religious expression at schools entirely.", "The overall message about Trump and school prayer in this video is misleading.
