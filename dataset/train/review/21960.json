["About this rating", "The hashtag #NobodyLikesTrump began trending on July 28, 2020, amid intense social media chatter about remarks U.S. President Donald Trump allegedly made earlier that day during a White House press briefing about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.", "Reportedly, Trump diverged from national issues in a momentary contemplation of his popularity, saying \u201cNobody likes me\u201d in comments uncharacteristic of the often self-confident politician.", "\u201cIt can only be my personality. That\u2019s all,\u201d he concluded.", "Trump did, in fact, make these remarks, inspiring a Twitter frenzy that lasted into the next day.", "With more than 16,000 related tweets, #NobodyLikesTrump became the fourth most popular hashtag on Twitter\u2019s July 29 trending list and sparked \u201cpoor me\u201d news reports that played on Trump\u2019s \u201cself-pity.\u201d", "The quote went viral after Trump was asked by a reporter to respond to since-deleted tweets in which he reportedly accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of misleading the country in his response to the coronavirus pandemic. Fauci has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 and became the face of the United States COVID-19 response at the onset of the pandemic.", "https://www.c-span.org/video/?474297-1/president-trump-coronavirus-news-conference\n\nIn a long-winded reply beginning around the 20-minute mark of the video, Trump said that he had a \u201cvery good relationship with Dr. Fauci\u201d and that he listened to the adviser despite not always having agreed with his policies, particularly those related to the travel bans on China and Europe. Trump went on to speak to Fauci\u2019s \u201cvery good approval rating\u201d and described fellow White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Deborah Birx as \u201cterrific.\u201d", "In subsequent comments, the president then questioned his own approval rating with respect to the virus and appeared to doubt his likability:", "And he\u2019s [Fauci] got this high approval rating, so why don\u2019t I have a high approval rating with respect \u2014 and the administration, with respect to the virus? We should have a very high, because what we\u2019ve done in terms of \u2014 we\u2019re just reading off about the masks and the gowns and the ventilators and numbers that nobody has seen, and the testing at 55 million tests; we tested more than anybody in the world. I have a graph that I\u2019d love to show you \u2014 perhaps you\u2019ve seen it \u2014 where we\u2019re up here and the rest of the world is down at a level that\u2019s just a tiny fraction of what we\u2019ve done, in terms of testing.", "So it sort of is curious: A man works for us \u2014 with us, very closely, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx also highly thought of. And yet, they\u2019re highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality. That\u2019s all.", "During the 26-minute long press conference, the president also provided an update to COVID-19 vaccine trials and announced a $765 million loan to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals that will allow the film company to \u201cproduce generic active pharmaceutical ingredients\u201d and \u201cmake the key starting materials\u201d for many drugs.", "Quinn, Allison. \u00a0 \"Trump: How Come People Like Fauci but \u2018Nobody Likes Me?\u2019.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Daily Beast. \u00a0 28 July 2020.", "Crowley, Michael. \u00a0 \"\u2019Nobody Likes Me,\u2019 Trump Complains Renewing Defense of Dubious Science.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 28 July 2020.", "Lovelace Jr., Berkeley. \u00a0 \"Dr. Fauci on Trump Criticism: \u2018I Have Not Been Misleading the American Public Under Any Circumstances.\u2019\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNBC . \u00a0 28 July 2020.", "\"Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Members of the Coronavirus Task Force.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Whitehouse.gov Statements & Releases. \u00a0 8 July 2020.", "\"Remarks by President Trump in Press Briefing.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Whitehouse.gov Remarks. \u00a0 28 July 2020.", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
