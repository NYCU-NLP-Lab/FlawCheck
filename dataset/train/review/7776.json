I know that Islam came to India much later than Hinduism (which) had already existed. Pakistan claimed independence way after all this happened, 70 years ago. So I don\u2019t think Pakistani is a suitable negotiator regarding Kashmir. I don\u2019t even think they have the right to speak. I believe its Hindu land. That\u2019s very controversial. Many will say no, they have the right to have their opinions. My position is that Kashmir is Hindu land and I say this in front of everyone. I\u2019m not just saying this because I am in India. This has been my opinion for five years. Even when I was an extremist this was my opinion. So nobody can say that I am being paid by Modi or anything like that,\u201d is the full speech of the man.", "This video was also massively shared on social media earlier in February after the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman\u2019s visit to India.
