["By Lori Robertson, Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on February 6, 2020", "A day after his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial, President Donald Trump made celebratory remarks in the White House on Feb. 6, thanking many Republican politicians and repeating several false and misleading claims, many of which we\u2019ve checked before.", "The president twisted the facts on the Russia investigation, former FBI officials, European contributions to Ukraine, the stock market, Medicare for All and drug prices.", "Recounting what he described as ongoing and unfair attempts to overturn his presidency, Trump provided this\u00a0blunt assessment\u00a0of the Russia investigation: \u201cAnd you have to understand, we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bullshit.\u201d", "But there was plenty to the Russia investigation.", "On Jan. 6, 2017, two weeks before Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence publicly released a\u00a0declassified intelligence report\u00a0that said: \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,\u201d and the goal of the campaign was \u201cto help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances.\u201d", "In addition to a clandestine social media campaign to discredit Hillary Clinton, the report\u00a0said\u00a0Russian military intelligence gained access to Democratic National Committee computers from July 2015 to June 2016 and then used WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and \u201cGuccifer 2.0, who claimed to be an independent Romanian hacker,\u201d to publicly release hacked emails and documents. The cyberattacks and public release of hacked material were part of larger \u201cRussian propaganda efforts\u201d to hurt Clinton and help Trump, the report said.", "The special counsel\u2019s office in February 2018 secured an\u00a0indictment\u00a0against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for their role in that interference. The indictment says the defendants conspired to defraud the United States. The conspiracy involved using the names of U.S. citizens and companies to illegally buy political ads on social media and stage political rallies. Some defendants also \u201csolicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates,\u201d according to the indictment.", "The defendants are alleged to have employed hundreds of people for online operations, \u201cranging from creators of fictitious personas to technical and administrative support personnel, with an annual budget of millions of dollars,\u201d then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u00a0said.\u00a0In July of that year, 12 Russian military officers were also\u00a0indicted.", "Regarding special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russians, his report said that \u201cthe investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russia offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away.\u201d", "It continued: \u201cUltimately, the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\u201d", "As we have written, Trump has provided\u00a0mixed messages\u00a0about the appropriateness of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 president election. At times he has acknowledged that Russia interfered in the election, and other times he has called the investigation a \u201choax\u201d and questioned whether Russians or some other group was responsible.", "During the phone call in July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that triggered the impeachment investigation, Trump raised the debunked\u00a0conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 elections and hacked the Democratic National Committee.", "\u201cThe server, they say Ukraine has it,\u201d Trump said, according to a\u00a0memo of the call\u00a0released by the White House, adding, \u201cI would like you to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\u00a0But there is\u00a0no evidence Ukraine has the servers.", "Trump once again falsely\u00a0claimed\u00a0that Peter Strzok, a former FBI senior counterintelligence agent, and Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer, \u201cillegally deleted\u201d all of their emails and text messages between them. They have not been charged with violating any laws, and there is no evidence that\u00a0any\u00a0messages were intentionally deleted \u2014 let alone \u201call\u201d of them.", "The president, in the midst of celebrating his impeachment acquittal, recalled how Strzok and Page exchanged anti-Trump text messages prior to the election. Trump read from some of those messages \u2014 which resulted in special counsel Mueller removing Strzok from the Russia investigation.", "Trump:\u00a0When Mueller found out that everybody knew that they were 100% this way, he let them go. But they deleted all of their emails and text messages. So when we got the phone, they were all deleted. Can you imagine the treasure trove? They illegally deleted.", "We covered this issue in a\u00a0story\u00a0in 2018, but here\u2019s a summary: During the election, Strzok and Page were assigned to the FBI\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of personal email for government business while she was secretary of state. In July 2016, the FBI closed the Clinton investigation without any charges being filed, and opened an investigation into reports that Russia hacked into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers. Strzok was assigned to lead the Russia probe, and Page was assigned to serve as the deputy director\u2019s liaison to the new investigation, according to a Department of Justice inspector general\u2019s\u00a0report\u00a0published in\u00a0June 2018.", "But they weren\u2019t on the Russia investigation for long. Both left in July 2017. Page\u2019s assignment ended after less than two months, and Strzok was removed after the IG informed Mueller that the couple exchanged text messages that expressed \u201chostility\u201d toward Trump during the 2016 presidential election, according to the IG\u2019s June 2018 report.", "\u201c[A]fter finding responsive text messages between Page and Strzok that appeared to intermingle political comments with discussions of the [Clinton] investigation, the OIG obtained from the FBI all text messages between Strzok and Page from their FBI-issued phones for the entire period of the Clinton email server investigation as well as the period of the Russia investigation during which Strzok and Page worked on it,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThe OIG received more than 40,000 unique text messages between Strzok and Page in response to these requests. The FBI did not provide any text messages for the period from December 15, 2016, to May 17, 2017, because of issues with the data collection and preservation software used on the FBI\u2019s Samsung S5 mobile devices.\u201d", "Trump\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0has\u00a0accused\u00a0Strzok and Page, as well as\u00a0Mueller\u00a0and\u00a0Mueller\u2019s team,\u00a0of deleting the missing text messages from December 2016 to May 2017.", "\u201cBiggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely & illegally deleted,\u201d Trump\u00a0tweeted on Dec. 18, 2018. \u201cWould have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest!\u201d", "However, the IG\u2019s forensic agents were able to recover about 20,000 missing text messages during that \u201cgap period\u201d in late 2016 to mid-2017. A footnote in that June report says the failure to preserve the emails from Dec. 15, 2016, to May 17, 2017, resulted from a software problem \u2014 \u201cnot from the actions of any FBI employee, including Strzok.\u201d", "A\u00a0second IG report\u00a0in December 2018 detailed how the IG was able to recover the emails, and why\u00a0the text message data collection tools on the FBI\u2019s Samsung phones failed.\u00a0That report similarly said, \u201c[T]he\u00a0OIG did not find that the gaps in collection were intentional on the part of the FBI or any FBI\u00a0personnel.\u201d", "Contrary to the evidence, the president continues to claim that the text messages were \u201cillegally deleted.\u201d", "Trump falsely said that Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa got former FBI Director James Comey to admit to leaking information about the FBI\u2019s investigations of Hillary Clinton and Russian interference in the 2016 elections.", "\u201cChuck Grassley, he\u2019s looking at Comey, \u2018Well, you tell me, what did you say?\u2019\u201d Trump said Grassley asked. \u201cAnd that was when Comey, I think that was when Comey announced that he was leaking, lying and everything else, right? He choked.\u201d", "That\u2019s not what happened in the\u00a0May 2017 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing\u00a0that Trump appears to be referencing. Comey, who was still the FBI director at the time, actually told Grassley he did not leak, or authorize anyone else at the FBI to leak, information about those investigations to the press.", "Here\u2019s the exchange:", "Grassley, May 3, 2017:\u00a0Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?", "Comey:\u00a0Never.", "Grassley:\u00a0Question two, relatively related, have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?", "Comey:\u00a0No.", "About a month later, during a hearing before a different Senate committee, Comey did admit to Sen. Susan Collins of Maine that \u2014 after he was fired as FBI director by Trump on May 9 \u2014 he had a friend of his relay to the New York Times the contents of a memo he wrote about a conversation he had with Trump about Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, whom the FBI was investigating.", "Collins, June 8, 2017:\u00a0Finally, did you show copies of your memos to anyone outside the Department of Justice?", "Comey:\u00a0Yes.", "Collins:\u00a0And to whom did you show copies?", "Comey:\u00a0The president tweeted on Friday after I got fired that I better hope there\u2019s not tapes. I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, because it didn\u2019t dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our conversation, there might be a tape. And my judgment was, I needed to get that out into the public square, so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with the reporter. I didn\u2019t do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. So I asked a close friend of mine to do it.", "Trump falsely suggested that Germany, France and the United Kingdom don\u2019t give money to Ukraine. In fact, as we have written, the European Union and European financial institutions have contributed $16.4 billion in grants and loans to Ukraine since 2014, considerably more than the United States. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s list of the top 10 donors\u00a0of official development assistance to Ukraine has EU institutions as No. 1, with $425.2 million contributed on average for 2016-2017. The U.S. was second ($204.4 million in assistance) and Germany was third ($189.8 million on its own, in addition to what it would have given through the EU).", "Trump said he would ask Vice President Mike Pence, \u201cTell me, why isn\u2019t Germany paying money? Why isn\u2019t France? Why isn\u2019t the United Kingdom paying money? \u2026 I say, find out what the hell\u2019s going on. And I told that to all of my people. \u2026 Why is the United States always the sucker?\u201d", "Some State Department employees did try to tell the president that EU countries contributed more money to Ukraine than the U.S., according to the congressional testimony of David Holmes, the political counselor for the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. Holmes said he and others on the Ukraine team, in coordination with other U.S. missions in Europe and NATO, began \u201clooking into the facts\u201d after the hold was placed on the security assistance to Ukraine and they were trying to understand why.\u00a0Holmes said they found the U.S. had provided about $3 billion in combined civilian and military assistance to Ukraine since 2014, plus $3 billion in loan guarantees that he said \u201cget paid back largely.\u201d The EU plus member states \u201chave provided a combined $12 billion to Ukraine\u201d since 2014. Holmes said he believed this was communicated to the White House in late August.", "Trump made the remarkable prediction that \u201cif we didn\u2019t win, the stock market would\u2019ve crashed. The market was going up a lot before the election because it was looking like we had a good chance to win.\u201d We wrote the day Trump was inaugurated: \u201cTrump takes office with stock prices near historic highs, after an eight-year run-up that will be a tough act for Trump to follow.\u201d", "Over former President Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in office, stock prices set record after record. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock average increased by 166%, from the last trading day before he took office until his final day as president. The S&P has gone up another 47.8% under Trump.", "Trump boasted that stock prices \u201cwent up tremendously from the time we won the election until the time we took office,\u201d and there was a so-called \u201cTrump Rally\u201d in the weeks after the election that many attributed partly to investor optimism that Trump would cut taxes and regulation as promised. But the S&P increased by just under 6% between Election Day and Obama\u2019s last day in office.", "Trump claimed, in a reference to Medicare for All, that one year of the plan would cost more than the country \u201ccould make in 30 years.\u201d That doesn\u2019t add up.", "\u201cWe\u2019re going to give you a health care that\u2019s going to cost more money than the country could make in 30 years if it does really well. That\u2019s one year,\u201d he said\u00a0Democrats were saying by backing the plan.", "The cost estimates for Medicare for All \u2014 a plan introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders for a universal, Medicare-like health care system \u2014 vary, as many details are yet to be determined. One recent estimate, from the Urban Institute, for a single-payer plan similar to Sanders\u2019 legislation found federal government spending would need to go up by $2.8 trillion next year and $34 trillion over 10 years.", "But federal revenues, without any changes to finance the plan, would be higher than that cost, contrary to what Trump said. The White House Office of Management and Budget estimates total federal receipts would be $3.6 trillion in 2020 and increase to $4.8 trillion by 2024. Perhaps more important, Sanders, and others who support the plan, have said they will use new revenue streams to finance it, such as payroll taxes, an income-based \u201cpremium\u201d and increased taxes on high-income individuals. So, the revenue the government makes would increase.", "Also, it\u2019s worth noting that while the cost to the federal government would go up significantly under a single-payer plan, health spending by everyone else \u2014 individuals, employers, insurers, and state and local governments \u2014 would be largely, if not entirely, eliminated. Total national health expenditures by all payers were an estimated $3.6 trillion in 2018 and are projected to be $47 trillion over 10 years, 2018-2027, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.", "The president falsely claimed, \u201cWe had first time in 51 years where drug prices actually came down last year.\u201d Drug prices can be measured in different ways, but using Trump\u2019s measure \u2014 the 12-month change in the consumer price index for prescription drugs \u2014 the price decline from December 2017 to December 2018 was the first in five-and-a-half years, when the year-over-year change in the CPI for drugs dipped below zero from July 2012 to July 2013.", "The CPI for prescription drugs is a measure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that aims to capture what consumers, plus their insurance companies or other payers, are paying for a basket of retail prescriptions. As we found when we wrote about this issue last year, Trump has used the December 2017 to December 2018 decline of 0.6% as the first \u201ccalendar year\u201d drop since December 1971 to December 1972, which is 46 years prior, not 51. But that\u2019s not the last year-to-year drop for these figures.", "Trump has a point that the CPI for prescription drugs has appeared to show good news, with a year-to-year decline in nine out of the 13 months from December 2018 through December 2019, the most recent figures available. However, those year-to-year figures have gone up for the last three months of 2019, so drug prices, by this measure \u2014 at the point of sale and for all payers combined \u2014 are again rising.", "We explained in detail the limitations to the CPI and what other measures of drug prices show. For instance, brand list prices, inflation-adjusted, had gone up by 3.3% in the first quarter of 2019, but net prices (after rebates, discounts, coupons and fees are deducted) had dropped by 4.1%, according to an analysis by SSR Health, an investment research firm.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
