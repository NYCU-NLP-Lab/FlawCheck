["About this rating", "In June 2018, the Trump administration received heavy criticized for enacting a short-lived policy to separate children from their families at the border of the United States and Mexico, sending them to detention centers across the country as an apparent attempt to deter asylum-seekers.", "As outrage over the issue continued, so did the disinformation. On 19 June, a video purportedly showing former United States President Barack Obama agreeing with Trump's immigration policies was posted to Twitter by political analyst Oliver McGee:", "Wow. Obama really did agree with @realDonaldTrump on Immigration.", "Show this to your friends. pic.twitter.com/oQGcz5Ng87", "\u2014 Oliver McGee PhD MBA (@OliverMcGee) June 19, 2018", "This footage is disingenuous at best. It is true that Obama, like Trump, wished to take action against people entering the country without documentation, and argued that he had the authority as president to take certain legal actions. In terms of separating families at the border, however, there is nothing in this clip to suggest that Obama agreed with the current policy \u2014 and as a matter of fact, Obama's full speech contains a number of passages that directly contradict this particular claim or inference.", "The footage compiles several moments from a speech Obama delivered in 2014 about immigration reform and his \"Immigration Accountability Executive Action\" plan. Although he did genuinely say the words used in this clip, the quotes are out of order and out of context. The relevant portions of the speech can be found below. The words in bold are the passages included in the video. The full speech can be read in its entirety here:", "My fellow Americans, tonight, I\u2019d like to talk with you about immigration.", "For more than 200 years, our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations. It\u2019s kept us youthful, dynamic, and entrepreneurial. It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities \u2014 people not trapped by our past, but able to remake ourselves as we choose.", "But today, our immigration system is broken \u2014 and everybody knows it.", "Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules. Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less. All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America. And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows, or risk their families being torn apart.", "[...]", "Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of bill a simple yes-or-no vote, it would have passed with support from both parties, and today it would be the law. But for a year and a half now, Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote.", "Now, I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law. But until that happens, there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President \u2014 the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me \u2014 that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.", "Tonight, I am announcing those actions.", "First, we\u2019ll build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings, and speed the return of those who do cross over.", "Second, I\u2019ll make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed.", "Third, we\u2019ll take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country.", "I want to say more about this third issue, because it generates the most passion and controversy. Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we\u2019re also a nation of laws. Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable \u2014 especially those who may be dangerous. That\u2019s why, over the past six years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security. Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who\u2019s working hard to provide for her kids. We\u2019ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day.", "But even as we focus on deporting criminals, the fact is, millions of immigrants in every state, of every race and nationality still live here illegally. And let\u2019s be honest \u2014 tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isn\u2019t realistic. Anyone who suggests otherwise isn\u2019t being straight with you. It\u2019s also not who we are as Americans. After all, most of these immigrants have been here a long time. They work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs. They support their families. They worship at our churches. Many of their kids are American-born or spent most of their lives here, and their hopes, dreams, and patriotism are just like ours. As my predecessor, President Bush, once put it: \u201cThey are a part of American life.\u201d", "Now here\u2019s the thing: We expect people who live in this country to play by the rules. We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded. So we\u2019re going to offer the following deal: If you\u2019ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you\u2019re willing to pay your fair share of taxes -- you\u2019ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. That\u2019s what this deal is.", "Now, let\u2019s be clear about what it isn\u2019t. This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently. It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future. It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive \u2014 only Congress can do that. All we\u2019re saying is we\u2019re not going to deport you.", "[...]", "That\u2019s the real amnesty \u2013- leaving this broken system the way it is. Mass amnesty would be unfair. Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character. What I\u2019m describing is accountability \u2014 a common-sense, middle-ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you\u2019re a criminal, you\u2019ll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up.", "The actions I\u2019m taking are not only lawful, they\u2019re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century. And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill.", "I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution. And the day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary. Meanwhile, don\u2019t let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue. That\u2019s not how our democracy works, and Congress certainly shouldn\u2019t shut down our government again just because we disagree on this. Americans are tired of gridlock. What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose \u2014 a higher purpose.", "Interestingly, the heavily edited video did not include passages from the same speech in which Obama specifically spoke out against the practice of separating families. Near the end of the speech, he rhetorically asked if the United States was a nation that would tolerate taking children away from families:", "Because for all the back and forth of Washington, we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger. It\u2019s about who we are as a country, and who we want to be for future generations.", "Are we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law? Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends, take responsibility, and give their kids a better future?", "Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents\u2019 arms? Or are we a nation that values families, and works together to keep them together?", "A few sentences later Obama adds:", "Over the past few years, I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs without taking a dime from the government, and at risk any moment of losing it all, just to build a better life for their kids. I\u2019ve seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they didn\u2019t have the right papers. I\u2019ve seen the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as American as Malia or Sasha; students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in the country they love.", "Obama also emphasized in this speech that his immigration policy targeted \"felons, not families\" and \"criminals, not children\":", "I want to say more about this third issue, because it generates the most passion and controversy.

We\u2019ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day.", "President Obama's \"Immigration Accountability Executive Action\" plan tackled a wide range of immigration issues, not just those concerning the border. The three main points of his plan involved cracking down on unauthorized immigration at the border, deporting undocumented felons, providing undocumented immigrants already in the United States a chance to avoid deportation by passing background checks and paying taxes.", "The \"felons, not families\" portion of the plan even included a provision to reduce family separations:", "DHS will also create a new deferred action program for people who are parents of U.S. Citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) and have lived in the United States for five years or longer if they register, pass a background check and pay taxes.", "Reducing family separation for those waiting to obtain LPR status. Due to barriers in our system, U.S. citizens and LPRs are often separated for years from their immediate relatives, while they wait to obtain their LPR status. To reduce the time these individuals are separated, DHS will expand an existing program that allows certain individuals to apply for a provisional waiver for certain violations before departing the United States to attend visa interviews.", "The viral video attempted to make it seem as if Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump were in lockstep with one another when it came to immigration issues such as the separation of families at the border by dishonestly cherry-picking out-of-context quotes and omitting passages that disagreed with the chosen narrative.", "However, Obama repeatedly said in this speech \u2014 as well as in the \"Immigration Accountability Executive Action\" plan \u2014 that he was opposed to family separation.", "The United States Department of Justice. \u00a0 \"Attorney General Sessions Addresses Recent Criticisms of Zero Tolerance By Church Leaders.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 14 June 2018.", "Office of the Press Secretary. \u00a0 \"Remarks by the President in Address to the Nation on Immigration.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 20 November 2014.", "Office of the Press Secretary. \u00a0 \"FACT SHEET: Immigration Accountability Executive Action.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 20 November 2014.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
