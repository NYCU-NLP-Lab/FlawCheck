["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on November 9, 2018", "In his rallies, President Donald Trump repeatedly talks about \u201cclean coal,\u201d using the phrase more than a dozen times over the past three months.\u00a0He also has said in other appearances that clean coal can be exported or \u201cloaded up\u201d on railway cars.", "But \u201cclean coal\u201d refers to technologies deployed at power plants\u00a0that make coal cleaner to burn, not to the fuel itself. Modern definitions require cuts in carbon dioxide emissions, and the only way to do that in a substantial way is through carbon capture. Just two coal power plants in the world use the technique, and it makes up less than 0.1 percent of American coal-fired capacity.", "\u201cClean coal\u201d has become a popular talking point for the president, especially when he addresses crowds in coal-producing states, such as West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Montana.", "On Nov. 3 in Belgrade, Montana, Trump said: \u201cAnd we then did the war on clean, beautiful coal, and we are putting \u2014 and you see it better than almost anybody \u2014 our coal miners. They\u2019re all back to work, and they\u2019re going back to work. Clean coal, clean coal. Nobody thought that was going to happen so fast, either.\u201d", "But what does \u201cclean coal\u201d mean? And how does the technology work? We\u2019ll dive into the various ways coal combustion can be made cleaner, and take a look at the future of coal in a world grappling with the effects of climate change.", "The term \u201cclean coal,\u201d which is used by industry, the government and academics, is annoyingly nebulous.", "\u201cClean coal turns out to mean largely whatever one wants it to mean,\u201d said Edward S. Rubin, a professor of mechanical engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, in a phone interview. He has worked on energy and environmental issues for almost half a century, and on coal technologies nearly as long.", "Julio Friedmann, a senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy and CEO of the company Carbon Wrangler, agrees.", "\u201cThere is no formal definition of clean coal,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd it is often in the eye of the beholder.\u201d", "Rubin recalls the term first being widely used in the mid-1980s, when the Department of Energy launched its Clean Coal program. At the time, acid rain was a top priority, and coal plants were a key culprit. Coal contains impurities, that, when burned, escape into the air as harmful air pollutants, including acid-rain-causing chemicals such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Fortunately, scrubbers and catalytic converters could be added to power plants to chemically remove the majority of these pollutants.", "Over time, the definition expanded as society recognized that burning coal resulted in other pollution problems. In the \u201890s, for example, as scientists realized the importance of mercury emissions from coal, that too became a clean coal signifier. Mercury released into the air eventually makes its way back down to Earth, where it can become a health hazard for humans and damage ecosystems and wildlife. The Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0estimates coal-burning power plants are responsible for about 42 percent of all man-made mercury emissions in the United States.", "Finally, the \u201cclean\u201d label evolved to include reductions in carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas scientists say is driving climate change. The EPA formally designated carbon dioxide as an air pollutant in 2009, in recognition of the harm the gas poses \u201cto public health and welfare\u201d in its role in global warming.", "Coal plants pump out inordinate amounts of the gas. According to the Energy Information Administration, coal power plants released 1,207 million metric tons of CO2 in 2017 \u2014 far more than any other source of electricity. And that\u2019s despite a decline in coal use. As the EPA notes, \u201calthough coal accounted for about 67 percent of CO2 emissions from the sector, it represented only about 32 percent of the electricity generated in the United States in 2016.\u201d", "\u201cThese days, my own sense is that talking about clean coal without extending it to mean significant reductions in carbon emissions is basically ignoring the climate-related impacts of coal combustion,\u201d Rubin said.", "It\u2019s a sentiment Friedmann shares. \u201cI personally believe coal cannot be clean unless it controls CO2 emissions as well,\u201d he said.", "But Rubin notes that coal industry definitions are often vague, referring to environmental performance improvements that may make only incremental advancements. Even if industry groups accept that carbon dioxide control is part of clean coal, as some do, it\u2019s often a question of how much. Someone could argue, Rubin said, that a 5 percent reduction in emissions is enough to make coal \u201cclean.\u201d", "Clearly, the \u201cclean\u201d part of \u201cclean coal\u201d is relative, and is better described as \u201ccleaner.\u201d For this reason, many environmentalists think that \u201cclean coal\u201d doesn\u2019t exist and consider the phrase an oxymoron. Coal can never be clean, they argue, because even if sophisticated power plants capture pollutants, there is environmental damage during the mining and transport of coal. Mountaintop removal in particular is notorious for polluting streams and harming ecosystems, especially aquatic ones. This environmental damage is well documented by the EPA.", "But while Friedmann considers these fair complaints, he also thinks they should be put in perspective, as just 5 percent of U.S. coal production is done by mountaintop removal. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t represent a big fraction of how coal is produced,\u201d he said.", "The best technology cannot make coal completely pollution-free or carbon-neutral, but it can mitigate a lot of the negative environmental impacts. This technology, known as carbon capture and sequestration (or storage), or CCS, is a process in which CO2 is trapped and kept out of the atmosphere, usually by forcing the gas into below-ground formations. As we\u2019ll explain, there are several ways to do CCS. But the technology is expensive and is not yet widespread.", "Other \u201cclean coal\u201d methods also address carbon dioxide emissions, including novel ways of burning coal more efficiently. In a standard coal-fired power plant, coal is burned to heat a boiler, which creates steam that turns a turbine, which powers a generator to create electricity. Increasing the temperature and pressure of the steam, as is done in so-called supercritical and ultrasupercritical plants, makes this process more efficient. Because less coal needs to be burned to create the same amount of energy, the plants have smaller carbon footprints. These improvements, however, usually yield only modest reductions in carbon dioxide, such that they still do not match the lower emissions of modern natural gas plants. Rubin said these are also not widely used in the United States.", "The White House did not reply to requests for clarification on what Trump means when he says \u201cclean coal.\u201d\u00a0Trump could simply be thinking of the basic scrubbers that prevent acid rain \u2014 but do nothing to reduce CO2 emissions.", "Some of Trump\u2019s more specific comments, however, incorrectly describe coal itself as being \u201cclean,\u201d not the burning of it.", "Take, for instance, the idea that coal sitting in railway cars is clean, and that the U.S. exports clean coal, both ideas he floated in September.", "Trump, United Nations speech, Sept. 25: We have become the largest energy producer anywhere on the face of the Earth. The United States stands ready to export our abundant, affordable supply of oil, clean coal, and natural gas.", "Trump, aboard Air Force One, Sept. 7: No administration has done what I\u2019ve done. I just left Montana, and I looked at those trains and they\u2019re loaded up with clean coal \u2014 beautiful clean coal. And those trains were empty two years ago. They were empty; they were dying. Nobody\u2019s done what I\u2019ve done.", "Setting aside Trump\u2019s inflated claims about reviving the coal industry, which we\u2019ve addressed before, Rubin said Trump\u2019s words don\u2019t make a lot of sense, given the normal definitions of clean coal.", "\u201cIt isn\u2019t the coal that\u2019s clean,\u201d said Rubin. \u201cIt\u2019s using coal, and using it in a way that generates useful energy, without significant environmental emissions.\u201d All of the meaningful ways to do this, he said, happen at a power plant.", "There is only one plausible way Trump could argue his case, and it\u2019s a stretch.", "He could be thinking of coal cleaning or\u00a0coal washing, an older technology that removes impurities, such as non-combustible mineral matter and sulfur, from coal. This can cut down on coal ash pollution, and slightly reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. But this processing hardly makes coal clean.", "\u201cToday, no one really thinks of coal cleaning as a significant clean coal technology,\u201d said Rubin.", "According to the Energy Information Administration, less than 20 percent of U.S. coal is washed, usually higher-sulfur coal in the East, and cleaning does not change coal\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions.", "Coal washing, notably, appears on a list of technologies posted on the American Coal Council\u2019s website, but the industry group is careful to label the entire list \u201ccleaner\u201d rather than \u201cclean.\u201d", "As for the export claim, Friedmann is equally baffled.", "\u201cIn my mind, I don\u2019t see how you can export coal and call it clean unless you export clean coal technology with it,\u201d said Friedmann, adding that this is something the Trump administration is not doing.", "And no exported coal heads to carbon capture facilities. Of the two coal-fired CCS plants, only one \u2014 the Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan, Canada \u2014 is outside the United States, and it gets its coal domestically.", "Understanding the basics of how coal-based carbon capture and sequestration works will help explain why it isn\u2019t more widespread.", "There are three main ways to do carbon capture, which differ in when and how the CO2 is removed:", "Perhaps surprisingly, the basic technology hasn\u2019t changed much since we last wrote about it in 2009, when then-President Barack Obama was taking heat from environmental groups for supporting clean coal. What has changed is that there are now two commercial coal CCS plants in operation. One is the Petra Nova plant in Houston, Texas, which came online in 2017, and the other is Canada\u2019s Boundary Dam, which debuted in 2014. Both grab the CO2 after combustion using chemicals, although their setups are different.", "One of the differences is in how the plants get the extra energy to run their capture systems, which Rubin said can take 20 to 25 percent of an efficient coal-fired power plant\u2019s energy to run. Boundary Dam uses internal power, reducing its output. Petra Nova, in contrast, uses a separate natural gas plant \u2014 without carbon capture. As a result, Petra Nova can produce more electricity, but its overall carbon footprint is higher than one might think. Even though Petra Nova captures 90 percent of its CO2 emissions, Rubin estimates that the net reduction is only about 70 percent.", "That\u2019s still substantial, but it\u2019s important to keep in mind when evaluating how clean even this type of advanced technology actually is. \u201cAn efficient natural gas plant would have roughly half the emissions of a modern coal plant, without doing anything,\u201d explains Rubin.", "Along with reducing the plant\u2019s green credentials, the extra energy required to do carbon capture drives up the cost of electricity, which is arguably the bigger hurdle keeping coal CCS from going mainstream.", "One workaround, which is what the Petra Nova and Boundary Dam plants are doing, is to profit off of their captured CO2 through something called enhanced oil recovery. It turns out that CO2 is useful to oil companies because injecting the gas into the ground can help squeeze out more oil.", "Of course, not everyone is on board with using captured CO2 to find more oil, which as a fellow fossil fuel would be contributing to our CO2 problem. But Rubin said it depends on one\u2019s assumptions as to whether on net, there\u2019s a decrease in CO2 emissions or not. \u201cIt\u2019s something that needs to be considered,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s not a clear answer.\u201d", "With just two coal plants in the world that make significant reductions in all air pollutants, anything approaching clean coal is happening on an extremely small scale. In fact, the carbon capture systems at both plants are only running on a portion of the total coal that is burned.", "At Boundary Dam, the total capacity of all the units is 672 megawatts, but the single carbon capture unit is capable of about 120 megawatts. It is often down for repairs or running below capacity. At Petra Nova, carbon capture is applied to 240 megawatts of the 654 megawatt unit. That makes Petra Nova the largest coal CCS project in the world \u2014 an impressive feat. But given that the country\u2019s total coal-fired power plant capacity tops 250,000 megawatts, it still means that less than 0.1 percent of American capacity uses the technique. Will we see more?", "\u201cWith the price of natural gas being as low as it currently is, there is relatively little interest in building new coal plants of any sort,\u201d said Rubin. What\u2019s needed, he said, are regulations and policies that make it economically worthwhile for more companies to build these sorts of power plants, such as a sufficiently high price on CO2 emissions, or a standard that requires emission reductions.", "\u201cWe have neither of these today,\u201d he said, \u201cnor any prospects of such incentives from the current administration.\u201d", "In February, Trump signed into law a set of expanded\u00a0tax credits\u00a0that could encourage various carbon capture projects. The measure provides tax credits for every ton of CO2 that\u2019s either stored or reused. But while Friedmann thinks the credits might allow for a few existing coal plants to do CCS retrofits, even those projects would likely need extra support.", "In the end, Friedmann said, the focus shouldn\u2019t really be on coal or any other fuel, it should be on the power plant. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t care if it\u2019s using coal, natural gas, or tires,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should care about what is emitted. That\u2019s the only thing that the Earth cares about.\u201d", "Clarification, Nov. 9: We clarified that only two American power plants use gasification.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
