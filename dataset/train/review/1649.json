(AP photo)", "A fake Internet post said President Donald Trump was going to outlaw Facebook, but a closer look revealed it was a simple April Fool\u2019s Day prank.", "The headline on an April 2, 2017, post on usanews4u.us declared, \"Donald Trump to issue an executive order to ban Facebook across U.S.\"", "Likely concerned by the prospect, Facebook users flagged it as potentially being fabricated as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to stamp out fake news.", "The fake post said that Trump was going to take action despite criticism from congressional Republicans, because fake news was still being widely circulated on the site. Facebook users, federal judges and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg were all prepared to fight any executive order, but Trump didn\u2019t care.", "\"Inside, we both know what\u2019s been going on. We know the game and we\u2019re gonna play it,\" Trump is quoted in the story.", "First and foremost, we know that this is a faker than fake quote, because it\u2019s a line from Rick Astley\u2019s Never Gonna Give You Up.

That\u2019s apparently still a thing for some people.", "But we just gotta tell you how we\u2019re feeling, and gotta make you understand.", "Even with Trump\u2019s penchant for labeling things as fake news, there has been no report about an executive order banning Facebook.

There also is a \"Faking News\" section full of intentionally bogus content \"to attract your attention.\"", "But this post wasn\u2019t categorized there, instead getting the label \"World News.\" The post also had an April Fool\u2019s Day tag, so the story is a prank.", "Readers who made it to the end of the faux story would have noticed something not in the usanews4u.us post: A link marked as Trump\u2019s and Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks on the issue actually redirects to \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Astley\u2019s 1987 hit single.", "If you ask us how we\u2019re feeling about this statement, don't tell us you're too blind to see.
