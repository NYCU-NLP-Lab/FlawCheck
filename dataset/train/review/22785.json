There are 149 nursing homes; 53 domiciliary facilities that provide a home, food, clothing and medical services; and three facilities that offer day care programs, including medical and rehabilitation services.", "The $750 million allocated in the American Rescue Plan is in addition to funds that the federal government provides annually for homeless veterans through appropriations bills.", "Those funds support various programs operated by the VA that serve homeless veterans, including \u201cHealth Care for Homeless Veterans, Supportive Services for Veteran Families, and the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem program, as well as a collaborative program with [the Department of Housing and Urban Development] called HUD-VASH, through which homeless veterans receive Section 8 vouchers from HUD and supportive services through the VA,\u201d according to the Congressional Research Service. \u201cThe Department of Labor also operates a program for homeless veterans, the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program.\u201d", "The Grant and Per Diem program is for short-term assistance \u2013 which is most similar to the current emergency situation at the border.
