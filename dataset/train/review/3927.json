["About this rating", "President Obama attempted to delegitimize Fox News by calling their oppositional stance \"destructive\" for the country, took questions from Fox News correspondents less frequently than he did from those of other major networks in press briefings, and his administration expressed a willingness to exclude Fox reporters from interviews with top officials.", "The Obama administration never rescinded the press passes of Fox News reporters nor ejected or banned them from White House press conferences.", "President Trump's bellicose relationship with the press reached a crescendo in November 2018, when he blasted CNN correspondent James Acosta for being a \"rude, terrible person\" during a briefing which culminated in the suspension of Acosta's \"hard pass\" to White House press events.", "For all Trump's attacks on what he calls \"the fake news media,\" whom he regularly accuses of lying and being \"enemies of the people,\" however, he is not the first president to have hostile relations with the fourth estate.

For example, in September 2009 Obama famously snubbed \"Fox News Sunday\" (anchored by Chris Wallace) when making the rounds of Sunday talk shows to discuss health care reform, and he did not appear on the show until 2016, his last year in office. Again in 2009, Obama spokesperson Josh Earnest admitted a willingness to exclude Fox News from interviews with top administration officials.\nMore disturbingly, the Washington Post reported in 2013 that Obama's Department of Justice (DOJ) surveilled a Fox News reporter and obtained a search warrant for his e-mails while conducting an investigation into national security leaks in 2009. Although he wasn't the only journalist targeted in such an investigation, the Fox News correspondent was singled out as a possible \"aider, abettor, and/or co-conspirator,\" a fact which, according to the Post, \"distinguishes his case from the probe of the AP, in which the news organization is not the likely target.\"\nNot unlike Trump designating CNN and other mainstream media outlets \"fake news,\" the Obama administration sought to delegitimize Fox News as a reputable news organization and marginalize its reporters.
