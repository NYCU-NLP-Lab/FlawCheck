I didn't inherit money from my parents. What I have, I earned. I worked hard, the American way.\"\n\nWe were curious. Did Romney, the last of George and Lenore's four children, receive no inheritance on his path to wealth?\n\nRomney's words", "We asked Romney's campaign about his claim.", "According to\u00a0a short history\u00a0of the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management at BYU, the family provided an endowment in 1998, within a few years of George Romney's death.\n\nSo, in Romney's own words, he did \"inherit some funds\" from his dad. But he gave them away.\n\nWhy?\n\n\"I figured we had enough of our own,\" he said.\n\nHe probably did. By 1995, Romney had already led Bain Capital for more than a decade, where shrewd investments made him millions. He stepped down in 1999.\n\nHe\u00a0now says he's worth\u00a0somewhere between $190 million and $250 million.\n\nHow Romney got rich\n\n\"I went off on my own,\" Romney said at the debate. \"... What I have I earned. I worked hard, the American way.\"\n\nSo while he didn't ultimately benefit from an inheritance, we wondered: Had Romney's parents' wealth helped build his own fortune?\n\nThere's no evidence we saw that Romney's parents helped buy him a business career. But there were certain advantages to Romney's comfortable upbringing.", "Romney started college at Stanford, where his \"allowance\" was big enough for frequent plane tickets to sneak home to Michigan see his girlfriend, Ann, according to a recently published book by two Boston Globe journalists, \"The Real Romney.\"\n\nAfter a two-year missionary trip to France, where he lived sparely as he proselytized door-to-door, he finished his undergraduate studies at BYU, where he married Ann in 1969. He was 22, his wife 19. His parents' wedding gift? A car. Meanwhile, the students \u2014 who started a family a year later \u2014 lived in a modest, $62-a-month basement apartment, Ann later told the Boston Globe. But they didn't have to work.\n\n\"We were happy, studying hard. Neither one of us had a job, because Mitt had enough of an investment from stock that we could sell off a little at a time,\" she said.\n\nWhen the couple moved to Boston so Romney could study business and law at Harvard, his parents helped them buy a house.\n\nIt's not clear who paid for his education, but Romney wasn't exactly a struggling student: enough cash for plane tickets, a car as a wedding gift, stock that kept him from having to work, help buying a home.\u00a0\n\nWhat about that hard work he mentioned?", "Mitt Romney, comments at a Republican presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., Jan. 16, 2012 (transcript from CQ, subscribers only)\n\nEmail interview with Ryan Williams, spokesman for Mitt Romney, Jan. 17, 2012\n\n\"The Real Romney,\" Michael Kranish and Scott Helman, Harper Collins, 2012\n\nInterview with Michael Kranish, Jan. 20, 2012\n\nNew York Times, \"Romney and his money,\" Jan. 20, 2012\n\nWashington Post Fact Checker, \"Fact checking the CNN debate in Charleston,\" Jan. 20, 2012\n\nCSPAN, \"Q&A Gov.
