["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on August 26, 2016", "Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein cherry-picked the findings of a disputed study when she claimed that global warming would cause sea levels to rise on average \u201cnot one yard but many yards\u201d in as soon as 50 years. Scientific consensus says a more realistic rise is 0.33 to 1.33 yards above current levels by 2100.", "Stein made her claim in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 23 during a press conference in which she discussed her Aug. 21 visit to flooded areas in Louisiana and the natural disaster\u2019s link to climate change.", "According to a 2016 report by the National Academies of Sciences, global warming is expected to lead to more moisture in the atmosphere. This, in turn, can increase the frequency of extreme rainfall events like the one that recently took place in Louisiana.", "Primarily affecting regions around Baton Rouge and Lafayette, the flood damaged tens of thousands of homes\u00a0and killed 13 people, reported NPR. The Red Cross also\u00a0called the flood \u201clikely the worst natural disaster in the United States since 2012\u2019s Superstorm Sandy.\u201d", "Stein did accurately state, \u201cAny one storm cannot be definitively pegged to climate change, but when you see so many at such extreme levels, there\u2019s no question, according to the scientists, that this is a consequence of warmer air that holds much more water.\u201d But then she moved on to exaggerate the extent of projected sea level rise.", "Stein, Aug. 23: There are these growing warnings about sea level rise, according to James Hansen, the foremost climate scientist \u2026 he is predicting meters-worth, that is yards-worth \u2014 not one yard but many yards worth \u2014 of sea level rise as soon as 50 years from now. And that of course would be an absolutely devastating sea level rise that would essentially wipe out coastal population centers, including the likes of Manhattan, and Florida and so on, and actually all over the world, the entire country of Bangladesh.", "This isn\u2019t the first time Stein has exaggerated the extent of projected global sea level rise. But it is the first time she has cited Hansen\u2019s work while making her claim.", "Hansen, a climate scientist at Columbia University, and colleagues did conclude, \u201cContinued high fossil fuel emissions this century are predicted to yield \u2026 sea level rise, reaching several meters over a timescale of 50\u2013150 years\u201d in a study published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics in March 2016.", "However,\u00a0reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which are both collaborations of hundreds of scientists,\u00a0project a much smaller rise over a longer period than Hansen.", "The 2013 IPCC report predicts\u00a0an average rise of between 0.26 to 0.98 meters (1 meter = 1.09 yards) in the global sea level by 2100, with the higher end entailing\u00a0a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario.", "The 2016 Global Change report similarly projects a 1 to 4 feet (3 feet = 1 yard) rise by 2100. However, the report also states, \u201cIn the context of risk-based analysis, some decision makers may wish to use a wider range of scenarios, from 8 inches to 6.6 feet by 2100.\u201d Still,\u00a06.6 feet translates to 2.2 yards, which is not \u201cmany\u201d yards, and it also would not occur in \u201cas soon as 50 years.\u201d", "In his paper, Hansen and colleagues argue\u00a0that ice covering the North and South poles will melt at rates much faster than predicted by the IPCC and others. Instead of a linear rate, the researchers argue\u00a0the rate will grow exponentially, doubling every 10, 20 or 40 years. This will lead to \u201cmulti-meter\u201d global mean sea level rise in about 50, 100 or 200 years, respectively, the authors conclude.", "But the group\u00a0also admits that, while the data they analyzed are \u201cconsistent with\u201d a multi-meter sea level rise in around 50 years, they \u201ccannot exclude slower responses.\u201d This is why the researchers give\u00a0a timescale\u00a0of 50 to 150 years to reach\u00a0several meters of sea level rise.", "In an email to us, Hansen also explained, \u201cIf we stay on business-as-usual high emissions, I would say that several meters [of sea level rise] is unlikely in 50 years, though possible. In 100 years it is likely, and I can\u2019t see how it could be avoided in 200 years.\u201d", "But back in March,\u00a0Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University and\u00a0a lead author on a chapter of the IPCC\u2019s third report,\u00a0told The Guardian:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m always hesitant to ignore the findings and warnings of James Hansen; he has proven to be so very prescient when it comes to his early prediction about global warming. That having been said, I\u2019m unconvinced that we could see melting rates over the next few decades anywhere near his exponential predictions, and everything else is contingent upon those melting rates being reasonable.\u201d", "In 1988, Hansen, then a NASA scientist, testified before Congress on\u00a0the dangers of global warming. His testimony instigated broader awareness of the issue, which has led some\u00a0to call him the \u201cfather of climate change awareness.\u201d", "Steven Goodbred Jr., an environmental scientist at Vanderbilt University\u00a0and expert on sea level rise in Bangladesh, agrees with Mann that Hansen\u2019s warnings should be heeded, but also said Hansen\u2019s latest findings are over the top. \u201cMeters of sea level rise would require major collapse of Greenland or East Antarctic ice sheets,\u201d Goodbred told us by email. \u201cWhile improbable, the evidence that Hansen et al put forth warns us not to think impossible.\u201d", "Goodbred also told us issues in Bangladesh, which Stein mentioned specifically, can\u2019t be boiled down to sea level rise. The Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, which flow from China and India to Bangladesh, together \u201cdeliver the largest sediment load on earth\u201d at around 1 billion metric tons per year, he explained. \u201cThat sediment distributed across Bangladesh\u2019s low-lying coastal region could keep pace\u201d with the current rate of sea level rise, \u201cperhaps with relatively limited consequences (though certainly not none).\u201d", "Along these lines, \u201cany reduction in that supply would harm the system\u2019s ability to respond to sea level rise,\u201d added\u00a0Goodbred. \u201cThreats to sediment delivery (that are more probable than Hansen et al scenarios) include dam construction, water diversion, and increased irrigation/water extraction in upstream areas of India and China.\u201d\u00a0Many of these modifications to the river systems are already planned or ongoing, he said, and represent as much of a threat to Bangladesh as sea level rise does.", "Mann told us the situation in Florida and Manhattan, which Stein also pointed to specifically, can\u2019t be reduced to sea level rise either. \u201cEven 5-6 m of sea level rise would not submerge New York City, or most of Florida,\u201d he said.", "\u201cDue to the threat to our coastlines from the combined effect of sea level rise and potentially more potent hurricanes, we might indeed be looking at managed retreat from coastal regions like Miami and New York City on a timeframe of 50 years,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be because of inundation of these regions. It would be because the cost to insure property would become prohibitive given the greatly increased coastal risk.\u201d", "In other words, Miami\u00a0and Manhattan probably won\u2019t be completely underwater in 50 years, but it may become too expensive for many to live there due\u00a0to\u00a0increased property insurance costs.", "Stein was on the mark when she said warmer air, which can hold more water, has the potential to bring about more\u00a0extreme weather events, such as the one in Louisiana.", "But her claim that global warming would cause sea levels to rise on average \u201cnot one yard but many yards\u201d in as soon as 50 years is\u00a0\u201can example of a greatly exaggerated version of reality that has a kernel of truth to it,\u201d Mann told us.", "Current scientific consensus\u00a0puts the likely global mean sea level rise at a maximum 1.33 yards above current levels by 2100. And for Manhattan, Florida and Bangladesh in particular, issues go above and beyond sea level rise.", "Editor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/39f9cc08-1151-4828-9ed6-823ce98a878a", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
