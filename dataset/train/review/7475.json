["About this rating", "On 12 January 2018, Erin Elizabeth of Health Nut News posted what was, in essence, a regurgitation of a factual article from the Santa Barbara Independent discussing how virulent this year\u2019s flu season is shaping up to be:", "Eight Santa Barbara County residents have died from the flu in the past two weeks alone. By contrast, only three residents died throughout last year\u2019s entire flu season, which typically runs from October to April. All eight people were ages 65 or older. [...] \u201cOur numbers are in line with statewide numbers, and they\u2019re definitely cause for concern,\u201d [public health official Charity Dean said].", "Dean attributed this year\u2019s impact to a strain of flu \u2014 H3N2 \u2014 that\u2019s particularly resistant to vaccination. According to the Center for Disease Control, vaccines have been effective at knocking this strain out only 32 percent of the time. But studies from Australia \u2014 where the flu season runs about six months ahead of the United States and Europe \u2014 indicates the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness could be even more limited than that, only ten percent.", "In keeping with her website\u2019s primary modus operandi, Elizabeth uses these tragic deaths to push her own flawed political argument. Her article (bearing the headline \"8 Die of 'Flu' in 2 Weeks in Santa Barbara. 7 Had Their Flu Shot\") appears to cast doubt on the very existence of influenza, speciously repurposing the story as evidence that people shouldn\u2019t get the flu vaccine:", "This year\u2019s strain of flu, H3N2, has been knocking people out \u2014 hard. But you don\u2019t need a flu shot that\u2019s only 10 percent effective and comes with a host of potential problems. Instead, you need to take care of your body (I\u2019m not a doctor and not trying to tell you what to do) by getting sunlight or taking Vitamin D, drink plenty of water, manage your stress level, and eat plenty of whole foods.", "Half-hearted disclaimer aside, Elizabeth attempts to make or allude to two medically dubious points while offering her own vitamin D-based treatment plan:", "The Flu Vaccine Is Ineffective, So Why Bother?", "The effectiveness of the flu vaccine, as well as the strains it covers, varies year to year depending on \u2014 among other things \u2014 how well researchers are able to predict which strains will be the most virulent each season. That selection is made each year primarily by the World Health Organization Global Influenza Surveillance Network (WHO GISN) in collaboration with research centers all around the world. How well matched their work is to the strains that become problematic each flu season is a primary driver of the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness.", "As referenced by Elizabeth, data from Australia had suggested that the 2017-2018 influenza season's most virulent strain was H3N2. The season's flu shot did include that strain, however, so a mismatch is not likely the issue; according to an increasing body of research, the issue may be with the strain itself.", "H3N2 is more difficult to vaccinate against because it can mutate more rapidly during the vaccine production process and as a result, produce antibodies that do not actually impart immunity against the form of H3N2 to which humans are susceptible. In a 4 January 2018 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, scientists have suggested that this year\u2019s prevalence of H3N2 could be related to this fact.", "Despite the variable effectiveness of annual flu shots \u2014 which have never claimed to provide 100 percent certainty of immunity against various strains of the flu \u2014 doctors and scientists (even the ones writing about its ineffectiveness against H3N2) still strongly recommend getting the shot. Aaron Carroll, a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, argued in an 11 January 2018 New York Times piece that even an ineffective vaccine year can provide tangible benefits, save lives, and reduce hospital visits and deaths:", "Let\u2019s say that this year\u2019s flu vaccine is even worse than we think. Maybe the absolute risk reduction will be as low as 1 percentage point, making the [number of people needed to treat to get a result, a metric known as N.T.T.] 100. That\u2019s still not that bad. Even at an N.N.T. of 100, for every 100 people who get a flu shot, one fewer will get the flu. That\u2019s a pretty low N.N.T. compared with many other treatments that health experts recommend every day.", "Further, a [...] review published in 2016 showed that the N.N.T. in children 6 years old or younger to prevent one flu case was just six \u2014 an astonishing payoff in medical terms. It has even been shown to be effective in preventing death in children from flu-related causes.The negatives of a flu shot are almost nonexistent, and significant side effects are very rare. Even in an ineffective year, the benefits greatly outweigh the harms.", "The Flu Vaccine Will Make You More Susceptible to the Flu and Other Viruses Next Year", "The flu vaccine has been the subject of a number of either completely or mostly incorrect claims made about its safety, which we have previously reviewed in detail. Here Elizabeth adds to that list with a new claim, made in the form of a link to a YouTube video featuring anti-vaccine activist, Natural News contributor and former nephrologist Suzanne Humphries in which she claims that \"plenty\" of medical literature demonstrates that a flu shot increases your risk of getting the flu or other respiratory diseases in following years.", "This is a stretch. One small-scale study published in 2012 found an increased risk of \"virologically-confirmed non-influenza infections,\" arguing that \"being protected against influenza, [flu shot] recipients may lack temporary non-specific immunity that protected against other respiratory viruses.\" No other studies have replicated this result (though many have tried), and a number of larger-scale studies have, in fact, found no evidence that this is the case.", "Elizabeth's effort to turn the tragic deaths of eight senior citizens from the flu into an argument against influenza inoculation rests only on the premise that there is a significant risk to getting the flu shot in the first place. She has provided no credible evidence to support that claim because no credible evidence exists. Instead, she uses the testimony of someone who once provided a biblical rationale for avoiding vaccines to make her argument.", "The fact is, unless you belong to a class of immunocompromised individuals, the flu shot is extremely safe but its effectiveness does vary year to year. Even in its least effective years, though, influenza immunization has been shown to reduce significantly the incidence of the virus at the population level, which ultimately means there will be fewer opportunities for someone to infect, as an example, eight Santa Barbara County residents.", "Welsh, Nick. \u00a0 \"Flu Kills Eight Santa Barbara Residents in Two Weeks.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Santa Barbara Independent. \u00a0 8 January 2018.", "Elizabeth, Erin. \u00a0 \"8 Die of \u2018Flu\u2019 in 2 Weeks in Santa Barbara. 7 Had Their Flu Shot\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Health Nut News. \u00a0 12 January 2018.", "Russell, Colin, A., et al. \u00a0 \"Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection and Recent Studies on the Global Migration of Seasonal Influenza Viruses.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Vaccine. \u00a0 12 September 2008.", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u00a0 \"Vaccine Effectiveness - How Well Does the Flu Vaccine Work?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 15 January 2018.", "Wu, Nicolas C, et al. \u00a0 \"A Structural Explanation for the Low Effectiveness of the Seasonal Influenza H3N2 Vaccine.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 PLOS Pathogens. \u00a0 23 October 2017.", "Paules, Catherine I., et al. \u00a0 \"Chasing Seasonal Influenza \u2014 The Need for a Universal Influenza Vaccine.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New England Journal of Medicine. \u00a0 4 January 2018.", "Carroll, Aaron E., et al. \u00a0 \"Why It\u2019s Still Worth Getting a Flu Shot.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Times. \u00a0 11 January 2018.", "Cowling, Benjamin J., et al. \u00a0 \"Increased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Clinical Infectious Diseases. \u00a0 15 June 2012.", "Hayward, Andrew C., et al. \u00a0 \"Comparative Community Burden and Severity of Seasonal and Pandemic Influenza: Results of the Flu Watch Cohort Study.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. \u00a0 June 2014.", "Sundaram, Maria E. \u00a0 \"Influenza Vaccination Is Not Associated With Detection of Noninfluenza Respiratory Viruses in Seasonal Studies of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Clinical Infectious Diseases. \u00a0 September 2013.", "Humphries, Suzanne. \u00a0 \"In Vaccines We Trust?
