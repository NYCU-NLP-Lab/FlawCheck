["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on September 12, 2017 | Updated on September 12, 2017", "Sen. John McCain says the budget deal President Donald Trump reached with Democratic leaders \u201cbasically freezes last year\u2019s funding in place, which is a cut of $52 billion\u201d in defense spending. In fact, the deal doesn\u2019t cut the defense budget at all.", "The legislation \u2014 known as a continuing resolution \u2014 funds the federal government for the first three months of fiscal year 2018, which begins Oct. 1, at the same funding level as fiscal year 2017. So McCain is right that the deal \u201cfreezes last year\u2019s funding in place,\u201d but only for three months. We won\u2019t know the size of the defense budget until Congress passes a permanent funding plan.", "In an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d McCain criticized Trump\u2019s support for a short-term budget plan proposed by the Democratic leaders. McCain voted against the bill, which Trump signed on Sept. 6.", "The bill \u2014 known as the\u00a0Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017 \u2014 provided $15 billion in emergency hurricane relief, raised the debt ceiling and temporarily funded the government for the first three months of fiscal year 2018 at current levels.", "Asked by anchor Jake Tapper why he voted against a \u201cbipartisan\u201d bill, McCain \u2014 who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2014 said it would cut defense spending.", "McCain, Sept. 10: [T]his agreement basically freezes last year\u2019s funding in place, which is a cut of $52 billion.", "As we said, McCain is right about the funding freeze. But that freeze is only for three months, and the senator didn\u2019t explain how keeping funding at the same level can result in a cut \u2014 let alone a $52 billion cut.", "We asked McCain\u2019s office about the $52 billion \u201ccut,\u201d and we were told that McCain is actually referring to the difference\u00a0between Trump\u2019s request for $603 billion in base defense spending for fiscal year 2018, which begins Oct. 1, and the $551 billion in the base defense budget for fiscal 2017, which ends Sept. 30.", "There are two issues with McCain\u2019s math: He exaggerates the difference between what Trump proposed for the total defense budget and the continuing resolution, and there hasn\u2019t been an actual cut in spending.", "Trump is proposing an increase in total defense spending \u2014 not just base defense spending \u2014 of $34 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u00a0analysis\u00a0of the president\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal year 2018.", "As we have written before, CBO has said Trump\u2019s proposed FY2018 budget would increase defense spending by 5 percent. \u201cFor defense discretionary programs in 2018, the President proposes appropriations of $668 billion, which would be $34 billion (or 5 percent) more than the amount provided in 2017,\u201d CBO said.", "The $668 billion includes $603 billion in base defense spending and $65 billion for overseas contingency operations, or OCO, which fund ongoing military operations in the Middle East.", "McCain was referring only to the base defense spending, not the total amount.", "Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told us it makes more sense to use the total defense budget, rather than just the base defense budget, when comparing the impact of congressional funding.", "Harrison also told us that McCain\u2019s use of the word \u201ccut\u201d is wrong, or \u201cat a minimum unclear,\u201d because the senator didn\u2019t explain that he was comparing the funding to proposed funding, not the actual current funding level.", "\u201cYes, it is $52B less (in the base budget) than the President requested,\u201d Harrison said in an email. \u201cIt is not a cut at all compared to the current level of funding. The very nature of a CR is that it continues funding at the same level as last year until a regular appropriations bill is enacted. So this is not a cut, and it\u2019s not permanent.\u201d", "This is not to say that a temporary fix that continues funding at the same level will not have an impact on the Defense Department. McCain may have a point about that.", "In a Nov. 7,\u00a02016, report\u00a0on the impact of the fiscal 2017 continuing resolution on defense spending, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service noted that the Defense Department\u00a0had started the fiscal year under a continuing resolution in 12 of the last 16 years \u2014 that\u2019s now 13 in the last 17 years. The report\u00a0said: \u201cCRs can create hurdles\u201d and \u201cfoster inefficiencies\u201d for federal agencies, such as preventing them from \u201ctaking advantage of efficiencies through bulk buys and multi-year contracts.\u201d", "\u201cI suppose that a CR \u2014 if extended well into the fiscal year \u2014 would be a problem,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cBut as long as Congress eventually enacts a regular appropriations bill at some point in FY18, the funding level of the CR will not matter.\u201d", "The current fiscal year is a good example.", "Congress twice extended government funding\u00a0this fiscal year with continuing resolutions. The first CR provided defense funding for the first three months of fiscal 2017 that was $5.3 billion, or about 1 percent, less than the department\u2019s fiscal 2017 funding request (see table 1 of the CRS report).\u00a0The second CR, which extended funding through April 28, provided more than $9 billion in additional funding for the Defense Department, including $8 billion extra for overseas contingency operations.\u00a0In May, Trump signed\u00a0the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017\u00a0that provided permanent funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2017 \u2014 including an\u00a0additional $21 billion\u00a0for the military.", "As a result, the Defense Department received more money than it initially requested for fiscal 2017.", "The White House says\u00a0it will continue to seek the defense funding requested in the president\u2019s budget for fiscal 2018. We will have to wait to see what happens, but we can say that the actions taken so far have not created a $52 billion cut in defense spending.", "Updated, Sept. 12: This has been updated with a response from the White House.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
