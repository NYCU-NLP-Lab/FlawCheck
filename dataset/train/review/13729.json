["President Joe Biden struck a contrast with his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, when he spoke at last week\u2019s virtual Munich Security Conference about the importance of global alliances", "But a claim circulating on social media suggests that Biden had a stronger rebuke for the country he represents, calling it \u201can embarrassment.\u201d", "The claim shared on Facebook uses a photo of Biden in front of a Munich Security Conference backdrop, with the text \u201cJoe Biden tells Europeans in Munich that America is \u2018an embarrassment.\u2019\u201d", "While Biden has used the word \u201cembarrassment\u201d about U.S. border policy and the separation of migrant children from their parents during a past address at the conference, he didn\u2019t during remarks he delivered virtually on Feb. 19.", "A user who shared the post did not respond to request seeking comment.", "More:Fact check: Posts falsely claim Biden gave China control of U.S. power grid", "During the 2021 Munich Security Conference, Biden said that Democracy was \u201cunder assault\u201d and reiterated that the U.S. supported NATO while calling out Russia and China.", "A search of his official remarks, though, shows he did not use the word \u201cembarrassment\u201d or \u201cembarrassing\u201d during the 2021 conference.", "But Biden did make news at the conference in February 2019, months before announcing his run for president, when he spoke about U.S. border policy.", "The image used in the Facebook post came from that 2019 speech.", "\u201cThe America I see values basic human decency, not snatching children from their parents or turning our back on refugees at our border. Americans know that\u2019s not right. The American people understand plainly that it makes us an embarrassment. The American people know overwhelmingly that\u2019s not right, that\u2019s not who we are,\u201d Biden said at the time.", "More:Biden seeks to 'reinvigorate' US-Canada relations in first bilateral meeting with Trudeau", "The comment came in a portion of Biden\u2019s 20-minute speech, in which\u00a0he said he wanted to give insight into his country \u201cas a citizen\u201d because he did not hold elected office at the time. He said there was a perception that the U.S. was \u201cpulling away from the world and our leadership responsibilities.\u201d", "While Biden said then that there was \u201canxiety about what the future holds\u201d among the American people, he said, \u201cI can assure you that the American people, the ultimate wellspring of power in the United States of America, remain committed to engaging the world with decency and respect. That is the prevailing view of the American people.\u201d", "The claim that Biden said America is \"an embarrassment\" while in Munich is MISSING CONTEXT. While Biden did use the word \u201cembarrassment,\u201d it was during a 2019 speech at the Munich Security Conference, not when he delivered remarks last week as president during the 2021 virtual conference. Biden also was speaking specifically about U.S. border policies at the time and the separation of migrant children from their parents.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
