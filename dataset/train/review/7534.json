He won't use the term \u2018radical Islamic terrorism,\u2019\" Trump said during the Oct. 9 debate at Washington University in St. Louis. \"Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name. But the name is there.

I think they mean the same thing.\"", "Clinton emphasizes a distinction between a \"distorted version of Islam\" and the religion itself.", "\"What I won't do, because I think it is dangerous for our efforts to defeat this threat, is to demonize and demagogue and, you know, declare war on an entire religion. That plays right into ISIS' hands,\" she said. \"We can call it radical jihadism, we can call it radical Islamism. But we also want to reach out to the vast majority of American Muslims and Muslims around this country, this world, to help us defeat this threat, which is so evil and has got to be denounced by everyone, regardless of religion.\"", "Clinton made similar comments in an interview on NBC Today.", "\"It matters what we do, not what we say. It mattered that we got bin Laden, not the name we called him,\" she said. \"But if he is somehow suggesting I don't call this for what it is, he hasn't been listening.
