Scott Walker on the day Walker filed federal papers as a precursor to announcing his run for president.", "\"We\u2019ve cut the deficit by two-thirds.

Yes!\"\n\nHere's why the deficit claim caught our attention:", "In September 2014 in Milwaukee, Obama said he had cut the deficit in half. We rated that statement True, and it has become one of our most-clicked fact checks.", "Could it be that, less than a year later, the deficit is down by two-thirds?", "Deficit vs debt", "Let\u2019s be clear at the top that Obama is talking about the deficit, which has been getting smaller -- not the debt, which is getting bigger.", "The deficit is an annual number. It\u2019s the difference between what the government collects in revenues and spends in one year. The United States hasn\u2019t seen budget surpluses since the days of President Bill Clinton.", "The debt, meanwhile, is a running tally -- it\u2019s the total of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses.
