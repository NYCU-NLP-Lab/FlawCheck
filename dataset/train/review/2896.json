The wealthy are the only ones doing well, period.", "Whether workers are doing \u201cwell\u201d may be a matter of opinion, but the fact is, rank-and-file workers have been making steady gains in weekly paychecks.", "Figures released earlier on the day of the debate by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers in \u201creal\u201d terms \u2014 that is, after adjusting for inflation \u2014\u00a0rose 2.5%\u00a0during President Donald Trump\u2019s first 35 months in office. That\u2019s actually a more rapid pace than when Biden was vice president, when real weekly\u00a0earnings rose 4% over eight years.", "Furthermore, rank-and-file\u00a0production and nonsupervisory workers\u00a0(82% of all workers) are doing just a bit better than their bosses during Trump\u2019s tenure. Real earnings for them have gone up 2.6%.", "To be sure, those at the top are gaining faster. A\u00a0study last year by ISS Analytics\u00a0for the Harvard Law School\u2019s Forum on Corporate Governance found that the median compensation of chief executive officers of S&P 600 corporations rose 95% (before inflation) between 2009 and 2018, while median worker pay rose only 20%.", "But saying that \u201conly\u201d the wealthy are doing well is just not true.", "Biden continued to spin the history around his vote in 2002 to authorize the use of military force in Iraq, claiming the Bush administration \u201csaid they were not going to go to war\u201d and only sought weapons inspections. In a speech days before Biden\u2019s vote, Bush made clear that military action was possible.", "Biden also misleadingly claimed that from the moment the war started, \u201cI was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake.\u201d Biden criticized President Bush for getting into the war too soon, with too few allies, and without a clear plan to \u201cwin the peace,\u201d but he did not initially oppose the war altogether.", "Here\u2019s how Biden described things during the debate:", "Biden: It was a mistake to trust that they weren\u2019t going to go to war. They said they were not going to go to war. They said they were just going to get inspectors in. The world, in fact, voted to send inspectors in, and they still went to war. From that point on I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake. And from that point on I voted to \u2014 I moved to bring those troops home.", "In a\u00a0speech\u00a0on Oct. 7, 2002, just days before Congress would vote on a resolution authorizing military force against Iraq, Bush said that after years of \u201ccontainment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon.\u201d", "Bush did call for new, tougher inspections and sanctions \u2014 as Biden said during the debate. But contrary to Biden\u2019s claim that the Bush administration assured \u201cthey were not going to go to war,\u201d Bush made clear in that speech that war was possible.", "\u201cI hope this will not require military action, but it may,\u201d Bush said.", "A day after the resolution\u00a0passed\u00a0the House on Oct. 10, 2002, it passed the Senate\u00a077-23,\u00a0with Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, voting in favor.", "In the days and weeks before and after the war started, Biden said that while the hope was that the resolution could be used to leverage further inspections, he also acknowledged it was a vote for the possibility of war.", "\u201cThe way the Constitution works is, we voted to give the president the authority to go to war,\u201d Biden said in\u00a0a CNN interview\u00a0two weeks after the war started. \u201cIt\u2019s our decision whether or not we go from a state of peace to a state of war. We gave him that authority. You can second guess whether we should have or not. Once we\u2019ve [done] that then it\u2019s his decision to prosecute the war.\u201d", "During the debate, Biden also misleadingly claimed that from the moment the war actually started, \u201cI was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake.\u201d", "As we\u00a0have written\u00a0before, Biden was a consistent critic of the way the Bush administration handled the war: its failure to exhaust diplomatic solutions, its failure to enlist a more robust group of allies for the war effort, and the lack of a plan for reconstruction of Iraq. Some of his comments proved to be quite prescient, including his warnings about the likely higher-than-expected cost and length of the war, and the complexity of \u201cwinning the peace\u201d once Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime was toppled.", "In other words, Biden argued that it was a mistake\u00a0the way\u00a0the Bush administration went to war, but Biden never outright opposed military action in Iraq in the immediate days after the start of the invasion. The day the war commenced, Biden\u00a0told CNN: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of us who voted for giving the president the authority to take down Saddam Hussein if he didn\u2019t disarm. And there are those who believe, at the end of the day, even though it wasn\u2019t handled all that well, we still have to take him down.\u201d", "In\u00a0an interview with Charlie Rose\u00a0on March 20, 2003, the day after the start of the war, Biden said, \u201cI all along, Charlie, believed the right decision is to separate him from his weapons and/or separate him from power.\u201d", "\u201cIf the U.N. didn\u2019t do it, do it?\u201d Rose interjected.", "\u201cYes, you\u2019ve gotta do it,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not the time to argue it, but I am disturbed at the lost opportunities we had to bring the rest of the world along with us to this point. \u2026 And so now the question is \u2026 can you make lemonade out of lemons here?\u201d", "In a\u00a0Brookings Institution address\u00a0on July 31, 2003, Biden said the Bush administration was \u201cright to confront the challenge posed by Saddam thumbing his nose at the world and refusing \u2014 refusing \u2014 to alter his conduct.\u00a0Contrary to what some in my party might think, Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with sooner, rather than later. So I commend the president. \u2026\u00a0For me,\u00a0the issue was never\u00a0whether\u00a0we had to deal with Saddam, but when and how we dealt with Saddam. And it\u2019s precisely the when and how that I think this administration got wrong. We went to war too soon. We went to war with too few troops. We went to war without the world, when we could have had many with us, and we\u2019re paying the price for it now.\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t until Nov. 27, 2005, that Biden acknowledged on\u00a0NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d\u00a0that his 2002 vote authorizing force in Iraq was \u201ca mistake.\u201d", "Sanders made several claims about health care that were close to true, but not quite there.", "Sanders went too far (again) when he claimed: \u201cWe\u2019re spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.\u201d The U.S. spends twice as much as most countries \u2014 and twice as much as the average for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries \u2014 but not twice as much as \u201cany other country.\u201d", "According to the most recent OECD data, the U.S. per capita spending ($10,586) was twice as much as every country except six others, though the U.S. spending was close to double the amount for several of those nations (Denmark, Austria and Sweden). However, Switzerland\u2019s per capita spending was $7,317; Norway\u2019s was $6,187, and Germany came in at $5,986.", "The senator also exaggerated in claiming that \u201cyou\u2019ve got 500,000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills.\u201d The research he has cited indicates that medical bills or health problems contributed to \u2014 but not solely caused in all cases \u2014 a half million bankruptcy filings. We wrote more about the claim after the September debate.", "Sanders claimed that \u201cworkers\u201d were \u201cpaying on average 20% of their incomes for health care. That is insane.\u201d His campaign pointed us to a figure from the Milliman Medical Index, which said in 2018 the cost for a \u201ctypical family of four\u201d with an employer-sponsored health plan was $12,378, which includes employee contributions to premiums and out-of-pocket costs. That figure is nearly 20% of the 2018 median household income of $63,179, according to Census Bureau figures (see Table H-11), the campaign said. But that\u2019s not the correct Census statistic to use for a \u201cfamily of four.\u201d", "The average household size was 2.52 people. Census does have a median income figure for a family of four, and that\u2019s $97,631 (see Table F-8). That would make $12,378 in health care spending 12.7% of the median income for a family of four.", "Near the end of the debate, moderators asked candidates about climate change, drawing out a response from Sanders in which he suggested the planet could become unlivable.", "Sanders:\u00a0If we as a nation do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, not by 2050, not by 2040, but unless we lead the world right now \u2014 not easy stuff \u2014 the planet we are leaving our kids will be uninhabitable and unhealthy.", "It\u2019s unclear exactly what timeline Sanders had in mind, or what he meant by \u201cuninhabitable,\u201d but many scientists disagree with the notion that the entire planet will soon become uninhabitable because of climate change.", "As we\u2019ve\u00a0noted\u00a0before\u00a0when clarifying politicians\u2019 comments about climate change being an \u201cexistential\u201d threat, NASA scientist Benjamin Cook said that it was plausible that some parts of the world could become unlivable. \u201cIn a given locality, if the impacts are so severe,\u201d he said in a phone interview, the current way of life could become \u201cno longer tenable.\u201d", "But he did not think that would happen everywhere.

One or two words.", "Warren, following the rules, simply replied \u201cclimate change.\u201d Biden, Sanders, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and businessman Tom Steyer were not in the June 26 debate, so they weren\u2019t asked that question.", "Klobuchar also misled when she said that in her answer to the question about the biggest threat she said Iran \u201cbecause of Donald Trump, because I feared that exactly what happened would happen: enrichment of uranium, escalation of tensions, leaving frayed relations with our allies.\u201d We provide her entire answer above.", "Klobuchar is referring to another question asked during the same debate \u2014 but that question was not asked of Warren or any of the other candidates in last night\u2019s debate.", "Lester Holt, who was also a moderator of the June 26 debate, asked Klobuchar if the nuclear agreement was a \u201cgood deal\u201d for the United States. She said it was \u201cimperfect\u201d but a \u201cgood deal for that moment.\u201d She went on to express concern about Iran exceeding the limits on enriching uranium and the possibility of war.", "But Klobuchar is not the only Democratic candidate who sees Iran as a threat or fears Trump will lead the U.S. to war with Iran.", "In the first night of the second debate, Warren  said the world is getting \u201ccloser and closer to nuclear warfare\u201d because Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement with Iran.", "Warren, July 30: At a time when Donald Trump is pulling out of our nuclear negotiations, expanding the opportunities for nuclear proliferation around the world, has pulled us out of the deal in Iran, and Iran is now working on its nuclear weapon, the world gets closer and closer to nuclear warfare.", "Sanders exaggerated when he said repeatedly that 500,000 people are \u201csleeping out on the streets.\u201d", "Sanders: How does it happen that \u2026 half a million people are sleeping out on the streets tonight?", "Sanders:\u00a0We got 500,000 people sleeping out on the streets tonight.", "That\u2019s wrong.
