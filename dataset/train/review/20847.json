["By Eugene Kiely and Lori Robertson", "Posted on January 16, 2019", "On the same day ISIS claimed responsibility for a deadly attack against U.S. service members in Syria, Vice President Mike Pence declared that ISIS \u201chas been defeated.\u201d It is true that the U.S. and its allies have retaken virtually all of the land ISIS controlled in Iraq and Syria, but experts say the group still has tens of thousands of fighters and remains dangerous.", "Pence made his remarks\u00a0at\u00a0the Global Chiefs of Mission Conference at the U.S. State Department.", "Pence, Jan. 16:\u00a0Thanks to the leadership of this commander in chief and the courage and sacrifice of our armed forces we\u2019re now actually able to begin to hand off the fight against ISIS in Syria to our coalition partners, and we\u2019re bringing our troops home. The caliphate has crumbled and ISIS has been defeated.", "In Syria, however,\u00a019 people were reportedly killed in a suicide bombing at a restaurant in the city of Manbij. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed\u00a0four Americans, including two U.S. service members, a Defense Department civilian and a DOD contractor, according to the Pentagon. The announcement of the U.S. deaths came shortly after Pence spoke.", "After the attack, Pence released a statement offering his condolences to the \u201cloved ones of the fallen.\u201d He did not repeat that ISIS had been \u201cdefeated,\u201d but he said the U.S. has \u201ccrushed the ISIS caliphate and devastated its capabilities.\u201d", "The vice president was following the lead of President Donald Trump, who on Dec. 19 posted a video on Twitter to announce that U.S. troops would be withdrawing from Syria. \u201cWe\u2019ve beaten them and we\u2019ve beaten them badly,\u201d Trump said of ISIS, which is also known as the Islamic State. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken back the land and now it\u2019s time for our troops to come back home.\u201d", "But military experts \u2014 including those in the U.S. military \u2014 have cautioned against declaring victory over the terrorist group, even though, as Trump said, \u201cwe\u2019ve taken back the land\u201d once controlled by ISIS in Iraq and Syria.", "According to analytics and consultancy firm\u00a0IHS Markit, near its height in January 2015, the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria covered about 35,000 square miles.\u00a0The U.S-led coalition\u00a0reported\u00a0a year ago that 98 percent of that territory had been reclaimed.\u00a0At the time,\u00a0Brett McGurk, special presidential envoy\u00a0for the global coalition to counter ISIS, said the U.S. and its allies had made \u201ca lot of progress,\u201d but warned that \u201cISIS will be around for a while, so \u2026 we have a long way to go.\u201d", "In a September 2018\u00a0report, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \u2014 citing U.S. military estimates \u2014 said ISIS had \u201capproximately 30,000 current and former IS personnel\u201d in areas of Syria and Iraq. The United Nations made \u201csimilar estimates\u201d of ISIS presence in the region, the report said.", "The CRS report quoted a Defense Department spokesman, Cmdr. Sean Robertson, as saying ISIS is probably as dangerous as al-Qaeda in Iraq was at its peak in the mid-2000s.", "CRS report, Sept. 25, 2018:\u00a0Defense Department officials assess that the Islamic State \u201cis well-positioned to rebuild and work on enabling its physical caliphate to re-emerge,\u201d and \u201cprobably is still more capable than Al Qaeda in Iraq at its peak in 2006-2007, when the group had declared an Islamic state and operated under the name Islamic State of Iraq. \u2026\u201d", "Those partial quotes are from Robertson\u2019s interview with Voice of America in August for a story that carried the headline, \u201cIslamic State \u2018Well-Positioned\u2019 to Rebuild Caliphate.\u201d", "On Dec. 11, 2018, just eight days before Trump announced a troop withdrawal from Syria, McGurk said at a press briefing, \u201cNobody is declaring a mission accomplished. Defeating a physical caliphate is one phase of a much longer-term campaign.\u201d", "In a Dec. 15 interview, four days before Trump\u2019s announcement, McGurk told CNBC that there was still more work to do in the months ahead to keep control of recaptured land.", "\u201cWe\u2019re on track now over the coming months to defeat what used to be the physical space that ISIS controlled,\u201d McGurk told CNBC\u2019s Hadley Gamble. \u201cThat will not be the end of ISIS.\u201d", "After Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw, Defense Secretary James Mattis and McGurk both resigned in protest.", "Daniel Byman,\u00a0a senior fellow in the Brookings Institutions\u2019\u00a0Center for Middle East Policy and the\u00a0senior associate dean for undergraduate affairs at Georgetown University\u2019s Walsh School of Foreign Service, wrote in December, after Trump\u2019s withdrawal announcement, that the Islamic State is \u201cfar from \u2018defeated,'\u201d as the president had claimed.", "\u201cThe U.S.-led military campaign has greatly weakened the group, and Trump should rightly be proud of that success,\u201d Byman wrote in an article for Brookings\u2019 website. But the group could reemerge.", "\u201cThe Islamic State still controls small pockets of territory in Syria. More important, it has a large underground presence, and it is waiting for outside pressure to ease to reassert itself,\u201d Byman said. \u201cThe group commits dozens of attacks each month as well as a massive assassination campaign to prevent any local governance from taking hold, and it still has thousands of fighters under arms.\u201d", "A month earlier, Byman wrote\u00a0that ISIS, as other terrorist groups before it, has spread its reach beyond Iraq and Syria to other countries.", "\u201c[T]he Islamic State and other groups like al-Qaida have a presence in countries like Mali, Pakistan, Somalia, and other parts of the Muslim world,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThough outflows of foreign fighters from Syria have not been huge, small numbers have made their way to Libya, Afghanistan, and other fields of jihad.\u201d", "Similarly,\u00a0Michael P. Dempsey,\u00a0the national intelligence fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the former acting director of National Intelligence,\u00a0wrote a year ago that the group\u2019s \u201ctactics are evolving.\u201d", "\u201cWith the end of the physical caliphate, ISIS\u2019 tactics are evolving. It is more and more likely to avoid major battlefield engagements and instead resort to terrorist attacks in the Middle East, other conflict zones, and the West,\u201d\u00a0Dempsey wrote in Foreign Affairs, a publication of the Council on Foreign Relations.", "Dempsey continues: \u201cU.S. policy needs to change quickly to meet the evolving threat, both in terms of its operations in the region and of its counterterrorism priorities at home.\u201d", "\u201cIn order to remain militarily relevant, ISIS increasingly prefers to conduct isolated suicide attacks and hit-and-run operations,\u201d Dempsey wrote. \u201cIn early January, the group\u2019s official media wing published a list celebrating nearly 800 such attacks in 2017, including ones against the Iraqi military (nearly 500), Kurdish forces in Syria (136), and the Assad regime and its allies (120), as well as a few dozen against moderate opposition groups in Syria.\u201d", "As far back as December 2017,\u00a0Benjamin Bahney and Patrick B. Johnston wrote in Foreign Affairs that ISIS was \u201cquietly preparing\u201d to resurrect and reinvent itself.", "\u201cISIS could resurrect its caliphate where it was born, in Iraq and Syria. It has been planning for such a resurrection since at least 2016, and quietly preparing since well before losing Raqqa in October,\u201d they wrote.\u00a0\u201cMost ominously, ISIS has a tried-and-true playbook for bringing itself back from near death. Just a few years ago, it managed to resurrect itself after apparent defeat. And the history of that resurrection should serve as a warning of what may be coming now.\u201d", "It\u2019s unclear how and when the Trump administration will withdraw troops from Syria. John Bolton, the president\u2019s national security adviser, has said\u00a0the U.S. will impose conditions for withdrawal.", "\u201cThere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal,\u201d Bolton told reporters in Jerusalem on Jan. 6. Bolton\u2019s conditions included \u201cdefeating what\u2019s left of ISIS in Syria and protecting Kurdish militias who have fought alongside U.S. troops against the extremist group,\u201d according to the Associated Press.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
