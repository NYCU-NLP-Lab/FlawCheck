And, how we should be thinking about it. I mean we\u2019ve had in India for some time, a policy framework, particularly when we were in the UPA, of providing sort of a floor for poor people. MGNREGA, Right to Food etc. and now a lot of that work is going to sort of fall by the wayside because we have this disease come in, and millions and millions of people are going to fall back into poverty. This is something\u2026 How should one think about this?\u201d questions Gandhi.", "To which Banerjee replied: \u201cI think that these are kind of separable in my view. In the sense that I think the real problem in the very short run is that these I think more policies.. good policies put in place by the UPA are inadequate. And the government in a sense absolutely embraced them. I mean it was not that there was a particular partisan disagreement. That was very clear that the UPA instruments will be used for doing whatever it is. I think what is harder to wrap one\u2019s head around is for what do you do about the people who are not covered by that. That is a lot of people. The migrants in particular.\u201d", "In the next few minutes, Banerjee elaborates on what he meant by \u201cinadequate\u201d policies.", "\u201cOne of the ideas that was mooted I think in the last years of the UPA but also embraced by the current government was the idea that the Aadhaar would be made national and therefore would be used for PDS and other things. So, the Aadhaar based claims on PDS would be \u2026 you would be eligible for it wherever you are. That would have been wonderful to have that right now. We sort of looking back I would say that would have saved a lot of misery because I think a lot of people would have then gone to the local ration shop and said here is my Aadhaar. I am you know I am eligible for PDS, I am collecting PDS in Mumbai, even though my family resides in Malda or Darbhanga or whatever. That\u2019s my claim and so I think the fact that didn\u2019t happen means that there\u2019s a bunch of people for whom there isn\u2019t really a system. They aren\u2019t eligible to MGNREGA because they are in Bombay there is no MGNREGA in Bombay\u2026that they are not eligible for PDS because they are not actually residents. Part of the problem in the very short run is that the conceptualisation of the welfare structure was based on the idea that anybody who\u2019s really not in where they are supposed to be is actually working and is earning an income and therefore we don\u2019t have to worry about them. And that\u2019s what has collapsed.\u201d", "Simply put, Banerjee said the policies put in place by the UPA regime were good but are currently inadequate because they don\u2019t cover a large section of the poor, migrants in particular. He elaborated how the migrants stuck in different parts of the country are facing problems in procuring ration through the Public Distribution System (PDS) as the infrastructure of Aadhaar is not being used for the same. Banerjee also explained how migrant workers are not eligible for rations in states where they are not residents.", "Moneycontrol.com and News18 misquoted economist Abhijit Banerjee.
