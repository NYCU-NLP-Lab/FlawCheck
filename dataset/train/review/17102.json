And the evidence that you\u2019re talking about, John, is anecdotal evidence. So, as the commissioner of FDA and the president mentioned yesterday, we\u2019re trying to strike a balance between making something with a potential of an effect to the American people available, at the same time that we do it, under the auspices of a protocol that would give us information to determine if it\u2019s truly safe and truly effective. But the information that you\u2019re referring to specifically is anecdotal. It was not done in a controlled, clinical trial. So, you really can\u2019t make any definitive statement about it.\"", "The FDA also tempered expectations, saying in a news release is is working closely with other government agencies and academic centers that are studying chloroquine \"to determine whether it can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding, which can help prevent the spread of disease.
