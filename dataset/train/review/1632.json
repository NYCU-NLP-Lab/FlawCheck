They were brought against former Alabama Secretary of State Nancy Worley in 2007.", "Several other sites copied the story or linked to a version with a robotic voice reading it on YouTube.", "The story is misleading from the start \u2014 and not just because of the unrelated picture of Pelosi. It begins by saying: \u201cThe head of the Alabama Democratic Party found herself in very hot water just recently.\u201d", "But it wasn\u2019t recent. More than 10 years ago, Worley was charged with violating state law when she sent a letter soliciting support from her employees for her bid for reelection as the secretary of state, according to court documents from the case. She was not reelected, and she ended up entering a \u201cbest interest\u201d plea to one misdemeanor charge in 2012.", "The following year, she became the chairwoman of the state Democratic Party in Alabama.", "Parts of the Right Wing News story appear to be lifted from a report by the NBC affiliate in Montgomery, Alabama, that was posted shortly after the charges were filed in 2007. One sentence, for example, says, \u201cShe did not want to go on camera to respond to the accusations against her.\u201d", "The writer of the Right Wing News story, Terresa Monroe-Hamilton, did not return a call for comment, and the phone number that Right Wing News gives on its Facebook page connects to Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.", "Updated, July 24:\u00a0After we posted our story, Right Wing News changed its headline and parts of its story,\u00a0which\u00a0it agreed was\u00a0\u201coutdated & incorrect.\u201d It also removed the Facebook post that showed an unrelated photo of Nancy Pelosi. The publication explains all the changes in an\u00a0editor\u2019s note\u00a0at the end of its story.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.", "\u201cHead Of Democratic Party Just Hauled Out In Handcuffs With Multiple Charges \u2013 Enjoy Life Behind Bars!\u201d RWNofficial.com. 12 Jun 2018.", "State of Alabama v.
