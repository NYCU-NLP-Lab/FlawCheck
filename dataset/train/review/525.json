["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Activists participating in Occupy Wall Street, a movement that protests greed, corporate influence and unemployment, began camping out in New York\u2019s financial district in September 2011 and have spawned similar demonstrations around the country.\n\nSupporters include the left-leaning political advocacy group MoveOn.org and Russ Feingold, the former Democratic U.S. senator from Wisconsin, who said \"accountability for corporate greed is long overdue.\"\n\nAs part of what is being billed as an international protest, local offshoots of the Occupy Wall Street plan to demonstrate in Milwaukee, Madison and Appleton on Oct. 15, 2011.\n\nOn Oct. 4, 2011, Wisconsin Public Radio host Joy Cardindiscussed the demonstrations with Matthew Rothschild, editor and publisher of The Progressive. The 102-year-old Madison magazine calls itself \"one of the leading voices for peace and social justice in this country.\"\n\nWhen Cardin asked Rothschild why younger people are leading the demonstrations, he said: \"The unemployment rate for people between the ages of 16 and 24 in this country is 18.4 percent, which is a 60-year high.\"\n\nIs the rate for younger workers that high?\n\nUnemployment has been a major issue since the start of the recession in December 2007 -- and not just for people in their late teens and early 20s.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor reported, for example, that in December 2009, unemployment reached a record 7.2 percent among people ages 55 and over and that people in that age group spent an average of 35 weeks out of work -- considerably more than the average of 23 weeks for unemployed people ages 16 to 24.\n\nIn making his claim about younger workers, Rothschild told us he was quoting an April 2011 report from the Economic Policy Institute.\n\nIt said: \"In 2010, the unemployment rate for workers age 16-24 was 18.4 percent \u2014 the worst on record in the 60 years that this data has been tracked.\"\n\nSo, although Rothschild said the current rate of unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 is at a 60-year high, he was referring to the annual rate for 2010.\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute is a liberal-leaning Washington, D.C. think tank that says it seeks to \"broaden discussions about economic policy to include the needs of low- and middle-income workers.\"\n\nIts report -- which urges \"substantial additional stimulus spending\" by the federal government to create jobs for younger workers -- says the unemployment statistics came from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau is the federal government\u2019s statistics keeper on unemployment.\n\nWe queried the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 database to create a chart showing the monthly and annual unemployment rates for people ages 16 to 24 from 1948 through August 2011.\n\nWe found that the Economic Policy Institute report was correct: Unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 was 18.4 percent in 2010; and that rate is higher than any annual rate dating back to when statistics were first kept in 1948. That\u2019s more than 60 years.\n\nThe next-highest annual rates, each exceeding 17 percent, were posted in 1982, 1983 and 2009.\n\nIn each of the first eight months of 2011, however, the rate has been below the 2010 mark of 18.4 percent.\n\nUnemployment among people ages 16 to 24 was 17.7 percent in August 2011, the most recent month for which statistics are available. And the year-to-date average is 17.6 percent.\n\nSo, the rate is lower today than it was for 2010 as a whole, though only eight months of 2011 are accounted for. We don\u2019t know, of course, how the year will end up.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nRothschild said unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 \"is 18.4 percent, which is a 60-year high.\" The 18.4 percent is correct as the average rate for 2010, and that average annual rate is the highest in more than 60 years. More recent figures, however, show the unemployment rate among people ages 16 to 24 has dipped below 18 percent in 2011, at least through August.\n\nWe rate Rothschild\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "Wisconsin Public Radio, Matthew Rothschild interview, Oct. 4, 2011\n\nInterview, The Progressive editor and publisher Matthew Rothschild, Oct. 5, 2011\n\nEconomic Policy Institute, \"The Class of 2011\" briefing paper, April 20, 2011\n\nThe Progressive, Matthew Rothschild video\n\nTwitter, Russ Feingold tweet, Oct. 5, 2011\n\nMoveOn.org, \"We\u2019re going to Wall Street\" email, Oct. 5, 2011\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Occupy Wall Street rallies headed to Wisconsin,\" Oct. 3, 2011\n\nNew York Times, \"Anti-Wall Street protests spreading to cities large and small,\" Oct. 3, 2011\n\nNew York Times, \"Occupy Wall Street,\" Oct. 3, 2011\n\nOccupy Milwaukee, Facebook Info page\n\n15October website\n\nInterview and email interview, Economic Policy Institute research assistant Nicholas Finio, Oct. 6, 2011\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, monthly and annual unemployment rates among people ages 16 to 24, 1948 through 2011\n\nU.S. News & World Report, \"15 stunning statistics about the job market,\" Sept. 28, 2011\n\nNew York Times, \"Obama proposes protecting unemployed against hiring bias,\" Sept. 26, 2011\n\nU.S. Department of Labor, Issues in Labor Statistics, March 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
