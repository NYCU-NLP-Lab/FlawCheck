Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 that would cap both rates at 15%.", "Payday loans are small-dollar advances designed to provide emergency funds. They are typically due in full on the borrower\u2019s next payday. Critics say these operators take unfair advantage of those in financial distress with exorbitantly high interest rates.", "Sanders, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, zeroed in on those rates in Wisconsin \u2014 and several other states \u2014 in a May 10, 2019\u00a0tweet.

So a state where the four largest lenders had rates of 300%, 400%, 500% and 500% would be listed at 500% since that appears most often.", "In other words, it\u2019s not an \"average\" as Sanders\u2019 tweet claims.", "Sanders\u2019 spokesman Bill Neidhardt confirmed the tweet was based on the numbers from the responsible lending group.", "Wisconsin is one of just three states \u2014 along with Delaware and Texas \u2014 that have no rate limit on short-term payday loans, Kravitz said.\u00a0Many states cap these rates around 15%, and the responsible lending group says caps 36% or less can stop the \"payday loan debt trap\" cycle.", "Other states have recently moved to address this issue.
