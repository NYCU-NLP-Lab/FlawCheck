House and Senate have each passed budget proposals, and now they\u2019re negotiating which provisions to keep and which to change or jettison. One of the main budget writers in the House said that if his chamber gets its way on Pre-K funding, that waiting list could go away entirely \u2013 giving thousands of needy children an educational head start that their parents might not otherwise be able to afford.", "\"The waiting list for Pre-K is over in the House budget,\" Rep.
