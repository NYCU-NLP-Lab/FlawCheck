["After the gruesome gang-rape and murder in Hyderabad where a young veterinarian was burnt to death, actor-turned-parliamentarian Jaya Bachchan suggested that culprits accused of such crimes should be \u201cbrought out in public and lynched\u201d. Amidst the hue and cry across the country, certain images of mob justice are being shared on social media to claim efficiency in deterring crimes against women.", "An image of a man stripped and tied to a pole while a mob attempts to burn him alive is garnering multiple shares on social media.

It\u2019s an image of a man named Marco Quispe J\u00e1come accused of robbery being burnt alive by villagers of Pelileo Grande in Ecuador. Hearing the shouts of Quispe, parish priest Fabricio D\u00e1vila along with the two other locals came to his rescue and doused the fire with a sack and dirt, according to a report by Ecuadorian newspaper El Universo published on October 11, 2006. The accused was later handed over to the police and taken to a hospital where it was found that he suffered second-degree burns.", "\u201cThe subject was apprehended by a group of residents who were guarding the parish, who found him with a bag with keys, screwdrivers, ropes, razor and other items that, according to the inhabitants of the area, he allegedly used to commit his robberies.

Syed Sharif Uddin Khan, a 35-year-old small-time trader, was accused of a raping a 20-year-old student of a local women\u2019s college on February 24, 2015. He was dragged out of the Dimapur Central Jail and lynched by an angry mob on March 5, 2015, according to an initial report by The Indian Express. The police had said that the mob overpowered the jail security, tied up the man and dragged him seven kilometres while thrashing him along the way. The man was believed to be an illegal Bangladeshi infiltrator, said the report. However, the outlet later reported that Khan came from a family of army men. Two of his brothers were serving in the army while one had died on duty.", "\u201cProtesters take picture from the mobile after he was dragged out of the Jail and lynched him on the highway in Dimapur, India north eastern state of Nagaland on Thursday, March 05, 2015.

Police resorted to blank firing and fired tear gas shells to disperse the mob injuring scores of protesters and killing a student,\u201d reads the caption given to a Getty Images photo shot by independent photojournalist Caisii Mao.", "However, according to a Nagaland government report submitted a few days after Khan was lynched in March 2015, the accused had said to the police that he had paid the women after \u201cconsensual sex\u201d twice. On March 12, The Indian Express reported, \u201cWhen contacted, Wabang Jamir, IGP (Range), Nagaland, said that investigators were not aware of the government report and were still treating the case as one of rape.\u201d", "Alt News was unable to locate any other follow-up reports on the investigation. The then Chief Minister of Nagaland T.R. Zeliang was quoted on March 12, 2015, by The Telegraph stating that the investigation into the incident was not complete thus it could not be concluded whether the crime was rape or not. He said that the court will decide the matter while adding that media reports about the government report stating that there was \u201cno rape\u201d were false. In September 2015, Guwahati high court asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the killing of the rape accused. After missing the deadline for the completion of the investigation, CBI filed an application asking for more time to submit the final report. On June 21, 2016, the high court granted six more months.", "\u201cAccording to the high court direction, the CBI registered four cases in connection with the lynching and started its investigation after collecting the case records from Nagaland police on December 10 last year.

In May 2018, NDTV reported that a 12-year-old tribal girl was allegedly raped by a non-tribal salesman in a remote village located near the Myanmar border in Mon district of Nagaland. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, the number of rape incidents in Nagaland in the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 were 35, 26, and 10 respectively.", "In conclusion, an unrelated image of a mob attempting to immolate a robbery-accused in Ecuador was shared as a rape-accused being served justice by a lynch-mob in Nagaland. While the second image is related to this incident, the claim that the man was a rapist was not substantiated. Furthermore, it is untrue that no incidents of rape have been reported in the state since the 2015 lynching.", "It is noteworthy that mob justice has become a talking point since the Hyderabad rape case after parliamentarians called for the culprits to be surrendered to the public and lynched. An attempt at public extrajudicial punishment was in fact made on November 30 when locals hurled slippers on the policemen who stopped them from entering the Shadnagar police station where the Hyderabad rape-accused are held. Lawmakers encouraging citizens to take the law in their own hands, coupled with social media posts promoting that mob justice deters heinous crimes, can prove to set a dangerous precedent in the public mind.", "Donate Now", "Jignesh is a writer and researcher at Alt News.
