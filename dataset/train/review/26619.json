["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 25, 2019", "A viral story shared on Facebook falsely claims President Donald Trump has fired a \u201cMuslim federal judge\u201d over \u201cSharia Law.\u201d The story was published two years ago by a website that calls its work satire, but it is being spread again by a Tumblr site.", "A headline shared more than 50,000 times on Facebook \u2014 from a Tumblr account whose URL is misleadingly made to look like a Fox News property \u2014 falsely tells users that President Donald Trump has removed a \u201cMuslim federal judge for trying to implement Sharia Law.\u201d", "The falsehood, now being spread by foxnw.tumblr.com, has circulated for two years, and was originally published in 2017 by the self-described satirical publication called America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. The Tumblr account links to a post on another website, which refers to a \u201c22nd Circuit Court of Appeals Justice\u201d named \u201cHansam al Alallawalahi-Smith.\u201d But neither the court nor the judge exist.", "We\u2019ve written about many hoaxes stemming from America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which employs a network of different websites and publishes content that can mislead social media users. While the websites include satirical labels \u2014 for those who click beyond the headline \u2014 other websites, as in this case, often republish the stories without any such disclaimers. We\u2019ve previously debunked similar\u00a0stories from America\u2019s Last Line of Defense that also claimed that Trump had fired made-up Muslim judges.", "What\u2019s more, while presidents nominate federal judges and the Senate confirms nominees, the power to remove a federal judge is held only by Congress. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution says federal judges \u201cshall hold their offices during good behaviour,\u201d which \u201chas been interpreted to mean that the only way federal judges can be removed from office is if the House of Representatives impeaches them, and the Senate convicts them, of \u2018treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,'\u201d as the National Constitution Center explains on its website.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
