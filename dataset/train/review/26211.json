["About this rating", "On 20 May 2017, a USPOLN.com item suggested that Sam Clovis (a former professor of economics, talk radio show host, and Tea Party activist who is now President Trump's purported pick for a U.S. Department of Agriculture appointment) said scientists are \"dumb\" and that dinosaurs are a hoax:", "The research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the \u201cchief scientist\u201d is supposed to be the leader \u201camong distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s pick, Sam Clovis, doesn\u2019t seem to have any of those credentials. He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter.", "When asked to comment on his credentials in a recent interview with KYXL Radio, Clovis, who is currently working as the senior White House advisor within the USDA, argued that he was \u201cproud\u201d he didn\u2019t have any scientific credentials or education, because \u201cscientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead individuals anyway ... When I get back home from work \u2013 believe me \u2013 I thank God every single day that he had the mercy not to make me a scientist as well ... That\u2019s why I\u2019m happy I\u2019m not one of them. At the end of the day, scientists are nothing more than a bunch of dumb, regular people with limited vision who think dinosaurs actually existed and the earth is somehow getting warmer. They don\u2019t even consider the fact that there\u2019s more to us, to our species than just the physical and the tangible. It\u2019s as funny as it is pitiful,\u201d he said. When asked why he continues to work as president Trump\u2019s pick for top scientist if that\u2019s how he feels about it, he replied, \u201cWell, just because you\u2019re a member of the Trump administration doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have to pay the bills. That used to work for members of the Obama administration, if I remember correctly. Not now,\u201d Clovis concluded.", "A source linked at the bottom of the page was Politicops, well known as a purveyor of hoaxes and embellishments based on current events using a model that mixes real stories with fiction.
