["About this rating", "In March 2015, the \"Rhodes Must Fall\" campaign began at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, when students began pushing for the campus to take down a statue of Cecil Rhodes.", "Rhodes (the former prime minister of Cape Colony) was a businessman and politician. He was also an ardent imperialist who was part of the effort to annex large parts of land in South Africa in the late 1800s, making enormous sums of money and eventually founding the De Beers diamond firm.", "Many universities in South Africa bear his name, and for years,\u00a0Rhodes has been lauded for his accomplishments. \u00a0However, he also passed laws which laid the groundwork for apartheid in the country, and is thus also regarded as a symbol of repression, colonization, and apartheid \u2014 which has no place,\u00a0activists say, on a university campus, especially in a region of the world that still struggles with the aftereffects of institutional racism.", "The \"Rhodes Must Fall\" campaign was successful at the University of South Africa; the school removed the statue in April 2015, a month after the protest there began. \u00a0Students and anti-colonialism activists then began\u00a0similar protests to remove statues at other universities, including Oxford, where\u00a0Rhodes (who was born in England) remains a large figure. Oxford University\u00a0still\u00a0offers\u00a0the elite Rhodes Scholarship, and a statue in his likeness presides over the university's Oriel College campus.", "In January 2016,\u00a0Oxford students voted to remove the statue. \u00a0Later that month, the university\u00a0opted\u00a0to keep the statue after receiving threats from alumni to withdraw millions in donations if it was removed.\u00a0\u00a0The college's decision\u00a0sparked more marches and ongoing\u00a0protests,\u00a0keeping the issue in the news.", "A letter about the\u00a0Cecil Rhodes statue at Oxford University began to be\u00a0widely circulated via social media and e-mail\u00a0after it was originally published on the web site\u00a0Breitbart\u00a0in December 2015. The\u00a0message (a missive that in part laments today's politically correct culture) is often preceded by the claim that it is an official letter from Oxford University's chancellor, Chris Patten.\u00a0The original posting on Breitbart\u00a0starts with a small disclaimer informing the reader that the following message is what Oxford should\u00a0have told its students, and not what the university\u00a0actually said:", "Instead of standing up to these hoity-toity grievance mongers \u2013 led by two black South African students on scholarships \u2013 \u00a0Oriel has caved.", "Here is the letter that Oriel College should have written to the campaigners from Rhodes Must Fall.", "The above-displayed message was eventually stripped from the letter and replaced with the claim that it was an official piece of correspondence from Patten to the student's of Oxford:", "My mouth is still hanging open after reading this\u2026.this is OUTStANDING!! About time the institutions and governments on this side of the pond get some backbone and use logic in lieu of feelings.", "Subject: Oxford Rebukes Idiot Activists", "Black activists at Oxford have been campaigning to have THE RHODES statue removed and below is the Chancellor Chris Patten\u2019s response...it\u2019s a beauty from start to finish.", "While Patten did argue against the removal of the Rhodes statue during an appearance on the\u00a0Today program on BBC Radio 4 in January 2016, his language was far tamer than the openly racist rhetoric employed in\u00a0Breitbart's\u00a0fictional letter:", "\u201cBut if people at a university are not prepared to demonstrate the sort of generosity of spirit which Nelson Mandela showed towards Rhodes and towards history, if they are not prepared to embrace all those values which are contained in the most important book for any undergraduate, Karl Popper\u2019s Open Society, if they are not prepared to embrace those issues then maybe they should think about being educated elsewhere. But I hope they will embrace those issues and engage in debate.\u201d", "Patten styled the objections to Rhodes as along the lines of the \u201csafe spaces\u201d policies adopted on many university campuses in Britain and the US, which critics have said are used to suppress debate on a range of issues.", "\u201cThat focus on Rhodes is unfortunate but it\u2019s an example of what\u2019s happening in American campuses and British campuses,\u201d Patten said. \u201cOne of the points of a university \u2013 which is not to tolerate intolerance, to engage in free inquiry and debate \u2013 is being denied. People have to face up to facts in history which they don\u2019t like and talk about them and debate them.\u201d", "He added: \u201cCan you imagine a university where there is no platform? I mean a bland diet of bran to feed people, it\u2019s an absolutely terrible idea. If you want universities like that you go to China where they are not allowed to talk about western values, which I regard as global values. No, it\u2019s not the way a university should operate.\u201d", "The protests, which have developed into an international movement, are real and ongoing.
