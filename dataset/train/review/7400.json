["By Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on December 3, 2020", "In what he billed as perhaps \u201cthe most important speech I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d President Donald Trump continued his attempt to deceive the American public into believing the election was \u201crigged.\u201d", "Trump has presented no evidence for such an explosive charge. Nor have his lawyers, who have admitted as much in some of their many dismissed lawsuits. Instead, the evidence shows Trump is inventing and pushing conspiracy theories and other false and misleading claims in an unrelenting attack on U.S. elections.", "We\u2019ve fact-checked his false claims about voter fraud for months, and even years, dating back to the 2016 campaign, long before he lost his reelection bid to President-elect Joe Biden. But on Dec. 2, 49 days before he is set to leave office, Trump once again repeated a slew of assertions in a nearly 46-minute video he posted to social media.", "The speech came one day after his own attorney general, William Barr, rebutted his claims, saying the Department of Justice and FBI \u201chave not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election.\u201d", "Here are 19 false or misleading claims the president made during the speech. It is by no means an exhaustive list.", "Not \u2018overwhelming\u2019 evidence:\u00a0The president boasted that his legal team has collected \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence of fraud. \u201cEveryone is saying, \u2018Wow, the evidence is overwhelming,\u2019 when they get to see it,\u201d he said. Judges, however, have found the evidence\u00a0less than overwhelming.", "For example, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann criticized the Trump campaign for failing to provide evidence to justify blocking Pennsylvania from certifying its election results.\u00a0In\u00a0dismissing the case,\u00a0Brann said: \u201cOne might expect that when seeking such a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption.\u201d Brann continued, \u201cInstead, this Court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence.\u201d", "The Trump campaign\u00a0appealed\u00a0Brann\u2019s decision\u00a0to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, but the three-judge panel unanimously\u00a0upheld\u00a0the lower court ruling. Judge Stephanos Bibas, a\u00a0Trump appointee, wrote: \u201cCharges of unfairness are serious.\u00a0But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.\u201d", "In Michigan, the Trump campaign\u00a0sued\u00a0to stop the counting of mail-in ballots in Wayne County, which includes Detroit, and block the certification of the county\u2019s election results. The lawsuit included an affidavit from a poll watcher who claimed she heard from another poll worker that other poll workers were told to change the dates on late ballots. The state judge who\u00a0ruled\u00a0against the campaign called the affidavit \u201cinadmissible hearsay within hearsay.\u201d", "There are \u2018safeguards\u2019: Trump wrongly claimed there were \u201cno safeguards\u201d used by states to check the identity of voters. \u201cWhile it has long been understood that the Democrat political machine engages in voter fraud from Detroit to Philadelphia, to Milwaukee, Atlanta, so many other places,\u201d Trump said, \u201cwhat changed this year was the Democrat Party\u2019s relentless push to print and mail out tens of millions of ballots sent to unknown recipients with virtually no safeguards of any kind.\u201d", "Only\u00a0nine states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sent mail-in ballots to all registered voters, and the states home to the cities mentioned by Trump \u2014 Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia \u2014 were not among them. As for\u00a0safeguards, most states use bar codes on mail-in ballots matched to a specific person in the voter files; ballot envelopes require personal information, such as date of birth or driver\u2019s license numbers; and signatures are required and matched against ones on file.", "Dominion Voting Systems: Trump again made the bogus claim that Dominion Voting Systems technology, certified by\u00a028 states, switched votes. \u201cIts name is Dominion, with the turn of a dial or the change of a chip, you could press a button for Trump and the vote goes to Biden,\u201d Trump said. Multiple experts, including Attorney General Barr, have debunked this conspiracy theory.", "Barr said the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department looked into such claims and \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen anything to substantiate that.\u201d A group of federal, state and local officials overseeing the nation\u2019s voting system also refuted such claims.", "Trump added that \u201cthe only secure system is paper,\u201d but 95% of ballots did have a paper record, said Christopher Krebs, the head of DHS\u2019 Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency whom Trump fired after the election. That\u2019s up from 82% of ballots in 2016 and \u201cone of the keys to success for a secure 2020 election,\u201d Krebs said.", "Vote counting:\u00a0In describing Dominion as a \u201cdisaster,\u201d Trump asked \u201cwhere are the votes counted?\u201d He answered his own question by\u00a0repeating\u00a0a fantastical false claim: \u201cWhich we think are counted in foreign countries, not in the United States.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t understand this claim,\u201d Krebs said, when asked about it in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that aired Nov. 29. \u201cAll votes in the United States of America are counted in the United States of America. Period.\u201d Dominion\u00a0said in a statement, \u201cVotes are not processed outside the United States. Votes are counted and reported by county and state election officials \u2014 not by Dominion, or any other election technology company.\u201d", "Human error in Michigan:\u00a0Trump inaccurately used a case of human error \u2014 by a Republican county clerk, no less \u2014 to falsely suggest widespread voter fraud. \u201cIn one Michigan County, as an example, that used Dominion systems, they found that nearly 6,000 votes had been wrongly switched from Trump to Biden, and this is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is what we caught. How many didn\u2019t we catch?\u201d", "The facts: A day after the election, Antrim County in Michigan\u00a0reported\u00a0that Biden was ahead of Trump by about 3,000 votes, with 98% of votes counted. Election officials, surprised that Biden could win a Republican-leaning county, found it was a case of\u00a0human error\u00a0and Trump was actually leading by about 2,500 votes.\u00a0The county clerk \u201caccidentally did not update the software used to collect voting machine data,\u201d the Michigan Department of State, which oversees the state\u2019s elections, said in a\u00a0statement.", "Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy,\u00a0a Republican, said the error in unofficial results would have been caught during the county canvass process when certifying votes. \u201cI must emphasize that the human error did not in any way, shape or form affect the official election results of Antrim County,\u201d\u00a0she said\u00a0at a state legislative hearing.", "Poll observers present: Trump has repeatedly, falsely claimed that votes were counted without Republican poll observers present. His own lawyer admitted in court that observers were there. \u201cIn Pennsylvania, large amounts of mail-in and absentee ballots were processed illegally. And in secret, in Philadelphia, in Allegheny counties, without our observers present,\u201d Trump claimed.", "Trump campaign lawyer Jerome Marcus\u00a0admitted under questioning by a Republican-appointed U.S. district judge that there were GOP observers present \u2014 saying there were \u201ca nonzero number of people in the room.\u201d", "Half of Detroit registered voters voted: Trump falsely claimed that in Detroit, \u201cthere were more votes than there were voters. Think of that. You had more votes than you had voters.\u201d Nearly 50% of the city\u2019s 504,714 registered voters cast a ballot, according to the city\u2019s unofficial election results.", "Trump appears to be talking about a minor issue with out-of-balance precincts. In Detroit, the number of ballots cast versus the number of voters checked into polling precincts differed by a mere 357, Mayor Mike Duggan said on Nov. 18. Such discrepancies, which aren\u2019t unique to this election, can occur through a scanner error or if a voter decides not to vote or spoils a ballot, meaning they ask to void the ballot and re-do their vote.", "Trump lost the state by more than 150,000 votes.", "\u2018Not credible\u2019 allegations:\u00a0Repeating unsupported allegations from a failed lawsuit, Trump said: \u201cOther witnesses in Detroit also saw our election officials counting batches of the same ballots many times, as well as illegally duplicating ballots.\u201d He also said election workers entered \u201cfake birth dates into the system, in order to illegally count\u201d ballots.", "Trump is referring to a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0brought by Republican poll challengers that alleged widespread fraud in the counting of ballots at the TCF Center in Detroit. The\u00a0suit\u00a0included seven affidavits that accused Detroit election workers of \u201ccounting the same ballot more than once,\u201d using \u201cfalse information to process ballots, such as using incorrect or false birthdays,\u201d and \u201cimproperly duplicating ballots,\u201d among other things.", "In\u00a0ruling against\u00a0the Republicans, who were seeking to stop certification of the election results in the county, Wayne County Circuit Judge Timothy Kenny said the allegations made in the affidavits were \u201cnot credible\u201d and represented a misunderstanding of the ballot tabulation process. Detroit election officials, he wrote, \u201coffered a more accurate and persuasive explanation of activity\u201d within the TCF Center.", "Georgia signature checks: Trump wrongly claimed Georgia didn\u2019t properly check signatures from mail-in ballots and misleadingly claimed the signature checks were left out of the recount. \u201cIn the recent recount in Georgia, which means nothing because they don\u2019t want to check signatures, and if you\u2019re not going to check signatures in Georgia, it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we have a secretary of state, and a governor who made it very difficult to check signatures.\u201d As\u00a0we have written, Georgia election officials check signatures twice: once when a voter requests a mail-in ballot, and then again when the ballot is returned.", "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican,\u00a0said\u00a0Georgia strengthened its signature match for this election, and trained election officials on Georgia Bureau of Investigation signature-matching techniques. Trump is correct that signature checks were not part of the hand recount. Once a signature is verified on the ballot\u2019s outer envelope, the ballot itself is\u00a0separated\u00a0for counting. This protects voter privacy.", "Rejected ballots in Georgia: Trump again falsely claimed that the percentage of ballots rejected in Georgia was suspiciously low. \u201cIn swing state after swing state, the number of ballots rejected has been dramatically lower than what would have been expected based on prior experience,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn Georgia, just 0.2%, that\u2019s substantially less than 1%, of mail-in ballots have been rejected. In other words, almost none have been rejected. They took everything. Nothing was rejected, practically, compared to 6.4% in 2016.\u201d As\u00a0he has in the past, Trump is conflating the ballots rejected just for signature issues in this election with ballots rejected in past elections for all reasons \u2014 usually for arriving too late. The percentage of mail-in ballots rejected in Georgia due to signature issues this year was about the same as in the 2016 and 2018 general elections.", "\u2018Cured\u2019 ballots: Trump wrongly claimed that in Pennsylvania, Democrats were allowed to cure their ballots \u2014 meaning voters were notified about an error in their mail-in ballot so they could fix it \u2014 but Republicans were not. \u201cTens of thousands of voters across Pennsylvania were treated differently based on whether they were Republicans, or Democrats,\u201d Trump said. \u201cVoters who submitted flawed ballots in some Democrat precincts were notified and asked to fix their ballots, while Republican precincts, and in particular Republican voters, were not so notified, which plainly violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d", "As\u00a0we have written, all counties got the same guidance the night before the election instructing them to notify political parties and update the ballot-tracking online system about ballot errors, thus allowing voters to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day. Some counties notified voters, and some didn\u2019t. But that inconsistency didn\u2019t fall strictly along partisan county lines.", "On Nov. 27, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit\u00a0rejected\u00a0a Trump campaign lawsuit on this issue. According to an opinion written by Judge Bibas, who, again, was\u00a0appointed by Trump, the campaign\u2019s \u201cclaims have no merit.\u201d The complaint, \u201cnever alleges that anyone treated the Trump campaign or Trump votes worse than it treated the Biden campaign or Biden votes.\u201d", "\u201cA violation of the Equal Protection Clause requires more than variation from county to county,\u201d Bibas wrote. \u201cIt requires unequal treatment of similarly situated parties. \u2026 To be sure, counties vary in implementing that guidance, but that is normal. Reasonable county-to-county variation is not discrimination.\u201d", "Vote \u2018dumps\u2019:\u00a0Trump\u00a0again\u00a0claimed that in Michigan, early in the\u00a0morning after Election Day, \u201ca vote dump of 149,772 votes came in unexpectedly. We were winning by a lot. That batch was received in horror.\u00a0Nobody knows anything about it.\u201d", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve written\u00a0before, what appeared to be an unusually large\u00a0uptick of about 140,000 votes for Biden was the result of a typo in unofficial results reported by Michigan\u2019s Shiawassee County. The mistake was quickly corrected, the county\u2019s elections clerk told us in a phone interview.", "Wisconsin results:\u00a0Trump\u00a0again\u00a0questioned how he lost Wisconsin even though he was ahead in the vote count on the night of the election.", "\u201cIn Wisconsin, as an example, where we were way up on election night, they ultimately had us miraculously losing by 20,000 votes,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re leading by a lot and then at 3:42 in the morning, there was this, it was a massive dump of votes, mostly Biden, almost all Biden. And to this day, everyone\u2019s trying to figure out, \u2018Where did it come from?\u2019\u201d", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve written\u00a0before, Trump was seemingly ahead in Wisconsin at the end of the day on Nov. 3, but that was before many of the mail-in ballots were counted. State law prevented election officials from counting absentee ballots before polls opened on Election Day.", "And no one is trying to determine where those absentee votes came from because the\u00a0Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u00a0has\u00a0already explained\u00a0what happened. \u201cBiden overtook Trump in the early morning hours when Milwaukee reported its roughly 170,000 absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic. Then early morning returns from Green Bay and Kenosha on Wednesday added to his slender lead. Trump had nurtured a lead of more than 100,000 votes before those returns came in,\u201d the newspaper reported.", "Missed votes in Georgia:\u00a0Trump falsely suggested that many votes from Trump supporters in Georgia remain uncounted. \u201cThousands of uncounted ballots were discovered in Floyd, Fayette, and Walton counties weeks after the election, and these ballots were mostly from Trump voters. They weren\u2019t counted. They were from Trump voters,\u201d he said.", "It\u2019s true that\u00a0almost 6,000\u00a0previously uncounted or unreported votes in those counties (and Douglas County) were discovered by officials during Georgia\u2019s hand recount of ballots after the election. But those votes for Trump\u00a0and\u00a0Biden have since been included in the overall tallies and didn\u2019t change the outcome.", "Gabriel Sterling, the voting systems implementation manager for the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office, said that after including those additional votes for both candidates, Biden\u2019s lead over Trump narrowed from 14,156 votes to 12,781 votes.", "Pennsylvania ballots: Trump suggested some issues with mail-in ballots \u2014 addressed by elections officials before Election Day \u2014 were evidence of fraud. They\u2019re not.", "\u201cMany voters all across Pennsylvania received two ballots in the mail,\u201d he said. In October, some voters in Allegheny and Fayette Counties received incorrectly printed ballots. In both cases, election officials issued corrected ballots and made clear: \u201cOnly one ballot will be counted for each voter,\u201d as the statement from Allegheny County said.", "The state also contacted in October about 4,300 voters who received two ballots, due to a printing error. Department of State spokesperson Ellen Lyon told reporters any duplicate ballots were \u201ccoded for the same voter, so if a voter tried to submit more than one, the system would literally prevent the second ballot from being counted.\u201d", "Trump further exaggerated: \u201cIn Fayette County, Pennsylvania, multiple voters received ballots that were already filled out.\u201d In late October, the county\u2019s district attorney\u2019s office announced it was investigating two ballots that voters received that were already filled out. The Trump campaign cited that incident in a Nov. 9 lawsuit, which was dismissed by a federal judge and upheld by the unanimous 3rd Circuit.", "Arizona: Trump repeated a claim from another dismissed lawsuit that wasn\u2019t about fraud. \u201cIn Arizona, in-person voters whose ballots produced error messages from tabulation machines were told to press a button that resulted in their votes not being counted,\u201d he said.", "As we\u2019ve written, Trump campaign lawyer Kory Langhofer stated in court that he was \u201cnot alleging fraud,\u201d but instead was raising concerns about a \u201climited number of cases\u201d involving \u201cgood faith errors.\u201d There were 191 presidential ballots with \u201covervotes\u201d \u2014 meaning more than one candidate for the same office was selected \u2014 in Maricopa County.", "No witnesses\u00a0for the Trump campaign could confirm that their votes had not been recorded, and the judge\u00a0dismissed\u00a0the campaign\u2019s claims as moot and with prejudice,\u00a0meaning the decision cannot be retried.", "Trump lost Arizona by more than 10,000 votes.", "The president added that Arizona\u2019s \u201cattorney general announced that mail-in ballots had been stolen from mailboxes and hidden under a rock.\u201d The AG did announce that 18 ballots, which weren\u2019t opened or filled out, had been found in a field on Oct. 30. Police hand-delivered them to the voters.", "Voter rolls: As he has\u00a0for years, Trump falsely equated errors on voter rolls with evidence of voter fraud. \u201cThis colossal expansion of mail-in voting opened the flood gates to massive fraud,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a widely known fact that the voting rolls are packed with people who are not lawfully eligible to vote, including those who are deceased, have moved out of their state, and even our non-citizens of our country.\u201d It is true that voter rolls contain errors, such as people moving to another state but not being removed from the old state\u2019s voter rolls, or people dying but their names not being removed in a timely fashion. But that\u2019s not fraud, unless or until someone tries to illegally vote in the wrong state, or for a deceased person.", "As\u00a0we have written, voting experts say that while the instances of voter fraud via mail-in ballot are more common than in-person voting fraud, the number of known cases is relatively small.", "Wisconsin rolls: Trump claimed \u2014 with no evidence \u2014 that he \u201cknew\u201d a legal dispute over whether to remove more than 100,000 voters from Wisconsin voter rolls involved \u201cillegal voters.\u201d All those voters did was fail to respond within 30 days to a mailing saying it appeared they had moved\u00a0and giving them the opportunity to continue their registration if they had not. There\u2019s no evidence they voted illegally. The case dates back to 2019 and concerns whether the state elections commission, which found errors in such residency-change lists before, had the authority to deactivate those voters. The state Supreme Court heard arguments in late September and has yet to rule on the case.", "Not \u2018statistically impossible\u2019: Trump wrongly claimed that it was \u201cstatistically impossible\u201d that he lost the presidential race even as Republicans had success in congressional races. \u201cThe tremendous success we had in the House of Representatives, and the tremendous success we\u2019ve had so far in the Senate, unexpected success all over the country, and right here in Washington, it is statistically impossible that the person, me, that led the charge lost,\u201d Trump said. It is statistically possible.", "As John McCormack wrote in\u00a0National Review,\u00a0\u201cthe notion that down-ballot Republicans greatly outperformed President Trump is inaccurate.\u201d As he noted, only one Republican won a Senate race in a state lost by Trump, Susan Collins in Maine. Republicans picked up seats \u2014 but not the majority \u2014 in the House. But while Republicans\u00a0fared better\u00a0than polls suggested they would, it is not unusual in recent elections for\u00a0House GOP candidates to fare better against their Democratic opponents \u201cthan the Republican presidential candidate performed against his Democratic opponent,\u201d McCormack wrote.", "Election experts\u00a0also attribute some of the disparity to \u201cballot roll-off,\u201d which is when voters skip certain races.\u00a0Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,\u00a0told us\u00a0it\u2019s not unusual for voters to \u201cchoose a candidate at the top of the ballot and then \u2018roll off\u2019 as they move down the ballot.
