["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on February 24, 2017", "Stephen Miller, a senior White House policy adviser, claimed that 72 people from the seven countries covered by President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day travel ban \u201chave been implicated in terroristic activity in the United States\u201d since the 9/11 attacks. That\u2019s a gross exaggeration.", "Miller cited an\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the Center for Immigration Studies that covered alleged terror cases from Sept. 12, 2001, through Dec. 31, 2014. We reviewed the convictions of all 72 people included on the list, and here is what we found:", "None of the 72 people was responsible for any terrorist-related deaths in the U.S. \u2014 even though roughly 1 million citizens of the seven countries came to the U.S. during this time as refugees, immigrants or on nonimmigrant visas, according to our review of State Department data.", "Miller appeared on several Sunday talk\u00a0shows on Feb. 12 and discussed, among other things, the president\u2019s executive order\u00a0\u2014 Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0United States. The order imposes a 90-day travel ban on the citizens of seven predominately Muslim countries (Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen). It also indefinitely prohibits Syrian refugees from entering the U.S., and\u00a0suspends the refugee program for citizens of all other countries for 120 days.", "U.S. District Judge James L. Robart\u00a0on Feb. 3 issued a temporary restraining order\u00a0that blocked portions of Trump\u2019s order from taking effect, pending his full consideration of a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota seeking to permanently block Trump\u2019s order. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Feb. 9 unanimously denied the Trump administration\u2019s emergency motion to lift Robart\u2019s temporary order.", "\u201cThe Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,\u201d the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said.", "As a result of the court decisions, refugees approved for resettlement in the U.S. and visa holders of the seven countries can travel to the U.S., pending further action by the administration or the courts.", "In defense of the temporary travel ban, top White House officials have cited terrorism attacks that never happened. Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, spoke of the \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d and White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeatedly listed \u201cAtlanta\u201d among the sites of U.S. terror attacks. (We did not write about those incidents, because both acknowledged their mistakes. We try not to play gotcha here at FactCheck.org.)", "On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Miller also defended the president\u2019s travel ban, and\u00a0criticized the court decisions. Host Chuck Todd asked Miller why the administration\u2019s travel ban does not include citizens from countries that have a history of committing terrorism in the U.S., such as Saudi Arabia.", "Miller, Feb. 12: First of all, 72 individuals according to the Center for Immigration Studies have been implicated in terroristic activity in the United States who hail from those seven nations.", "Miller made a similar statement on\u00a0ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that same day.", "Miller, Feb. 12: We know there\u2019s at least several dozen, perhaps many more than that, cases of terrorism from these countries that have happened in the United States in terms of terroristic plots, terroristic activity, material support for terrorism, supporting terrorism overseas \u2014 all different kinds of terroristic activity that\u2019s been interdicted in the United States tracing back to these seven countries.", "The Center for Immigration Studies, an advocacy group for low immigration, posted a blog item on Feb. 11 that said \u201c72 individuals from the seven countries covered in President Trump\u2019s vetting executive order have been convicted in terror cases since the 9/11 attacks.\u201d\u00a0CIS extracted the 72 names from a larger list of foreign-born suspected terrorists\u00a0compiled by the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s subcommittee on immigration.", "We reviewed the CIS list and found that not all 72 individuals from the seven countries covered by Trump\u2019s travel ban were convicted of terrorism charges.", "Most of the 72 individuals referenced by Miller were not convicted on terrorism charges. Many of them were caught up in terrorism investigations in the days following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but were either never charged or not convicted of terrorism.", "For example, CIS listed 19 Iraqis convicted in terror cases. But we found that only three Iraqis were convicted on terrorism charges. Most \u2014 11 of the 19 \u2014 were part of a terrorism investigation in Pittsburgh that ended up as a simple fraud case that had nothing to do with terrorism.", "In the Pittsburgh case,\u00a0Kamel Albred, Haider Alshomary, Haider Al-Tamimi, Ali Alubeidy, Alawi Al-Baraa, Mustafa Al-Aboody, Mohammed Alibrahimi (a cousin of Ali Alubeidy), Fadhil Al-Khaledy, Hatef Al-Atabi, Wathek Al-Atabi and Elmeliani Benmoumen were among 20 people arrested in the days following the 9/11 attacks on charges they illegally obtained commercial driver\u2019s licenses and hazmat transportation permits, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Federal prosecutors feared that the men obtained the licenses in order to transport hazardous materials across the country to carry out terrorist attacks, the Post-Gazette\u00a0wrote.", "But the terrorism investigation fizzled.", "When one of the defendants, Alawi Al-Baraa,\u00a0pleaded guilty to illegally obtaining a hazmat license by bribing a state official, the Post-Gazette wrote, U.S. District Judge Robert Cindrich \u201ctook the unusual step\u201d at the hearing of asking the federal prosecutor to make clear that Al-Baraa\u2019s case had nothing to do with terrorism.", "Post-Gazette, Dec. 14, 2001: \u201cWe have attempted through the FBI\u2019s efforts to establish any possible connections between Mr. Al-Baraa\u2019s activities and the events of Sept. 11,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Teitelbaum. \u201cWe have been unable to establish any link.\u201d", "Teitelbaum said there is no reason to believe Al-Baraa is anything but a truck driver who paid bribe money to get a new hazmat certification without taking the required test.", "Nearly four years later, the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0wrote a story about the Pittsburgh case \u2014 \u201cThe Terrorism Case That Wasn\u2019t \u2014 and Still Is\u201d \u2014 that quoted Cindrich as saying that he would \u201cnot continue to characterize this as a successful prosecution of a terrorism case, because it was not.\u201d", "Similarly, CIS identified 19 Yemeni citizens on its list of 72 individuals \u201cconvicted in terror cases,\u201d but we found only four who were convicted on terrorism charges. Most of them \u2014 10 \u2014 were initially suspected of funneling money to terrorists through illegal\u00a0money transfers, but the investigations failed to support terrorism charges.", "For example,\u00a0federal authorities grew suspicious of a check-cashing business in California and set up a sting operation that resulted in the March 2007 arrests of three Yemen-born men,\u00a0Yehia Ali Ahmed Alomari, Mohamed Al Huraibi and Saleh Mohamed Taher Saeed. The men agreed to arrange illegal overseas transfers of more than $100,000 for an undercover agent who allegedly \u201ctold the men that some of the money would go to Hezbollah, an organization linked to terrorism,\u201d according to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.", "However, the paper wrote, \u201cU.S. District Judge Charles Siragusa did not allow mention of Hezbollah during the trial because the criminal charges the men faced had no connection to terrorism.\u201d Ultimately, the three each pleaded guilty to operating an illegal money-transmitting business \u2014 an outcome \u201cauthorities contended\u201d was \u201cfair, given the government\u2019s evidence,\u201d the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle wrote.\u00a0The paper said that one of the jurors told the men, \u201cI hope you go and have a good life.\u201d", "Like the Pittsburgh case we mentioned earlier, several of the terrorist investigations were launched in the days following the 9/11 attacks but terrorism charges failed to materialize:", "Other examples of terror investigations that did not result in terrorism convictions, but were among the 72 cited by Miller:", "Of course, some citizens of the seven countries covered by Trump\u2019s ban were convicted on terrorism charges. In all, there were 28 individuals who were either convicted on terrorism charges (25) or admitted to terrorism activity (three) in pleading guilty to lesser charges.", "Of those 28, however, three arrests occurred abroad, and the suspects were extradited to the United States. None of them were trying to enter the U.S., so they would not have been blocked by Trump\u2019s travel ban. Like Osama bin Laden, they were plotting attacks from other countries.", "For example, Syrian arms dealer Monzer Al Kassar\u00a0was extradited from Spain and later convicted on charges of conspiring to sell millions of dollars worth of high-powered weapons to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, to be used to kill Americans in Colombia, according to the New York Times.", "Al Kassar was convicted of, among other things, providing material support to terrorists. That was true for most of the terrorism convictions, and many of them were Somalian citizens living in the U.S. In all, there were 14 Somalians convicted of helping to finance terrorism abroad, typically for\u00a0al-Shabaab \u2014 a terrorist group operating in East Africa whose leaders are affiliated with al Qaeda, according to the National Counterterrorism Center.", "There were only three cases during this time in which foreign-born residents of the seven countries on Trump\u2019s temporary travel ban attempted to carry out a terrorist attack in the U.S. \u2014 two of which were not real attacks, but rather government sting operations:", "To sum up, we found 28, or more than a third, of the 72 people cited by Miller were convicted on terrorism charges. We found that 25 of the 28 people were in the U.S., when they were arrested. Only three of 25 were implicated in plotting a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, and only one of those was aimed at U.S. citizens on U.S. soil \u2014 a government sting operation, not an actual attack.", "None of the U.S. residents from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen were responsible for any attacks on U.S. soil that resulted in a loss of life. At the same time,\u00a0roughly 956,000 citizens of those countries entered the U.S. as refugees and visa holders, according to State Department data.", "A total of 258,508 refugees from the seven countries resettled in the U.S. from Sept. 12, 2001, to Dec. 31, 2014. Another 697,113 others obtained immigration and nonimmigration visas in fiscal years 2002 through 2014, which covers Oct. 1, 2001, to Sept. 30, 2014.", "Here is the breakdown, by country:", "Editor\u2019s Note: We obtained refugee data from the State Department\u2019s Refugee Processing Center,\u00a0and the visa holder data from the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs. Our analysis of the Center for Immigration Studies list of 72 \u201cterror cases\u201d can be found in a spreadsheet that you can download here.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
