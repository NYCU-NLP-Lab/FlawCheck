The group has not actually made a donation though.", "Uniting Missouri, a political action committee in support of Gov. Mike Parson\u2019s bid for reelection, has been running several attack ads against Nicole Galloway, who is looking to unseat him in the Nov. 3 election.", "The purpose of these ads is to connect Galloway to groups that want to defund the police and reinvest some funding into social services, an idea that has gained traction over the past few months in response to the police killings of several Black Americans during altercations.", "A Sept. 2 ad said: \"Galloway's campaign is being bankrolled by the same extremists who want to defund our police.\"", "Another ad released that same day featured a woman named Le\u2019Jon who talks about how crime has affected her family.

According to the group\u2019s website, the group works to \"resist the GOP\u2019s agenda, elect local champions, and fight for progressive policies.\"", "The national website also urges their supporters to \"call on your own local and state officials and tell them to defund your local police department and invest those funds in resources people need in Black communities, Indigenous communities, and communities of color.\"", "The Missouri chapter of Indivisible\u2019s website urges voters to volunteer and donate to a number of Democratic candidates including Galloway. The St. Louis chapter has also posted links on Facebook to donate to Galloway\u2019s campaign.", "Nowhere in Galloway\u2019s campaign finance reports are any contributions made in Indivisible\u2019s name.", "The Missouri GOP also released a statement Tuesday that said \"her campaign is taking money from groups like Planned Parenthood, NARAL, Indivisible and the Sunrise Movement that are pushing defund the police policies.\"", "Although it is none of their primary missions, these groups have all shown support for efforts to defund the police. Planned Parenthood, NARAL and Indivisible have all publicly voiced support for Galloway, but we found no donations made in any of these groups\u2019 names.", "Kevin Donohoe, a spokesperson for Galloway\u2019s campaign, said he was unaware of any evidence supporting the ad\u2019s claim.
