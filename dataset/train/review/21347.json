But it\u2019s bunk: There is no record of Biden ever tweeting the message in question.", "The purported tweet, dated Feb. 21, reads: \u201cI\u2019m proud to see Coca-Cola educate their staff in cultural reappropriation. The disconnect is because the way white people talk leaving minorities confused. Black people communicate a certain way and me and my staff know how those kinds of people talk and it\u2019s time white people learn to do the same #justforthetasteofit #dietcoke.\u201d", "But as we said, there is nothing to suggest Biden posted that tweet.", "On Feb. 21, we found, his verified @JoeBiden Twitter account \u2014 the one used in the bogus screenshot \u2014 didn\u2019t post any direct tweets that day. Instead, it only retweeted two posts from the official presidential account, @POTUS, about the late Rep. John Lewis and COVID-19. We also checked a log of deleted tweets from Biden maintained by ProPublica and didn\u2019t find the supposed Coca-Cola tweet there, either.", "The bogus screenshot was spread amid allegations that Coca-Cola\u2019s diversity training included a class that contained a suggestion to \u201ctry to be less white\u201d \u2014 a claim that our fact-checking colleagues at Snopes explored further. The company has issued a statement saying the course in question was not part of its diversity and equity curriculum.", "\u201cThe training includes access to the LinkedIn Learning platform on a variety of topics, including on diversity, equity and inclusion,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe video in question was accessible on the LinkedIn Learning platform but was not part of the company\u2019s curriculum.\u201d", "Users spreading the phony Biden tweet referring to that issue paired it with captions suggesting the tweet was authentic.", "One Facebook post was captioned, \u201cSo when white people talk blacks can\u2019t comprehend? Interesting\u2026\u201d Text with another post reads, \u201cHe sounds like he\u2019s racist.\u201d", "Images of made-up tweets are a common form of misinformation.
