(AP/Ake)", "A commission reporting to Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C., recommended that Bowser lobby the federal government to \u201cremove, relocate or contextualize'' eight federal statues and memorials, including the Washington Monument.", "To avoid confusion over whether the group was proposing the tear-down of landmarks such as the Washington Monument, Bowser had the section on federal statues and memorials deleted from the report, and her office clarified that it wasn\u2019t calling for removal. The Lincoln Memorial was never mentioned in the report.", "The recommendations in the report came from the commission, not Bowser.", "President Donald Trump attacked Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, wrongly accusing her during a campaign rally of recommending that the city get rid of two storied landmarks.", "\"We have a mayor in D.C. who formed a commission with recommendations,\" Trump said Oct. 24 in Circleville, Ohio. \"Her recommendation is: Take down the Washington Monument, close up the Lincoln Monument.

In a 24-page report published in September, the commission laid out whether certain city-owned facilities should be \"removed, renamed or contextualized.\"", "The group looked primarily at whether the namesakes had \"key disqualifying histories,\" such as participation in slavery, systemic racism or the mistreatment of minority groups. It suggested that the city rename 21 of its public schools; nine of its residential buildings and campuses; 12 of its parks, fields and playgrounds; and seven of its government buildings.", "Relevant to Trump\u2019s claim, the commission also recommended that Bowser use her position on the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission to lobby the federal government to \"remove, relocate or contextualize\" eight federal properties.", "The report did not specify what it was recommending for each of the properties listed, which included iconic landmarks such as the Jefferson Memorial and Washington Monument, both named for former presidents who enslaved people.", "But the rollout of the report was met with criticism from the White House and the president\u2019s allies, some of whom misrepresented the report\u2019s intentions as calling\u00a0for the removal of the Washington Monument, according to the Washington Post.", "To address the confusion, Bowser had\u00a0the report shortened by a page, removing the page related to federal properties.
