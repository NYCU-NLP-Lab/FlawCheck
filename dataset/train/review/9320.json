["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "On CNN, a panel of commentators discussed some of the health-policy issues surrounding Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s revelation the night before that his newborn had to have surgery for a rare heart defect.", "In a video clip that went viral, Kimmel devoted the monologue of his ABC late-night show to telling the story of the birth of his son, Billy. Shortly after he was born, doctors discovered a serious congenital heart defect known as tetralogy of Fallot. The doctors were able to operate on Billy, and their efforts appear to be successful, though additional surgeries may eventually be needed.", "In addition to drawing widespread popular interest in his son\u2019s story, Kimmel touched on the current debate over whether or how to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. In the monologue, he urged lawmakers not to return Americans to the days before the law, when a pre-existing condition -- like his son\u2019s -- could prevent you from securing health insurance.", "\"If your baby is going to die and it doesn\u2019t have to, it shouldn\u2019t matter how much money you make,\" Kimmel said. \"I think that\u2019s something that whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?\"", "Kimmel\u2019s monologue inspired a discussion of health care policy on a CNN segment moderated by anchor Kate Bolduan the following day.", "At one point, CNN commentator Margaret Hoover noted that, for all the concern about Kimmel\u2019s situation, poor families would be less likely than a celebrity to have access to a world-class surgical team.", "Referring to the Kimmel\u00a0surgery, she said, \"Medicaid has stopped providing this kind of service. Our health care system is broken, and the poorest of us cannot afford it.\"", "We wondered whether she was correct, so we started contacting experts. Before we could finish our research, Hoover emailed us to say that she had misspoken.", "\"The point I had intended to make was that poorer families, especially those who have received health coverage under the ACA, have largely received it through Medicaid expansion, which increasingly isn't accepted at hospitals,\" she said in an email.", "\"Sadly, in an emotional segment, I misspoke,\" Hoover told us. Hoover said she realized she had said something wrong when she began seeing criticism in her Twitter mentions.", "Hoover tweeted a correction shortly after our email exchange:", "\"Correction to misspeaking w/ @KateBolduan: I accidentally said Medicaid has stopped providing \u2018that kind of service.\u2019 \u2026 Point I intended to make was that hospitals increasingly don\u2019t accept Medicaid. \u2026 Which means poor families have a harder time getting Kimmel\u2019s level of care already.\"", "For the record, the experts we contacted agreed that Medicaid has not done anything to cut off its beneficiaries from complex pediatric surgeries like the one Kimmel\u2019s son underwent.", "Hoover\u2019s initial remark on CNN was \"totally incorrect,\" said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. In fact, she said, \"Medicaid is the major source of health insurance coverage for children\u2019s hospitals and the specialized services they offer.\"", "MaryBeth Musumeci, associate director of the Kaiser Family Foundation, added that Medicaid covers a broad range of services for children under its Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment benefit, called EPSDT.", "Any state that accepts Medicaid funding must offer EPSDT to children from birth through age 21, she said. As a practical matter, this means that Medicaid must cover necessary services for children\u2019s physical or mental health, even if that service is not covered by Medicaid\u00a0for adults in that state, she said.", "At PolitiFact, our policy is to correct a speaker\u2019s original misstatement while noting subsequent corrections by the speaker.", "Hoover, for her part, did have a point when she mentioned the relative lack of access for Medicaid beneficiaries.", "A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that while 85 percent of physicians accepted new patients with private insurance, only 69 percent accepted new patients with Medicaid. Hoover pointed to this column, by Scott W. Atlas, a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, to support her point.", "\"People on Medicaid have more challenges accessing specialists than the privately insured, and the more high-tech and innovative, the more challenging that may be,\" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush.", "Our ruling", "Hoover said that, regarding the surgery that saved Kimmel\u2019s son, \"Medicaid has stopped providing this kind of service.\"", "That\u2019s wrong -- Medicaid does cover this kind of service, and indeed, the federal-state program is a key source of reimbursement for children\u2019s hospitals. Hoover quickly acknowledged that she was wrong and tweeted a correction. We rate Hoover\u2019s original claim False.", "Margaret Hoover, remarks in a discussion on CNN, May 2, 2017", "Margaret Hoover, tweets, May 2, 2017", "Jimmy Kimmel, full monologue on YouTube, May 1, 2017", "Washington Post, \"A tearful Jimmy Kimmel said his newborn had a congenital heart defect.
