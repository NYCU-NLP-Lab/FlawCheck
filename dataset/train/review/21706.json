["By Lori Robertson, Robert Farley, Vanessa Schipani and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on August 31, 2017", "In a speech on changing the tax code, President Donald Trump offered some political spin on the facts.", "Trump made his remarks on Aug. 30 in Springfield, Missouri, calling on Congress to \u201csupport pro-American tax reform.\u201d", "Trump exaggerated the amount of money U.S. companies likely have in offshore accounts, nearly doubling a\u00a0figure\u00a0the White House includes in a fact sheet, released the same day as the president\u2019s remarks.", "Trump: Because of our high tax rate and horrible, outdated, bureaucratic rules, large companies that do business overseas will often park their profits offshore to avoid paying a high United States tax if the money is brought back home. So they leave the money over there. The amount of money we\u2019re talking about is anywhere from $3 trillion to $5 trillion. Can you believe that?", "U.S. companies with\u00a0business overseas do keep some profits\u00a0in offshore accounts, where it isn\u2019t subject to U.S. corporate taxes until it is repatriated to this country. The profits are declared indefinitely, or permanently, reinvested, which means the companies say they will reinvest the money abroad.", "If a U.S. company does bring the money back to the United States, it would be \u201csubject to the U.S. tax rate of 35 percent minus a tax credit equal to whatever taxes the company paid to foreign governments,\u201d the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy explains in a March report on this issue.", "The White House cites figures from that report in its Aug. 30 fact sheet on Trump\u2019s tax remarks.", "White House fact sheet, Aug. 30: Fortune 500 corporations are holding more than $2.6 trillion in profits offshore to avoid $767 billion in Federal taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.", "If the White House is citing a figure of $2.6 trillion for profits kept overseas, where does\u00a0Trump get the $5 trillion figure? We asked the White House, but we haven\u2019t received a response.", "We also asked ITEP, a nonprofit that\u00a0partners with the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice, about\u00a0the $5 trillion figure, which Trump has used before. ITEP Senior Fellow Matthew Gardner\u00a0told us in an email: \u201cI have never seen an estimate as high as $3 trillion, and the $5 trillion number seems impossibly high.\u201d", "ITEP\u2019s estimate is for Fortune 500 companies, but the independent research firm Audit Analytics\u00a0has a database for all companies that file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u00a0Don Whalen, the firm\u2019s director of research,\u00a0told us that as of today, there were $2.8 trillion in corporate profits indefinitely reinvested.", "Trump\u2019s campaign cited a $2.1 trillion estimate from 2015 in the footnotes for Trump\u2019s economic speech in Detroit in August\u00a02016. In that speech, Trump said: \u201cWe are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas.\u201d And his campaign tax plan used a figure of $2.5 trillion.", "But he has established a pattern of bumping that up to $5 trillion. He told the Economic Club of New York in September 2016: \u201cSome people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it\u2019s $5 trillion.\u201d And he used the figure in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in late July.", "Trump went on to say in his Aug. 30 remarks: \u201cBy making it less punitive for companies to bring back this money, and by making the process far less bureaucratic and difficult, we can return trillions and trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.\u201d", "It\u2019s worth noting that the U.S. has tried to spur repatriation of these earnings before. In 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act created a one-year reduction\u00a0that made the tax rate on repatriated profits 5.25 percent for companies that paid a 35 percent corporate rate, explains a 2011 Congressional Research Service report. About one-third of offshore earnings were brought back to the U.S., CRS said, but studies on the impact generally found that \u201cthe repatriations did not increase domestic investment or employment. They further conclude that much of the repatriations were returned to shareholders through stock repurchases.\u201d", "The president didn\u2019t reveal details on what his tax holiday for offshore profits would be. His campaign tax plan, however, proposed a repatriation tax of 10 percent.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Though he gets the numbers right, Trump engaged in some misleading spin when he compared economic growth under his administration with the previous administration.", "Trump, Aug. 30:\u00a0And today, a very appropriate day that this should happen, we just announced that we hit 3 percent in GDP. Just came out. And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit 3 percent. So we\u2019re really on our way.", "It\u2019s true that\u00a0the real GDP growth rate was 3 percent for the second quarter of this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. But Trump doesn\u2019t make it clear that he is talking about one quarter, and then he compounds the distortion by comparing one quarter growth to annual growth under the Obama administration.", "In fact, the real GDP growth rate\u00a0exceeded 3 percent in eight quarters during the Obama administration, with a high of 5.2 percent in the third quarter of 2014,\u00a0according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.", "Trump is correct that the annual real GDP growth rate never exceeded 3 percent under Obama. The highest it reached was 2.9 percent in 2015, according to the BEA. It remains to be seen if the nation\u2019s economy will top 2.9 percent annual growth under Trump.\u00a0Real GDP increased just 1.2 percent in the first quarter of this year.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Trump claimed \u201cwhen it comes to the business tax, we [the U.S.] are dead last.\u201d And, he said, the U.S. rate is \u201c60 percent higher\u201d than \u201cour economic competitors.\u201d The U.S.\u00a0does\u00a0have the highest statutory corporate tax rate among developed countries. But the U.S. isn\u2019t highest when tax credits are factored in, for example.", "There are many ways to measure and compare corporate tax burdens, and Trump chose those that paint the U.S. in the worst possible light relative to other countries.", "Trump: Today, we are still taxing our businesses at 35 percent, and it\u2019s way more than that. And think of it, in some cases way above 40 percent when you include state and local taxes in various states. The United States is now behind France, behind Germany, behind Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and many other nations. \u2026", "So when it comes to the business tax, we are dead last. Can you believe this? So this cannot be allowed to continue any longer. America must lead the way, not follow from behind. We have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors, to one that is more than 60 percent higher. We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries.", "It\u2019s not strictly true that the U.S. has a higher statutory corporate tax rate than every other country in the world. That dubious distinction goes to Comoros, a tiny\u00a0archipelago off Africa\u2019s east coast that has a statutory rate of 50 percent, and the United Arab Emirates, which selectively levies at a rate of 55 percent,\u00a0Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, told us.", "The federal statutory corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 35 percent, as Trump said, and that figure jumps to about 39 percent when state taxes are added in. That\u00a0is\u00a0highest among the 35 advanced economies tracked by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development. The next highest is France at 34.4 percent.", "But that\u2019s just one way to measure corporate tax burdens. In 2014, a\u00a0Congressional Research Service report\u00a0found that the average effective corporate tax rate in 2008 was 27.1 percent, which tracks pretty closely to the GDP weighted average among other OECD countries, 27.7 percent.", "\u201cAlthough the U.S. statutory tax rate is higher, the average effective rate is about the same, and the marginal rate on new investment is only slightly higher,\u201d the CRS report states. \u201cThe statutory rate differential is relevant for international profit shifting; effective rates are more relevant for firms\u2019 investment levels.\u201d", "Pomerleau, of the Tax Foundation, warned however that effective tax rate calculations that simply divide taxes paid by corporate profits skew results for the U.S. That\u2019s because the U.S. has a smaller corporate sector than many other developed nations. And that\u2019s because the U.S. has a larger proportion of pass-through businesses, such as S corporations and partnerships that are taxed at an individual rather than corporate rate.\u00a0The marginal individual rate ranges from 10 percent to 39.6 percent.", "A\u00a0Congressional Budget Office\u00a0report in March presented three measures of corporate tax. The first, the \u201ctop statutory corporate tax rate,\u201d lists the U.S. highest among G20 nations at 39.1 percent. The second is the \u201caverage corporate tax rate,\u201d a measure \u201cof the total amount of corporate taxes that a company pays as a share of its income.\u201d By that measure, the U.S. rate of 29 percent ranks third among G20 countries, behind Argentina at 37.3 percent and Indonesia at 36.4 percent. Finally, the CBO calculated the \u201ceffective marginal corporate tax rate,\u201d defined as \u201ca measure of a corporation\u2019s tax burden on returns from a marginal investment.\u201d By that measure, CBO found, the U.S. rate of 18.6 percent was fourth among G20 countries, lower than Argentina (22.6), Japan (21.7) and the United Kingdom\u00a0(18.7).", "A 2016 Government Accountability Office report found that from 2006 to 2012 \u201cat least two-thirds of all active corporations had no federal income tax liability.\u201d The GAO said: \u201cAmong large corporations (generally those with at least $10 million in assets) less than half\u201442.3 percent\u2014paid no federal income tax in 2012. Of those large corporations whose financial statements reported a profit, 19.5 percent paid no federal income tax that year.\u201d", "As for Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cwe have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors, to one that is more than 60 percent higher,\u201d that\u2019s accurate when comparing the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to the average statutory tax rate among the 35 countries tracked by the OECD. But according to a\u00a0Congressional Research Service\u00a0analysis of rates in 2010, when weighted to reflect the relative size of the countries\u2019 economies, the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and the OECD average is just 32 percent.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Trump discussed the complexity of the U.S. tax code that frustrates today\u2019s taxpayers.", "Trump:\u00a0In 1935, the basic 1040 form that most people file had two simple pages of instruction. Today, that basic form has 100 pages of instructions, and it\u2019s pretty complex stuff.\u00a0The tax code is so complicated that more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes.", "Trump\u2019s statement on professional tax help\u00a0is misleading.", "Fifty-four percent of taxpayers \u2014 not all Americans \u2014 paid\u00a0someone else to do their taxes for tax year 2014,\u00a0according to the Taxpayer Advocate Service, which serves as an advocate for taxpayers\u00a0at the IRS. And another 40 percent of taxpayers used tax software.", "That would, of course, include some Americans who choose to use online software for ease and convenience, not necessarily because they think their taxes are too complicated. Some tax filers\u00a0can use software for free, if they meet income and other requirements set by several\u00a0companies.", "Of the 147.4 million individual returns filed in 2013, 16 percent were through\u00a01040EZ,\u00a0according to IRS data, which is one page.", "He was right when he said that the 1040 instruction form in 1935 was\u00a0only two pages. Today, the\u00a01040 instruction booklet\u00a0is 106 pages, although not all of them are instructions. There are dozens of pages of tables and other illustrations. His larger point, however, that filing taxes is much more complicated today is correct.", "But Trump ignored one key difference between then and now: Only about 5 percent of Americans paid the federal income tax in the 1930s. It wasn\u2019t until President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the\u00a0Revenue Act of 1942 that the federal income tax became a tax on the masses,\u00a0according to the IRS.", "IRS, Taxes in U.S. History:\u00a0In 1939 only about five percent of American workers paid income tax. The United States\u2019 entrance into World War II changed that figure. The demands of war production put almost every American back to work, but the expense of the war still exceeded tax-generated revenue. President Roosevelt\u2019s proposed Revenue Act of 1942 introduced the broadest and most\u00a0progressive tax\u00a0in American history, the Victory Tax.", "\u201cBy war\u2019s end in 1945, about 90 percent of American workers submitted income tax forms, and 60 percent paid taxes on their income,\u201d the IRS says.", "In 1935, the\u00a0top marginal tax rate\u00a0was 63 percent; today it is\u00a039.6 percent.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
