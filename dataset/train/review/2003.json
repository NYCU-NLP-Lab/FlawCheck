(AP/Kaster)", "President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign repeatedly challenged Joe Biden to release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, including when it put out Trump\u2019s own list in early September.", "Biden said releasing such a list would distort the Senate\u2019s role in the nomination process and subject his potential nominees to outside influence and attacks.", "As Republicans look to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death, President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has elevated its calls for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to release a list of candidates he would consider for the bench.", "Trump and his campaign have challenged Biden to match the list of 20 potential nominees Trump rolled out Sept. 9, which included several federal appeals court judges and Republican senators such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.", "Biden has dismissed those requests. Speaking in Philadelphia two days after Ginsburg\u2019s death, the former vice president rejected the call again, while urging the Republican-led Senate to let the winner of the presidential election pick Ginsburg\u2019s replacement.", "In doing so, Biden wrongly claimed the Trump campaign asked for his list only after Ginsburg died. (He also claimed, falsely, that \"there's no court session between now and the end of this election.\")", "\"After Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, they said \u2018Biden should release his list,\u2019\" Biden said in the Sept. 20 address. \"It\u2019s no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release the list only after she passed away. It\u2019s a game for them. It\u2019s a play to gin up emotions and anger.\"", "The Biden campaign noted that the claim came as Biden diverged slightly from his prepared remarks, which the campaign provided to PolitiFact. His prepared line was: \"It\u2019s no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release a list only hours after Justice Ginsburg passed away.\"", "Both Trump and his campaign called several times for Biden to put out a list of prospective nominees before Ginsburg\u2019s death on Sept. 18. When the campaign unveiled the 20 additions to Trump\u2019s list in a Sept. 9 press release, it wrote, \"Biden must do the same.\"", "Hey @JoeBiden,Trump Campaign here!We asked for your prospective SCOTUS nominee list on September 9th, 2020.https://t.co/d5Xo94EGab", "Trump\u2019s campaign staff cited that announcement and other examples disproving Biden\u2019s claim on Twitter and on its website, and the campaign flagged a few more in response to an inquiry:", "On Sept. 17, the Trump campaign released a statement saying \"it\u2019s time for Joe Biden to release a list of his own potential Supreme Court nominees.\"", "On Sept. 12, Trump said at a campaign rally in Minden, Nev., \"I put out a list of an additional number of very conservative, highly thought of, highly respected judges ... They are the only people that I will consider for the Supreme Court of the United States. And I'm asking Joe Biden to do the same thing.\"", "On Sept. 9, Trump said at the White House, \"Joe Biden has refused to release his list, perhaps because he knows the names are so extremely far left that they could never withstand public scrutiny or receive acceptance.\"", "On Aug. 24, Trump said in an Aug. 24 Republican National Convention speech,\u00a0\"I'm demanding, actually, a list. Let Biden put up a list of the judges he's going to appoint.\"", "Trump made similar statements during a \u00a0June 22 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network and a June 20 campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla.", "The Trump campaign has ramped up its calls for a Biden list since Ginsburg\u2019s death. But in Philadelphia, Biden gave three reasons why he didn\u2019t want to publish the names of his potential nominees \u2014 and why he thought Trump\u2019s decision to do so was unconventional.", "Biden argued that putting judges\u2019 names on such a list could influence their decisions in courts where they currently serve, subject them to \"unrelenting political attacks\" without an immediate hearing at which to defend themselves, and upend the traditional process of consulting with the Senate on nominees.", "Trump put out a similar list as a candidate in 2016. In June, Biden told reporters he was thinking about qualified African American women with \"the experience to be on the court.\"", "Biden said, \"The Trump campaign asked that I release the list (of potential Supreme Court nominees) only after (Ginsburg) passed away.\"", "Trump and his campaign challenged Biden to release such a list on multiple occasions in advance of Ginsburg\u2019s death.", "We rate this statement False.", "This fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here\u00a0for more.", "NBC News on YouTube, \"Watch: Biden Delivers Remarks In Philadelphia | NBC News,\" Sept. 20, 2020", "CNN, \"Fact check: Biden falsely claims Trump campaign only asked him for Supreme Court list after Ruth Bader Ginsburg died,\" Sept. 20, 2020", "Donald J.
