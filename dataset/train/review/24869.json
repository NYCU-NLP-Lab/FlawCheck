Now she\u2019s the victim of a new round of false reports that claim she\u2019s being charged with a crime for doing so since former President Barack Obama left office.", "\"Obama\u2019s mother-in-law charged with larceny and fraud,\" reads the headline on several Internet posts that started appearing on or after March 16, 2017. The posts all read roughly the same, claiming that Robinson was charged \"for accepting money from the federal government under false pretenses.\"", "The story stokes reader ire by admonishing Robinson for attempting to take money she didn\u2019t deserve.", "\"While it may not have been her idea to ask for a $160K pension for being the Obama daughters\u2019 \u2018caretaker,\u2019 she was the one who filled out the paperwork and signed her name,\" the posts read.", "Several of these links were flagged by Facebook users for being potentially fake, as part of the social media company\u2019s efforts to prune fake news from readers\u2019 news feeds.

She did move into the White House in 2009, and has helped raise her granddaughters. But she didn\u2019t draw a salary and wasn\u2019t on any kind of government payroll for doing that.
