["Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 24, 2020, on U.S. policy in a changing Middle East.

Ted Cruz and a quote that, in the context of 2020, is both misleading and factually problematic.", "The Oct. 1 Facebook post shows the Texas lawmaker in front of American and Texas flags, and quotes him as saying, \"In the last election, 54 million evangelical Christians stayed home. If Christians will simply show up and vote our values, we\u2019ll turn this country around.\"", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "Although the post is correct to attribute these words to Cruz, it leaves out important context: Cruz said this in 2015 and he was referring to the 2012 election, which resulted in President Barack Obama winning a second term.", "When Cruz was running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, he used this 54 million figure multiple times. In fact, Cruz made the exact statement seen in the post. It was during a taped interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network\u2019s David Brody in July 2015.", "\"There are 90 million evangelical Christians in the United States \u2014 it\u2019s about 30 percent of our population,\" Cruz said. \"In the last election 54 million evangelical Christians stayed home.
