["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on December 7, 2017", "The head of the House science committee falsely claimed the National Science Foundation funds \u201cmore than twice as many graduate students in the social and behavioral sciences as in computer science, mathematics or material science.\u201d", "In fact, 21.5 percent of the 22,821 graduate students funded by the NSF in 2015 were in math, computer science and material engineering, according to the latest data. That\u2019s more than three times the number of psychology and social science students.", "Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, made his claim in a Nov. 30 op-ed, \u201cScience That Leads,\u201d published in the newspaper Roll Call.\u00a0In his op-ed, Smith argues that, in order for U.S. scientists to \u201csurpass their counterparts in China and other competing countries,\u201d\u00a0the NSF \u201cneeds to get its priorities straight\u201d when it comes to what kind of research it funds.", "Smith claimed the NSF is funding too much \u201clow priority\u201d research in the social and behavioral sciences, including sociology and psychology, and not enough research in \u201cfields most likely to yield scientific breakthroughs, technological innovation and economic growth,\u201d such as computer science. To change this, he urged Congress to shift 10 percent to 20 percent of federal funding for social-behavioral research to \u201cnonsocial research.\u201d", "Smith has a right to view some scientific fields as more important than others, but he\u2019s wrong about NSF funding for graduate students.", "When we emailed Smith\u2019s office for support, spokesperson Thea McDonald told us that the chairman\u2019s claim is supported by a \u201clist of current and active Graduate Research Fellowships\u201d that NSF provided to the committee in October. McDonald urged us to reach out to NSF for specific numbers, so we did.", "NSF spokesperson Aya Collins\u00a0told us by email that Smith\u2019s\u00a0\u201cstatement is inaccurate as it only focuses on a single program at NSF: the Graduate Research Fellowship Program.\u201d This \u201cis only one of the means through which NSF funds graduate and undergraduate education,\u201d Collins added.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the numbers on NSF\u2019s\u00a0Graduate Research Fellowship Program first. The program gives students $34,000 for living expenses and $12,000 for tuition, and provides them with other opportunities.", "Collins told us this program currently funds a total of 8,204 graduate fellows, with the life sciences and engineering making up the lion\u2019s share at 2,310 and 1,972 students, respectively. The life sciences include fields such as genetics or neuroscience.", "When it comes to the fields Smith mentioned, this program currently funds\u00a0728 graduate students in the social sciences,\u00a0562 in psychology,\u00a0403 in computer science, 294 in the mathematical sciences and 187 in materials research.", "If psychology and the social sciences are grouped together, then the NSF does indeed fund more than twice as many students in the social and behavioral sciences compared with computer, materials or mathematical sciences \u2014 in this particular program.", "But if we take a look at the NSF\u2019s funding for graduate students across the agency, a different picture unfolds.", "Graduate students can get funding through multiple programs at NSF. For example, Collins highlighted the agency\u2019s CyberCorps program, which\u00a0provides scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students studying cybersecurity, an area of computer science.", "The most recent agencywide\u00a0numbers on graduate students comes from 2015\u00a0(see chart on the left). In that year, the NSF funded a total of 22,821 graduate students.", "Of the fields that Smith highlighted in his op-ed, computer science had the most students \u2013 3,227, or about 14.1 percent of the total students. Math and statistics students made up about 3.7 percent.", "The agencywide data doesn\u2019t specifically delineate \u201cmaterial science\u201d from other disciplines. But there is data on \u201cmetallurgical and materials engineering.\u201d The NSF funded 875 graduate students in this field in 2015, or about 3.8 percent of the total.", "Psychology and social science students made up less than these fields in 2015 at about 2.4 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively.", "Out of all fields, the NSF funded the most graduate students in the physical sciences, including physics and chemistry, at almost 18 percent of the total in 2015. Computer science came in second place.", "The NSF\u2019s funding for all research, not just for graduate students, tells a similar story.", "Congress allocated about $6 billion to the NSF for \u201cresearch and related activities\u201d for fiscal year 2017, which ran from Oct. 1, 2016, to Sept. 30, 2017.", "Of that total amount, Collins told us the social, behavioral and economic sciences made up nearly $270 million. That\u2019s compared with just over $935 million for computer and information science and engineering, and around $1.4 billion for the mathematical and physical sciences, she said.", "It\u2019s worth mentioning, however, that Smith did correctly note\u00a0in his op-ed that, according to TOP500, \u201cChina now has the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer and has just passed the U.S. for the first time to lead the world in the number and total performance of supercomputers.\u201d", "TOP500 is a project of the ISC Group based in Germany that\u00a0ranks supercomputers across the world by their ability to solve linear equations, a simple example of which is 2x=1. The list is compiled by four computer science experts at the ISC Group, the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California and the University of Tennessee.", "In a November article, TOP500 notes that China overtook the U.S. in the total number of supercomputers\u00a0\u201cby a margin of\u00a0202 to 143.\u201d That\u2019s the most \u201csupercomputers China has ever claimed on the TOP500 ranking, with the US presence shrinking to its lowest level since the list\u2019s inception 25 years ago,\u201d adds TOP500.", "So Smith\u2019s argument that the U.S. is falling behind in computer science, at least in supercomputing, is backed by some evidence. But in supporting his argument, Smith falsely claimed that the NSF funds \u201cmore than twice as many graduate students in the social and behavioral sciences as in computer science, mathematics or material science.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: In the chart above, we grouped NSF\u2019s data for \u201cBiological sciences\u201d and \u201cNeuroscience and neurobiology\u201d\u00a0under \u201cLife Sciences.\u201d The number for \u201cOther Sciences\u201d comes from combining NSF\u2019s data for \u201cAgricultural sciences,\u201d \u201cCommunication,\u201d \u201cFamily and consumer sciences and human sciences,\u201d \u201cMultidisciplinary and interdisciplinary studies\u201d and \u201cHealth.\u201d The number for \u201cOther Engineering\u201d comes from adding \u201cAerospace engineering,\u201d \u201cAgricultural engineering,\u201d \u201cArchitecture,\u201d \u201cEngineering science, mechanics, and physics,\u201d \u201cIndustrial and manufacturing engineering,\u201d \u201cMining engineering,\u201d \u201cNuclear engineering,\u201d \u201cPetroleum engineering\u201d and \u201cEngineering nec.\u201d", "SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
