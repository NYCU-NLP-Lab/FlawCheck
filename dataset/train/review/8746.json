["By Robert Farley", "Posted on July 20, 2017", "President Donald Trump misleadingly suggested Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein may be biased against him because Rosenstein \u201cis from Baltimore\u201d and \u201cthere are very few Republicans in Baltimore.\u201d", "Rosenstein, who has testified that he is not a member of any political party, was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush to serve as U.S.\u00a0attorney for the district of Maryland and elevated to deputy attorney general by Trump.", "And he is not from Baltimore. Rosenstein grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia. As the U.S. attorney for Maryland, he worked in Baltimore, but lived in Bethesda, Maryland.", "In a New York Times interview on July 19, Trump expressed frustration with Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from any federal investigation involving the 2016 presidential campaign. Sessions was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump and served as a senior adviser to his campaign.", "Trump said that after Sessions told him about the recusal, he asked Sessions, \u201cWho\u2019s your deputy?\u201d Trump announced his intention to nominate Rosenstein to be deputy attorney general on Jan. 31, and Rosenstein was overwhelmingly confirmed 94-6 by the Senate on April 25.", "Trump, July 19: Yeah, what Jeff Sessions did was he recused himself right after, right after he became attorney general. And I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this before?\u201d I would have \u2014 then I said, \u201cWho\u2019s your deputy?\u201d So his deputy he hardly knew, and that\u2019s Rosenstein, Rod Rosenstein, who is from Baltimore. There are very few Republicans in Baltimore, if any. So, he\u2019s from Baltimore.", "When Sessions recused himself on March 2, it fell to Rosenstein to oversee any matters involving the 2016 presidential campaign. Just a few weeks later, FBI Director James Comey confirmed at a congressional hearing that the bureau was investigating \u201cwhether there was any coordination between the [Trump] campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts\u201d to influence the 2016 presidential election.", "The first crack in Rosenstein\u2019s relationship with the president surfaced shortly after Trump fired Comey on May 9. Rosenstein contradicted the White House\u2019s initial contention that Trump\u2019s decision to fire Comey was based on a recommendation from Rosenstein.", "Rosenstein did, in fact, write a two-and-a-half page memo\u00a0that laid out a case for Comey\u2019s removal, citing Comey\u2019s \u201chandling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary [Hillary] Clinton\u2019s emails.\u201d Rosenstein criticized Comey for holding a press conference on July 5, 2016, to publicly announce his recommendation not to charge Clinton, and for announcing on Oct. 28, 2016, that the FBI had reopened its investigation of Clinton.", "But Rosenstein later told Congress\u00a0that he knew of Trump\u2019s decision to fire Comey a day before he penned the memo. (In the New York Times interview, Trump continued to insist the letter played a role in his decision to fire Comey, though Trump acknowledged that even without it, \u201cperhaps I would have fired Comey anyway.\u201d See our story, \u201cWhy Did Trump Fire Comey?\u201d)", "Rosenstein further drew the ire of the president due to his decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials attempting to influence the election in Trump\u2019s favor. Trump told the New York Times, \u201cA special counsel should never have been appointed in this case.\u201d", "But Trump\u2019s insinuation that Rosenstein may be politically biased against him \u2014 based on being \u201cfrom Baltimore\u201d \u2014 is misplaced.", "Rosenstein grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, as did Trump. He then went on to Harvard Law School and became a prosecutor with the U.S. Department of Justice. In the mid-1990s, Rosenstein was tapped by Kenneth Starr to help as a prosecutor with the Whitewater investigation involving Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s business dealings in Arkansas.", "In 2005, George W. Bush appointed Rosenstein to serve as the\u00a0U.S. attorney for the district of Maryland. Two years later, Bush nominated Rosenstein to a federal appeals court, but the move was blocked by Maryland\u2019s two Democratic senators. He continued to serve as a U.S. attorney under Democratic President Barack Obama.", "It\u2019s true that while Rosenstein served as the U.S. attorney for Maryland, he was based in Baltimore, which is an overwhelmingly Democratic city. In fact, Democrats outnumber Republicans 10-to-1 in the city, according to the Baltimore Sun.", "But Rosenstein resides in Bethesda, Maryland. Montgomery County, Maryland, which includes Bethesda, is strongly Democratic \u2014 with registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans more than 3-to-1 \u2014 but there are plenty of Republicans in Bethesda.", "Thiru\u00a0Vignarajah, who once worked as a federal prosecutor under Rosenstein at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Maryland, described Rosenstein as a \u201crock-ribbed Republican\u201d in a column he wrote for Vox in May.", "But a 2011 profile of Rosenstein in the Washington Post noted, \u201cColleagues say he keeps his politics out of the office.\u201d The profile said: \u201cHe is one of only three U.S. attorneys \u2014 out of 93 nationwide \u2014 appointed by then-President George W. Bush who has been kept on by the Obama administration.\u201d", "In his written testimony for the Senate judiciary committee, Rosenstein stated, \u201cI have not been a member nor held office in or rendered services to any political party or election committee.\u201d", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
