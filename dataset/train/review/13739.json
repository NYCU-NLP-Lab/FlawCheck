["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on February 6, 2018", "President Donald Trump claimed that \u201cApple is investing $350 billion in the United States\u201d over the next five years all because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That\u2019s contradicted by Apple\u2019s chief executive officer, who said that \u201cthere\u2019s large parts of this that we would have done in any situation.\u201d", "Not all of the money is exactly new spending. Apple said that a portion of its contribution would come from continuing its \u201ccurrent pace of spending with domestic suppliers and manufacturers,\u201d which is expected to be $55 billion in 2018. If it spent that amount each year for five years, it would total $275 billion.", "Apple said another $75 billion consists of capital expenditures, new manufacturing investments and taxes paid on overseas profits transferred back to the U.S.", "But the president credited the Republican tax bill he signed into law in late December for the full amount during remarks he made to members of Congress at a GOP retreat in West Virginia.", "Trump, Feb. 1: Because of our tax cuts, Apple is investing $350 billion in the United States. They\u2019re bringing $240 billion back \u2014 $240 billion. They\u2019re going to pay a tax of $38 billion, Mitch \u2014 $38 billion. But they\u2019re going to invest a total of $350 billion. \u2026 for $350 billion, they\u2019re going to build a lot of plants. And this would have never happened without us and the work you\u2019ve done. And they\u2019re hiring 20,000 workers, by the way.", "Apple did announce that it will be creating 20,000 jobs as part of a $350 billion contribution to the U.S. economy over the next five years. But the company did not attribute all it has planned to the new tax law.", "A Jan. 17 press release said: \u201cCombining new investments and Apple\u2019s current pace of spending with domestic suppliers and manufacturers \u2014 an estimated $55 billion for 2018 \u2014 Apple\u2019s direct contribution to the US economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years, not including Apple\u2019s ongoing tax payments, the tax revenues generated from employees\u2019 wages and the sale of Apple products.\u201d", "As for new investments, the press release stated: \u201cPlanned capital expenditures in the US, investments in American manufacturing over five years and a record tax payment upon repatriation of overseas profits will account for approximately $75 billion of Apple\u2019s direct contribution.\u201d", "Of that amount, the tech giant said $38 billion would come from taxes it will pay on about $250 billion in foreign profits it plans to bring back to the U.S. That was the only explicit mention of the tax law, which lowered the tax rate from 35 percent to 15.5 percent on overseas cash that companies repatriate to the U.S.", "In addition, Apple said it plans to spend $30 billion on capital expenditures, including $10 billion on investments in data centers across the country.

He told ABC News reporter Rebecca Jarvis in an interview in January that \u201cthere are large parts of this that are the result of tax reform, and there\u2019s large parts of this that we would have done in any situation.\u201d", "Cook said he \u201chasn\u2019t spent a lot of time categorizing the two,\u201d but his statement means that Trump can\u2019t attribute everything that Apple has planned to the Republican tax legislation that he signed into law.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
