In this video, the man says that since past seven or eight days he has been visiting these slums to give food. However, he claims that some people have been hoarding the relief food even when they have more than enough supplies of their own. Later in the video, he enters a house and shows various food items \u2013 a portion of chicken, a meagre quantity of flour and nine food packets. The video also shows stacks of pooris lying on a table. Just as the pooris are shows we can hear goats bleating in the background. While the man walks out, we see a lady sitting on the ground.

He discouraged hoarding and said that authorities will look into the claims made in the viral video.

Balaji refuted the claim made by JAN TV that people are selling excess food.", "Alt News spoke with Balaji. He said, \u201cI work in the real estate sector,\u201d and confirmed that he is a part of HYV. Explaining the context behind the viral video he said, \u201cI heard that some marginalised people were hoarding food. So I decided to look into the matter along with the government officials.\u201d Balaji didn\u2019t reveal the identity of the officials to Alt News. When we informed that the video is being shared with communal narrative, Balaji clarified that there is no communal angle to this video. \u201cI just wanted to show that some people are taking more food supplies than required.\u201d", "Balaji told us that video 1 was shot on April 9 and video 2 was shot a day prior. \u201cMultiple people were shooting the video on April 8, that\u2019s why there are two versions of the video online,\u201d he added, \u201cThere is no Hindu-Muslim angle to my videos.\u201d", "Alt News reached out to a local journalist (identity concealed at request) who visited the location where the video was shot. According to the journalist, the slums are located 100 metres away from Gandhi Ashram crossway.", "According to the journalist, the woman is the video has nine family members. Alt News crossed checked this with Ashutosh Kumar, inspector Nauchandi, Meerut. \u201cThe woman seen in the viral video is Kasturi and she belongs to a Hindu family,\u201d the inspector added.", "As per the journalist, Kasturi explained that pooris had dampened because they were packed with dal which is why she placed them outside to dry. In the video, we can hear Kasturi trying to make this point twice. Inspector Kumar said, \u201cShe told us that uses these pooris with other food that is given to her.\u201d The journalist also told that he got the same explanation from Kasturi.", "The journalist added that many families in slums accept extra food packages because there is an uncertainly about their next meal. While speaking with Alt News, inspector Kumar said, \u201cThese people get food from the government or NGOs. They accept food from everyone hoping to secure the next meals.\u201d", "The image below shows four screenshots from the video of various food items \u2013 chicken and chapati, pooris (which were next to chicken curry), boxes (that don\u2019t look like food parcels, possibly empty) and flour. Anyone in the right mind will not label this quantity as hoarding. However, Balaji felt that Kasturi\u2019s family had excess food.", "Inspector Kumar informed, \u201cKasturi got chicken from Lisari gate. We told her not to do this in future (until lockdown).\u201d Alt News checked the distance of Lisari gate from Gandhi Ashram crossway in order to verify it was practically possible to make this trip during the lockdown. We found out that Lisari gate is within a two-kilometre radius from Kasturi\u2019s home.", "The viral video also shows boxes of food \u2013 possible flavoured rice or biryani. Balaji suggested that the family had taken more food than necessary. However, in the picture, we can clearly see the boxes match the number of members in Kasturi\u2019s family.", "Inspector Kumar clarified that social media claims are baseless and added, \u201cThe family shown in the video is a Hindu family.\u201d Balaji also confirmed that there is no communal narrative, as mentioned above.", "Balaji added, \u201cAfter I learnt that the video got viral, I realised that the families in this area might be struggling to get food from NGOs. Since last two days, I have been going to this area to give them food.\u201d Alt News couldn\u2019t independently verify this claim.", "Thus, the social media claim associated with the first viral video is false. Additionally, Balaji\u2019s allegation that the family shown in the video is hoarding food doesn\u2019t hold water. Moreover, entering someone\u2019s home without permission and filming them inside is a gross violation of privacy.", "At the beginning of the video, Balaji said he is at Kusht Ashram behind a mehal. Using that as a clue, Alt News performed a keyword search on Google and found Shri Vivekanand Kusht Ashram (SVKA), a leprosy shelter. As per Just Dial, the ashram is located on Delhi Road, behind Mukud Mehal.", "Alt News tried looking up for the ashram on Google maps but couldn\u2019t find it.

The screenshot below highlights the location of Shri Vivekanand Kusht Ashram (SVKA), as per Balaji.", "Balaji said, \u201cOn April 8 we visited the ashram in order to assess if they need food supplies. While inspecting the premises we saw few doors that were locked. One of our team members managed to have a peek inside and pointed out that there is food lying on the ground.\u201d As stated above, he clarified that there is no communal narrative in the video.", "Alt News spoke to Sachin, secretary at SVKA. Sachin informed that in the ashram only members of the Hindu community stay and refuted the communal narrative on social media. According to him, they had received food on Kanya Poojan which was celebrated on April 1 this year. \u201cThis year we received pooris in extra quantity. Despite distributing it among ashramites food was left. We were going to give it to a gaushala,\u201d Sachin said. He added that they received food from Amar Ujala newspaper as well.", "However, as per Balaji, the ashram authorities didn\u2019t explain why they had so much food rotting in a room.", "Alt News spoke with Rajan Tripathi regional editor Amar Ujala, Meerut. According to Tripathi, SVKA had reached out, prior to April 1, for aid because they were struggling to feed the people at the ashram. He also pointed out that the ashram is very close to their office. Alt News checked on Google maps and found that it is within a two-kilometre radius.", "Tripathi said, \u201cI find it unlikely that Kanya Poojan was celebrated due to the lockdown. However, it is likely that the ashram got more food than the requirement. Thus a lot of it was wasted.\u201d When we informed that the video is being shared with a communal narrative, he said, \u201cThis a leprosy ashram \u2013 people all faiths are welcome. However, as far as my knowledge only Hindu community residents here.\u201d", "Alt News also spoke with an inspector at Nauchandi police station who looked into this incident.

Thus no case was registered.\u201d The inspector confirmed, \u201cThere is no communal narrative to this incident.\u201d", "Despite the inconsistencies on why food was wasted in the ashram, the claim that Muslims are stocking up food supplies in this ashram was refuted by Meerut Police, Navneet Balaji (the person who recorded the video), Sachin, secretary at the Shri Vivekanand Kusht Ashram and Rajan Tripathi, regional editor Amar Ujala, also have the same statement.", "Two videos went viral from Meerut around April 10. The initial claim was that marginalised people are stocking up food. However, several people subsequently shared it with the communal narrative on social media.
