Seth Moulton, D-Mass., took Biden to task again \u2014 this time after Biden flipped his position on the Hyde Amendment, a provision that bars Washington from spending federal money to pay for abortions.", "\"Bravo to @JoeBiden for doing the right thing and reversing his longstanding support for the Hyde Amendment,\" Moulton, a former U.S. Marine who served in Iraq, wrote in a June 7 tweet. \"It takes courage to admit when you're wrong, especially when those decisions affect millions of people. Now do the Iraq War.\"", "Moulton\u2019s tweet is based on a faulty premise. Moulton says that Biden admitted he was wrong about the Hyde Amendment. He didn\u2019t. He said he changed his stance due to a change in circumstances.", "As for Biden\u2019s vote for a resolution that cleared the way for the Iraq War, he called it a mistake, but without admitting he was wrong.", "We took a close look at his words on both topics. The ways Biden approached his shift on these two issues have more in common with one another than Moulton's tweet suggests.", "By the fall of 2002, the drum beat from President George W. Bush\u2019s administration on Iraq President Saddam Hussein and his nation\u2019s purported weapons programs left little doubt that military action was imminent. Senate Democrats split \u2014 29 in favor and 21 against \u2014 over whether to approve a resolution that would give Bush a free hand to launch an attack.", "Political scientist John Pitney at Claremont McKenna College said that Biden saw his vote for the resolution as making war less likely.", "\"Biden explained the authorization to use military force as a way to compel Iraq to abandon WMDs,\" Pitney said. \"He even said, \u2018I believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur.\u2019\"", "In the late hours of Oct. 11, 2002, Biden justified his vote by amplifying Bush\u2019s own words about avoiding war.", "\"He said that quote, \u2018war is neither imminent nor inevitable\u2019,\" Biden said. \"And that he desired to lead the world and, if war was necessary, it would be with allies at our side.\"", "Biden said the resolution wasn\u2019t perfect, but it leaned toward working with the international community to get Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions.", "The war started in March 2003. In 2004, Biden reflected on the vote he had cast.", "\"A year and a half ago, I voted to give President Bush the authority to use force in Iraq, Biden wrote in an op-ed. \"I still believe my vote was just \u2014 but the president's use of that authority was unwise in ways I never imagined.\"", "By late 2005, the Iraq operation had unravelled. The weapons of mass destruction were nowhere to be found.

He pointed to efforts to shutter Planned Parenthood clinics and limits tied to the Affordable Care Act.", "\"We now see so many Republican governors denying health care to millions of the poorest and most vulnerable Americans by refusing even Medicaid expansion,\" Biden said. \"I can't justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need and the ability to exercise their constitutionally protected right.\"", "Biden painted his shift as the product of compassion and pragmatism, not contrition. It was about the states\u2019 moves to restrict access.", "\"I make no apologies in my last position,\" he said. \"I don't want to mislead you. If in fact, it (abortion service) was still available, I think, just as I've never attempted to impose my views on anyone else as to when life begins, I have never attempted to impose my view on who should pay for it.\"", "\"But folks, times have changed,\" Biden added.", "Moulton said Biden hasn\u2019t admitted he was wrong on the Iraq War.

Rather, he expressed regret for having thought that Bush would wisely use the authority he had been given.", "We leave it to others to decide if that is sufficient regret. But if Moulton saw that as different from how Biden talked about the Hyde Amendment, we find those differences slight.", "In both cases, Biden cast his past actions as based on certain expectations or conditions that weren\u2019t met. He had just as many caveats when talking about his shift on the Hyde Amendment as he did about his Iraq War vote.
