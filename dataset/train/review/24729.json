["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on May 19, 2020", "At a White House meeting with fellow Republicans, President Donald Trump said, without evidence, that the coronavirus \u201cis going to go away without a vaccine.\u201d While it\u2019s impossible to predict the future, experts say it\u2019s unlikely that the virus will simply go away.", "His son Eric went even further in a May 16 interview, claiming that coronavirus \u201cwill magically all of a sudden go away\u201d after the November election.", "\u201cIt is completely fanciful and not evidence-based to state that SARS-CoV-2 will \u2018go away\u2019 without a vaccine,\u201d said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, referring to the full name of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. \u201cThere is no basis for this statement.\u201d", "\u201cIt is a theoretical possibility that the virus could go away permanently with a large uncontrolled epidemic everywhere in the world, leading to depletion of susceptible people and permanent immunity,\u201d Lipsitch added in an email.", "But, he said, that series of events would be \u201cexceedingly unlikely,\u201d since no human coronavirus is known to elicit permanent immunity, and because countries will maintain a pool of people susceptible to the virus for a long time, allowing for reintroductions of the virus.", "To state that the virus will go away without a vaccine is \u201cbaseless,\u201d Lipsitch said, and to consider it as one of the top scenarios for policy planning is \u201cfoolish.\u201d", "In an interview\u00a0on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, also objected to Trump\u2019s claim that the virus would \u201cgo away\u201d without a vaccine.", "\u201cNo, this virus isn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, over time, we\u2019ll learn to live with it and we\u2019ll be able to reduce the risk of transmission. But it\u2019s going to stay as a background problem in the country and around the world until we have a vaccine.\u201d", "Barry Bloom, an immunologist and global health expert at Harvard, also told us he did not think the virus would go away without a vaccine.", "Trump\u2019s comments came\u00a0during a May 8\u00a0meeting\u00a0at the White House with Republican members of Congress\u00a0in response to a reporter\u2019s question\u00a0about how necessary a vaccine is to resolving the pandemic.", "Trump, May 8: Well, I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests. This is going to go away without a vaccine. It\u2019s going to go away, and it\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time. You may have some \u2014 some flare-ups and I guess, you know, I would expect that. Sometime in the fall, you\u2019ll have flare-ups maybe. Maybe not. But according to what a lot of people say, you probably will. We\u2019ll be able to put them out. You may have some flare-ups next year, but eventually, it\u2019s going to be gone. I mean, it\u2019s going to be gone.", "You know, there are some viruses and flus that came, and they went for a vaccine, they never found the vaccine, and they\u2019ve disappeared. They\u2019ve never shown up again. They got \u2014 they die too, like everything else. They die too.", "When asked for evidence for his position in a follow-up question, Trump said he relied \u201con what doctors say,\u201d adding, \u201cThey say it\u2019s going to go \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean this year, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be gone, frankly, by the fall or after the fall. But eventually, it\u2019s going to go away. The question is will we need a vaccine? At some point, it will probably go away by itself. If we had a vaccine, that would be very helpful. I\u2019d be very happy to have a vaccine.\u201d", "The White House did not respond to our requests for support for the statement or for clarification on what the president meant by \u201cgo away.\u201d But back in February, Trump made a similar claim, suggesting that because of warmer weather, the coronavirus would \u201cgo away\u201d in April \u2014 a prediction that, as we explained, was highly uncertain even at the time, and did not come to pass.", "And in an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro on May 16, the president\u2019s son Eric Trump used similar language to make the groundless claim that the coronavirus is a Democratic ploy to keep his father from doing arena-style campaigning. \u201cYou watch, they\u2019ll milk it every single day between now and Nov. 3,\u201d the younger Trump said of Democrats. \u201cAnd guess what? After Nov. 3, coronavirus will magically all of a sudden go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen.\u201d", "While the president is right that the pandemic will eventually wane, scientists do not anticipate a speedy retreat \u2014 and even with a vaccine, there is a chance the virus will continue to stick around.", "\u201cViruses do not do anything magically,\u201d said Lipsitch. \u201cAll scientific evidence and reasoning indicates that SARS-CoV-2 will be spreading in large parts of the human population for months or years to come, in the absence of widespread use of an effective vaccine.\u201d", "Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a prominent member of the coronavirus task force, has said that it will take a vaccine to allow society to let up on all of its mitigation efforts.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be over to the point of our being able to not do any mitigation until we have a scientifically sound, safe and effective vaccine,\u201d he said in an April 16 television interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle.\u201d", "And Fauci pushed back when host Laura Ingraham suggested, as Trump later did, that this virus might \u201cdisappear\u201d the way SARS did.", "\u201cAnything could, Laura, but I have to tell you, the degree of efficiency, of transmissibility of this is really unprecedented in anything that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinarily efficient virus in transmitting from one person to another. Those kinds of viruses don\u2019t just disappear.\u201d", "In Senate testimony on May 12, Fauci again said of the virus disappearing, \u201cThat is just not going to happen,\u201d adding that even if there is better control of the virus in the summer, \u201cit is likely that there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will eventually get back to us.\u201d", "Fauci also previously cautioned that while conditions in the U.S. would improve, there could be an ongoing risk.", "\u201c[I]f you want to get to pre-coronavirus, you know, that might not ever happen in the sense of the fact that the threat is there,\u201d he said in an April 6 task force briefing. \u201cBut I believe, with the therapies that will be coming online, and with the fact that I feel confident that over a period of time we will get a good vaccine, that we will never have to get back to where we are right back now.\u201d", "The World Health Organization, too, has said that while a vaccine is humanity\u2019s best chance of getting rid of the virus, even then, there is no guarantee that the virus will go completely away.", "\u201cI think it\u2019s important to put this on the table,\u201d said Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme, in a May 13 press conference. \u201cThis virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities and this virus may never go away.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can predict when or if this disease will disappear. We do have one great hope,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cIf we do find a highly effective vaccine that we can distribute to everyone who needs it in the world, we may have a shot at eliminating this virus. But that vaccine will have to be highly effective, it will have to be made available to everyone and we will have to use it.\u201d", "Ryan noted that the world has failed to eliminate other viral diseases, such as measles, even with readily available, effective vaccines.", "\u201cThere are no promises in this and there are no dates,\u201d he said, adding that there was a possibility COVID-19 might \u201csettle into a long-term problem.\u201d", "How the COVID-19 pandemic will unfold can\u2019t be known, but some scientists have attempted to model how the virus will spread under different assumptions to understand what the possibilities might be.", "Lipsitch was part of a team at Harvard that created a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in temperate regions of the world, factoring in different levels of seasonality, immunity and cross-immunity to two common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1.", "Publishing in the journal Science in mid-April, the team found that repeated wintertime outbreaks \u201cwill probably occur,\u201d and even if the virus might appear to go away, \u201ca resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.\u201d", "In many of the team\u2019s simulations, SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate long-term. If immunity to the virus lasts a bit less than a year \u2014 on par with the common cold coronaviruses \u2014 then the coronavirus might return annually. A longer, two-year period of immunity pushes the virus\u2019s reappearance into a biennial or more sporadic pattern.", "In the unlikely case that immunity is permanent, then the virus could disappear for five or more years, the study found. But even in cases in which the virus might seem to die out, SARS-CoV-2 could make a comeback several years later.", "These scenarios do not factor in any mitigation measures, but other modeling from the group suggests that one-time lockdowns won\u2019t be enough to control the virus.", "\u201cWe found that one-time social distancing measures are likely to be insufficient to maintain the incidence of SARS-COV-2 within the limits of critical care capacity in the United States,\u201d said co-author Stephen Kissler, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard, in a press call. \u201cAnd so what seems could be necessary in the absence of other sorts of treatments are intermittent social distancing periods.\u201d", "While the team does not endorse any particular strategy, the basic idea with intermittent social distancing would be to try to space out the number of infections enough so that the health care system never gets overloaded, but that over time, immunity to the virus builds.", "If approximately 50-67% of a given population were to become infected and develop immunity, then that could provide so-called community or herd immunity, preventing spread to those who still remain susceptible \u2014 and causing outbreaks to eventually peter out.", "This type of slow-build immunity approach is one way that the pandemic could end without a vaccine, Annelies Wilder-Smith, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told us. (The other involves a highly unlikely global containment effort, involving a simultaneous Wuhan-level lockdown in every country.)", "But it would take a long time, she said \u2014 perhaps two to four years \u2014 and, as we\u2019ve established, would not necessarily bring a true end to the virus.", "Work by others also suggests the virus will be around for the long haul. In an April 30 report released by the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, researchers outlined three possible scenarios, based on what is known about SARS-CoV-2 and past experience with epidemics.", "In the first so-called \u201cpeaks and valleys\u201d scenario, the first wave of infection would be followed by a series of well-defined waves that gradually diminish in 2021.", "In a second scenario, the virus returns in the fall or winter with a vengeance \u2014 akin to what happened with the 1918 influenza pandemic \u2014 producing a much larger wave of infections than the current one, followed up by smaller subsequent waves.", "In the third \u201cslow burn\u201d scenario, infections would continue at a lower level after the first surge, but wouldn\u2019t follow a clear wave pattern.", "Regardless of the scenario the pandemic follows, the report cautions that \u201cwe must be prepared for at least another 18 to 24 months of significant COVID-19 activity, with hot spots popping up periodically in diverse geographic areas.\u201d", "And the report notes that the virus may not go away, even if the pandemic resolves.", "\u201cAs the pandemic wanes, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in the human population and will synchronize to a seasonal pattern with diminished severity over time,\u201d similar to what has happened with past pandemic influenza viruses and the more mild human coronaviruses that cause colds.", "Indeed, although Trump suggested that viruses disappear, never to return, without vaccines, that\u2019s not actually what happens in most cases.", "\u201cI\u2019m hard pressed to think of any viruses that \u2018disappeared\u2019 on their own,\u201d Columbia epidemiologist Stephen Morse told us. \u201cOnce they gain a foothold, most viruses are hard to eliminate, especially respiratory viruses. Influenza \u2013 flu \u2014 doesn\u2019t go away, it just keeps coming back in new guises.\u201d", "Far from disappearing, even after all the waves of a pandemic conclude, pandemic influenza viruses return as seasonal influenza viruses.", "\u201cThey settle down and evolve, a key surface protein (the hemagglutinin, H) mutating to get past our immune systems,\u201d said Morse, allowing \u201cthe new variant to reinfect, even people already immune from having had the pandemic.\u201d", "Versions of the H1N1 influenza strain that caused the 2009 pandemic, for example, continue to circulate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the virus led to at least 100 million illnesses and 75,000 deaths between 2009 and 2018 in the U.S. alone \u2014 and that is with a vaccine that became available in October 2009 and is estimated to have prevented up to 1.5 million clinical cases.", "In fact, Morse said every seasonal flu the world knows is the descendant of a pandemic virus.", "The common cold coronaviruses that infect humans today are also examples of viruses that never disappeared. These viruses are thought to have emerged from animals in the past, the most recent one around 1890, according to a genetic analysis of OC43. Although still speculative, the authors of that study think it\u2019s possible that OC43 may have been responsible for the 1889-1890 pandemic when it crossed over into humans from cows.", "These coronaviruses do not mutate to the extent that influenza does, Morse said. But immunity to the viruses is short-lived, so the viruses are able to reinfect people after a period of time and also tend to exhibit a seasonal pattern.", "There is the example of the SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, virus, which led to an outbreak in 2003 that was successfully contained. Other than a few lingering cases and a couple mishaps in a lab in 2004, the virus has not returned \u2014 although there is still the risk the virus could reemerge if humans interact with animals harboring the virus.", "But that virus never spread as widely as SARS-CoV-2, infecting only about 8,000 people in fewer than 30\u00a0countries. In contrast, as of May 19, there have been more than 4.6 million COVID-19 cases in 188 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker.", "SARS-CoV-1, Morse said, was not as transmissible as its successor, and the bulk of the transmission was in health care settings. \u201cOnce the affected facilities implemented rigorous infection control,\u201d he said, \u201cthey could control SARS in the facility and it eventually stopped.\u201d", "What will ultimately happen with SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, as the trajectory, Morse said, will depend \u201con the virus, on how we behave, and on our immune systems.\u201d", "But there is little precedent for a virus that has spread so efficiently to \u201cgo away,\u201d as the president claimed.", "Morse said that long-term, there isn\u2019t enough evidence to know whether the coronavirus will follow the path of a seasonal flu virus \u2014 mutating and periodically reinfecting \u2014 or that of a seasonal coronavirus, periodically reinfecting after a while, and usually causing a milder disease.", "\u201cWhatever the scenario,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s likely we\u2019ll be dealing with it, and its consequences, for some time to come.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
