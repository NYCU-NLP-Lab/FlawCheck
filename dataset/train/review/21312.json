The move, which caught everyone including Bill Cosby off guard, takes effect immediately. Even though the evidence was strong, President Obama felt compelled to pardon the famous comedian of all current and future charges.", "The Scooper reached out to Mr. Cosby for comment, but we were provided with the following press release.", "\"I know people are tired of me not saying anything, but a guy doesn\u2019t have to answer to innuendos. People should fact check. People shouldn't have to go through that and shouldn't answer to innuendos. And just because I've received a Presidential pardon, doesn't mean I'm guilty of anything. To the contrary, it shows I'm innocent.\"", "There is no truth to this story, which originated with NC Scooper, a fake news site that does not publish factual stories:", "This website is satirical in scope and intent.
