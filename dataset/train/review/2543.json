It has been viewed more than 1.2 million times.", "Below is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:", "The man seen in the clip can be heard speaking Tagalog. From the one-minute five-second mark, he\u00a0can be heard saying: \u201cThe coronavirus does not have an antibiotic yet. Even if I\u2019m not a scientist, I have a right to do research. I have a right to contribute what I know. And I found out that the coronavirus is from the skin and crawls to the eyes, infecting humans who quickly die.\u201d", "\u201cMakabuhay is the number one antibiotic. Very great antibiotic. It is bitter but not poisonous. It\u2019s more effective if its sap is dropped directly on both eyes.\u201d", "At the four-minute 28-second mark, he says: \u201cIf there are diseases in the throat, there are microbes, viruses in the throat, the makabuhay can kill these if it is dropped on the eyes.\u201d", "Makabuhay is the local name of tinospora crispa, a popular medicinal plant in Southeast Asia, sometimes used to treat a variety of health conditions,\u00a0according to this medical journal.", "The misleading video\u2019s Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \"I WENT TO THIS FOREST ON PURPOSE BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUS. It passes through the Eyes and this cure IS ALSO DROPPED ON THE EYES. Find out why\".", "The novel coronavirus epidemic, now declared a global health emergency by the World health Organization (WHO), first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. At least 490 people have died and some 24,000 have been infected in China since the outbreak, according to this AFP report dated February 5, 2020.", "The virus has spread to at least 20 other countries, including the Philippines, which reported the first death from the virus outside China.", "The same video was also shared here and here on Facebook, here on YouTube, and here on Twitter, alongside a similar claim.", "The\u00a0claim is misleading; Philippine health experts told AFP there is no evidence the sap of tinospora crispa is effective in treating or preventing novel coronavirus infections.", "Dr. Ferdinand De Guzman, a spokesperson for Philippines\u2019 San Lazaro Hospital, a national center for infectious diseases,\u00a0told AFP on February 4, 2020 that online\u00a0claims about using\u00a0the sap of tinospora crispa to treat novel coronavirus were inaccurate.", "He said: \u201cThe novel coronavirus is a virus so an antibiotic would have no effect.\u201d", "Dr. Jaime Purificacion from the University of the Philippines\u2019 Institute of Herbal Medicine\u00a0told\u00a0AFP by phone on February 3, 2020 there was no scientific basis\u00a0in claims that tinospora crispa was effective in treating novel coronavirus.", "\u201cOur indication for [medical benefits of] makabuhay is [only] for scabies,\u201d he said.", "He also strongly advised the public against\u00a0putting\u00a0plant sap in the eyes.", "\u201cThe eyes are a sensitive organ of the body. It\u2019s dangerous because there are no safety studies,\u201d he added.", "This WHO information sheet also says antibiotics are ineffective in treating the new coronavirus strain.", "It states: \"No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
