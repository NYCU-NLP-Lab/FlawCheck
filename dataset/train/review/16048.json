["By Robert Farley", "Posted on September 16, 2016", "Donald Trump finally, definitively allowed that \u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.\u201d But his terse statement on the matter included two falsehoods.", "\u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it,\u201d Trump said in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 16. Neither of those things is true.", "As we have written before, there\u2019s no evidence that Clinton or her campaign had anything to do with bogus claims that Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States and thus was ineligible to be president.", "What we do know, as we wrote\u00a0in November 2008, is that some diehard Clinton supporters pushed that theory during that year\u2019s presidential campaign. But again, there is no evidence that either Clinton herself or anyone on her campaign staff was involved in that.", "On March 19, 2007, then Clinton adviser Mark Penn wrote a strategy memo\u00a0to Clinton that identified Obama\u2019s\u00a0\u201clack of American roots\u201d as something that \u201ccould hold him back.\u201d That memo, which was part of campaign documents featured in a September 2008 article in The Atlantic, cited Obama\u2019s \u201cboyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii\u201d as life experiences that made his \u201cbasic American values \u2026 at best limited.\u201d But Penn\u2019s memo did not question Obama\u2019s birthplace or his birth certificate. It advised Clinton to contrast her life experiences in middle America \u201cwithout turning negative.\u201d", "\u201cWe are never going to say anything about his background,\u201d Penn wrote.", "Again, if there is evidence that Clinton or her campaign had something to do with the origins of the so-called birther movement, we\u2019ve yet to see it. And Trump has never offered any proof.", "Trump is also wrong to say he \u201cfinished\u201d what he called the \u201cbirther controversy.\u201d The issue was long settled, as we wrote repeatedly, even before\u00a0Trump prominently injected himself into the birther movement\u00a0in April 2011, as he was mulling a presidential run.", "Back in 2008, the Obama campaign had made public the official birth certificate issued by the state of Hawaii. FactCheck.org staffers touched, examined and photographed that document, as we wrote in our \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d article. Trump\u00a0claimed in 2011 that the official \u201cCertification of Live Birth\u201d that Obama produced in 2008 was \u201cnot a birth certificate,\u201d but we noted then that he was wrong. The U.S. Department of State uses \u201cbirth certificate\u201d as a generic term to include the official Hawaii document, which satisfies legal requirements for proving citizenship and obtaining a passport.", "And\u00a0there was\u00a0more evidence than that.", "There also were public announcements of Obama\u2019s birth published in Hawaii newspapers shortly after his birth in 1961 (placed there not by his family, as Trump suggested, but based on official state records). And the state\u2019s top vital records official, Dr. Chiyome Leinaala Fukino, director of the Hawaii Department of Health, issued a statement in 2009 stating that she had \u201cseen the original vital records maintained on file\u201d and that those records, which are confidential under state law, verified that \u201cBarack Hussein Obama was born in Hawai\u2019i and is a natural-born American citizen.\u201d", "On April 27, 2011, just a few\u00a0weeks after Trump began floating some of his bogus conspiracy theories about Obama\u2019s birthplace, President Obama released the long-form version of his birth certificate. At the time, Obama said he sought release of the confidential long-form birth certificate from the Hawaii Department of Health\u00a0so that the nation could focus on more serious matters. \u201cWe do not have time for this kind of silliness,\u201d he said.", "So while Trump may have an argument that he played a role in getting Obama to release his long-form birth certificate, he\u2019s wrong to say that he \u201cfinished\u201d the debate. It was already finished, at least to our satisfaction.", "And if Trump had \u201cfinished it\u201d by pressuring Obama to release a long-form birth certificate, at least one person was apparently unconvinced: Trump.", "As Buzzfeed noted, Trump tweeted in August 2012 that \u201cAn \u2018extremely credible source\u2019 has called my office and told me that Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate is a fraud.\u201d In September of that year, Trump shared via Twitter an article claiming the birth certificate was fake. In a June 2014 tweet, Trump boasted, \u201cI was the one who got Obama to release his birth certificate, or whatever that was!\u201d And in 2013 he retweeted someone who alleged the long-form birth certificate was \u201ca computer generated forgery.\u201d", "We\u2019re glad to hear that Trump is now convinced Obama was born in the U.S. But his claims about the issue continue to stray from the facts. There\u2019s no evidence that either Clinton or anyone on her campaign staff \u201cstarted it.\u201d Nor did Trump \u201cfinish it.\u201d If anything, Trump continued to perpetuate the issue long after it was settled.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f08384f5-d3ac-491b-8169-aded8896a998", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
