["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on May 6, 2020", "Claims on social media have been spreading the falsehood that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention significantly lowered the COVID-19 death toll. There has been no such reduction. These claims confuse two different measures of the number of deaths.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regularly updates two different lists that track deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. One list, referred to as \u201cprovisional deaths,\u201d counts death certificates. The other list\u00a0counts confirmed and probable cases.", "The list that counts death certificates shows a lower number partly because official documentation takes days or weeks to produce. So that number lags behind other methods of counting the death toll.", "But several claims based on a faulty comparison of those two lists have been spreading the falsehood that the CDC has \u201cadjusted\u201d or \u201creduced\u201d the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the U.S.", "This message \u2014 made explicit in some posts and implicit in others \u2014 furthers the conspiracy theory that the pandemic was planned or is a hoax.", "For example, one Facebook post said, \u201cThe CDC has adjusted their COVID19 deaths from 64,000 to 37,000. What do you think about that? Still scared? Angry yet?\u201d It generated this response from a reader: \u201cWHAT A DAMM HOAX!!! ALL OF IT!\u201d", "But it\u2019s not true.", "The claim received widespread attention after it was highlighted by the popular right-wing personality Dinesh D\u2019Souza. On May 2, he tweeted: \u201cJust like that, CDC reduces its #Coronavirus death count to 37,000. That\u2019s nearly HALF the total they were peddling. Did 30,000 people spring back to life like Lazarus? No, this seems a \u2018gaffe\u2019 \u2014 defined as a case of the CDC accidentally telling the truth.\u201d", "A few minutes after he posted the tweet, another user responded with a screenshot showing 62,406 deaths on the CDC\u2019s list of confirmed and probable cases. D\u2019Souza replied with a screenshot of the CDC\u2019s other list, counting death certificates, that showed 37,308 deaths. He wrote, \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d", "But, as we said, those two lists are different. The first one shows the number of deaths from COVID-19 based on information collected from states and territories reporting both confirmed and probable cases. The second one shows the number of death certificates that list COVID-19 as the cause of death.", "As the CDC explained, the count based on death certificates has a one- to two-week lag behind the numbers shown in lists that use other methods for counting because:", "Archived versions of the two lists confirm that there has been no decrease in the death toll total and that the number shown in the list counting death certificates does, indeed, lag the other by about two weeks. For example, as of April 20, the list showing confirmed and probable cases put the death toll at 39,083. Two weeks later, on May 4, the list showing the number of death certificates put the toll at 38,576.", "Still, the bogus claim continues to circulate, including in the form of a screenshot meme that was created from the headline on the conservative website waynedupree.com, which has since issued a correction.", "And, on May 4, a conservative radio show repeated the claim in a story that has garnered more than 100,000 likes, shares, and comments on Facebook, according to data from CrowdTangle.", "Neither the radio show nor D\u2019Souza responded to our request for comment.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
