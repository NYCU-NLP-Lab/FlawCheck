["A clipping that has been floating on social media the last few years has resurfaced this election season.

He traded the stolen items for gold, which, in turn, were stolen by Narendra Modi when he was a young boy. His father, unable to cope with his son\u2019s actions, suffered a cardiac arrest. The family could not get back the stolen gold despite lodging an FIR and Damodardas Mulchand Modi subsequently died because his family could afford the medical expenses. The story ends by claiming that former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee suppressed the case and the FIR against Narendra Modi in 1996.", "The elaborate tale is being shared by multiple users on social media.", "\u0938\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0936\u0928 \u092a\u0930 c \u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0915\u0921\u093c\u093e 6 \u092e\u0939\u0940\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u091c\u093e \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u0925\u0940\u0964 \u0930\u0947\u0932\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0932\u094b\u0939\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u0915\u094b\u092f\u0932\u093e \u092d\u0940 \u091a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0925\u093e \u0907\u0938 \u0916\u092c\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u0939\u094b \u091c\u093e\u090f \u0924\u094b \u0906\u092a \u092d\u0940 \u0915\u0939\u0928\u093e \u091a\u094c\u0915\u0940\u0926\u093e\u0930 \u091a\u094b\u0930 \u0939\u0948 \u0964 \u0926\u0941\u0938\u0930\u094b \u0915\u094b \u092d\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u091a\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0939\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0916\u0941\u0926 \u091a\u094b\u0930 \u0939\u0948 \u0964 pic.twitter.com/Z49IFH05Ob", "\u2014 #NYAYforIndia \u2013 Luv Datta \u2122#INC \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 (@Luv_Datta) May 6, 2019", "It has been shared on Facebook by quite a few users.", "\u0938\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0936\u0928 \u092a\u0930 \u091a\u093e\u092f \u092c\u0947\u091a\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0928\u0947 \u091a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u090f \u0925\u0947 300 \u0930\u0941\u092a\u092f\u0947 \u092c\u095c\u0928\u0917\u0930 \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938 \u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0915\u095c\u093e 6 \u092e\u0939\u0940\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u091c\u093e \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u0925\u0940\u0964 \u0930\u0947\u0932\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0932\u094b\u0939\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u0915\u094b\u092f\u0932\u093e \u092d\u0940\u2026", "Posted by Sujit kumar on Sunday, 5 May 2019", "The claim has been floating on WhatsApp as well.", "The oldest instance of the story that Alt News found was a 2017 post by one Velaram M Patel whose Facebook bio says that he is a member of Congress.", "\u0938\u092c \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092f\u0939 \u0938\u0935\u093e\u0932 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u0909\u0920\u0924\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0915\u093e \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0932\u0947\u0924\u0947\u2026 \u0930\u0947\u0932\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0936\u0928 \u092a\u0930 \u091a\u093e\u092f \u092c\u0947\u091a\u0924\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u092f\u2026", "Posted by Velaram M.

At first glance, the clipping appears to be a newspaper cutout. But it isn\u2019t. While the story has been aligned similar to articles published in newspapers, the report is not dated. Furthermore, the story gives out information that is not backed by factual data like dates, time and place. It says Narendra Modi stole his father\u2019s gold, however, fails to mention his age or the year of the alleged incident. All that it does is give readers a photograph of PM Modi as a young boy. This could be interpreted as visual manipulation. While the story itself does not reveal his age, the picture causes the reader to infer that the Prime Minister must have been a teenager when the incident took place. Furthermore, the clipping says that his father died of a heart attack. But it does not give away the year of the death.", "2. If one tries to look up the alleged incident on Google, the search engine does not throw up any results.", "3. There are several spelling errors in the article.
