Someone has forgotten something and we zip over to Walmart and pick up what we need.", "Today changed that for our family. We will never return to Grove Walmart or any other Walmart.

It went on to say how they support the black community and acknowledge the injustices committed by the law enforcement agencies. I watched my nine-year-old son whip his head around and the light goes out in my husband's eyes. We decided to leave the store. My husband was just going to leave and not say anything to anyone.

A few minutes later two male employees came up. The manager asked what happened. When we told him he said that she had the right to not serve anyone. My husband agreed with that. My husband told the manager that he didn't expect Walmart to back Blue lives but he did think of the very least for impartiality.

He said this was Walmart's corporate policy.", "I asked the man so Walmart is not going to support law enforcement officers at all?

So this tells me that they only care about money.", "The manager said that people at corporate make the decisions and they have to play the message.
