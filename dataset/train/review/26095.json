Rather, it was a \"3D visualization\" of the Australian fires by Anthony Hearsey, \"an image maker who specialises in photography, retouching and creative imaging,\" which was compiled from NASA satellite data collected across the span of a month.", "Many postings of this image included a disclaimer noting that the visualization encompassed \"all the areas which have been affected\" by fires in Australia, but that \"not all the areas are still burning\":", "https://imgur.com/gallery/9oiePhO", "Anthony Hearsey himself offered a clarification of what this image represents:", "This is a 3D visualisation of the fires in Australia. NOT A PHOTO. Think of this as prettier looking graph.", "This is made from data from NASA\u2019s FIRMS (Satellite data regarding fires) between 05/12/19 - 05/01/20. These are all the areas which have been affected by bushfires.", "Scale is a little exaggerated due to the render\u2019s glow, but generally true to the info from the NASA website. Also note that NOT all the areas are still burning, and this is a compilation.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
