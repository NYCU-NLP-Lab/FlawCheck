["About this rating", "A familiar song from everyone\u2019s childhood has an interesting backstory, which carries particular resonance as the COVID-19 vaccine was administered for the first time in late 2020. On Dec. 1, 2020, Jeffrey Sherman \u2014 the son and nephew of Robert and Richard Sherman, the songwriting duo responsible for the music of classics like \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d \u201cThe Aristocats,\u201d and more \u2014 shared how the song \u201cA Spoonful of Sugar\u201d from \u201cMary Poppins\u201d came about.", "Sherman posted the following story on Facebook describing the inspiration behind the lyrics, \u201cA spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down,\u201d and a number of Snopes readers asked us to verify if this account was true. We learned it was.", "Robert Sherman himself described this moment in his autobiography \u201cMoose: Chapters From My Life.\u201d He and his brother were coming up with songs for Julie Andrews, the actor who would go on to embody Mary Poppins, but she was not a fan of their favorite number, \u201cThe Eyes of Love,\u201d which she thought was \u201ctoo sentimental.\u201d So the Sherman brothers were stumped and spent weeks working on a rewrite. Robert described one evening when he came home:", "Joyce and my three children, Laurie, Tracy and Jeff (Robbie had not yet been born) greeted me as I arrived. I asked the kids how their days had been. Joyce informed me:\n\u201cJody got the Salk Vaccine today.\u201d\nI looked down at my five year old son and asked him: \u201cDid it hurt?\u201d\nHe replied: \u201cNo. They just put it on a cube of sugar and we swallowed it down.\u201d\nAnd that was it! I realized at the moment that I had the spark of a winning song. I couldn\u2019t sleep all night. The lyric mulled around in my mind. The next day, at work, I showed up half an hour earlier than usual so that I could pop the idea on my brother. As he walked into our shared office, I must have spooked him a little. I don\u2019t think he expected me to be so plosive.\nI said: \u201cDick! A Spoonful of Sugar Helps the Medicine Go Down!\u201d", "The Salk vaccine for polio was developed in the early 1950s by Jonas Salk, and was first administered through needle injections. According to McGill University\u2019s Office for Science and Society, the oral polio vaccine received by Sherman\u2019s son was developed by Albert Sabin and introduced commercially in 1961, and it largely replaced the original injectable form of the vaccine.", "But sugar also helped reduce the pain from injectable vaccines. British pediatrician Paul Heaton found that a few drops of sucrose solution put on infants\u2019 tongues before an injection was capable of blocking the pain felt in their arms or bottoms from an injection.", "Update Dec. 21, 2020: Jeffrey Sherman reached out to us after we posted this article with a new tidbit for the story about the polio vaccine: \"My dad and uncle always mistook it as the \u201cSalk\u201d vaccine since that was the version of the polio vaccine (the injected one) that everyone had heard about back then. It was in fact the Sabin oral vaccine I received at school in a sugar cube, as you stated.\"", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
