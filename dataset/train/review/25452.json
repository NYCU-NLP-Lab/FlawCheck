["Photos have been circulating on social media in Kenya with the claim that the images show security officers stationed at the Lee Funeral Home in Nairobi on March 19, 2021. Some speculated that the heightened security indicated that a prominent official in Kenya had died.

His body was taken to the Lee Funeral Home.", "\u201cBREAKING NEWS: Military Takes Over Lee Funeral Home Ahead Of This Official Declaration\u201d, reads the caption of a Facebook post that has been shared over 70 times.

The photo is credited to Kevin Philips of TUKO.", "The second photo circulating with the false Facebook posts was also taken the same day at the funeral home when former president Moi died.

Ignore the rumors about Lee Funeral Home (sic)\u201d.
