["Throughout Donald Trump\u2019s presidency his Twitter profile has drawn lots of attention. Now, as he refuses to\u00a0acknowledge his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden, online jokesters are doctoring images to create fake Trump tweets suggesting he has acknowledged defeat.", "\u201cI was red\u2026 and you liked him cause he was blue.. then you touched me.. and i was a lilac sky.. but then you all decided that purple just wasn\u2019t for you,\u201d reads\u00a0an Instagram post containing what appears to be a\u00a0quote of a tweet from Trump.", "The post contains some obvious signs that the tweet is not authentic like the phrases it uses and the blue and red heart emojis.", "The screenshot of the fake tweet was shared Nov. 10 to Instagram, where it received thousands of likes. Absurd as this tweet may seem, some Instagram users questioned, and pleaded, for it to be real.", "\u201cWAS THIS A REAL TWEET AHAHHAHA,\u201d one wrote.", "\u201cPLEASE TELL ME THIS IS REAL PLEASE,\u201d commented another.", "To these commenters\u2019 disappointment, there is no evidence that the tweet is real and, instead, is an altered image that appears to have begun as satire.", "Fact check:Chart of job growth by president shows historic unemployment under Trump", "USA TODAY reached out to the Instagram user who shared the screenshot for comment.", "The statement closely mirrors the lyrics\u00a0of recording artist Halsey\u2019s 2015 song \u201cColors.\u201d\u00a0The song was a\u00a0single on Halsey's debut album \u201cBadlands.\u201d\u00a0 It rose to\u00a0No.\u00a023 on the Billboard\u00a0charts\u00a0in June 2016.", "\u201cYou were red, and you liked me because I was blue. But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky. Then you decided purple just wasn't for you,\u201d\u00a0Halsey sings on the record.", "On election night, just three days before Trump\u00a0purportedly tweeted her lyrics, Halsey criticized the president and his handling of the election on Twitter. In the weeks before the election, the pop star participated in a YouTube interview series with Bernie Sanders whom she endorsed for president in March.", "It\u2019s unlikely Trump would have tweeted the lyrics from\u00a0a well-known recording artist that has publicly opposed him and left no trace on the internet. The tweet\u2019s phrasing far too closely mirrors the popular song\u2019s lyrics to be a coincidence.", "Fact check:Election unlikely to be decided in the House, even if Trump refuses to concede", "@BhadDhad, the Twitter user who appears to have retweeted Trump, first posted the fake tweet. The image of Trump\u2019s tweet is timestamped 1:28 p.m. Nov. 7 and @BhadDhad tweeted the photo seven minutes prior to that at 1:21 p.m.", "\u201ci joke a lot so don't take anything i say seriously,\u201d reads @BhadDhad\u2019s bio.", "USA TODAY could not find the tweet anywhere on Trump's\u00a0Twitter profile, confirming suspicions that it was fake.", "The tweet doesn\u2019t appear in an\u00a0archived image\u00a0of the president\u2019s Twitter profile that was\u00a0taken 20 minutes after the fake tweet was timestamped. This indicates it\u2019s very unlikely Trump tweeted the passage and later deleted it.", "Fact check:Dominion voting machines didn't delete votes from Trump, switch them to Biden", "USA TODAY could find no evidence that President Donald Trump tweeted a political statement mirroring the lyrics to Halsey\u2019s hit song \u201cColors.\u201d\u00a0The Twitter profile that originally posted the image and statement's absurdity\u00a0indicate the doctored image began as a joke.
