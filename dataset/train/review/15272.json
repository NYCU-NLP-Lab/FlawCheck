This is what he\u2019s done to Newark,\" Lonegan said. \"So he\u2019s done using Newark as a stepping stone. Now he wants to go to Washington, D.C. and do exactly the same thing to the country.\"", "While Lonegan is correct that Newark has seen an increase in overall violent crime over the course of Booker\u2019s tenure, his statement is inaccurate and misleading, according to crime statistics compiled through the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program.", "Lonegan is wrong to say violent crime and murders have increased \"five years in a row,\" since there were decreases in some of those years. In addition, the numbers in three of the four violent crime categories in 2012 were below their levels from 2007, Booker\u2019s first full year in office.", "Lonegan spokesman Will Gattenby said the candidate was trying to make the point that violent crime in Newark has increased significantly since 2007.

In 2012, the only category higher than its respective 2007 figure was robberies.", "There were 1,976 robberies last year, marking a nearly 79 percent increase over the 1,104 in 2007.", "By comparison, the 95 murders in 2012 were almost 9 percent less than the 104 murders in 2007. In fact, since 2008, the number of yearly murders in Newark has never exceeded the 2007 level.", "In 2012, the numbers of forcible rapes and aggravated assaults were down from their 2007 levels by about 8 percent and roughly 4.7 percent, respectively.", "In a statement, Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the Booker campaign, said in part: \"Mr. Lonegan is again using statistics misleadingly.
