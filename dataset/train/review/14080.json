That's literally true. Republicans shouldn't follow suit on that. You shouldn't pander to people.\"", "A reader asked us to check whether there was any substance to Carlson\u2019s dig at Democrats.", "The basic events in Milwaukee", "On the Saturday before the election on Nov. 7, 2000, Connie Milstein, a long-time Democratic donor from New York, was in Milwaukee. Milstein and some colleagues went to the mission and offered to give anyone who was interested a ride to City Hall to pick up an absentee ballot. About two dozen men took up the offer and at some point, 10 of them were given a pack of cigarettes each.", "We don\u2019t know, however, if they were promised the cigarettes in advance or asked for a smoke afterwards and were treated to a full pack. And we don\u2019t know if the promise of cigarettes was in exchange for a vote.", "In Wisconsin, it\u2019s illegal to give a person anything worth more than $1 to induce them to vote. The cigarettes cost about $3.25 a pack. Republicans cried foul and pressed local prosecutors to file charges against Milstein.", "The Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s office was reluctant, if only because it might have cost thousands of dollars to bring the case to trial. Months later, after an investigation, Assistant District Attorney Kurt Benkley said he didn\u2019t think the evidence proved anyone was guilty.", "In May 2001, Milstein agreed to pay $5,000 in a civil forfeiture, a legal term that admitted no guilt and closed the case.

We did not hear back. We could find no other example of cigarettes being offered to voters.", "Why Newports?", "The oddest feature in Carlson\u2019s statement is he specifically named Newport cigarettes.", "Benkley, the assistant district attorney, said he has no idea where that came from because the brand of cigarette had nothing to do with the case.", "\"Those facts would never have come into the public domain,\" Benkley said. And he added, \"I don\u2019t recall the brand.\"", "Bottom line: The Newport brand appears to be an invention.", "Our ruling", "Carlson said that Democrats give Newports to the homeless to get them to the polls.", "Based on the evidence, Carlson is citing an isolated case where authorities were unable to prove that votes were traded for cigarettes, or that the cigarettes were an enticement.", "On one occasion in Milwaukee, as many as three Democrats gave rides to homeless men to City Hall to cast absentee ballots. At some point, they gave some of the men cigarettes.
