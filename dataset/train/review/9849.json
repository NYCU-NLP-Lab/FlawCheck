["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "For the past year or so, Exxon Mobil\u2019s tax payments, or lack thereof, have provided political fodder to politicians like Rep. Dennis Kucinich, a Cleveland Democrat \u00a0who maintain that U.S.corporations don\u2019t pay their fair share of taxes.\n\n\"Let\u2019s go into some facts here and talk about shared responsibility,\" Kucinich told FoxNews host Neil Cavuto in an interview on Aug. 6, 2011 that he conducted from Seattle, with the city\u2019s iconic Space Needle in the background. \"Listen to this: Exxon Mobil, $19 billion in profits in 2009, paid no federal income taxes, received a $156 million rebate.\"\n\nThe statement had a familiar ring to it, so PolitiFact Ohio checked it out.\n\nKucinich\u2019s claim is similar to one made last year by Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who asserted that Exxon Mobil booked $19 billion in profit for 2009, paid no taxes and got a $156 million refund from the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nPolitiFact ruled that claim False because Exxon paid many other types of tax that year, and also because it relied on statistics from the company\u2019s 2009 \"10-K\" form that may not reflect the company\u2019s actual tax payments. Officials from Exxon Mobil, as well as a University of North Carolina business school tax professor, said the figure on the form doesn\u2019t \u00a0refer to the actual income taxes that Exxon paid to the government, which is confidential. Exxon Mobil spokesmen told PolitiFact the company\u2019s \"U.S. income tax expense\" for 2009 was approximately $500 million. The company declined to provide documentation for that number.\n\nExxon Mobil\u2019s updated 2010 \"10-K/A\" form also lists \"- $156 million\" as the company\u2019\nU.S. income tax figure for 2009, as did the earlier form consulted by Sanders. But Exxon spokesmen Cynthia Bergman White and Ken Cohen reiterated it\u2019s not correct to interpret the negative figure as a $156 million refund. They said it merely reflects a tax credit Exxon obtained because of overpayments in previous years.\n\nIn a blog statement that Exxon Mobil released after filing its 2010 forms, Cohen said the company paid more than $9.8 billion in total taxes and duties to the U.S. government and its subdivisions that year, including more than $1.6 billion in income tax expenses. He said the 2009 numbers were taken out of context by the media and politicians.\n\nThe numbers \"reflected more than ExxonMobil\u2019s tax expense for 2009 activities,\" said Cohen. \"They included the effect of adjustments to our taxes for earlier years, which exceeded the amounts related to 2009. In fact, ExxonMobil\u2019s income tax expense related to 2009 activities was approximately $500 million.\"\n\nThat statement matches ExxonMobil\u2019s response to PolitiFact last December.\n\nKucinich spokesman Nathan White insisted his boss\u2019 claim is \"completely true\" and wasn\u2019t as sweeping as the previous Sanders claim that PolitiFact examined. Kucinich stipulated that Exxon paid no federal income taxes in 2009, while Sanders had said it paid no taxes at all that year.\n\nWhite pointed to a 2010 report from CNN Money, which also listed Exxon\u2019s 2009 federal tax bill as \"-$156 million\" even as it pointed out that the company paid heavy taxes in other countries, as well as sales taxes in the United States.\n\n\"You are comparing apples to oranges,\" White said in an email. \"The Politifact critique of Senator Sanders is irrelevant because the two statements are not the same.\"\n\nKucinich\u2019s words weren\u2019t identical to Sanders\u2019, but were they different \u00a0enough to warrant a different rating on the Truth-O-Meter? \u00a0\n\nAs University of North Carolina tax professor Douglas A. Shackleford told PolitiFact last year, the \"-156 million\" figure that Sanders interpreted as a rebate doesn\u2019t actually refer to the cash taxes that Exxon paid to the U.S. government. The $156 million number refers \"to the U.S portion of the current and deferred income tax expense.\"\n\n\"It is a (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) number, not a figure from their U.S. corporate tax return,\" Shackleford said. \"The actual income taxes paid by Exxon to the U.S. government is confidential information. It is not reported in their financial statements.\"\n\nWe contacted Shackleford again, who confirmed that the same rationale would apply to Kucinich\u2019s claim.\n\nThe amount of income tax that Exxon Mobil paid to the U.S. government in 2009 is confidential information that did not appear on the forms that Kucinich and Sanders relied upon to make their claims that the company paid no income taxes and got a rebate.\n\nExxonMobil says the \"- $156 million\" figure reflects holdover tax issues from previous years that showed up in paperwork for 2009, and that it\u2019s U.S. income tax expense for 2009 was approximately $500 million.\n\nA tax professor confirmed that interpreting that $-156 million as the ExxonMoblil\u2019s tax figure would be a misreading of the 10-K form.\n\nBased on that, we rate Kucinich\u2019s statement, as we did Sanders\u2019, as False.", "Video of FoxNews interview with Dennis Kucinich, August 6, 2011\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, 2009 Form 10-K for Exxon Mobil Corporation, \u00a0Feb. 26, 2010\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, 2010 Form 10-K/A for Exxon Mobil Corporation, \u00a0\u00a0February 28, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, Bernie Sanders says ExxonMobile paid no taxes in 2009, but that\u2019s inaccurate, December 10, 2010\n\nEmail interview with Kucinich spokesman Nathan White, August 10, 2011\n\nCNN Money, Tax bills for 5 corporate giants, April 16, 2010\n\nOral and email interview with Exxon Mobil spokeswoman Cynthia Bergman White, August 12, 2011\n\nExxonMobil Perspectives blog, Taking a look at our 10-K, February 25, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
