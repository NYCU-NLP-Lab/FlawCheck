Later, the figure had shot up to Rs 44,000 crore as the government decided to waive all crop loans of Rs 1 lakh in cooperative banks availed till July 1, 2018.", "PM Modi\u2019s claim that only 800 farmers have availed the farm loan waiver is outdated. The origin of this claim is a December 13, Times of India report in which it was reported that the Karnataka government has distributed the sum of Rs 44,000 cr mandated for farm loan waiver scheme to 800 farmers. It further stated,\u201cCooperation minister Bandeppa Kashempur told the legislative that only about 800 farmers have availed the benefits of the scheme announced, by the CM on July 5.\u201d", "Since then, there have been multiple reports which illustrate the progress in the disbursement of loan waiver by the Karnataka government.

Although, the loan limit was capped at Rs 2 lakh per each family what is being waived now is an initial Rs 50,000 per loan.", "An article by The Mint on December 27, 2018 presented the updated figures of the farm loan waiver disbursement that matched the figures as reported by NDTV.", "A report published by The Hindu on December 28 stated that So far, about 70,000 farmers specifically in the cooperative sector have availed benefited from the scheme and the total waiver was pegged around Rs 348 crore.", "In conclusion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s claim that so far only 800 farmers have been benefited by the loan waiver promised by the Karnataka government is false.
