["About this rating", "A fabricated story about Philippines Vice President Leonor \"Leni\" Robredo being barred from traveling to the U.S. illustrates how fake sites are proliferating in countries outside the U.S. The story was originally published on 19 March 2017 on \"Al Jazeera Channel,\" a knockoff of the actual Al Jazeera news outlet. It was later reprinted nearly verbatim on another web site, PinoyTribune.com:", "U.S department of States has announced travel sanction against the Philippines Vice president, Leni Robredo for her continued effort to destabilize the government. Leni, who resigned from Presidents Duterte cabinet last year citing political frustrations has been banned from entering the United States for unspecified period of time, State department noted.", "The story hinges on tensions between Vice President Robredo and President Rodrigo Duterte.

Gary Alejano of the Magdalo Party.", "In July 2016, Robredo accepted Duterte's offer to head the national Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council, a Cabinet-level position.

Hence, I am tendering my resignation from the Cabinet on Monday, December 5, 2016. With this resignation, you can expect that I will continue to support the positive initiatives of this administration and oppose those that are inimical to the people\u2019s interest.", "Later that month, Duterte said he barred her from Cabinet meetings because she had joined rallies calling for him to leave office. The two did sit together while attending the Philippine National Police Academy commencement ceremony in the Silang municipality on 24 March 2017.", "We have contacted Robredo's office seeking comment on both the fake story about the sanctions and the spread of fake news sites in her country.", "Placido, Dharel. \u00a0 \u00a0\"Duterte: Robredo Not\u00a0Involved in Destabilization.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ABS-CBN. \u00a0 \u00a013 March 2017.", "Corrales, Nestor. \u00a0 \"Palace Links Robredo to Impeachment Try vs Duterte.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Inquirer.net. \u00a0 \u00a024 March 2017.", "Philippine Star. \u00a0 \u00a0\"First Impeachment Complaint vs Duterte Filed.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 16 March 2017.", "Romero, Alexis. \u00a0  \"Leni Kicked Out for Attending \u2018Ouster\u2019 Rallies \u2014 Duterte.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Philippine Star. \u00a0 30 December 2016.", "Salaverria, Leila B. \u00a0  \"When Digong Meets Leni.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Inquirer.net. \u00a0 24 March 2017.", "Arturo Garcia is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
