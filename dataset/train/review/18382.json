Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan, a Republican, said earlier this year that his conference wants to \"get rid of\" the program.", "Lawmakers were especially critical of Start-Up NY after the state spent $53 million in advertising to promote it between 2013 and 2015. The program created 408 net new jobs by the end of 2015 after launching\u00a0in January 2014.", "Is Kolb right that this year\u2019s budget also includes money to advertise Start-Up NY?", "Budget language", "The part of the budget Kolb referred to funds more than advertising for Start-Up NY.", "The bill sets aside $44.5 million to support the state\u2019s economic development initiatives, including Start-Up NY,\u00a0primarily through marketing and promotion.\u00a0It also pays for the state's effort to promote\u00a0New York state as a tourism destination and is also available to bolster some of the state\u2019s other economic development programs. The Global NY program, for example, connects businesses in New York state to international companies.", "Empire State Development, the state\u2019s economic development agency, has not spent money to advertise Start-Up NY for three years and has no plans to do so, said Jason Conwall, an agency spokesman.", "The funding line is a holdover from the 2014 budget, the first to earmark advertising money for the program. The same line has been included, almost verbatim, in each budget since.", "That\u2019s not uncommon in the state budget. The document spans thousands of pages and includes 10 bills that allocate more than $160 billion.

But state officials use the same pot of money to promote tourism and other programs in the state. While the bill may include language about where advertising money can be spent, if the agency chooses to advertise the program, nothing in the budget bill requires the Cuomo administration to spend money on Start-Up NY advertising.
