Kelli Ohara (sic) is the true face of real feminism.

She hands the trophy to Rapinoe and then drops the flag as she, Rapinoe and Morgan begin what looks like a choreographed move that ends with them throwing their hands in the air.

And here, we think words matter. While it\u2019s true that Long dropped the flag on the ground for a few seconds during the team\u2019s celebration, to say that players stomped on it suggests something more sinister than what took place.", "But more than that, it doesn\u2019t appear that anyone even stepped on the flag.
