["About this rating", "Though scientist Carl Sagan died in 1996, his work remained highly influential.\u00a0One quote in particular attributed to Sagan regularly showed up on share-centric social media sites: \"If it can be destroyed by the truth, it deserves to be destroyed by the truth.\"", "So popular is the phrase that it has appeared as a print available for purchase:", "However, we were unable to find any versions\u00a0of the quote published until mid-2013, long after Sagan's death.", "A frequently cited source for the attribution was the social literature site GoodReads, but we couldn't find the quote in any of his books.\u00a0Another prominent placement of the phrase involved\u00a0Sagan's Wikiquote page, under the \"misattributed\" section, which observed\u00a0that the quote was built on a similar phrase\u00a0in\u00a0fantasy author P.C. Hodgell's novel Seeker's Mask:", "That which can be destroyed by the truth, should be.", "Hodgell\u00a0commented on a\u00a0Reddit page\u00a0in February 2016, confirming\u00a0that the quote appeared in her novel, but that she didn't get it from Sagan:", "Hodgell here. \"That which can be destroyed by the truth should be\" appears in my 1994 novel Seeker's Mask. I first heard of the Sagan quote in 2013, more or less. No source that I've seen dates the latter. If it's not a case of misattribution, it's probably a matter of \"great minds\" etc.", "As Hodgell indicated, the quote didn't appear to exist in the Sagan-attributed form until mid-2013. (Hodgell's novel appeared in 1994.) The likeliest trajectory is one of the most common for misattributed quotes: the phrase was dormant for nearly two decades, and then reached socially viral status only when a slightly rewritten version was incorrectly attached to a beloved science celebrity.", "However, Sagan really did write the following on the topic of truth:", "One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we\u2019ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We\u2019re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It\u2019s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we\u2019ve been taken.
