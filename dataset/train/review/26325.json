["Since its global emergence over a year ago, the PCR test \u2013\u00a0a molecular test that diagnoses infection by detecting\u00a0genetic material\u00a0\u2013 has been used to\u00a0distinguish the COVID-19 positives from the negatives.

Yesterday, on the day of inauguration, the recommendations for PCR testing changed,\" writes Facebook user Maria Dawn Tyler on\u00a0Jan. 21.", "\"Now, a positive PCR test is NOT enough to confirm a positive case. You need a second test AND a clinical correlation, which means be symptomatic, and have a doctor tell you that you have covid based on your symptoms, for it to count as a positive case.\"", "Tyler goes on to claim this means asymptomatic individuals \u2013 those not showing or experiencing coronavirus symptoms\u00a0\u2013 will not be considered positive cases nor will people who only underwent one test.", "\"So hundreds of thousands of cases that have been documented now suddenly were not, in fact, positives and now will not count. It is amazing how low the numbers are going to be now,\" she concludes.", "That a single positive COVID-19 PCR test will no longer count toward new cases has been echoed elsewhere on social media. Some of the posts also cite\u00a0a now-deleted\u00a0Jan. 21 tweet by Newsmax contributor and urologist Dr. David Samadi discussing the World Health Organization's information notice.", "\"The World Health Organization has now released guidance to laboratories around the world to reduce the cycle count in PCR tests to get a more accurate representation of COVID cases,\" writes Samadi, claiming that the current PCR cycle being used \"was much too high and resulting in any particle being declared a positive case.\"", "USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook users for further comment.", "Fact check:Not likely that COVID-19 vaccine was cause of Hank Aaron's death", "PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, was conceived by\u00a0biochemist Kary Mullis, an employee of the now defunct Cetus Corp., in April 1983 as an answer to a problem facing scientists: How can DNA, particularly specific genes\u00a0or sections, be copied quickly and in vast amounts?", "To do that, Mullis exploited\u00a0the remarkable, and natural, function of enzymes called DNA polymerases, discovered by biochemist Arthur Kornberg and colleagues at Stanford University in the mid-1950s. DNA polymerases were like miniature Xerox copy machines, able to assemble DNA when given a template strand and nucleotides, the essential building blocks of DNA.", "During PCR, the DNA polymerase copies\u00a0the unfurled\u00a0helical structure, its two strands separated from each other by heat, with the help of molecules called DNA primers,\u00a0short genetic sequences that bind to sites of interest providing\u00a0a replication starting point for the enzyme.", "Unwinding and separating the DNA, binding of DNA primers and copying by DNA polymerase \u2013 also called denaturation, annealing and extension \u2013 occurs in a single cycle repeated on average 40 times, generating a tremendous 100 billion copies of the sought\u00a0after DNA segment.", "However, because COVID-19's genome is made of RNA, there is one prerequisite step: rewriting its genetic material into DNA using another enzyme called reverse transcriptase, commonly used to convert RNA-based viruses, like hepatitis C or influenza A, since its discovery in the 1970s.", "Fact check:Posts use 2012 photo of Magic Johnson to falsely claim he donated blood", "While its specificity and sensitivity make PCR a useful, and widely used, diagnostic tool, incorrect use can lead to misdiagnosis \u2013 the chief reason behind WHO's information notice.", "\"Since the beginning of 2020, WHO has received 10 reports of problems related to PCR tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, including some products listed for emergency use by WHO.
