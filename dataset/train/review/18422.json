For example, Breitbart.com reported:", "Joshua Witt, 26, was leaving his car to enter a Steak \u2019n Shake in Sheridan, Colorado, and claims his long-on-top, buzzed-on-the-sides haircut was the reason for the stabbing as a confused anti-fascist accused him of being a neo-Nazi.", "Fox News reported a similar story.
