No worries, he said.", "\"Because I\u2019m fast,\" he joked in a May 18 interview on NBC\u2019s Today. \"They can\u2019t catch me.\"", "This should be obvious: We are not saying that running is a Zika prevention method. (Here are some actual steps to take to avoid being bitten.)", "But we were curious whether Bolt really would outpace the mosquito. (People already have tried to figure out if Bolt can beat a cheetah. He can\u2019t.)", "To the stat sheet!", "Bolt currently holds both the 100 meter and 200 meter world records at 9.58 seconds and 19.19 seconds respectively. That corresponds to 23.35 miles per hour for the 100-meter dash, and 23.31 miles per hour for the 200-meter dash.", "Based on how he\u2019s performed in all past races listed by the International Association of Athletics Federations, Bolt\u2019s average speed is\u00a021.65 miles per hour.

Bolt runs short distances, while the mosquitoes are in it for the long haul. Researchers have documented lady aegypti flying continuously for two to nine hours, with an average of 2.2 hours. So Bolt, or really anyone, would have to run more than 7.37 miles in that time frame to outpace the mosquito.", "Kenya\u2019s Dennis Kimetto, Bolt\u2019s world record counterpart in the marathon world, ran 26.219 miles in 2 hours, 2 minutes and 57 seconds. He\u2019d leave the mosquito nearly 20 miles behind with that pace.", "Kimetto. (AP)", "Bolt and Kimetto would have a lot more to worry about if the Zika vector was a desert locust or earworm, which have respective average air speeds of 21 and 17 miles per hour.
