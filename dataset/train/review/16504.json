["North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest speaks during a debate with Gov. Roy Cooper on Oct. 14, 2020.", "Lt. Governor Dan Forest thinks he would be a better governor than Roy Cooper.", "But Cooper says Forest hasn\u2019t put in the work needed to hold the office. The two went at it on Oct. 14 in North Carolina\u2019s lone gubernatorial debate.", "\"The Lieutenant Governor is on the state board of education where the state opening plans are discussed and voted on. And while I\u2019m working with them and public health officials, he\u2019s missed almost half of the board of education meetings during the pandemic,\" Cooper said.", "Forest responded by saying \"I\u2019ve been to almost every one of those meetings, especially every voting meeting. My staff sits in. My education experts and advisors sit in on all of those meetings, we don\u2019t miss a beat on an education meeting. We never have. We\u2019ve always been present at all of them.\"", "So what\u2019s the truth here?", "We\u2019ll rate Cooper\u2019s statement, since he\u2019s the one bringing up the subject as an attack.", "He said Forest has missed almost half of North Carolina\u2019s education board meetings during the pandemic.", "As it turns out, Cooper\u2019s claim is almost spot-on.", "The Board of Education has not uploaded its meeting minutes since March. So we listened to audio files uploaded to YouTube. Then we asked the North Carolina Department of Instruction for attendance records.", "Cooper declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus on March 10, so we\u2019re using that as the start date for the pandemic in North Carolina.", "There have been 28 meetings since then, according to Deanna Townsend-Smith, DPI\u2019s director of board operations and policy. Most of them were over an hour long, meaning the board has spent well over 24 hours talking about education policy just in the last eight months.", "Forest has missed 13 of the 28 meetings, or 46%.", "Forest missed meetings on March 18 and 27. He attended five meetings in a row before missing seven out of 10 from the beginning of May to the end of July. He then missed four in a row between Sept. 3 and Oct. 7.", "In some cases, Forest arrived late to meetings but was still counted present.", "\"Present does not always mean attendance for the entire meeting, but present at some point and time,\" Townsend-Smith said.", "It\u2019s unclear why Forest missed the meetings. Neither his office nor his campaign responded to questions from PolitiFact this week.", "Forest said during the debate that his experts and advisors \"sit in on all\" of the meetings.", "Staff members can\u2019t vote. And Townsend-Smith told PolitiFact that board members \"cannot have anyone attend the meeting on their behalf.\"", "Forest \"may have had someone listening to the meeting on his behalf,\" she said, adding \"however that is not something that is within my purview and you would need to verify that with the LG\u2019s office.\"", "Forest has downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, saying the state should reopen schools without a mask mandate. DPI\u2019s records show Forest missed votes that made changes to grading, testing and graduation requirements, set guidelines for remote learning, as well as another vote on grade point averages.", "Cooper said Forest has \"missed almost half of the board of education meetings during the pandemic.\"", "We\u2019re not here to say whether or not Forest should have attended the meetings. However, we can say whether Cooper\u2019s stat is correct.", "The state Department of Instruction says Forest has missed 13 of 28 meetings since the pandemic started. That means he\u2019s missed 46% of the meetings.", "That\u2019s close enough to \"half\" for us. We rate Cooper\u2019s claim is True.", "Story and video, \"Pandemic dominates debate between Cooper, Forest,\" posted Oct. 14, 2020.", "Meeting minutes posted on the NC State Board of Education website.", "YouTube playlist of North Carolina State Board of Education meeting audio.", "Email correspondence with Deanna Townsend-Smith, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction\u2019s director of board operations and policy.", "Story by the Washington Post, \"NC lieutenant governor: Reopen schools without mask mandate,\" posted on Sept. 16, 2020.", "Story by WRAL, \"State OKs major changes to grading, graduation requirements due to coronavirus,\" posted March 27, 2020.", "Story by WBTV, \"NC State Board sets requirements for 2020-21 remote instruction plans,\" posted May 21, 2020.", "Story by the News & Observer, \"Some NC students sought regular grades to improve GPAs. But state rejects that option,\" posted May 7, 2020.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
