The chemical composition of water is H2O (hydrogen and oxygen). These are mixed in the combustion chamber and ignited, which results in extremely high-temperature steam (6000 degree F) coming out of the nozzle at a very high rate and pressure. That steam rises in the atmosphere, creating a steam cloud that cools off and turns back into water and rains depending on the temperature and humidity at the time of the test. There is also water flowing in the flame deflector which also mixes in the cloud. The steam released during a test is water and does not pollute the atmosphere.\u201d", "The first five seconds of footage in the misleading posts has been captured from this video published on NASA's official YouTube channel on October 19, 2017.
