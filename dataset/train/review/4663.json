["On November 9-10, Eid Milad-un-Nabi was celebrated in Kashmir\u2019s Hazratbal shrine to observe the birth of Prophet Muhammed. According to a report in The Hindu by Kashmiri journalist Peerzada Ashiq, \u201cAll entry points to the mosque, including Habak area on the outskirts of the city and the Rainawari and Sadrabal areas in the old city, were closed for traffic. The security forces started spreading concertina wires on the streets and used mobile bunkers to block several stretches on Saturday as part of an exercise to impose restrictions.\u201d", "A resident attending the prayers since 1990 told the media outlet, \u201cIt is the first time in my living memory that such a thin attendance of worshippers was observed on the auspicious occasion in Kashmir. Only locals living in nearby areas turned up for the night-long prayers\u2026\u201d", "Similar news emerged from other media outlets, including PTI which said, \u201cAuthorities on Sunday sealed all roads leading to the Hazratbal Shrine here as a precautionary measure to maintain law and order in view of the Supreme Court ruling in the Ayodhya case and Eid-Milad-un-Nabi, officials said.\u201d Local reports carried similar accounts of restrictions imposed to prevent large gatherings.", "However, a section of the media circulated a video to counter the claim of restrictions. Among the firsts was Republic TV\u2019s Aditya Raj Kaul who asserted that thousands had gathered in the occasion.", "Soon after, the same clip was shared by Ashish Singh of ABP News, journalist Aarti Tikoo Singh and Doordarshan.

Photojournalist Sheikh Yamin put the strength of the gathering at around 400-500 people at 2:30 PM, which according to him was the peak time. \u201cThe gathering is usually in thousands but very few people came because of the blockade. Most people who turned up hailed from surrounding areas. The security personnel stopped vehicles, people on foot were able to enter,\u201d Yamin added.", "Yamin shared visuals from the day which show a scattered gathering among security personnel. From 1:03 in the video below, some devotees can be seen offering prayers.", "If one were to compare publicly available photographs from November 10, 2019, with those of celebrations in Hazratbal in past years, the massive difference in the strength of the gathering is evident.

Very few people had turned up in the morning. When photographers went at 1 PM, a few people from neighbouring areas had turned up. There were no restrictions on offering prayers however because of the blockade many were unable to come.\u201d", "The relic is displayed not only on the occasion of Eid Milad but also on Mehraj-ul-Alam, which is believed to be the night when the Prophet Muhammad ascended to the highest levels of Heavens.
