It adds that any official removed through impeachment remains fully subject to criminal prosecution,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThat provision would make no sense if the president could pardon himself.\u201d", "The authors of the op-ed also said they agreed with an Aug. 5, 1974, memo written by Mary C. Lawton, who at the time was an acting assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel during the Watergate investigation. Lawton\u2019s memo, which was written four days before President Richard Nixon resigned from office, said:\u00a0\u201cUnder the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the President cannot pardon himself.\u201d", "Tribe and his co-authors argued that the Constitution allows the president \u201cto act essentially in the role of a judge of another person\u2019s criminal case, and to intervene on behalf of the defendant when the president determines that would be equitable.\u201d", "On the same day, Turley wrote that the president \u201cclearly\u201d has the power to pardon his family members and aides and could \u201cprobably\u201d pardon himself, but he advised against it.\u00a0\u201cIn the end, a pardon of Trump\u2019s allies and family \u2014 let alone himself \u2014 would destroy any legacy of Trump\u2019s and demean his office,\u201d Turley wrote.", "Like Sekulow, Turley said the issue of a self-pardon is legally unsettled.", "\u201cThe issue of whether a president can pardon himself is one of the unanswered questions of the Constitution; it has never happened in the history of our republic,\u201d Turley wrote. \u201cEven Nixon did not stoop to a self-pardon, although he did research it. Neither did Andrew Johnson or Bill Clinton, both of whom were impeached by the House but not removed from office by the Senate.\u201d", "So, while constitutional scholars agree that the president has the power to pardon others, there are some limits to that power, and the question of whether a president can pardon himself is an unresolved legal issue that remains in dispute.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
