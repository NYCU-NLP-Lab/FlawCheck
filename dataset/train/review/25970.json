The bill's most publicized feature was that the federal government would be sending $1,200 checks to every adult with an adjusted annual gross income of less than $75,000.", "While negotiations over CARES were underway, social media posts contended that members of Congress \u2014 or, more specifically, \"[House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi and the Democrats\" \u2014 were attempting to sneak a $25 million pay raise for themselves into the bill:", "However, neither the bill as passed, nor any previous version of it, included a $25 million pay raise for members of Congress. That misperception appeared to arise from a portion of the bill labeled \"HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\" which set aside $25 million for \"Salaries and Expenses\":", "HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES", "Salaries And Expenses", "For an additional amount for \u201cSalaries and Expenses\u201d, $25,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2021, except that $5,000,000 shall remain available until expended, to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally, to be allocated in accordance with a spend plan submitted to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives by the Chief Administrative Officer and approved by such Committee: Provided, That such amount is designated by the Congress as being for an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.", "As Evan Hollander, a communications director for the House Appropriations Committee, explained, these funds were not allocated to provide pay increases to House members: \u201cThe $25 million funding is to support the House\u2019s capability to telework, including for the purchase of equipment and improvements to the network,\u201d he said. The allocation also provides money to cover the cost of paying the staff of the House Child Care Center, food service contracts, paying the House sergeant-at-arms. \u201cNone of the funds will go to member salaries, which are paid directly from the Treasury pursuant to the Constitution,\u201d Hollander verified.", "The 27th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits any law from raising (or lowering) the salaries of members of Congress until after the next national election has taken place, so the House could only raise the pay of representatives elected in the November 2020 election or later (which, naturally, could include current House members who successfully sought reelection).", "116th Congress. \u00a0 \"H.R.748 - CARES Act\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 31 March 2020.", "Seitz, Amanda. \u00a0 \"Federal Rescue Package Doesn\u2019t Give \u00c7ongress Pay Raises.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Associated Press. \u00a0 26 March 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
