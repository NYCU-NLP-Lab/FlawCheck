["About this rating", "In July 2017, social media users shared videos and images of burning trees and melting streetlights, the purported results of a record-breaking heatwave in Kuwait during which temperatures soared to 62\u00b0 Celsius (143.6\u00b0 Fahrenheit).", "First of all, a 62\u00b0 Celsius day has never been recorded. The highest temperature on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization, was 56.7\u00b0C (134\u00b0F) on 10 July 1913 in Furnace Creek, California. The highest temperature in Kuwait, 54\u00b0C, was recorded in Mitrabah in July 2016.
