["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on October 18, 2018", "In two recent interviews, President Donald Trump said he is not convinced that climate change is due to human activity, and he suggested that any changes will reverse themselves \u2014 two ideas that lack scientific backing.", "He also claimed in a third interview that there are scientists \u201con both sides\u201d of climate change, despite published papers showing that the vast majority of climate scientists \u2014 as high as 97 percent \u2014 agree on the issue.", "Trump\u2019s first comments on climate change this week came during a CBS \u201c60 Minutes\u201d\u00a0interview on Oct. 14, when CBS\u2019 Lesley Stahl asked whether Trump still viewed climate change as a hoax.", "Stahl, Oct. 14: Do you still think that climate change is a hoax?", "Trump:\u00a0I think something\u2019s happening. Something\u2019s changing and it\u2019ll change back again. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hoax, I think there\u2019s probably a difference. But I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s man-made. I will say this. I don\u2019t wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don\u2019t wanna lose millions and millions of jobs. I don\u2019t wanna be put at a disadvantage.", "Stahl: I wish you could go to Greenland, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels.", "Trump:\u00a0And you don\u2019t know whether or not that would have happened with or without man. You don\u2019t know.", "Stahl: Well, your scientists, your scientists\u2013", "Trump:\u00a0No, we have\u2013", "Stahl: At NOAA and NASA\u2013", "Trump:\u00a0We have scientists that disagree with that.", "Stahl: You know, I\u2013 I was thinking what if he said, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve seen the hurricane situations, I\u2019ve changed my mind. There really is climate change.\u201d And I thought, \u201cWow, what an impact.\u201d", "Trump: Well\u2013 I\u2019m not denying.", "Stahl: What an impact that would make.", "Trump: I\u2019m not denying climate change. But it could very well go back. You know, we\u2019re talkin\u2019 about over a millions of years.", "The following day, the president repeated these ideas during a briefing about Hurricane Michael when asked by a reporter why he had changed his mind about climate change being a hoax.", "Trump, Oct. 15: There\u2019s no question. There is something there \u2014 man-made or not. \u00a0I mean, there\u2019s something there. And it\u2019s going to go, and it\u2019s going to go back and forth. But there is something there.", "Then, on Oct. 16, in an interview with the Associated Press, Trump once again said he agrees \u201cthe climate changes,\u201d but said that it \u201cgoes back and forth, back and forth.\u201d He said he was unwilling to \u201csacrifice the economic well-being of our country for something that nobody really knows,\u201d noting that \u201cyou have scientists on both sides of the issue.\u201d", "The president presents climate change as a phenomenon that naturally swings back and forth, arguing that it might reverse itself all on its own.", "Climate systems are complex and do have natural cycles and feedbacks. But these cycles are already accounted for when scientists evaluate what is happening as the Earth warms from increases in greenhouse gases.", "\u201cThere is no reason to believe the climate would swing back because something would have to push it back,\u201d said\u00a0Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University, in a phone interview. \u201cWe have changed things so much that we now overwhelm things like the ice age cycles.\u201d", "When scientists, such as those with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, model future climate changes, there are no scenarios in which the general warming trend decreases\u00a0by the year 2100.", "The IPCC makes future projections under different greenhouse gas concentrations and emissions, among other factors, in what it calls Representative Concentration Pathways, to show what we might expect given various levels of action on climate change.", "According to the IPCC\u2019s fifth assessment report, which was finalized in 2014, global surface temperatures are expected to rise by 0.3 to 1.7 degrees Celsius by the end of this century in even the most aggressive scenario, known as RCP 2.6. In this scenario, greenhouse gas emissions are severely limited, consistent with the goal of limiting temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. While this goal is thought to be technically feasible, it requires the participation of all countries.", "Taking no additional action on climate change is projected in the same report to result in a global temperature increase between that expected for the two most lax scenarios, which range from 1.4 to 3.1 and 2.6 to 4.8 degrees Celsius. Looking further out, warming continues after 2100 in all scenarios except for RCP 2.6, the most stringent one.", "\u201cAll the scientific evidence suggests that the changes humans are causing now will last for hundreds or thousands of years, so long enough that we will have to move cities and infrastructure,\u201d Natalie Mahowald, a climate scientist at Cornell University, and a lead author of the IPCC\u2019s latest special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, told us in an email.", "On a very long timescale, the Earth might eventually cool after today\u2019s warming has taken effect and an ice age sets in. But Shindell explained that won\u2019t happen for at least thousands of years.", "\u201cThe CO2\u00a0going away will take thousands of years,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cand even then it\u2019d have to be driven by changes in earth-sun orbital alignment going in the right direction once the CO2 levels have declined.\u201d", "If that is the \u201cback and forth\u201d Trump has in mind, it will come too late to prevent the Earth from having to experience the ecosystem changes, extreme weather events, and rises in sea level that scientists expect from climate change in the near future.", "In both the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview and the briefing on Hurricane Michael, the president questioned whether climate change is caused by humans, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s man-made,\u201d and \u201cThere is something there \u2014 man-made or not.\u201d As we have written before, this is not an open question. Hundreds of scientists from across the world agree that climate change is driven by humans.", "In the latest IPCC assessment, the group was even more confident than in its previous report that human activity causes climate change, writing, \u201cIt is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG [greenhouse gas] concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.\u201d The IPCC defines \u201cextremely likely\u201d as between 95 percent to 100 percent probability.", "The U.S. Global Change Research Program\u2019s\u00a02017 Climate Science Special Report comes to the same determination. The program\u2019s website explains that the \u201cassessment concludes, based on extensive evidence, that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\u201d It adds, \u201cFor the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.\u201d", "In the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Trump also responded to Stahl\u2019s example of ice chunks falling off of Greenland and raising the sea level by saying, \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know whether or not that would have happened with or without man. You don\u2019t know.\u201d", "Trump is right \u2014 but only to a point. It is impossible to tie any particular ice chunk to climate change and human activity. \u201cAny individual chunk of ice, we don\u2019t know if that particular bit of frozen water would have fallen off without climate change,\u201d said Drew Shindell, the Duke climate scientist. But, he said, Trump is correct only in the narrowest sense.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re quite sure that the observations of the accelerated Greenland-wide loss are related to climate change,\u201d he said.", "Trump has questioned the status of glaciers, or what he called \u201cice caps,\u201d before, and as we\u2019ve explained, satellite imagery shows that Greenland has been losing mass since at least 2002, with increases in that rate since 2009.", "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration estimates that for the last 15 or so years, Greenland has lost a whopping 286 gigatonnes of ice per year, and this has led to a 0.8 millimeter rise in the global sea level each year. Some of the ice loss is from iceberg calving, which is when ice breaks off from the edge of a glacier, and is likely what Stahl had in mind, and some is from surface melting.", "The fifth IPCC assessment also concluded that human activity likely was behind ice loss and that it is connected to sea level rise.", "\u201cGlaciers have lost mass and contributed to sea level rise throughout the 20th century,\u201d the report reads. \u201cThe rate of ice mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet has very likely substantially increased over the period 1992 to 2011, resulting in a larger mass loss over 2002 to 2011 than over 1992 to 2011.\u201d The report adds, \u201cAnthropogenic influences likely contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993.\u201d", "Even in the specific case of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet, the president\u2019s skepticism about climate change being man-made is misleading and does not reflect what is known by scientists.", "In the AP interview, Trump repeatedly claimed that scientists do not agree about climate change, saying, \u201cyou have scientists on both sides of the issue.\u201d", "The president made a similar statement two days before, when he said that \u201cwe have scientists that disagree\u201d in response to Stahl challenging him on his remark about Greenland, when she brought up \u201cyour scientists\u201d at NASA and the\u00a0National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.", "It is unclear from the president\u2019s comments whether he was saying that NOAA and NASA scientists disagree, and the White House did not respond to our request for clarification or for help identifying these scientists.", "But both the NOAA and NASA websites clearly support the scientific consensus that climate change is happening and is primarily caused by human activity, and these agencies are behind important climate change\u00a0research projects in Greenland. NASA notes that studies have shown that \u201c97 percent or more\u201d of actively publishing climate scientists are in agreement \u2014 studies we have discussed\u00a0before.", "\u201cThere are very few climate scientists today who are skeptical of climate change, and their arguments tend to be rather weak,\u201d said Mahowald, the Cornell climate scientist. \u201cThey argue that the models are not accurate enough, and that the feedbacks will reduce the impact. But they can\u2019t explain the trends.\u201d", "Mahowald said the IPCC\u2019s results, which represent the scientific consensus, are carefully put together by many scientists after assessing the scientific literature, and are accepted by governments, including the United States, in approval sessions.", "\u201cAny results that are scientifically controversial do not make it into the reports,\u201d she said. As a result, rather than exaggerating the impact or importance of climate change, she said the reports \u201ctend to be rather conservative.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
