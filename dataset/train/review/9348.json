["In November 2013, a\u00a0list\u00a0of 16 claims about South Africa under the African National Congress - all of them negative - began doing the rounds on Facebook. Within days the list had attracted more than 2,000 comments, been \u201cliked\u201d 1,600 times and had been shared on the Facebook pages of more than 12,000 people.The list appears to be a shortened version of a blog post published on 8 May 2013 which derisively referred to the\u00a0\u201cthe ANC\u2019s list of achievements\u201d.A version of the list also appears to have been circulated via email. In August 2013, Business Day\u00a0reported\u00a0that a Democratic Alliance councillor in South Africa\u2019s Eastern Cape province, Stanford Slabbert, had been expelled from the party after forwarding an \u201coffensive and racist\" email that included some of the claims contained in the blog post.So what are the facts? Is there any truth to the claims?
