They\u2019re going to try to label me, someone who\u2019s been a small-town supervisor, who has kept a balanced budget, who has increased surpluses, who has led us to the highest credit rating our town has ever had, who is an Eagle Scout, who is a father and a husband and a dad, that I\u2019m some type of radical because I have a D next to my name. When is this game of party affiliation going to end?\"", "We decided to evaluate the claims he made about his tenure as Grand Island supervisor.
