In fact, she\u2019s skeptical that pieces of the plane exist at all.", "On Facebook, Mayfield recently posted a link to an obscure website promoting the idea that the towers in New York City may have fallen on Sept. 11, 2001, for some reason other than being struck by airplanes.", "\"I am still waiting for someone to produce pieces of the alleged plane that opened the doors for US Citizens to loose all privacy rights (from the conspiracy theorist in me),\" she posted.", "Mayfield later apologized for posting comments that caused \"hurt and pain,\" but has declined to acknowledge that planes were responsible for the collapse of the Twin Towers.", "She appeared on the WCNC show \"Flashpoint\" to discuss the post.
