["It is approaching a year since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic,\u00a0and on Dec. 8, Britain was the first Western country to begin vaccination against the virus. The rollout was followed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's emergency authorization of Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 11 and Moderna's on Dec. 18.", "Given the quick scientific\u00a0response to the\u00a0newly emerging\u00a0virus, one Instagram post is calling foul, questioning why vaccines for equally debilitating diseases, predating the pandemic, have not yet been developed.", "The Nov. 30 Instagram post\u00a0from\u00a0author Boyce Watkins shares a screenshot of a Facebook comment alleging countless years of research effort have yielded no vaccine.", "\"40 years worth of research...no vaccine for HIV (sic) At least 100 years research...no vaccine for cancer (sic) Ongoing research...no vaccine for the common cold (sic) Less than a year for a covid (sic) vaccine? Thanks but a hard pass on that shot...\" claims \"Lee Morin\" in the comment.", "\"This does make you wonder: How did you come up with this so fast, but you can't vaccinate against viruses that have been harming people for centuries?\" asks Watkins.\u00a0The post has received over 13,800 likes and comments agreeing with Watkins' charge.", "\"Come on. You have 7 BILLION customers. No other virus/cancer/ailment has that many customer. Follow the money,\" writes Instagram user borzirtc.", "Other social media users have posted the same or a similar claim, as recently as Jan. 13.", "USA TODAY has reached out to those who posted the claim for further comment.", "More:Fact check: COVID-19 outbreak at NY nursing home started before vaccinations", "Operation Warp Speed, the private-public partnership initiated by the White House during the pandemic, may give the impression the COVID-19 vaccine developed overnight, but in actuality, it depends on research dating\u00a0back nearly 100 years.", "Coronaviruses were first encountered in April 1930, when a strange respiratory disease ravaged\u00a0poultry farms across North Dakota and Minnesota, killing tens of thousands of baby birds, The Scientist reports. Unsure of what exactly this illness was, veterinarians Arthur Schalk and Merle Hawn of North Dakota Agricultural College, now North Dakota State University, called it \"infectious bronchitis of baby chicks,\" the viral agent later named infectious bronchitis virus.", "Further scientific research into IBV and recognition that it was not like influenza A, a flu virus known to cause\u00a0bronchitis, would transpire over the next 30 years. In November 1968, a group of scientists wrote to the journal Nature asking for IBV, and viruses resembling it like mouse hepatitis virus discovered in 1947, to be classified as coronaviruses, a name derived from its appearance \u2013 the spike\u00a0proteins casting\u00a0a halo around the surface, much like the sun's corona \u2013 on electron microscope\u00a0imaging.", "More:Fact check: Pregnant women do receive vaccines, but more study needed on COVID-19 shot", "While coronaviruses could cause a variety of fatal diseases in animals, the two known to infect humans were not a grave concern, as they only caused\u00a0the common cold. This belief was challenged in November 2002 with the emergence of a new respiratory illness in Guandong Province, China, that would infect over 8,000 people worldwide and claim 774 lives.", "In less than a month, researchers decoded the enormous genome of the new virus, which caused a\u00a0disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome.\u00a0Researchers concluded it was a coronavirus, likely to have jumped from animals to humans because it was only somewhat related to other known coronaviruses. (It took over 15 years of search to identify bats as the potential animal source.)\u00a0By July 2003, thanks to isolating and quarantining patients, the World Health Organization declared SARS officially contained.", "Nevertheless, fears of future seasonal SARS outbreaks called for a vaccine. SARS-CoV's spike protein was an obvious choice for a target.\u00a0Prior research found the spike protein was critical\u00a0in determining which species a coronavirus infected, where it preferred\u00a0to hunker down \u2013 called organ or cell tropism \u2013 and disease severity. The spike protein had even been proposed as a vaccine target for canine coronavirus in 1991.", "More:Fact check: Vaccination helped eradicate smallpox", "A number of vaccines targeting the spike\u00a0protein were designed, tested in animal models and found to be quite promising against SARS and other coronavirus illnesses like Middle East respiratory syndrome,\u00a0which appeared in 2012. But further testing reached an impasse when funding declined steadily in the years following the 2003 outbreak, said Dr. Peter Hotez,\u00a0a vaccine scientist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, whose team collaborated with\u00a0Galveston National Laboratory to create a SARS vaccine\u00a0in 2016.", "\"We manufactured a really great SARS 1 vaccine in the lab. We actually had a manufacturer at Walter Reed, but then we couldn't raise the money to do all the clinical testing,\" he told USA TODAY.", "Funding was not the only issue. Testing whether a vaccine can prevent disease requires the disease to still be around. Since there have been no major outbreaks of SARS since 2003, testing vaccine efficacy was difficult. But more instrumental is interest: Few\u00a0SARS or MERS cases meant pharmaceutical companies were less inclined to invest in a likely rarely used vaccine.", "More:Fact check: Doctors say Hilary Duff likely didn't contract pink eye from COVID-19 tests", "Typically, the road to creating new vaccines is long, with many steps:\u00a0Finding and developing a vaccine target (exploratory), testing it in tissue or cell cultures and animal models (preclinical) followed by three phases of clinical trials with human volunteers.", "If a vaccine proves its mettle, its developers have to seek and gain approval from the FDA before manufacturing. Lastly,\u00a0in phase four, quality control monitors\u00a0for any possible vaccine side effects.", "For vaccines to be effective, a specific target\u00a0is needed. This vaccine target, also called an antigen, is\u00a0typically a fragment of the disease-causing agent\u00a0that instructs the immune system on how to recognize and destroy it upon contact. Searching for a suitable antigen can be an arduous process but prior coronavirus research made it all easier.", "\"When the Chinese put up the COVID-19 sequence on bioRxiv in January, our community of scientists looked at it and said, 'Yeah, we got this because we know how to do it.' It was all about plug and play based on all that\u00a0experience,\" said Hotez.", "Having a running start does not mean the testing process was accelerated, however. Hotez, whose recombinant protein\u00a0subunit COVID-19 vaccine is undergoing clinical trials in India, stated the vaccine still underwent testing among a large group of human volunteers, even more than a typical trial with over 30,000 to 60,000 people.", "What accelerated the vaccine process was manufacturing.", "\"The two accelerants are doing the manufacturing of risk (scaling up manufacturing based on the assumption the vaccine will work, also called at-risk manufacturing) and manufacturing the vaccine in parallel with clinical trials. That's new because we usually wait for the phase three results,\" he said.", "More:Fact check: The US saw more deaths in 2020 than in 2019, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic", "Human immunodeficiency virus, the culprit behind acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, commonly\u00a0known as\u00a0AIDS,\u00a0is a tricky virus. Much like the novel coronavirus, HIV binds to a protein on the surface of T cells,\u00a0a type of white blood cell, to enter.\u00a0Once inside, HIV integrates its genetic material with its host cell's DNA, using the host's DNA replication machinery to create new viruses, which blast off to infect and kill other T cells.", "Finding a specific and effective vaccine target is therefore difficult, especially since HIV mutates frequently in order to mask itself from the immune system. According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, common vaccine approaches using inactivated or live HIV forms\u00a0have either not been \"effective in eliciting immune responses in clinical trials\" or are too dangerous to use.", "The same goes for the common cold,\u00a0which is caused by a\u00a0smorgasbord of viruses including\u00a0over 150 different types of rhinovirus, a common troublemaker.", "\"It's hard to create a vaccine when you have so many different viruses causing similar symptoms. To make a universal vaccine against all of them is probably pretty daunting, it might be doable, but it's daunting,\" explained Hotez.", "More:Fact check: Biden said he plans to increase COVID-19 small business relief to people of color and women", "Cancer, abnormal growth of the body's own cells due to unchecked genetic mutations, is no virus, but the struggle in finding a suitable vaccine target is not any easier.", "\"The challenge is getting antigen targets and also access because a lot of the antigens, or cancer proteins, are first inside the cell. They may not be presented to the immune system so these are much more complicated targets,\" said Hotez.", "Advances\u00a0in messenger RNA-based vaccine technology in recent years may help fast-track\u00a0some cancer vaccines, he acknowledged. The platform, which provides the body the equivalent of a genetic assembly instruction booklet for manufacturing target-specific antibodies, has been used for rabies, influenza and Zika and is considered an attractive approach for its low cost, speed of manufacturing, potency and versatility, Nature reported.", "Many cancer vaccines using mRNA are in the works, like Moderna's personalized cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, which is being tested in patients with metastatic common epithelial cancer. The Boston-based pharmaceutical company also announced on Jan. 11 it was working on an mRNA HIV vaccine with phase I clinical trials expected sometime in 2021.", "We rate this claim MISSING CONTEXT\u00a0because without additional context it might be misleading. Vaccines require specific targets against which they train the immune system. COVID-19's spike protein was identified nearly 20 years ago as a potential vaccine target during the development of the SARS vaccine, following the 2003 SARS outbreak.\u00a0This has helped expedite the vaccine process, given that vaccine platform technologies\u00a0have advanced in recent years, as well. Another accelerant was the commercial-scale production of COVID-19 vaccine doses prior to FDA clearance, called at-risk manufacturing, when early results appeared promising. Finding suitable vaccine targets for HIV, cancer and the common cold has been more difficult in comparison as these diseases have either elusive or highly variable targets.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
