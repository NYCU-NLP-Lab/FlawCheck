["By Robert Farley", "Posted on January 11, 2019", "President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise that Mexico would pay for a border wall, now misleadingly claims he never meant that Mexico would \u201cwrite out a check\u201d to pay for it. His campaign at least twice laid out specific methods of direct payment.", "In March 2016, the campaign threatened to halt remittance payments from Mexicans working illegally in the U.S. to relatives back home as a way to compel Mexico to make \u201ca one-time payment of $5-10 billion\u201d for the wall. The campaign also proposed increasing visa fees on Mexicans coming to the U.S. as a means to pay for the wall.", "In 2015, the campaign released a position paper on immigration that said \u201cMexico must pay for the wall and, until they do, the United States will\u201d take specific steps, such as threatening to \u201cimpound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages.\u201d The campaign paper also suggested increased tariffs and fees on Mexico to raise money for the wall.", "And even in the early days of the Trump presidency, his administration was talking about more direct reimbursement for the wall through tariffs on imported Mexican goods.", "During the 2016 president campaign, Trump repeated over and over that Mexico would pay for the border wall.", "In recent weeks, Trump has claimed that Mexico is paying for the wall \u201cindirectly,\u201d through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed on Nov. 30. As we have written, that\u2019s a dubious claim.", "Trump repeated that claim when meeting with reporters before flying to the southern border on Jan. 10. He then went on to say that he never promised Mexico would \u201cwrite out a check\u201d to pay for the wall.", "Trump, Jan. 10: Just a couple of things because I know the fake news likes to say it. When during the campaign, I would say Mexico is going to pay for it.\u00a0 Obviously, I never said this, and I never meant they\u2019re gonna write out a check. I said they\u2019re gonna pay for it. They are. They are paying for it with the incredible deal we made called the United States Mexico and Canada USMCA deal.", "We couldn\u2019t find any instances in which Trump specifically called on Mexico to cut a check to pay for construction of a border wall. In campaign speeches, Trump was usually short on specifics about how exactly Mexico would pay. For example, in a campaign speech in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Oct. 30, 2016, Trump simply said Mexico will \u201cbe very happy to pay for the wall\u201d because \u201cwe have tremendous trade deficits with Mexico.\u201d", "Though Trump was vague on the point, his campaign at least twice laid out specific methods for direct payment.", "The Trump campaign issued a position paper\u00a0during the Republican primary outlining some of the ways Mexico might be forced to pay for the wall, including impounding remittances from Mexicans living and working in the U.S. illegally or via increased fees on border-crossing cards, NAFTA worker visas and at ports of entry to the U.S.", "Trump campaign position paper, 2015: Mexico must pay for the wall and, until they do, the United States will, among other things: impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages; increase fees on all temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats (and if necessary cancel them); increase fees on all border crossing cards \u2013 of which we issue about 1 million to Mexican nationals each year (a major source of visa overstays); increase fees on all NAFTA worker visas from Mexico (another major source of overstays); and increase fees at ports of entry to the United States from Mexico [Tariffs and foreign aid cuts are also options].", "On March 31, 2016, the Trump campaign sent a two-page memo to the Washington Post under the subject line, \u201cCompelling Mexico to Pay for the Wall.\u201d", "The memo outlined a plan to use \u2014 or threaten to use \u2014 the Patriot Act to compel financial institutions to \u201cdemand identity documents before opening accounts or conducting financial transactions.\u201d The idea was to stem the flow of remittances being sent from Mexicans living and working in the U.S. illegally to their families back home.", "The campaign estimated that Mexican nationals send $24 billion a year to people in Mexico and \u201cthe majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s an easy decision for Mexico,\u201d the memo states. \u201cMake a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year.\u201d", "That sure sounds equivalent to demanding Mexico cut a check.", "The memo to the Washington Post lays out a hypothetical three-day plan to coerce the Mexican government to pony up billions of dollars to pay for the wall.", "Trump campaign memo, March 31, 2016:\u00a0On day 1 promulgate a \u201cproposed rule\u201d (regulation) amending 31 CFR 130.121 to redefine applicable financial institutions to include money transfer companies like Western Union, and redefine \u201caccount\u201d to include wire transfers. Also include in the proposed rule a requirement that no alien may wire money outside of the United States unless the alien first provides a document establishing his lawful presence in the United States.", "On day 2 Mexico will immediately protest. They receive approximately $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens. It serves as de facto welfare for poor families in Mexico. There is no significant social safety net provided by the state in Mexico.", "On day 3 tell Mexico that if the Mexican government will contribute $__billion to the United States to pay for the wall, the Trump Administration will not promulgate the final rule, and the regulation will not go into effect.", "The memo goes on to talk about other ways to \u201ccompel Mexico to pay for the wall.\u201d Among them:", "Impounding or freezing remittance payments would likely be problematic. For starters, it might violate peoples\u2019 civil liberties, a point then-presidential candidate Jeb Bush made when pushing back against Trump\u2019s plan in August 2015. A Government Accountability Office report in 2016 also noted that officials from the largest money transmitters raised concerns that \u201casking for information from remittance senders about their legal immigration status in the United States\u201d would \u201clikely contribute to pushing remittances out of formal financial systems to less detectable methods.\u201d", "In the first month of Trump\u2019s presidency, then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump was mulling a 20 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico to pay for the wall.", "\u201cWe can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone,\u201d Spicer told reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan. 26, 2017. \u201cThat\u2019s really going to provide the funding. This is something that we\u2019ve been in close contact with both houses [of Congress] in moving forward and creating a plan.\u201d", "(The plan outlined by Spicer also might have been problematic, as the New York Times noted, because it \u201cwould violate the North American Free Trade Agreement and most likely the rules of the World Trade Organization.\u201d)", "Spicer later said that was just one option, and Reince Priebus, then the White House chief of staff, said there were \u201ca buffet of options\u201d under consideration.", "For its part, Mexican leaders have been adamant that Mexico will never pay for the wall.", "In a phone call with then-Mexican President Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Jan. 27, 2017 \u2014 according to a transcript obtained by the Washington Post \u2014 Trump said they were \u201cboth in a bit of a political bind\u201d with Trump saying Mexico would pay for the wall and Nieto saying Mexico would not. And so, Trump said, if reporters ask, \u201cWho is going to pay for the wall?\u201d they should both agree to say, \u201cWe will work it out.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s rhetoric took a turn in early 2018 when he told the Wall Street Journal that Mexico could pay for the wall \u201cindirectly\u201d if the U.S. makes a \u201cgood deal\u201d renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. \u201cSay I\u2019m going to take a small percentage of that money and it\u2019s going to go toward the wall,\u201d Trump said. \u201cGuess what? Mexico\u2019s paying.\u201d", "And that\u2019s\u00a0the position\u00a0Trump has taken ever since the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement was signed on Nov. 30 by the leaders of all three countries (though it still must be ratified by Congress). Just prior to flying to the Southwest border on Jan. 10, Trump told reporters that Mexico is \u201cpaying for the wall indirectly many, many times over by the really great trade deal we just made.\u201d", "But economists told us that while the new trade agreement is arguably a slightly more advantageous deal for the U.S. than NAFTA,\u00a0it won\u2019t generate enough additional federal revenues to pay for the border wall, and shouldn\u2019t be construed as Mexican payments, anyway.", "Although Trump has consistently insisted Mexico would pay for the wall, the details of how exactly that will happen have evolved over time.\u00a0And while Trump may not have specifically said Mexico would \u201cwrite out a check\u201d to pay for the wall, his campaign proposed ways to force Mexico through economic pressure to make a direct payment for the wall.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
