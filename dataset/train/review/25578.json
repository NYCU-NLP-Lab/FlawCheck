The capital gains tax is the main federal tax that the Internal Revenue Service imposes on real estate.", "For example, if you purchased a house for $250,000 and sold it for $300,000, your capital gain would be $50,000. However, the IRS typically lets sellers deduct up to $250,000 in capital gains if they\u2019re single and $500,000 if they\u2019re married and file joint tax returns, so you probably wouldn\u2019t owe anything.", "Biden has not proposed changing those exemptions.

That means Biden\u2019s proposal would not affect the vast majority of people \u2014\u00a08.5% of Americans make more than $200,000 annually.", "According to the Internal Revenue Service, the capital gains tax rate \"is no higher than 15% for most individuals.\"", "\"Some or all net capital gain may be taxed at 0% if your taxable income is less than $78,750,\" the agency says. \"A capital gain rate of 15% applies if your taxable income is $78,750 or more but less than $434,550 for single; $488,850 for married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er); $461,700 for head of household, or $244,425 for married filing separately.\"", "What does that look like in practice?

You decide to sell your house, which you purchased for $400,000. To your surprise, you get your full asking price of $700,000.", "RELATED: No, Joe Biden doesn\u2019t want to impose a federal tax on homes", "Your capital gain would be $300,000 on the home \u2014\u00a0several times higher than the nationwide average. Since your household\u2019s annual income is less than $1 million, Biden\u2019s proposed capital gains tax rate would not apply to you. And since you\u2019re married and file taxes jointly, you probably wouldn\u2019t owe the IRS capital gains taxes anyway.", "So in what real estate scenario would Biden\u2019s proposed capital gains tax rate kick in?", "First, your household would have to make more than $1 million per year. Then, if you\u2019re single, you\u2019d have to sell your house for at least a $250,000 profit.
