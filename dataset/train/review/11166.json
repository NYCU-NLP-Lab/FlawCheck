["\u201cIf Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins the election but cannot serve his full term, vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris would assume the role of president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would become vice president. LET THAT SINK IN,\u201d an October 9, 2020 Facebook post reads.", "Other examples of the claim can be found here and here.", "However, the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, which covers presidential succession, indicates that the posts are false.", "According to Section 1 and 2, a vice president becomes president if the latter dies, resigns or is removed from office. However, it says the appointment of a subsequent vice president must be approved by a majority vote in both the House and Senate.", "The Constitution does not specify who exactly should fill the position of vice president, Adam Winkler, Professor at UCLA School of Law specializing in constitutional law, told AFP.", "He said Pelosi could theoretically be chosen by Harris in that scenario, although it would be \u201chighly unlikely\u201d for Harris to \u201cpick a person of Pelosi\u2019s age to serve.\u201d", "\u201cUnder a federal law, the Speaker of the House is third in line for the presidency if both the president and the vice president are incapacitated, but that law does not provide that the Speaker of the House becomes the vice president in any circumstances,\u201d he said.", "This is also stated in the section of the United States Code entitled \u201cVacancy in Offices of Both President and Vice President; Offices Eligible to Act.\u201d", "\u201cIf, by reason of death, resignation, removal from office, inability, or failure to qualify, there is neither a President nor Vice President...then the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall, upon resignation as Speaker and as Representative in Congress, act as President,\u201d the text reads.", "The misleading claim gained in popularity after Pelosi proposed a commission to assess presidential capacity on October 9, 2020 -- a move that highlighted concerns about Donald Trump's health weeks before the election.", "The proposed bill would establish a 16-member bipartisan panel of medical experts and former executive branch officials. With Republicans controlling the Senate, it is however highly unlikely that the bill will become law.", "Pelosi pushed back criticism and insisted the commission was \u201cnot about President Trump,\u201d who had just returned to the White House after he was treated in hospital for Covid-19.", "Pelosi has been targeted by various misleading claims in the run-up to the US election on November 3.
