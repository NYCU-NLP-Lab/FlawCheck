Pritzker over the perennially fraught issue of lawmaker pay.", "Illinois Rising Action, a nonprofit launched in March by America Rising Squared, is out with an ad accusing Pritzker of putting the interests of politicians above those of working families during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "\"While voters were distracted, Pritzker gave huge pay raises to his politician buddies,\" a narrator says halfway through the 30-second spot, which includes boilerplate imagery of an envelope being passed across a table. The group has said it spent $1 million on the TV ad buy.", "The ad cites an article published in May by a news station based in Quincy, which claimed state lawmakers \"gave themselves an $1,800 pay raise\" by including a cost-of-living increase in the budget they approved for the new fiscal year, which began July 1.", "Leaders in the Democrat-controlled General Assembly, long vocal about refusing such raises, are adamant there is no raise on the books.

It\u2019s a move experts say could face similar legal challenges from dissenting lawmakers who feel entitled to their raises.", "Republican lawmakers are suspicious of this new tactic, which comes only a year after Pritzker signed a budget that gave legislators their first raise since 2008, hiking their base pay to more than $69,000. The governor defended that increase based on \"how hard these legislators are working.\"", "This year, Pritzker and the General Assembly have promised no such raises, a point Pritzker reiterates in a TV spot of his own responding to Illinois Rising Action\u2019s attack.", "So we asked Illinois Rising Action for their evidence that lawmakers are getting a raise this year thanks to Pritzker.", "Kayleen Carlson, the group\u2019s executive director, referred to yet another law, passed in 2014, that made lawmaker pay a \"continuing appropriation,\" which she argues makes the $0 appropriation for raises in the budget Pritzker signed an empty gesture.", "\"Since 2014, Illinois law automatically increases state lawmakers\u2019 pay through a \u2018continuing appropriation,\u2019\" Carlson wrote in an email. \"This means that legislators who want to foreclose a pay increase must pass a bill specifically to do so.\"", "Regardless, Democratic Comptroller Susana Mendoza, the official in charge of cutting the state\u2019s checks, promises there will be no raises this fiscal year.
