The comment was not aimed at the Republican party's overall performance in passing legislation.", "The president's comment was part of a response to a reporter's question asking if the Republicans' version of a health care bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), was dead. Trump responded by expressing his disappointment with Republicans:", "I\u2019ve been saying that -- Mike, I think you\u2019ll agree -- for a long time. Let Obamacare fail. It will be a lot easier. And I think we\u2019re probably in that position where we\u2019ll just let Obamacare fail. We\u2019re not going to own it. I\u2019m not going to own it. I can tell you, the Republicans are not going to own it. We\u2019ll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us, and they\u2019re going to say, \"How do we fix it? How do we fix it? Or how do we come up with a new plan?\"", "So we\u2019ll see what happens. There\u2019s some other things going on right now as we speak, but I am disappointed because, for so many years, I\u2019ve been hearing repeal and replace. I\u2019m sitting in the Oval Office, right next door, pen in hand, waiting to sign something, and I\u2019ll be waiting. And eventually we\u2019re going to get something done, and it\u2019s going to be very good.", "Republicans have been working to fulfill the President's campaign promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare since he took office, but on 17 July 2017 it became apparent they did not have the votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They have been unable to agree on and pass a replacement for the current health care system.", "The president's comments, along with the Fox News chyron, can be seen on the cable channel's web site here:", "Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com", "Fox News.\u00a0\"Trump: 'We'll Just Let ObamaCare Fail, I'm Not Gonna Own It.'\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a018 July 2017.", "White House Press Office.\u00a0\"Remarks by President Trump at Luncheon with Servicemembers.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a018 July 2017.", "Murray, Mark.\u00a0\"NBC News/WSJ Poll: Just 12% in Key Trump Counties Back GOP Health Care Effort.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0NBC News.\u00a018 July 2017.", "Kaplan, Thomas.\u00a0\"Health Care Overhaul Collapses as Two Republican Senators Defect.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The New York Times.\u00a017 July 2017.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
