Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, and the New York State Department of Economic Development issued a guidance on the term \"essential worker,\" and it listed several categories of worker who would not be covered under the categories used in the comptroller\u2019s report, including those working at airports, certain types of manufacturing enterprises, hardware stores, funeral homes, animal shelters, and banks.", "Notably, the comptroller report\u2019s \"frontline worker\" category includes only \"direct-service, mostly non-governmental employees,\" meaning that it doesn\u2019t count most types of public employees. As a result, the report does not take into account police officers, firefighters, and other first responders.", "So while Lukaske said that Gillibrand \"is using \u2018frontline\u2019 and \u2018essential\u2019 as synonymous, there is a discrepancy between the two terms, and an alternate definition could end up changing the demographic profile.", "That said, the comptroller\u2019s report provides one reasonable definition. So what does the report\u2019s analysis show?", "According to the comptroller\u2019s study, more than 53% of frontline workers are foreign-born, meaning they\u2019re immigrants. Of the sectors studied, building cleaning services employs the highest share of immigrants at 70%. It is followed by health care and food and drug store workers, both at 53%.", "Other studies have backed up the broader proposition that immigrants make up a significant portion of essential workers.", "The Center for Migration Studies of New York, a think tank on international migration, has estimated that 1.8 million immigrants in New York state work in jobs the state considers \"essential businesses.\" The think tank found that foreign-born workers make up 31.5% of workers in essential businesses in New York state, despite only representing 28% of the state\u2019s overall labor force. (It is logical that New York City\u2019s percentage would be higher, since immigrants represent a higher share of the population in the city than in the rest of the state.)", "Nationally, immigrants make up a \"sizable\" share of essential workers in the fight against the pandemic, said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for the Migration Policy Institute.", "The group estimates that 6 million immigrants are working frontline jobs in health care, food production, and transportation, and another 6 million immigrants work in industries such as food services and domestic household services.", "\"You can assume that an immigrant-rich area like New York City might have higher shares of immigrants than the U.S. average in particular occupations,\" she said.", "Meanwhile, U.S. Census Bureau data shows that immigrants represent about 45% of the total workforce in New York City. That\u2019s in line with Gillibrand\u2019s assertion, said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center.", "Gillibrand said that \"immigrants make up a majority of essential workers in places like New York City.\"", "This number is backed up by a New York City comptroller\u2019s office study that found that 53% of all \"frontline\" workers in the city are immigrants.
