The estimated number of people living in the state illegally ranges from 2 million to 3.1 million.", "A meme on Facebook falsely claims that California Attorney General Xavier Becerra \u201cbragged there are now 10 Million Illegal Aliens\u201d in the state and, as a result, California \u201cwill receive 13 extra seats in Congress\u201d by including them in 2020 census. Both of these claims are inaccurate.", "In August,\u00a0Becerra said on Twitter and in a press release that more than 10 million immigrants live in California; he did not say that they were living in the state illegally.", "Becerra made his remarks in response to a new federal rule that applies to immigrants legally seeking admission to the United States or adjustment of status while living in the United States. The new rule, which so far has been blocked in the federal courts, would allow the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to deny admission or adjustment of status to immigrants who are \u201clikely at any time to become a public charge\u201d \u2014 that is, someone who receives public assistance.", "\u201cThis rule would cause significant harm to California, which is home to over 10 million immigrants,\u201d Becerra said in an Aug. 27 press release. \u201cHalf of all children in California have a parent who is an immigrant.\u201d", "California\u2019s total population is about 39.6 million \u2014 meaning one in every four Californians are immigrants, not that they are living in the state illegally.", "In fact, the 10 million figure cited in the meme is nearly the total population of those estimated to be living illegally in the United States.", "There were 12 million immigrants living in the country illegally as of January 2015, according to\u00a0the most recent estimate from the Department of Homeland Security. Most recent estimates from two independent groups are similar: The Pew Research Center\u00a0estimates\u00a0the number at 10.5 million in 2017, and the Center for Migration Studies\u00a0says\u00a0there were 10.7 million people in 2017 living in the U.S. illegally.", "As for California, estimates for the number of residents living in the state illegally range from 2 million to 3.1 million.", "The Pew Research Center estimated the number was 2 million in 2017, down from 2.2 million in 2016, and the Department of Homeland Security says that it was around 2.9 million in 2015. Based on 2012-2016 data from the Census Bureau, the Migration Policy Institute concluded the undocumented population was 3.1 million.", "The meme also falsely claims that \u201cCalifornia will receive 13 extra seats in Congress by including 10 million illegal aliens in the 2020 US census.\u201d", "California has 55 seats in Congress \u2014 including 53 House seats. The number of House seats depends on the population count recorded by the decennial census, which does include \u201cundocumented residents.\u201d", "But, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, California didn\u2019t gain any House seats after the 2010 census \u2014 the number of representatives remained at 53 from 2000 to 2010 \u2014 and it appears unlikely to gain any in 2020.", "The Sacramento Bee reported that California could actually lose a seat in 2020, because of the slow growth in the state\u2019s population. \u201cRight now, the current numbers that are coming in look very much like California is on track to lose a seat,\u201d Eric McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, told the Sacramento Bee in May.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
