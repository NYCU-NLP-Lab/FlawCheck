The original shot clearly shows five people rather than two,\u00a0including a third officer wearing a reflective jacket attempting to restrain a man. These two were erased from\u00a0the digitally-altered image shared on Facebook.", "The event was reported by local media here and here in January 2017 \u2013 four years earlier than the false post.
