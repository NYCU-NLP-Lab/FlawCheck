["By Lori Robertson, D'Angelo Gore, Eugene Kiely and Rem Rieder", "Posted on September 18, 2020", "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden answered questions from the public in a CNN town hall, but he got some facts wrong and misled on others:", "The Sept. 17 town hall was held near Biden\u2019s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, at a drive-in theater to maximize social distancing.", "Biden claimed Trump could have prevented \u201call\u201d of the deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 if he \u201chad done his job,\u201d citing unspecified \u201cdata.\u201d We know of no such data or any research that would support that notion.", "Biden: And if president had done his job \u2014 had done his job from the beginning \u2014 all the people would still be alive. All the people \u2014 I\u2019m not making this up, just look at the data. Look at the data.", "The Biden campaign hasn\u2019t responded to our request for the \u201cdata\u201d Biden said supports his claim. But it\u2019s far-fetched to say any leader could have done something to prevent every single one of the more than 197,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the United States.", "We don\u2019t know what actions Biden believes the president could have taken to stop all deaths. But even if the U.S. had implemented incredibly strict travel limitations very early on, the body of research shows that could have delayed the spread of the virus but not contained it. We reviewed that research when Trump claimed that the travel restrictions he instituted on China had saved \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of lives. There\u2019s no support for that figure.", "And there\u2019s no support for the idea that a severe travel policy would have saved all lives, either.", "Saad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told us in April that previous studies of viruses with a reproduction number of 1.9 or higher, meaning the average number of other people one person infects, have shown the travel limitations have to be very strict to have an effect. Travel restrictions \u201ccan have an impact if you shut down 90% of all travel,\u201d Omer said. But, \u201ceven then, it delays it a little bit but it doesn\u2019t stop it.\u201d", "Even countries with much smaller outbreaks than the U.S. have had some deaths from COVID-19. Biden mentioned Canada in his town hall, saying, \u201cLast Friday, we had a thousand deaths, all of Canada had zero deaths.\u201d That\u2019s correct, according to figures from Worldometer. But Canada still has had deaths from COVID-19 \u2014 more than 9,000 deaths.", "Even the tiny European country of Liechtenstein \u2014 population 39,000 \u2014 has had one death among its 112 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University & Medicine\u2019s Coronavirus Resource Center.", "Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us in an email: \u201cThere is no data to make the claim that \u2018all the people would be alive.'\u201d.", "Riley said the president could have better mitigated the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cThe epidemic would have been under better control by now and many deaths could have been prevented had the President allowed organizations like the CDC do their work without his interference,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt can be clearly said the President\u2019s actions not only prevented control of the epidemic but even fueled the epidemic. That\u2019s what Biden should have said.\u201d", "Biden claimed the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, said wearing masks would save 100,000 lives from now until the beginning of next year. He didn\u2019t.", "\u201cHis own CDC director contradicted him recently,\u201d Biden\u00a0said\u00a0referring to Redfield, whom Trump\u00a0appointed\u00a0to lead the CDC in 2018. \u201cHe said, if in fact, you just wore this mask, nothing else, but this mask, you would save between now and January, another hundred thousand lives.\u201d", "That\u2019s a projection from the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation \u2014 not Redfield.", "On Sept. 3, IHME\u00a0said\u00a0its updated model projected there would be 410,000 U.S. deaths from COVID-19 at the end of 2020. IHME also said that 122,000 of those deaths could be prevented with increased mask use.", "In\u00a0congressional testimony\u00a0on Sept. 16, Redfield did tell senators that face masks \u201care the most important, powerful public health tool we have\u201d against COVID-19.", "\u201cI will continue to appeal for all Americans, all individuals in our country, to embrace these face coverings,\u201d he said. \u201cI have said it, if we did it for six, eight, 10, 12 weeks we would bring this pandemic under control. \u2026 We have clear scientific evidence they work and they are our best defense. I might even go so far as to say that this facemask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine.\u201d", "But Redfield didn\u2019t say \u201c100,000 lives\u201d could be saved by wearing masks.", "Biden misleadingly claimed Trump \u201csaid that no longer would we in fact provide masks for schools \u2026 because it was not a national emergency.\u201d The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it would stop this month reimbursing states for the costs of masks for schools, but the Department of Health and Human Services said it would provide up to 125 million cloth masks for schools.", "Biden: The president of the United States said that no longer would we in fact provide masks for schools \u2014 for schools \u2014 pay them to have the masks in school, because it was not a national emergency. What is he talking about? It\u2019s totally irrational.", "NPR reported on Sept. 1 that\u00a0Keith Turi, FEMA assistant administrator for recovery, told state and tribal emergency managers that FEMA would stop on Sept. 15 reimbursing states for cloth masks and other personal protective equipment for places that are deemed nonemergency locations \u2014 including schools.", "\u201cThe changes narrow what constitutes an \u2019emergency protective measure\u2019 and is thus eligible for FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance Program,\u201d NPR, which obtained a recording of the call, said.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean the federal government isn\u2019t providing any masks to schools. The same NPR story noted the HHS would provide up to 125 million masks to schools.", "HHS\u2019 Public Health Emergency webpage says: \u201cThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be providing up to 125 million cloth masks to states for distribution to schools. The Administration intends for these masks to support students, teachers, and staff in public and private schools reopening, with an emphasis on students who are low-income or otherwise with high needs and schools providing in-person instruction.\u201d", "NPR also said states may stock up on such protective equipment before the FEMA policy went into effect. \u201cThe FEMA policy is not retroactive, so it could lead to a swift stockpiling during the next two weeks as states rush to get purchases in under the wire,\u201d NPR reported.", "Biden appears to have exaggerated when he said, \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going \u2014 to not tell people what you\u2019ve been told, that this virus is incredibly contagious, seven times more contagious than the flu.\u201d", "Biden may have been referring to the\u00a0revelation\u00a0that Trump, while downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 to the public, had told journalist Bob Woodward in interviews that Trump knew the novel coronavirus was highly contagious and deadly.", "\u201cBob, it\u2019s so easily transmissible, you wouldn\u2019t even believe it,\u201d Trump told Woodward on April 13,\u00a0according to\u00a0an audio recording Woodward recently released.", "In an earlier conversation, on Feb. 7, Trump\u00a0told\u00a0Woodward the virus was more fatal than \u201ceven your strenuous flus.\u201d Trump said \u201cthis is deadly stuff,\u201d adding that it might be five times more lethal than the flu.", "But there\u2019s no indication that Trump said the virus was \u201cseven times more contagious than the flu.\u201d", "As\u00a0we wrote\u00a0in late January, an early\u00a0estimate\u00a0from the World Health Organization suggested that every infected person would spread SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to 1.4 to 2.5 people, on average. A team at Imperial College London\u00a0pegged\u00a0the basic reproductive number \u2014 the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual \u2014 at 2.6. A group at the University of Bern in Switzerland estimated the reproductive number, or R0, to be around 2.2, and Harvard University researchers\u00a0estimated\u00a0a figure between 2 and 3.1.", "The WHO\u00a0later said\u00a0in mid-March that the reproductive number, which reflects\u00a0potential\u00a0transmission, \u201cis understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza.\u201d", "Seasonal influenza has an R0 value\u00a0ranging\u00a0from around 1 to 2. That would mean SARS-CoV-2 is about two to three times more contagious.", "In response to a question about whether he supports \u201cthe continuation of fracking safely and with proper guidelines,\u201d Biden pivoted to\u00a0discuss\u00a0the creation of so-called green jobs.", "In doing so, he appeared to exaggerate the number of jobs that can be created by capping orphan oil and gas wells.\u00a0Orphan wells\u00a0are gas and oil operations that have been abandoned and there is no responsible party to pay for closing up the wells.", "Biden: We can provide for right now as you know, for thousands of uncapped wells because a lot of companies gone out of business, whether they\u2019re gas or oil facilities, we can put to work right away 250,000 people from iron workers and other disciplines, making union wages.", "We don\u2019t know where Biden got his figure of 250,000. He used the same number in a\u00a0climate change speech\u00a0three days earlier.", "A recent report by the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University\u00a0estimated\u00a0that a \u201csignificant federal program\u201d could potentially create \u201cas many as 120,000\u201d jobs \u2014 about half of what Biden said. That assumes plugging 500,000 wells at a cost of between $12 billion and $24 billion.", "The number of orphaned wells is significant, but not known.\u00a0The Columbia report said there are \u201c56,600 documented unplugged orphaned wells as of 2018,\u201d citing a report by the\u00a0Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multistate government entity. \u201cAddressing 500,000 wells would require state, tribal, and federal agencies to identify and prioritize hundreds of thousands of additional wells,\u201d the Columbia report said.", "Update, Sept. 19: Biden\u2019s\u00a0energy plan on his campaign website\u00a0also cites the 250,000 figure but includes \u201creclaiming abandoned coal, hardrock, and uranium mines,\u201d as well as \u201cplugging abandoned oil and natural gas wells\u201d for that amount of job creation.", "Biden\u00a0wrongly claimed\u00a0that \u201cwe now have a larger trade deficit \u2026 than we\u2019ve ever had with China.\u201d He would have been right two years ago, but that is no longer true.", "In fact, the trade deficit with China is less than it was in the last year of the Obama administration.", "It\u2019s true that the U.S. trade deficit with China in goods and services was a record $380 billion in nominal dollars in 2018,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The previous high was $337.3 billion in 2017 \u2014 roughly the same as it was in 2015 when Barack Obama was president and Biden was vice president.", "But the trade deficit fell last year to $308 billion \u2014 which is slightly below the $310 billion trade deficit in Obama\u2019s last year in office in 2016.", "And it continues to fall. The most recent 12 months on record (ending in June) shows a deficit of $273.3 billion \u2013 which is $37 billion, or 12%, less than what it was in 2016.", "Dan Ikenson, director of Cato\u2019s Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, attributed the declining trade deficits in large part to Trump\u2019s trade war with China, which began in 2018 and resulted in both countries imposing escalating trade tariffs on certain imports.", "Ikenson told us in an email that trade deficits, in general, are the result of \u201cmacroeconomic phenomena,\u201d not trade policy. But \u201ctariffs imposed on a particular country\u201d \u2014 such as China \u2014 can affect trade deficits with that country. The impact of the tariffs on the U.S. trade deficit with China \u201cwas profound in 2019,\u201d he said, and the U.S. trade imbalance with China has continued to fall in 2020 due to \u201cthe tariffs and the global economic contraction.\u201d", "Biden falsely claimed that Trump has never condemned the far right and white supremacists. He did, in the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.", "It is true, however, that Trump has done so rarely, and has far more frequently condemned violence on the left. The president\u00a0declined\u00a0to criticize Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old Trump supporter charged with killing two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, with an assault-style weapon.", "Biden:\u00a0I\u2019ve condemned every form of violence, no matter what the source is. No matter what the source is. The president is yet to condemn, as you\u2019ve probably noticed, the far-right and the white supremacist, and those guys walking around with the AK-47s and not doing a damn thing about them. \u2026 But folks, I\u2019m waiting for the day when he says I condemn all those white supremacy, I condemn those militia guys as much as I do every other organizational structure.", "As we have\u00a0written, after a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville on Aug. 12, 2017, in which one person was killed and others were injured, Trump\u00a0said, \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides. On many sides.\u201d", "But much of the press coverage focused on another remark Trump made, that there had been \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d in Charlottesville.", "So two days later, Trump issued a\u00a0statement\u00a0from the White House in which he specifically condemned the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists.", "Trump, Aug. 14, 2017: As I said on Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence. It has no place in America.", "And as I have said many times before: No matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.", "Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.", "According to\u00a0the journalist Bob Woodward in his book \u201cFear,\u201d Trump later told Rob Porter, a White House aide at the time who had urged him to make the second statement, \u201cThat was the biggest fucking mistake I\u2019ve made. You never make those concessions. You never apologize. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong in the first place. Why look weak?\u201d", "When given an opportunity to condemn the actions of the pro-Trump teenager who allegedly killed two protesters in Kenosha, Trump demurred.", "Reporter, Aug. 31: Are you going to condemn the actions of vigilantes like Kyle Rittenhouse?", "Trump: We\u2019re looking at all of it. And that was an interesting situation. You saw the same tape as I saw. And he was trying to get away from them, I guess; it looks like. And he fell, and then they very violently attacked him. And it was something that we\u2019re looking at right now and it\u2019s under investigation. But I guess he was in very big trouble. He would have been \u2014 I \u2014 he probably would have been killed.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org. We do not accept advertising.
