["There\u2019s a reason they don\u2019t call it Factbook.

It holds up population as the sole constant that justifies comparing these countries\u2019 gun policy and violence.", "Even though Honduras and Switzerland are No. 94 and No. 96 in the CIA\u2019s list of countries by population, this metric alone is not enough reason to compare the effect of different gun control laws in either country.", "There\u2019s really no point in comparing the challenges of Honduras, a lower middle-income country in Central America beleaguered by corruption and violence from the drug trade and gangs, to Switzerland, an affluent country nestled in western Europe.", "\"Of course, what you want to do is compare countries where everything else is the same, except for guns and gun laws, to see if guns and gun laws have any effect,\" said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard School of Public Health. \u00a0\"Switzerland and Honduras are not even close to being the same in many aspects of their society that will influence the levels of violence and homicide.\"", "The post ignores a litany of cultural, political and socioeconomic factors that play into gun violence, or a lack thereof.

This was significantly higher than the rates of neighboring El Salvador (41.2), which has reduced its homicide rate following a truce among gangs, the UN said in its 2013 Global Study on Homicide.", "The vast majority, more than 80 percent, of those homicides are linked to a firearm. Lethal shootings most often occur in urban centers and areas along the Atlantic coast and border regions, which suggests the violence is linked to drug trafficking patterns and gangs, according to a report on Honduras by the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss-based research project.", "Switzerland\u2019s homicide rate is among the lowest in the world, but the meme goes too far in saying it\u2019s the very lowest. By the UN and WHO measures, the most recent Swiss intentional homicide rate is 0.6 deaths per population.", "Several countries \u2014 including Japan and Singapore, which have very strict gun laws, as well as Iceland and Luxembourg \u2014 posted lower rates than Switzerland in either one or both of the UN and WHO data sets.", "Laws", "The post is wrong about the gun laws in each country.", "Honduras doesn\u2019t \"ban\" citizens from owning guns.", "The Small Arms Survey says the most popular gun in Honduras is the 9mm handgun, \"which can be legally purchased and owned\" \u2014 undermining the meme\u2019s claim that Hondurans are banned from owning guns. Because this weapon is banned in nearby Mexico, the UN has said the difference in laws fosters the exchange of illegal weapons between the countries.", "An analysis of gun laws in six Latin American countries by Insight Crime, a foundation that studies crime and policy in Central America, characterizes Honduras\u2019 regulations as \"light\" compared to the \"restrictive\" laws of Brazil and Mexico and \"moderate\" laws of Venezuela and Chile. Uruguay also has \"light\" gun control laws but an incredibly smaller homicide rate than Honduras of about 5.9 percent per 100,000 people. (It also has less organized crime.)", "The disparity in homicide rates and gun control laws showed \"gun legislation, on its own, means little in terms of gun violence,\" the Insight Crime analysis found.", "The gun culture in Switzerland is altogether different. The country boasts the third-highest firearm ownership per capita rate, trailing the top-ranked United States and Yemen.

Swiss law requires mandatory background checks on civilian handgun purchases and licenses for the concealed carry of weapons, and it bans automatic weapons.", "Our ruling", "The viral post aims to jolt readers with a counterintuitive implication: Gun laws can lead to deadly unintended consequences.", "But the post is flawed on many levels.
