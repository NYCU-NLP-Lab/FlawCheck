But a recent Facebook post acknowledging the occasion repeats an unfounded conspiracy theory about Clinton and her allies.", "\"Tomorrow is the four year anniversary of the release of the Podesta E-Mails which revealed that Hillary Clinton & pals are involved in sex trafficking children,\" the Oct. 6 post says.", "It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "There is no evidence to support the allegation that Clinton and Podesta were involved in sex-trafficking children, or that there\u2019s a child sex-trafficking ring.", "The claim stems from an email exchange about a fundraiser at Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington, D.C., in September 2008, when Barack Obama was seeking the presidential nomination. People started to peddle the baseless idea that Podesta\u2019s use of the word \"pizza\" was code for pedophilia, and that Comet Ping Pong had secret rooms where Clinton and confidantes kidnapped and imprisoned children to be sexually abused, tortured, or sacrificed for Satan. Believers started to refer to the conspiracy theory as Pizzagate.", "In November 2016, BuzzFeed News published a story investigating how the theory spread. Its origins don\u2019t inspire much confidence: a random Twitter account and an anonymous user in the online forum 4chan claimed that police sources said the Clintons were about to be brought down massive sex trafficking scandal. A conspiracy theorist who piggybacked on these claims and said evidence of a \"pedophile sex ring\" had emerged.", "The theory has spawned other misinformation. We\u2019ve looked into claims that the FBI confirmed evidence of a \"huge underground Clinton sex network,\" that Clinton was on trial for allegedly torturing and killing a 10-year-old girl on camera, that an explosion in Beirut over the summer was linked to human trafficking by Clinton \u2014\u00a0they\u2019re all false.", "Four years since Pizzagate became a well-known word, there is still not evidence to back up the idea that Clinton is sex-trafficking children.", "We rate this post Pants on Fire.", "Facebook post, Oct. 6, 2020", "WikiLeaks, The Podesta Emails, visited Oct. 7, 2020", "PolitiFact, It\u2019s True: WikiLeaks dumped Podesta emails after Trump video surfaced, Dec. 18, 2016", "PolitiFact, How Pizzagate went from fake news to a real problem for a D.C. business, Dec. 5, 2016", "BuzzFeed News, How the bizarre conspiracy theory behind \"Pizzagate\" was spread, Nov. 4, 2016", "PolitiFact, Evidence ridiculously thin for sensational underground Clinton sex network, Nov. 4, 2016", "PolitiFact, No, Hillary Clinton is not on trial for the murder of a 10-year-old girl, July 13, 2020", "PolitiFact, Pizzagate conspiracy theorists spread false claims about Beirut explosion, human trafficking, Aug. 7, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
