He falsely claimed Russia \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to help me at all,\u201d even if he had sought out the U.S. adversary for help.", "Trump, Oct. 14:\u00a0Do you really think I\u2019d call Russia to help me with an election? Give me a break. They wouldn\u2019t be able to help me at all. Call Russia. It\u2019s so ridiculous.", "The special counsel\u2019s investigation into the 2016 election is ongoing. But, contrary to the president\u2019s claim, there is evidence that\u00a0Russia helped Trump\u2019s election chances in multiple ways.", "In July, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u00a0filed an\u00a0indictment\u00a0against\u00a012 members of a Russian military intelligence agency known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff, or GRU.\u00a0The officers \u201cengaged in a sustained effort to hack into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee, and the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, and released that information on the internet under the names \u2018DCLeaks\u2019 and \u2018Guccifer 2.0\u2019, and through another entity,\u201d a Justice Department press release said.", "\u201cThe object of the conspiracy was to hack into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, steal documents from those computers, and stage releases of the stolen documents to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election,\u201d the indictment said.", "For example,\u00a0WikiLeaks, identified as \u201cOrganization 1\u2033 in the indictment,\u00a0released\u00a0Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails on Oct. 7 less than an hour after the Washington Post reported\u00a0that Trump once bragged about groping women.", "\u201cIn order to expand their interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Conspirators transferred many of the documents they stole from the DNC and the chairman of the Clinton Campaign to Organization 1,\u201d the indictment said. \u201cThe Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, discussed the release of the stolen documents and the timing of those releases with Organization 1 to heighten their impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\u201d", "In addition to the damaging releases of hacked emails, three Russian organizations and 13 Russian nationals were indicted\u00a0in February for their role in an extensive pro-Trump social media advertising campaign.", "The indictment alleges that the\u00a0Internet Research Agency, a Russian-based\u00a0online propaganda\u00a0company, oversaw the pro-Trump influence campaign, which was financed by\u00a0Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a man described as \u201cPutin\u2019s cook\u201d or \u201cPutin\u2019s chef,\u201d and his two companies, Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering.", "\u201cFrom at least April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation through false personas, began to produce, purchase, and post advertisements on U.S. social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton,\u201d according to the indictment, which referred to the Internet Research Agency as the \u201corganization.\u201d", "Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, told a Senate panel\u00a0last year that \u201capproximately 126 million people may have been served content from a Page associated with\u201d the Internet Research Agency. At the same hearing, Sean J. Edgett, Twitter\u2019s acting general counsel, said the company identified\u00a036,746 automated accounts, known as bots, that \u201cgenerated approximately 1.4 million automated, election-related Tweets, which collectively received approximately 288 million impressions.\u201d", "In addition, Internet Research Agency mobilized Trump supporters for political rallies, focusing on so-called \u201cpurple states like Colorado, Virginia & Florida,\u201d according to the indictment, quoting from documents, such as emails and private Facebook messages, obtained during the investigation. Trump, who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, captured the Electoral College votes and the election by narrowly winning in key swing, or \u201cpurple,\u201d states, such as\u00a0Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.", "In a Jan. 6, 2017,\u00a0report,\u00a0the\u00a0Office of the Director of National Intelligence\u00a0said \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016\u2033 to \u201cundermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency,\u201d as well as \u201chelp President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances.\u201d The report\u00a0\u201cdid not make an assessment of the impact that Russian\u00a0activities had on the outcomes of the 2016 election,\u201d because it \u201cdoes not analyze US political processes or US public opinion.\u201d", "As he has done in the past, Trump boasted about the relationship he has developed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The president said\u00a0Kim \u201cunderstands denuclearization and he\u2019s agreed to it.\u201d", "That\u2019s not quite accurate. Trump and Kim issued a joint statement\u00a0in June saying that North Korea will \u201cwork toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d but they have yet to come to an agreement\u00a0on the terms of a denuclearization plan.", "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t wanna go to war, and we don\u2019t wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he\u2019s agreed to it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you see that, he\u2019s agreed to it. No missiles.\u201d", "When Stahl pressed Trump, asking if North Korea \u201cmay actually be building more missiles,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cWell, nobody really knows.\u201d", "Stahl: But is it true that they haven\u2019t gotten rid of a single weapon, and they may actually be building more missiles-", "Trump: They want to\u2013", "Stahl: With nuclear\u2013", "Trump: And I will tell you that they\u2019re closing up sites.", "Stahl: But\u2013", "Trump: Setting it up.", "Stahl: Is what I said true, that they haven\u2019t? Gotten\u2013", "Trump: Well, nobody really knows. I mean, people are saying that. I\u2019ve actually said that.", "Stahl: What? That they\u2019re still building missiles, more missiles?", "Trump: We don\u2019t really know, Lesley. We really don\u2019t know. But I assume\u2013", "Stahl: Suspect that?", "Trump: Let\u2019s say the answer is yes, okay? In the meantime, they haven\u2019t tested a missile. They haven\u2019t tested a rocket. They definitely haven\u2019t done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast. It sort of moves the earth. And we have a relationship now.", "The Washington Post, citing unnamed U.S. officials, reported on July 30: \u201cNewly obtained evidence, including satellite photos taken in recent weeks, indicates that work is underway on at least one and possibly two liquid-fueled ICBMs at a large research facility in Sanumdong, on the outskirts of Pyongyang, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe classified intelligence.\u201d That was a month and a half after the meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un.", "A day after the Post article was published, Fox News confirmed the reports \u201cthat North Korea is now busy once again building more missiles.\u201d", "\u201cU.S. officials telling Fox News, this is a quote, \u2018It is business as usual\u2019 at a factory near Pyongyang that builds ICBMs capable of reaching the United States,\u201d reported Greg Palkot, a senior foreign affairs correspondent for Fox News Channel. \u201cAnalysis of satellite photography showing, quote, \u2018There is no evidence of a halt of work.\u2019 We\u2019re talking about the long-range liquid-fueled missiles used three times last year in test firings that could, potentially, reach the East Coast of the United States. Recent work activity visible.\u201d", "Michael E. O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow and director of foreign policy research at the Brookings Institution, told us, \u201cPresident Trump is technically correct because we aren\u2019t completely sure about what is built at each factory or whether construction will conclude for each missile now in the works.\u201d", "\u201cBut,\u201d he told us via email, \u201cthe circumstantial evidence is very strong that North Korea does in fact continue to build more long-range missiles (and nuclear weapons) and that should be the presumption upon which US policy is based.\u201d", "Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, said in an email to FactCheck.org: \u201cNorth Korea did not commit to halt missile production, so it is very likely that Pyongyang is continuing to build nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. Kim Jong Un made clear in his January 2018 address that the mass production of nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles was a goal for the upcoming year. Recent satellite imagery indicating activity at missile production sites also points toward the conclusion that North Korea continues to quantitatively expand its nuclear arsenal.\u201d", "During the Jan. 1, 2018, address\u00a0referenced by Davenport, Kim Jong Un said, \u201cThe nuclear weapons research sector and the rocket industry should mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles.\u201d", "Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey and editor of the Nonproliferation Review, told us that for the the Washington Post story, some of his CNS colleagues used commercial space imagery and confirmed that \u201cthe Sanumdong missile R&D facility is active, although they could not independently establish what activities were underway inside.\u201d", "\u201cThe intelligence community clearly has better resources than CNS does, so I assume that they are in a better position to make such determinations,\u201d Pollack added.", "\u201cSeparately, CNS did independently discover this year that North Korea has pressed ahead with the construction of new production facilities at a different plant, the Chemical Materials Institute, which makes missile components.\u201d Pollack said.", "That\u2019s consistent, he said, with statements Kim Jong Un made during a visit to the site in August 2017.", "\u201cSo by the available indications, we have concluded that missile production is underway, consistent with plans declared in Kim Jong Un\u2019s Jan 1, 2018 speech \u2014 the same speech in which he unveiled his new diplomatic initiative,\u201d Pollack said.", "The president repeated several claims we\u2019ve written about before:", "On the administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d border policy: Trump repeatedly claimed that the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that caused the controversial separation of families at the Southern border was \u201cthe same as the Obama law. You know, Obama had the same thing.\u201d That\u2019s misleading. There were some family separations under previous administrations, experts told us when we examined this claim in June, but there was no blanket policy to prosecute parents and, therefore, separate them from their children.", "Members of the Trump administration have claimed that there\u2019s nothing new about this, yet a new policy was announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in early April to refer\u00a0all illegal border crossings for criminal prosecution. Since children can\u2019t be held in adult detention facilities, the referral\u00a0resulted\u00a0in parents being separated from their children.", "The Department of Homeland Security wasn\u2019t able to provide any figures for family separations under the Obama administration, but it said 2,342 children had been separated from their parents from early May to early June of this year. Trump signed an executive order to end the separations in late June.", "On NATO: Trump said the United States \u201cshouldn\u2019t be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe.\u201d It doesn\u2019t. The U.S. pays just over 22 percent of NATO\u2019s commonly funded budget, which includes civil, military and security investment expenses and is funded through a formula based on the gross national income of each member country.", "The president has repeatedly complained about indirect NATO spending \u2014 what each country spends on its own national defense. But even there, the U.S. share of total defense spending by member countries in 2017 was 67 percent, according to inflation-adjusted figures from NATO.", "On Christine Blasey Ford: The president was asked why, in a campaign-style rally in Mississippi, he had made fun of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school. Trump said: \u201cWhat I said is the person that we\u2019re talking about\u00a0didn\u2019t know the year, the time, the place.\u201d But that\u2019s incorrect. Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the alleged attack occurred in the summer of 1982 in an upstairs bedroom of a house in the Bethesda area of Maryland.\u00a0What she could not provide was the exact date and address of the alleged attack.", "On trade with China: Trump repeated his claim that China takes \u201c$500 billion a year out of the United States in the form of trade and others things.\u201d As we wrote in \u201cTrump\u2019s Numbers,\u201d the\u00a0goods-and-services trade deficit with China\u00a0was $351 billion for the most recent 12 months on record.\u00a0In 2017, the U.S. trade deficit in goods with China was $376 billion, but that was partially offset by a\u00a0trade surplus\u00a0of $40 billion in services, such as\u00a0software, legal and communications services, for a total trade balance of negative $336 billion.", "Correction, Oct. 18, 2018: The story was updated to reflect that CNS used commercial space imagery to confirm activity at the Sanumdong missile R&D facility for the Washington Post story, not after it ran.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
