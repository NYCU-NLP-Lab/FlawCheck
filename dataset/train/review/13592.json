["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on August 11, 2017", "TV ads from a Democratic group warn seniors that \u201cright now, your Medicare coverage is in danger,\u201d claiming \u201cdeep, automatic cuts\u201d could be made by \u201cunelected Washington bureaucrats.\u201d But those cuts, according to current estimates, wouldn\u2019t be implemented until 2023, and they would amount to .002 percentage points of Medicare growth that year.", "It\u2019s true that more automatic cuts to the growth of spending are expected in future years. But like many political messages about Medicare, these ads feature scare tactics \u2014 warning of cuts that could \u201crestrict access to doctors\u201d and \u201cdeny care\u201d \u2014 when we don\u2019t yet know what any cost-cutting would entail.", "The ads, from Majority Forward, a 501(c)(4) formed to support Democratic candidates and affiliated with the\u00a0Senate Majority PAC, are airing in Montana and North Dakota, in support of Democratic Sens. Jon Tester and Heidi Heitkamp. Another ad on this topic \u2014 featuring circling sharks to represent the \u201cbureaucrats\u201d who \u201cwant to take a bite out of your Medicare\u201d \u2014 is airing in Indiana, in support of Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly. All three ads say these senators are working to stop these cuts, and they have co-sponsored legislation that would do so.", "What the ads don\u2019t say is that these reductions to Medicare growth are now several years away.", "The TV ads are referring to the\u00a0Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which was created by the Affordable Care Act as a way to slow the growth in Medicare spending.\u00a0The ACA, signed into law in March 2010, called for a 15-member panel that would be tasked with cutting the growth of Medicare if spending on the program exceeded certain targets.", "The IPAB has been the target of criticism. Two months ago, we saw a $2 million ad buy from a group called Healthcare Leadership Council, a coalition of insurers, health clinics, pharmaceutical companies and others, urging a repeal of the board.", "The idea\u00a0was controversial from the start \u2014 former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin\u00a0called the board\u00a0a \u201cdeath panel\u201d in 2010, while Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, repeatedly\u00a0said it was made up of \u201cunelected, unaccountable bureaucrats,\u201d language that\u2019s echoed in the ads supporting Democratic senators.", "Fiscal groups such as\u00a0The Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget have supported IPAB, saying that it\u2019s necessary to find ways to control growing health care costs and that the board can operate without the political pressure rampant in Congress. \u201cUltimately, in a country struggling mightily with unaffordable health care costs now, and destined to struggle even more in the future, IPAB is one of the institutions that gives some hope that if we figure out how to control costs, we just might be able to put that knowledge to use,\u201d\u00a0Joshua Gordon, policy director at The Concord Coalition, wrote in a guest column for CNN Money in 2011.", "But so far,\u00a0there is no board: It doesn\u2019t have any members and hasn\u2019t done anything. The supposed \u201cbureaucrats\u201d who \u201cwant to take a bite out of your Medicare,\u201d as the Majority Forward ad in Indiana says, don\u2019t even exist yet.", "If the board is created in the future, the law stipulates that the president must consult with congressional leadership and appoint members with the \u201cadvice and consent of the Senate,\u201d a March 2017 Congressional Research Service report on the IPAB says. The IPAB members must \u201cpossess recognized expertise in health finance and economics, actuarial science, health facility management, health plans and integrated delivery systems, and reimbursement of health facilities,\u201d the CRS report explains, and include representatives of consumers and the elderly.", "The board hasn\u2019t been needed because Medicare spending growth has remained below targets set by the ACA that would trigger IPAB action. And the latest report by the Medicare trustees says the IPAB isn\u2019t expected to be triggered until 2021, with any required cuts implemented two years later.", "Here\u2019s how the trigger\u00a0works: The actuary for the Centers for Medicare &\u00a0Medicaid Services estimates per capita Medicare growth, and each year those estimates are published in a report from the Medicare trustees. The IPAB determination looks at a five-year projected average \u2014 the per capita growth for two years prior, the current year and two years later. Cuts would be required under the law if that rolling average exceeded the target. That target has been tied to inflation and medical care inflation, but next year, the target changes to the growth of per capita gross domestic product plus 1 percentage point.", "Once triggered, the IPAB must issue recommendations the following year on how to cut spending to keep growth below the savings target established by the actuary. And if there\u2019s no board, the secretary of health and human services instead would make the recommendations for cuts.", "The cuts would then be implemented the year after that, though Congress can choose to implement its own changes to keep spending below the target. Congress can\u2019t change the fiscal targets in other legislation, either, unless a three-fifths majority in the Senate waives that requirement.", "Last year, the Medicare trustees report estimated that the IPAB would be triggered in 2017 for the first time, requiring a 0.2 percentage point cut in Medicare spending growth, \u201ca relatively small difference,\u201d CMS Chief Actuary Paul Spitalnic said at a Brookings Institution event last June in explaining that the projection could change. And it did with the 2017 report, released July 13. The IPAB wasn\u2019t triggered, and now isn\u2019t expected to be until 2021, with savings implemented two years later.", "The estimated difference between Medicare growth and the IPAB target is even smaller \u2014 0.002 percentage points.", "Medicare trustees report, July 13, 2017:\u00a0As a result of the other savings provisions incorporated into current law, the Trustees estimate that the IPAB provision will reduce Medicare growth rates for the first time in 2023, and by only 0.002 percent in that year. In addition, the Trustees project that rates will be reduced by similar small amounts in 2026, 2027, 2028, 2030, 2033, and 2035", "It\u2019s certainly possible that that gap could widen, or go away, or that the IPAB could be triggered sooner.", "How \u201cdeep\u201d could these cuts be? And could they \u201crestrict access to doctors \u2026 deny care and cost you and your family more,\u201d as the TV ads say? We can\u2019t predict what action the IPAB provision could spark in the future, but the board is limited in what it can do. It can\u2019t increase beneficiaries\u2019 premiums or cost-sharing, or restrict benefits, but it could reduce payments to health care providers.", "Medicare spending totaled\u00a0$678.7 billion\u00a0in 2016 \u2014 about\u00a015 percent\u00a0of the total federal budget \u2014 and the health care program covered 56.8 million people, 84 percent of them age 65 and older and 16 percent\u00a0people with disabilities. The current projections for IPAB cuts would involve well under 1 percent of Medicare spending. Of course, the cuts could be larger in the future, and accumulate over time. But the IPAB is limiting to cutting no more than 1.5 percent of total Medicare payments in a given year, even if the gap between spending growth and the target is larger, a 2011 analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation\u00a0explains.", "The Affordable Care Act stipulates that the board \u201cshall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums\u201d or \u201cincrease Medicare beneficiary costsharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria\u201d (page 490).", "The Kaiser Family Foundation\u00a0analysis says that any recommended reductions\u00a0would then come from \u201cMedicare Advantage, the Part D prescription drug program, skilled nursing facility, home health, dialysis, ambulance and ambulatory surgical center services, and durable medical equipment.\u201d Payments to health care providers, including hospitals could also be cut, starting in 2020.", "Juliette Cubanski, associate director of KFF\u2019s Program on Medicare Policy, told us in a phone interview that beyond \u201cbasic guidelines,\u201d the ACA \u201cleft a lot of latitude\u201d for the board.", "She said it was \u201ca bit of a stretch\u201d to draw conclusions about how any cuts could affect access to doctors and medical care without knowing more specifically what the board or HHS secretary might have in mind. Even small spending reductions can lead to big battles, however, when it comes to Medicare.", "\u201cDepending on where those cuts are made, it could affect some providers more than others, if indeed they go for provider cuts to achieve the savings,\u201d said Cubanski, who holds a Ph.D. in health policy from Harvard.", "Majority Forward\u2019s support for the ad points to a February letter to Congress from the Healthcare Leadership Council, signed by many health care organizations across the country, warning that cuts to provider payments \u201cwould be devastating for patients, affecting access to care and innovative therapies,\u201d as some physicians wouldn\u2019t accept new patients under lower rates.", "The 2011 KFF analysis, which Cubanski co-authored, said there was \u201cambiguity\u201d in the law that could lead to IPAB proposals that could affect Medicare beneficiaries.", "Kaiser Family Foundation, \u201cThe Independent Payment Advisory Board: A New Approach to Controlling Medicare Spending\u201d:\u00a0Despite efforts to limit the reach of IPAB with respect to beneficiaries, there is some ambiguity in the ACA that could leave room for proposals that could directly or indirectly affect beneficiaries. The statute explicitly takes benefits, premiums, cost sharing, and \u201crationing\u201d out of the scope of IPAB\u2019s general authority, which appears to remove beneficiary issues from consideration. Yet, it is not entirely clear which proposals would be outside the scope of IPAB\u2019s authority. \u2026", "If IPAB recommends policies that squeeze Medicare payment rates without equal pressure being placed on private payment rates, there is some concern that Medicare beneficiaries would be at greater risk of having access problems, as providers become more inclined to serve other patients. While the ACA requires that proposals achieve the savings target \u201c\u2026while maintaining or enhancing beneficiary access to quality care\u2026\u201d there is no further clarification of how this is to be determined.", "The law allowed for a joint\u00a0resolution to abolish the IPAB this year \u2014 and such resolutions were introduced in the House and Senate. But they needed to be approved by three-fifths of each House by Aug. 15. There are other pieces of legislation, two in the Senate and one in the House, that would repeal IPAB provisions from the Affordable Care Act. All of these measures\u00a0were introduced in February and referred to committee.", "Tester and Heitkamp are co-sponsors of the Democratic Senate bill and, along with Donnelly, co-sponsors on the joint resolution.", "These TV ads warn that\u00a0\u201cright now, your Medicare coverage is in danger.\u201d Actually, \u201cright now,\u201d we don\u2019t know what will happen if IPAB is triggered and we could be\u00a0several years away from finding out.", "Interestingly, to support that line about Medicare being in \u201cdanger,\u201d Majority Forward pointed to the Medicare trustees\u2019 estimate that the trust fund for Part A, which pays hospital expenses, would be depleted in 2029. If Congress doesn\u2019t act to shore up financing, the tax revenue for Part A would cover only 88 percent of costs, the trustees said.\u00a0But the \u201cautomatic cuts\u201d the ad warns about\u00a0would improve Medicare\u2019s finances.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
