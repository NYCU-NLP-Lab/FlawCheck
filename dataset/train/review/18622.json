Kim Reynolds praised public schools In her January Condition of the State address for having \"the highest high-school graduation rate in the country.\" It\u2019s a popular sentiment that other Iowa politicians second \u2014 most notably Republicans when touting their state funding record for public schools.", "For example, Sen. Amy Sinclair, R-Allerton, made similar comments in a *Cedar Rapids Gazette* article from February, in which she defended increased state funding for K-12 schools.

However, he said he believes the shift from in-person to virtual instruction in many state schools could shed light on inequities within Iowa.", "He pointed to varying access to internet, food and transportation among students as examples of inequity within the education system.", "\"While we do have a discrepancy between those students who are in poverty and those students who aren\u2019t, it\u2019s still lower than a majority of states in the country,\" Beranek said. \"And I\u2019m hopeful that our districts are doing everything they can to ensure that doesn\u2019t widen but it narrows \u2014 and that\u2019s a goal of our districts in Iowa is to continue to narrow that gap.\"", "According to numbers from the NCES, graduation rates for black and Hispanic populations in Iowa were 82 percent and 82.4 percent in 2016-17, respectively \u2014 compared to a 92.7 percent graduation rate among the state\u2019s white population and an overall state graduation rate of 91 percent.
