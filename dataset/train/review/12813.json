Alt News visited the site of \u2018Crime Prevention Council of India (CPCI)\u2019 \u2013 www.cpcindiaonline.com \u2013 and the site\u2019s URL itself makes it evident that the organisation is not a part of the government.", "The URL of the \u2018Crime Prevention Council of India\u2019 ends with a \u2018.com\u2019 while websites of the Indian government either end with a \u2018gov.in\u2019 or \u2018nic.in\u2019.", "The official website of any ministry or government department always ends with the domain \u201cgov.in\u201d.

The letter also mentions that the Crime Prevention Council of India is a non-governmental organisation.", "The letter doing rounds on social media, notifying people to abstain from posting political propaganda content before the elections, was, thus, not issued by the government. It was merely a suggestion in public interest issued by a member of a non-governmental organisation. The NGO has, however, informed that the concerned member wrongly issued the letter.", "Despite the illusion of a government notice, social media users could have avoided falling for the letter by carefully analysing its tone and the organisation\u2019s website URL provided at the bottom. Even though the letter gave the impression of a warning, it did not mention \u2018Government of India\u2019 or the name of any ministry.
