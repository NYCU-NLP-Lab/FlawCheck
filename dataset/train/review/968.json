["\u201cThis shit is not Conspiracy theory anymore... This is happening!!! Our country has been sold to the globalists agenda, Trudeau has just announced it to everyone,\u201d a Facebook post claims.", "Similar posts have been shared thousands of times across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, where a user wrote: \u201cThat is happening right now, as democracy will be bypassed due to Covid-19. This pandemic has been orchestrated for decades only to implement the new world order.\u201d", "The claim, which gained traction on November 15, 2020, was quickly amplified across Twitter by conservative political commentators including Maxime Bernier, leader of the libertarian People\u2019s Party of Canada, Ezra Levant\u2019s Rebel News, Spencer Fernando and US radio and TV host Glenn Beck.", "\u201cWe want our lives to get back to normal\u2026 Instead they offer only more fear, more control, more centralization, and a reshaping of our lives and our economy without even asking us,\u201d Fernando wrote in a blog post.", "This conspiracy theory resurfaced with rising Covid-19 cases and harsher restrictions in some provinces of Canada, which recorded more than 311,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic.", "The full video of Trudeau\u2019s September 29, 2020 address to the United Nations, on which many of these posts are based, can be found here.", "In one segment Trudeau says, \u201cThis pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset. This is our chance to accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts, to reimagine economic systems that actually address global challenges like extreme poverty, inequality, and climate change.\u201d", "The \u201cGreat Reset\u201d is a formal initiative from Prince Charles and the World Economic Forum (WEF), a Swiss-based foundation that organizes an annual forum for political and economic leaders in Davos.", "Details of the Great Reset initiative are available on its website and in an interactive infographic here.", "A January 2021 WEF summit will have the \u201cGreat Reset\u201d as a theme, but as with every WEF meeting none of the discussions will be legally binding.", "\u201cThe COVID-19 crisis has shown us that our old systems are not fit any more for the 21st century,\u201d WEF founder and executive chairman Klaus Schwab said in June. \u201cIt has laid bare the fundamental lack of social cohesion,\u201d he said during a virtual event hosted from the WEF headquarters in Geneva, adding that \u201cnow is the historical moment, the time, not only to fight the virus but to shape the system for the post-corona era.\u201d", "\u201cThe elites want Covid-19 lockdowns to usher in a \u2018Great Reset\u2019 and that should terrify you,\u201d US Fox News TV host Tucker Carlson said in a November 17 broadcast that included Trudeau\u2019s comments to the UN.", "The same day, Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament Pierre Poilievre launched a \u201cStop the Great Reset\u201d petition. It has garnered 78,000 signatures since the opposition politician tweeted about it. Although his party does not oppose multilateralism, Poilievre said he is opposed to Trudeau imposing \u201csocialist ideology\u201d on Canada.", "Asked about the issue on November 20, Trudeau said: \u201cWe're seeing a lot of people fall prey to disinformation and if conservative MPs and others want to start talking about conspiracy theories, well that's their choice. I'm going to stay focused on helping Canadians get through this.\u201d", "Facebook posts also claimed that the WEF deleted a video outlining \u201c8 predictions for the world in 2030,\u201d implying a cover-up, but a Google search reveals that the video is still available on the WEF Twitter account. An article outlining each point of the video is also available on its website.", "In another segment of the UN speech video, Trudeau said, \u201cBuilding back better means getting support to the most vulnerable while maintaining our momentum on reaching the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals).\u201d", "Agenda 2030 is a United Nations initiative with goals including an end to global poverty and hunger, the combating of inequalities, and protection of the planet. AFP Fact Check has debunked false claims about the initiative in the past.", "Experts said the spreading of conspiratorial claims about the Great Reset reflects people\u2019s economic insecurities during the pandemic, but completely misrepresent the nature of the global initiatives.", "The theories outlined in the posts are \u201cextremely out of touch with the nature of the sustainable development goals or other initiatives that they are referencing,\u201d\u00a0Steven Bernstein, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, told AFP by phone.", "\u201cNothing in Agenda 2030 or the sustainable development goals tells any country or any individual that they have to do anything. It is completely voluntary. And that is the biggest irony of these theories because they use the language that someone is going to force them to do something or take away their property, and that is just nowhere in there. It\u2019s just completely made up,\u201d he said.", "Bernstein pointed out that \u201cmany international institutions historically have had difficulty in reaching down to the general population about what it is they\u2019re doing or not doing, so it can seem like it\u2019s something that is happening by elites behind closed doors.\u201d But he lamented that conspiratorial language about these initiatives \u201cundermines what should be societal, open discussion about the kind of goals and aspirations that people would like to pursue.\u201d", "Jeffrey Dvorkin, a University of Toronto journalism teacher whose book on disinformation is about to be published, said: \u201cWe live in a time where things are more complicated. The Covid-19 has made people even more insecure and the idea that there has to be something behind this pandemic is part of this thinking about how the world is changing and we can\u2019t control it.\u201d", "That way of thinking \u201calways seems to fall back on the idea that we are being manipulated by dark forces that we cannot see or control, or really understand. This is a simplified way to see the world,\u201d he added.", "The pandemic is a time of great economic pressure, and that always leads people to \u201clook for quicker, easier, more direct solutions, and people become easily frustrated when they see the government not moving as quickly as they want,\u201d he said.", "AFP Fact Check has reported on other conspiracies circulating in Canada during the Covid-19 pandemic, including the misleading claim that the government\u2019s move to outsource the management of quarantine sites means they are building \u201cinternment camps,\u201d and a fake leaked email said to be from a member of the Liberal party.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
