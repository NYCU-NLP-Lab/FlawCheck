["This screen grab comes from a May 2012 TV ad from then-Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, saying challenger Beto O'Rourke had a criminal record (VIMEO video, August 2018).", "Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas has said that in younger days he was twice arrested in his hometown of El Paso--once, he says, for leaping a campus fence and the other time for driving while intoxicated.", "Readers have asked us whether the third-term congressman challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz has a criminal history. We decided to fact-check mention of the arrests in a 2012 TV ad that also was screenshot for an April 2017 Texas Tribune news story.", "In the ad, sponsored by then-U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, text next to what looks like O\u2019Rourke\u2019s mugshot states that the \"facts\" are that O\u2019Rourke has a \"criminal record\" including burglary and DWI. The ad\u2019s narrator says O\u2019Rourke \"has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests.\"", "That he does, we confirmed, which he\u2019s acknowledged since his first run for office.", "We tried to phone and email Reyes about his claim and failed to connect. Next, we attempted to get our own fix on the facts by seeking\u00a0documentation of the DWI arrest through a public information request to the El Paso Police Department. Martin Rodriguez, a department records specialist, said by email the agency had no responsive records. We similarly queried the University of Texas at El Paso about the earlier\u00a0arrest and didn\u2019t immediately hear back.", "A background check", "Separately, we\u00a0ran a background check of O\u2019Rourke using the LexisNexis service. According to the results, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s May 1995 misdemeanor arrest on the UTEP campus was later declined and his September 1998 misdemeanor DWI arrest in El Paso was dismissed.", "The check gave us\u00a0case numbers for the arrests\u00a0enabling us to fetch an El Paso County record stating that O\u2019Rourke was initially arrested in May 1995 and that case was disposed of in February 1996. We saw too that after the DWI arrest, according to another county record, O\u2019Rourke was referred to a misdemeanor diversion program in March 1999 and completed\u00a0\"DWI school\" in May 1999. That document\u2019s last entry, dated Oct. 20, 1999, says: \"Misdemeanor diversion completed successfully.\"", "Campaign: O\u2019Rourke often confirms arrests", "When we sought\u00a0detail from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s spokesman, Chris Evans, he said by email that\u00a0O\u2019Rourke had consistently addressed his arrests, notably during campaign stops in\u00a0Paris, Sunnyside, San Antonio and Houston, where O\u2019Rourke told a group in August 2018 that he spent a night in the El Paso County jail after what he referred to as his 1995 arrest for criminal trespass.", "In San Antonio, a resident\u00a0told O\u2019Rourke she\u2019d seen what someone described as his mugshot. O\u2019Rourke replied: \"More than 20 years ago, I was arrested--not once, but twice. So you should know that and we should all own that, if asked.\" O\u2019Rourke specified that he\u2019d been arrested for attempting to hop a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso and later, he said, for a \"far more serious mistake: I drove under the influence of alcohol. There\u2019s no justifying that.\"", "April 2005 news story", "The oldest published account of the arrests appears to be an April 2005 El Paso Times news story about O\u2019Rourke\u2019s successful run for a seat on the El Paso City Council. The story, which we found by searching the Nexis news database, quoted the incumbent, Anthony Cobos, stressing O\u2019Rourke\u2019s DWI arrest. Cobos, who later served as county judge before being convicted on embezzlement charges, said at the time: \"I think you lead by example and his example speaks for itself.\"", "According to the story, O'Rourke was arrested on a DWI charge in September 1998 that was dismissed in 1999 after he completed a court-recommended DWI program. \"I've been open about that since the very beginning. I have owned up to it and I have taken responsibility for it,\" O\u2019Rourke told the paper.", "The Times further reported that court records showed that O\u2019Rourke earlier was arrested in 1995 at UTEP on a burglary of building charge, which was later dropped. O\u2019Rourke told the paper: \"That happened while I was in college. I along with some friends were horsing around, and we snuck under the fence at the UTEP physical plant and set off an alarm. We were arrested by UTEP police. ... UTEP decided not to press charges. We weren't intending to do any harm,\" he was quoted saying.", "O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign later provided a photo of a document Evans described by email as the original UTEP police report on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s arrest there. It says O\u2019Rourke and two other students were arrested at the university\u2019s Physical Plant under the \"burglary\" portion of the state penal code, section 30.02, for \"attempted forcible entry.\"", "Congressman Reyes\u2019 TV ad", "Seven years later, then-Rep.

The story said that according to police records, O\u2019Rourke completed a diversion program and the charge was dismissed.", "In August 2017, more recently, O\u2019Rourke described the arrests to an East Texas newspaper. The Palestine Herald-Press quoted him saying: \"Some 20 years ago, I was charged with driving under the influence and, during my college years, I jumped a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso which resulted in a burglary charge,\" O'Rourke said. \"I was not convicted of either.", "\"Both incidents were due to poor judgement and I have no excuse for my behavior then. However, since then, I have used my opportunities to serve my community and my state. I'm grateful for the second chance and believe that we all deserve second chances.\"", "Our ruling", "A 2012 Reyes TV ad still viewable online six years later said O\u2019Rourke \"has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests.\"", "O'Rourke's comments and\u00a0records indicate that UTEP police arrested O'Rourke in 1995 for\u00a0 burglary, a misdemeanor charge\u00a0disposed of the next year.
