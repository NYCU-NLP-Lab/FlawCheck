["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on August 27, 2019", "In a series of tweets aimed at the auto industry, President Donald Trump inaccurately said that his fuel efficiency plan would reduce the cost of cars \u201cby more than $3000\u201d and make them \u201csubstantially safer.\u201d Even going by his administration\u2019s analysis \u2014 which many experts doubt \u2014 he inflated the savings and is wrong about car safety.", "The tweets, which began the morning of Aug. 21, followed last month\u2019s announcement that four major auto companies had signed a deal with California to largely adhere to the fuel economy standards the Obama administration had put in place, although with slightly less stringency and more flexibility.", "Trump\u2019s plan, which has not yet been finalized, calls for freezing the standards at 2020 levels through 2026. It also revokes California\u2019s ability to set stricter standards. The auto companies struck a deal with California to avoid two sets of standards in the country after talks between the Trump administration and the state broke down.", "My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019", "Later in the day, Trump\u2019s attacks continued as he named specific companies.", "The Legendary Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan, the Founders of Ford Motor Company and General Motors, are \u201crolling over\u201d at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good, and cost $3,000 more to consumers. Crazy!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019", "\u201cHenry Ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car, that is far less safe and doesn\u2019t work as well, because execs don\u2019t want to fight California regulators,\u201d Trump added in a third tweet.", "Alfred P. Sloan, it should be said, didn\u2019t found General Motors, although he was one of the important leaders of the company for more than a quarter century. GM, at least so far, is not one of the companies to have officially made a deal with California; those automakers include Ford, Honda, and the U.S. divisions of BMW and Volkswagen.", "Trump\u2019s central claims about car safety and cost savings are reminiscent of the key arguments his administration has used to justify the rollback, known as the Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient Vehicles rule, or SAFE. We\u2019ve written before that experts are skeptical of those ideas. A group of researchers, for instance, published a paper in Science last December documenting numerous errors and faulty assumptions with the administration\u2019s analysis. But Trump\u2019s tweets are incorrect even taking that analysis at face value.", "Consider Trump\u2019s claim that new cars under his proposal would be \u201csubstantially safer\u201d or that automakers, by signing a deal with California, want to build cars that are \u201cfar less safe.\u201d According to calculations by the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, compared with leaving former President Barack Obama\u2019s standards in place, a 2020 freeze would save 12,700 lives over the lifetime of vehicles through model year 2029. Experts, as we\u2019ve explained, doubt that tally. But even assuming it\u2019s accurate, almost all of those saved lives come from people driving less and having newer model cars \u2014 not from car makers making safer vehicles under the frozen standards. EPA/NHTSA documents show that only 160 of the 12,700 lives, or a little more than 1%, would be due to physical changes to the cars themselves (see Table II-73, p. 43152).", "The rationale for the 160 extra deaths is that some automakers would reduce the weight of their vehicles to meet the fuel economy standards. But as we\u2019ve written, while reduced weight might be bad in a collision with a heavy truck, it would be beneficial for the other party when colliding with a smaller car. On net, it\u2019s not clear how weight changes as a result of stricter fuel efficiency standards would affect safety.", "Kenneth Gillingham, a Yale economist and a co-author of the Science paper, told us in an email that there\u2019s no basis for the idea that cars with lowered fuel efficiency standards would be \u201csubstantially safer.\u201d", "\u201cThe cars will all have the same safety equipment regardless of the standards and the effect of the change in the standards on the weight of vehicles and thus accident fatalities is ambiguous in the academic literature,\u201d he said. \u201cSome work, including my own, suggests that the standards may even save lives because of how they change vehicle attributes.\u201d", "Gillingham has previously worked for the California Air Resources Board, which is the entity in California that struck a deal with automakers. He was also on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama.", "On average car cost, Trump also goes beyond what his agencies state. In the proposed rule, there are numerous estimates for how much less an average vehicle might cost if fuel economy standards stayed fixed at the 2020 level. None of them, however, are more than $3,000 \u2014 and those figures don\u2019t include fuel savings.", "The number the agencies highlight in the text of their proposed rule is $2,100. \u201c[C]ompared to the proposed standards today,\u201d the overview section reads, \u201cthe previously-issued standards would increase average vehicle prices by about $2,100.\u201d", "It\u2019s not entirely clear where this number comes from, but it\u2019s also listed as the average price increase for vehicles in 2026, which is the last year in which the Trump rollback would apply (see Table VII-5, p. 43265). The number only refers to a price increase and does not reflect any benefits as a result of added fuel efficiency.", "The figure that EPA and NHTSA have used on their fact sheet is a $2,340 reduction in total ownership costs on a 2030 vehicle. That includes $1,850 less for technology costs \u2014 or how much the car\u2019s price would fall \u2014 and $490 less for things such as financing, taxes and other fees.", "However, that ignores the fact that a car with greater fuel efficiency would be cheaper to operate at the pump. The agencies estimated the average vehicle would reap $1,950 in fuel savings and other benefits. That means, according to the government\u2019s calculations, the rollback would save someone just $390, on average, over the lifetime of a 2030 vehicle (see Table VII-71, p. 43323).", "When we asked the Department of Transportation for an explanation for Trump\u2019s $3,000 figure, a spokesperson directed us to a table in the Obama administration\u2019s 2012 analysis, which shows increased lifetime costs of $3,100 to $3,200 for a vehicle in 2025 (see table 7.4-10 on p. 7-36). But that includes the costs associated with both the 2012-2016 and 2017-2025 fuel economy standards, not just the last few years of the program. The same table also points out that the lifetime fuel savings would be more than $10,000, and that on net, the rules would save consumers at least $7,200.", "Gillingham, the Yale economist, told us that the DOT-referenced numbers would not be the correct ones to use. He said he had \u201cno idea\u201d where Trump\u2019s figure could have come from unless the president was cherry-picking estimates of price drops for individual automakers in certain years.", "Under the rollback, for example, the average price of a Ford would be $3,000 lower in 2024 (see table VII-4, p. 43263). A Fiat Chrysler or a Volkswagen also would be more than $3,000 cheaper in some years, according to the administration\u2019s estimates, but prices for a dozen other automakers wouldn\u2019t fall by that much.", "That could explain the president\u2019s Ford-specific tweet, but it does not support Trump\u2019s claim that his proposal would \u201clower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000.\u201d According to that table, the average for all automakers in 2024 is $1,850 in savings, and it maxes out at $2,000 in 2026.", "It\u2019s worth noting that the Obama administration also predicted that upfront vehicle costs would increase under more stringent fuel economy standards. But its analyses generally estimated lower prices and always showed that the benefits would outweigh the costs for consumers.", "Gillingham said, too, that many analysts think the Trump administration has overestimated the costs of adding fuel-efficient technology.", "This month, Consumer Reports released its own analysis of the rollback, and found that freezing the standards would ultimately cost \u2014 not save \u2014 consumers $3,300 per vehicle, when \u201ctaking into account fuel costs and vehicle costs, among other factors.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
