["\"In the end I believe my generation will surprise everyone. We already know that both political parties are playing both sides from the middle and we'll elect a true outsider when we fully mature,\"\u00a0starts a quote supposedly said by Cobain in 1993. It concludes, \"I wouldn't be surprised if it's not a business tycoon who can't be bought and who does what's right for the people. Someone like Donald Trump as crazy as that sounds.\"", "The quote has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, but never with any attribution as to where or exactly when it was said by Cobain.", "The latest iteration is a meme including a black-and-white photo of Cobain during Nirvana\u2019s famous MTV Unplugged performance in 1993. Nowhere in that performance does Cobain speak the quote.", "In August 2016, fact-checking site Snopes reported that the hoax originated on a Facebook page called Trump Train.", "In another sign that the quote is likely fabricated, the earliest version of the meme misspelled Cobain\u2019s first name as Curt rather than Kurt.", "A recent debunk of the meme appeared in August 2018 when Danny Goldberg, who was one of Nirvana\u2019s managers when Cobain was alive, wrote in The Nation, \u201cI know that the quote is not only made up but it is also a grotesque perversion of Kurt\u2019s beliefs.\u201d", "While known to speak out against homophobia, a 2017 Rolling Stone magazine compilation of 12 great quotes from Cobain does not include broader statements on politics.", "A Google search of the quote from before July 2016 only produced only two results: a page ranking blogs on Cobain which is no longer online and a page of Cobain memes.", "There were no search results from during the tumultuous life of the grunge singer who died by suicide at age 27 in April 1994.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
