["By Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley, D'Angelo Gore and Jessica McDonald", "Posted on January 8, 2020", "In an address to the nation a day after an Iranian attack on military bases housing U.S. soldiers in Iraq, President Donald Trump made some dubious, misleading and inaccurate claims:", "Trump addressed the nation on Jan. 8 \u2014 a day after Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at two military bases in Iraq in retaliation for the U.S. killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. The military bases house U.S. and coalition military forces, but the president said no Americans were killed.", "During the remarks, the president criticized the Iran nuclear agreement that was negotiated by the Obama administration and supported by the international community.", "The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council \u2014 China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States \u2014 and Germany reached an agreement with Iran in July 2015 on a plan designed to ensure that Iran\u2019s nuclear program would be used only for peaceful purposes. In exchange, the U.S., European Union and United Nations agreed to lift sanctions on Iran.", "That plan \u2014 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \u2014 was implemented Jan. 16, 2016.", "But the deal has been in jeopardy since 2018, when Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement and began imposing sanctions on Iran. Since then, \u201cIran has breached JCPOA limits on uranium enrichment, research and development on advanced centrifuges, and stockpile size,\u201d as explained by the nonpartisan Arms Control Association.", "In response to the U.S. drone attack on Jan. 2 that killed Iranian\u2019s top military commander, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran went even further, announcing it would not comply with the JCPOA\u2019s limits on uranium enrichment.", "In his Jan. 8 remarks on Iran, Trump downplayed the significance of the JCPOA.", "Trump, Jan. 8: The very defective JCPOA expires shortly anyway, and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout.", "Trump distorts the facts. The nuclear agreement, which took effect four years ago, imposes restrictions on enriched uranium for 15 years, and requires monitoring and inspections of Iranian facilities for at least 15 years.", "\u201cNo single element blocks Iran\u2019s pathway to nuclear weapons, but taken together, the nuclear restrictions and monitoring form a comprehensive system that will put nuclear weapons out of Iran\u2019s reach for at least 15 years,\u201d the nonpartisan Arms Control Association said in an August 2015 analysis of the agreement. \u201cMany of the JCPOA provisions also extend beyond 15 years. Monitoring of centrifuge production facilities continues for 20 years, and monitoring of uranium mines and mills continues for 25 years. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors will have enhanced access indefinitely.\u201d", "The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said something similar in a 2018 report.", "CRS, July 20, 2018: For 15 years, the IAEA will monitor the stored Iranian centrifuges and related infrastructure. During this time, Iran will also permit the IAEA \u201cdaily access\u201d to \u201crelevant buildings\u201d at the Natanz facilities. For 20 years, Tehran will allow the agency to verify Iran\u2019s inventory of certain centrifuge components and the manufacturing facilities for such components. Additionally, Iran is to allow the IAEA to monitor the country\u2019s uranium mills for 25 years and to monitor Iran\u2019s plant for producing heavy water.", "The nuclear deal also lengthened the breakout time \u2014 which is how long it would take Iran to produce enough highly enriched uranium for one nuclear weapon \u2014 from roughly two or three months to at least one year for at least 10 years, according to the CRS report. A lengthier breakout time gives the U.S. and international community more time to react, if IAEA inspectors detect Iranian efforts to produce nuclear weapons.", "\u201cIn addition to the restrictions on activities related to fissile material production, the JCPOA indefinitely prohibits Iranian \u2018activities which could contribute to the design and development of a nuclear explosive device,\u2019 including research and diagnostic activities,\u201d the CRS report said.", "Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said Trump is simply \u201cwrong.\u201d", "\u201cThe JCPOA created important uranium and uranium enrichment-related barriers that prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons for more than 15 years, and some other limitations last longer and some indefinitely,\u201d Kimball told us in an email. \u201cBut with the impulsive decision to by Trump to withdraw from the agreement and violate U.S. commitments under the deal, he has prompted Iran to remove these barriers far sooner.\u201d", "Trump continued to mischaracterize and inflate the amount of money Iran was able to access when sanctions were lifted as part of the Iran nuclear agreement \u2014 money which Trump dubiously said was used to pay for missiles fired at U.S. soldiers in Iraq.", "Trump, Jan. 8: Iran\u2019s hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash. Instead of saying \u201cthank you\u201d to the United States, they chanted \u201cdeath to America.\u201d\u2026 Then, Iran went on a terror spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration.", "There are several things wrong with Trump\u2019s statement. For starters, the international agreement to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons\u2019 program, as we mentioned earlier, was signed in 2015 \u2014 not 2013.\u00a0 And, despite Trump\u2019s numerous claims to the contrary, Iran also was not \u201cgiven $150 billion\u201d in the deal.", "As we explained once again last year, the deal did unfreeze some of Iran\u2019s assets that were held largely in foreign, not U.S., banks.", "\u201cThat was Iran\u2019s money held in escrow,\u201d Elizabeth Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security, told us via email. \u201cIran was not so much given money but allowed access to its own money that had been held, according to sanctions, in escrow in countries to which Iran had been selling oil during the period of intensive sanctions from 2012-2015.\u201d", "Also, $150 billion is a high-end estimate of the total that was freed up after some sanctions were lifted.", "U.S. Treasury Department estimates put the figure at about $50 billion in \u201cusable liquid assets,\u201d according to 2015 testimony from Adam Szubin, acting under secretary of treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence. Another $50 billion to $70 billion in assets would be inaccessible to Iran because they \u201care either obligated in illiquid projects (such as over 50 projects with China) that cannot be monetized quickly, if at all, or are composed of outstanding loans to Iranian entities that cannot repay them,\u201d Szubin said.", "The \u201c$1.8 billion in cash\u201d Trump referred to is unrelated to the JCPOA. It was a settlement reached by the Obama administration to resolve a dispute that dates to 1979, when Iran paid the U.S. $400 million for military equipment it never received. The U.S. refused to provide the equipment after the Shah of Iran was overthrown during the Iranian Revolution in 1979.", "The agreement reached in 2016 ended a claim that Iran had filed against the U.S. in an international tribunal in The Hague. Together with interest, the U.S. agreed to pay a total of $1.7 billion to Iran. An initial installment of $400 million was paid in cash on the same day in January 2016, that Iran released U.S. prisoners. That led to charges that Obama had paid a ransom, though the Obama administration insisted it was not.", "As for Trump\u2019s claim that, \u201cThe missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration,\u201d experts told us that\u2019s impossible to say.", "\u201cThe Iranian missiles used in the retaliatory attack on U.S. forces based in Iraq were indigenously produced missiles, probably Fateh-110s and Fateh-313s, and it is impossible to determine whether those missiles were or were not produced before 2015 [when the JCPOA was signed], but Iran did possess a large number of these missiles before 2015,\u201d Kimball, of the Arms Control Association, told us via email.", "In his testimony back in 2015, Szubin said the Obama administration was \u201cmindful that at least some of the funds Iran receives from relief could find their way to malign purposes,\u201d but he said \u201cthe vast majority will be used to tackle a mountain of debts and domestic needs that at over a half trillion dollars are more than ten times as large as the funds it can freely use.\u201d", "The JCPOA also \u201cdoes not specifically contain ballistic missile restraints,\u201d as CRS stated in an Oct. 8, 2019 report. In remarks at the United Nations in December, 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said \u201cit is clear that the Iranian regime\u2019s ballistic missile activity has grown since the nuclear deal.\u201d", "Whether the money Iran freed up as a result of the JCPOA could have been used for the missiles, as Trump alleged, is \u201cdifficult to say\u201d because \u201cmoney is fungible,\u201d said Fabian Hinz, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.", "\u201cHowever, we can clearly state that the project to develop precision guidance was started way before the JCPOA and the missiles we saw were initially developed before the JCPOA,\u201d Hinz told us via email. \u201cAlso, this was a project that was given the highest priority by the Supreme Leader and missiles are the core pillar of Iranian national defense.\u201d Hinz said he had \u201cstrong doubts as such it is affected too much by budget fluctuations.\u201d", "In touting the strength of the American military, Trump name-checked one of the buzziest weapons of late: hypersonic missiles.", "\u201cUnder construction are many hypersonic missiles,\u201d the president said, adding, \u201cThe fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it.\u201d", "It\u2019s not entirely clear what Trump means by \u201cunder construction,\u201d which could refer to prototype creation or to full-blown production of deployable weapons. The White House did not respond to our request for clarification.", "Iain Boyd, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder with expertise in hypersonics, said the Department of Defense has several ongoing programs to build hypersonic weapons.", "\u201cIt\u2019s certainly way beyond just doing research on those systems,\u201d he said of American progress. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a factory where there is a production line, and they\u2019re just rolling off.\u201d", "A Congressional Research Service report updated in September 2019 also stated that the U.S. is \u201cunlikely\u201d to field an operational hypersonic weapons system before 2022. A table summarizing U.S. hypersonic programs indicates the projects are still in design review, flight or launch testing phases \u2014 and will be at least through 2020.", "Hypersonic missiles are a kind of weapons holy grail for several nations because they promise to be incredibly fast \u2014 and with current anti-missile defense systems, potentially impossible to defend against.", "The word \u201chypersonic\u201d refers to speeds above Mach 5, or five times faster than the speed of sound. Intercontinental ballistic missiles, which pop up into space and then fall back down along an arched, parabolic path, reach hypersonic speeds upon atmospheric re-entry. But because they follow known arcs, they are predictable. The term hypersonic weapon, then, is usually reserved for hypersonic-speed weapons that can still maneuver at high speed, making them difficult to stop with existing anti-missile technology.", "Boyd said there are two basic types of hypersonic weapon designs. One involves launching a glider on a rocket, and having the glider come back down. The second, which would likely be what Trump had in mind when he said \u201chypersonic missile,\u201d Boyd said, would be more akin to a cruise missile, with an engine to push it along at a constant speed and altitude for a while. Boyd said the glider design is further along. Whichever country gets there first, he said, it will likely be with a glider, adding that the U.S. is working on both designs.", "Indeed, despite news reports and claims from Russia and China about their hypersonic successes, Boyd said it\u2019s not necessarily clear who is winning the hypersonic weapons arms race. \u201cNobody has, I don\u2019t think, what we would call a \u2018fielded capability,\u2019 where there\u2019s something sitting in a bunker somewhere and you can press a button and fire one of these things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd until somebody does have that, then it\u2019s not really clear who\u2019s ahead.\u201d", "Russian and Chinese efforts on hypersonic weapons, however, have spurred more intense American interest in the technology, as well as in developing hypersonic weapon defense.", "Trump again credited himself for energy accomplishments that were previously predicted, or that began during the previous administration.", "Trump, Jan. 8: Over the last three years, under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before and America has achieved energy independence. These historic accomplishments changed our strategic priorities. These are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible. And options in the Middle East became available. We are now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil.", "We don\u2019t know how Trump is measuring energy independence, but the Energy Information Administration\u2019s most recent monthly review from December shows that, as of the first nine months of 2019, the U.S. exported slightly more energy than it imported, and it produced a tad more energy than it consumed.", "However, it\u2019s not true that no one thought that was possible. Prior to Trump taking office in January 2017, the EIA projected that U.S. total energy exports would exceed imports by at least 2026, and the agency projected that U.S. total energy production would exceed consumption by the same year. So the EIA did expect it would happen.", "Trump\u2019s claim that the U.S. is the \u201cnumber-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world\u201d isn\u2019t exactly new information, either. The EIA said the U.S. became the worldwide leader in crude oil production in 2018, but, as we have written before, it also said that U.S. became the international leader in production of petroleum products, including crude oil, in 2013, and the global leader in natural gas production in 2009.", "As for Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cwe do not need Middle East oil,\u201d the U.S. is importing less oil from Persian Gulf countries (Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) than in previous years. But in 2018, the most recent annual EIA data available, the U.S. still relied on those countries for about 19% of its crude oil imports and nearly 16% of all its petroleum imports.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
