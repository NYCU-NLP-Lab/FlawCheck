["A day after a panel of arbitrators ruled that Newark owed money to the New Jersey Devils, Mayor Cory Booker stood outside the Prudential Center and lambasted Jeff Vanderbeek, the team\u2019s managing partner.\n\nBut the mayor should remember it was city officials who initiated that arbitration process.\n\nYet Booker claimed twice during his April 4 news conference that Vanderbeek \"took us into arbitration.\"\n\n\"He\u2019s dragged my team through courts for five and a half years, millions and millions of dollars of legal fees he has swept up from the city pressing frivolous claims,\" Booker said. \"How do I know they\u2019re frivolous claims? Think about how much of a pathetic penny pincher he\u2019s been.\n\n\"He took us into arbitration, not just for that one letter that I mentioned. He took us into arbitration because he said, \u2018Oh, you didn\u2019t get the streets straightened in time.\u2019 He was responsible for the construction of this arena, but he said, \u2018Oh, it wasn\u2019t done on time,\u2019\" the mayor continued. \"Every legal manipulation and exploitation he could pursue to get another dime and dollar out of our city, he\u2019s gone after.\"\n\nAfter reviewing the arbitrators\u2019 decision and an application filed on the city\u2019s behalf, PolitiFact New Jersey determined that Booker is wrong. The arbitrators\u2019 decision resulted from an arbitration request filed in 2010 by the Newark Housing Authority, which owns the arena.\n\nIn a series of e-mails, Booker spokeswoman Anne Torres acknowledged that the authority initiated the process, but claimed that the Devils left city officials with no choice.\n\n\"The Newark Housing Authority would never have demanded an arbitration if the Devils had paid their rent, however, because of their recalcitrance and failure to follow through on their commitments, the Newark Housing Authority and the city were forced into arbitration,\" Torres wrote. \"It should be noted that these were the facts behind the Mayor\u2019s statement.\"\n\nTorres later added, \"The Mayor knows that the Housing Authority initiated the arbitration, that\u2019s no secret. \u00a0What I am saying is that when he says \u2018they took us into arbitration\u2019, he\u2019s saying this because they left us with no choice.\"\n\nLet\u2019s explain the timeline of events leading up to arbitration.\n\nThe Devils and the authority approved a lease agreement in February 2005 for the Prudential Center, which later opened in October 2007. But the two sides became divided over a host of issues, including unpaid rent and parking revenues.\n\nFollowing years of negotiations, the authority sent a \"notice of dispute\" to the hockey team, starting the process toward arbitration, according to a May 2010 Star-Ledger article. The lease agreement provides for arbitration as a method of resolving disputes.\n\nIn June 2010, the authority filed a \"demand for arbitration\" with the American Arbitration Association, according to the arbitrators\u2019 decision and the application filed at the time.\n\nThe arbitrators\u2019 decision released last week addresses the unpaid rent, parking revenues and other issues, but ultimately leaves Newark owing about $600,000 to the Devils.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAt an April 4 news conference outside the Prudential Center, Booker claimed twice that Vanderbeek \"took us into arbitration.\"\n\nBut as a spokeswoman for the mayor acknowledged, the Newark Housing Authority initiated the arbitration process.
