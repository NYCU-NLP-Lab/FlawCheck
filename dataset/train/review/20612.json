Firstly, the global mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2.93 percent a month ago and not 0.2 percent as claimed.", "Based on the latest WHO situation report, the COVID-19 mortality rate for Italy is 9.3 percent. Going by Italy\u2019s mortality rate, which is the highest globally, if Nigeria\u2019s estimated 200-million population were to contract COVID-19, the number of estimated deaths still falls way below 45 million.", "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control told AFP the voice note and its claims were \u201cfalse\u201d.", "The centre has reported 40 cases with only one casualty\u00a0-- keeping local mortality at 2.5 percent as of March 24, 2020.", "Daniel Meshak, a public health specialist\u00a0at Jos University Teaching Hospital, also dismissed the possibility of the virus killing 45 million Nigerians.", "\"Mortality is dependent on the kind of supportive care you get from the hospital so there is a need to be cautious\", he told AFP.", "The sender also claims that Nigeria wants to purchase protective gear from China but lacks the financial reserves.", "\u201cNigeria wants to buy used protective gear\u2026 from China... for N32,000 ($85 or \u20ac79) and they can\u2019t purchase the new one because we are actually broke, Nigeria doesn\u2019t have anything in their reserves anymore\u201d, the sender claims.", "He alleges President Muhammadu Buhari has spent state funds and \u201cwhat every state is waiting for is for the World Bank to release money\u201d.", "According to data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Nigeria had $35.9 billion in its reserves as of March 19, 2020. Central bank governor Godwin Emefiele said on March 18 that the bank would boost the economy with a N1 trillion stimulus, with an additional N100 billion\u00a0($264.5 million) loan to the health sector.", "Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves have fallen from $38.5 billion at the beginning of 2020 to $35.9 billion, but the reserves were nowhere near empty as of when the voice note started making the rounds.", "NCDC also told AFP there were no plans underway to buy used protective gear from China.", "The sender claims his source was a certain \u201cDr Alemu\u201d, a female Rwandan national and the WHO\u2019s representative in Nigeria.", "He alleges the NCDC reports to the doctor who then passed on the information.", "However, WHO spokeswoman Charity Warigon told AFP the claims were untrue.", "She said that although Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu was a real person, he was neither a woman nor from Rwanda.
