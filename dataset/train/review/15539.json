["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "As part of his push for the presidency in 2012, Tim Pawlenty makes the case in his book Courage to Stand that he is a tested fiscal conservative.", "\"Contrary to liberal rhetoric, spending cuts are not impossible. Take Minnesota, for example\" he writes in his book\u2019s conclusion. \"I lowered the average growth of annual spending during my time as Governor to just under 2 percent and balanced the budget without raising taxes. In 2009, we cut spending in real terms for the first time in 150 years.\"\n\nPawlenty was governor of Minnesota from 2003 to 2011, serving two terms. Here, we\u2019re checking Pawlenty\u2019s statement that he \"cut spending in real terms for the first time in 150 years.\"\n\nMinnesota celebrated its 150th anniversary of statehood in 2008, but we should note it\u2019s not possible to look at 150 years of state fiscal data. Minnesota Management and Budget, the state\u2019s fiscal information agency, keeps stats only back to 1960. We asked the Pawlenty campaign whether they had more historical data, but we didn't hear back.\n\nLooking at those stats, we can see that the 2010-2011 budget cycle -- a two-year budget referred to as a biennium -- marked the first drop in state spending since 1960, when state spending declined 10.9 percent.\n\nBudget figures are available on an annual basis as well. By those numbers, the 2010 general fund budget year (which starts July 1, 2009), was not the first year spending dropped. Spending also dropped in 2009, 2004, 1986 and 1983, although it was up for the two-year cycles that included those years.\n\nFinally, we should note that the 2010-2011 budget biennium was helped by a few factors.\n\nMinnesota Management and Budget \u00a0said the state had used several mechanisms to put off state spending. That included $2.3 billion from the federal stimulus and two separate postponements in spending on K-12 education that totaled $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion. Those fixes went away the next budget cycle, and the budget agency projects a significant spending increase of 29.3 percent for the biennium.\n\nIn rating this statement, we find that Pawlenty did reduce spending for the two-year budget cycle for the first time since 1960. But there were several single-year decreases, two during Pawlenty\u2019s tenure as governor (2009 and 2004), but also two before he was governor (1986 and 1983). The major reduction in the 2010-2011 budget cycle was achieved with a one-time infusion of federal dollars and measures that delayed state spending rather then permanently reducing it. Finally, we don't have 150 years of budget data to check. We only found data back to 1960, and Pawlenty's campaign provided no data to back up the claim covering the 100 years previous when we asked for it. If data emerges, we're willing to review the claim. But given the evidence at hand, we rate Pawlenty\u2019s statement Barely True.", "Minnesota Management and Budget, Historical Expenditures: General Funds, Feb. 28, 2011", "Minnesota Management and Budget, Frequently Asked Questions, accessed March 29, 2011\n\nInterview with John Pollard of Minnesota Management and Budget\n\nSt. Paul Pioneer Press, Pawlenty says he stopped spending binge; Others say he just delayed bigger problems, Dec. 21, 2010, accessed via Nexis", "The Minneapolis Star Tribune, Painful projection: $6.2 billion deficit, Dec. 2, 2010", "Minnesota Public radio, PoliGraph: Pawlenty spending claim lacks context, Jan. 27, 2011", "Minnesota Budget Project, Governor\u2019s budget spares K-12, but cost shifts remain, Feb. 22, 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
