The outcome of the race will help determine which party controls the U.S. Senate for the final two years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.", "Libertarian Amanda Swafford is also in the race, which will determine who succeeds retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss.", "PolitiFact Georgia decided to ponder Perdue\u2019s point -- with 100 members in the U.S. Senate, could only one in 10 senators have a background in business?", "We started with the Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Quarterly Roll Call Guide to the New Congress, two sources of detailed information on House and Senate members, including their average age, religion and education.", "In the 113th Congress, 27 senators identified \"business\" as their occupation, according to the groups\u2019 data. But it\u2019s more complicated than that.", "The law was the No. 1 occupation in the Senate (with 55 out of 100), followed by careers in public service and or politics (with 42 members listing that as their occupation), according to the data.", "Here\u2019s the complication: There were two qualifiers to the data. In responding to a survey by Congressional Quarterly, some members of Congress listed more than one occupation, and members of Congress may not have been practicing their listed profession immediately before they entered Congress.", "As for Perdue, he is using a number that campaign researchers gleaned by going through the biographies of all 100 senators, said Derrick Dickey, Perdue\u2019s spokesman.", "\"The occupational summary information available online was fairly generic and did not describe primary work responsibilities,\" Dickey said.", "He said the campaign research zeroed in on senators who worked in the corporate world or had responsibility for a company\u2019s profit and loss margins.", "\"Some of the members\u2019 primary occupations are debatable, which is why we use the language \u2018about 10,\u2019 \" Dickey said.", "Perdue isn\u2019t the first candidate to make his business background a key campaign focus.", "In 2010, businessman Ron Johnson unseated Russ Feingold, a three-term Wisconsin Democrat, in one of the most hotly contested Senate races of the midterms.", "Political pundits said Johnson capitalized on the electorate\u2019s economic angst with an ad that pointed out that the 100-member Senate had 57 lawyers, including Feingold, but just one accountant and no manufacturers.", "Johnson, who is an accountant and manufacturer, presented himself as a candidate with know-how to balance a budget and create jobs.", "Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said that a candidate promoting himself as a businessman is trying to project the image of someone who is \"practical, knows the value of hard work and knows how to balance a budget.\"", "\"In this particular case, though, I doubt Perdue has any occupational edge over Nunn,\" Sabato said. \"Running a nonprofit requires some of the same skills, and the Points of Light foundation has the added advantage of being tied to a former GOP president -- no doubt one reason why Nunn stresses it.\"", "So where does this leave us?", "Perdue identified \"about 10\" business people in the Senate. His campaign research was more narrowly focused on people with responsibility for a company\u2019s bottom line.", "But the overarching theme of Perdue\u2019s statement is correct. Members who are or consider themselves as business people are in the minority in the U.S. Senate.
