And the ranges for the 2011 to 2012 and 2013 to 2014 survey periods aren\u2019t all that different from one another.", "Overall, the researchers concluded the obesity rate for 2- to 5-year-olds rose steadily until it peaked in 2003 to 2004, and then began to decline.", "But\u00a0Michael Goran, an expert in childhood obesity at the University of Southern California, isn\u2019t completely convinced by these numbers.", "\u201cThere has not been a consistent fall in obesity levels and levels tend to fluctuate from year to year,\u201d he\u00a0told us by email. \u201cWe need to see a consistent change to make any more definitive conclusions.\u201d", "Goran added\u00a0\u201cthere is no way to directly link/draw a line between what Let\u2019s Move did and changes in the obesity rate,\u201d\u00a0as Obama claimed.", "Polacsek, at the University of New England, also told us there\u2019s \u201cno evidence\u201d that Let\u2019s Move\u00a0\u201cdirectly affected the obesity rate.\u201d", "Polacsek added that\u00a0it \u201cwould be very difficult to tie\u201d Let\u2019s Move \u201cback directly to national obesity rates especially given that obesity is a multifactorial problem and so many other programs were working to impact obesity rates at the same time.\u201d", "Polacsek held back\u00a0from making a definitive claim on\u00a0whether or not\u00a0there\u2019s a solid declining\u00a0trend in obesity rates for 2- to 5-year-olds. But she did acknowledge that obesity prevalence percentages\u00a0for 2- to 5-year-olds\u00a0\u201cjump around quite a bit.\u201d The number of participants for each survey period \u201care actually pretty small once they are broken down by age,\u201d she explained, and the\u00a0\u201csmaller the numbers in analyses\u2014the more likely they are to jump around.\u201d This means that Ogden\u2019s analysis is \u201cmost useful when looking at multi-year trends but no conclusions should be drawn from one data point to the next,\u201d added Polacsek.", "However, the CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture does have some additional evidence supporting\u00a0a downward trend.", "Researchers at these agencies looked at obesity trends from 2000 to 2014 for\u00a0children ages 2 to 4 years old from low-income families who participated in the\u00a0Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.
