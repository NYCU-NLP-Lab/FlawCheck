Drinking to this level on a very frequent basis can be indicative of a problem, although there is not a clear consensus on exactly how often -- and this by itself does not constitute an alcohol use disorder.", "Officially, the same survey found that 14.1 million adults -- 9 million men and 5.1 million women -- have alcohol use disorder.

However, by citing only this study, Ojeda glosses over the reality that a different federal study showed rates about half as high. Researchers have suggested that the dueling studies may be reporting divergent numbers due to differences in their methodologies. At this point, it\u2019s impossible to say whether the 12.7% statistic is accurate or if it\u2019s actually half that.
