["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on July 19, 2016 | Updated on July 21, 2016", "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says there is \u201cno way that Melania Trump was plagiarizing Michelle Obama\u2019s speech.\u201d Paul Manafort,\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, called the allegation \u201cabsurd.\u201d", "We were reluctant to join the pack in pointing out the obvious when the two convention speeches are compared. Melania Trump is the spouse of the Republican candidate, is not running for office, and likely read from a script that was handed to her, even though she earlier had taken credit for writing the speech \u201cwith as little help as possible.\u201d", "But Manafort, who made his comments on CNN, and Christie, who spoke about it on CNN and NBC, are political pros spinning the facts.", "Manafort flatly denied that there was any plagiarism of Obama\u2019s 2008 convention speech by Trump\u2019s speech writers.", "Manafort, July 19:\u00a0There\u2019s no cribbing of Michelle Obama\u2019s speech. These were common words and values. She cares about her family. Things like that. I mean, she was speaking in front of 35 million people last night. She knew that. To think that she would be cribbing Michelle Obama\u2019s words is crazy.", "Christie, a former prosecutor, told Matt Lauer on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday Show\u201d that 93 percent of Melania\u2019s speech was \u201ccompletely different.\u201d He also told CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel it isn\u2019t plagiarism \u201cif we\u2019re talking about 7 percent of a speech.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s no way that Melania Trump was plagiarizing Michelle Obama\u2019s speech,\u201d Christie told Gangel.", "Here is one section from the speeches of Michelle Obama and Melania Trump.\u00a0We\u2019ve bolded the identical and nearly identical language.", "Michelle Obama, Aug. 25, 2008:\u00a0Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you\u2019re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don\u2019t know them, and even if you don\u2019t agree with them.", "And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generation. Because we want our children \u2014 and all children in this nation \u2014 to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.", "And here is Trump:", "Melania Trump, July 18, 2016:\u00a0From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise, that you treat people with respect.", "They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily lives. That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son.\u00a0And we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow. Because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.", "We get that both speakers are expressing common values \u2014 as both Manafort and Christie pointed out. But the language is mostly identical in these passages, and for Manafort, in particular, to deny the obvious is \u2014 to use his word \u2014 \u201cabsurd.\u201d", "Update, July 20: Meredith McIver, a writer for the Trump Organization, said she wrote the passages that mirrored the language of Michelle Obama\u2019s speech. In a statement issued by the campaign, McIver apologized and offered an explanation of what happened.", "During a phone call, McIver said Melania Trump \u201cread me some passages from Michelle Obama\u2019s speech\u201d as examples of what she wanted to say. \u201cI wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in the draft that ultimately became the final speech,\u201d McIver said. \u201cI did not check Mrs. Obama\u2019s speeches. This was my mistake.\u201d", "Update, July 21: Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, said at a July 21 press conference that he did not know McIver was involved in writing Melania Trump\u2019s speech until after he had denied the allegations of plagiarism. \u201cWhen she came forward, we immediately put forward the statement,\u201d he said.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d03ecb7c-0272-4f67-b8a3-57f44352f5ea", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
