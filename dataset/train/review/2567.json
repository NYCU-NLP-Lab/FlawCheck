Rob Portman, R-Ohio, addresses delegates at the Republican National Convention in Tampa.", "When Barack Obama was seeking the presidency in 2008, Republicans frequently derided his career experience, saying it was limited to a scant four years in the U.S. Senate, some time in the Illinois Senate, and having been a \"community organizer\" in Chicago.\n\nThe GOP has often returned to that theme, asserting that Obama doesn\u2019t have the business savvy and private-sector experience to lead the country out of the economic doldrums. And it has reached a fever pitch with a Republican National Convention dominated by criticism of Obama\u2019s comment that business people \"didn\u2019t build\" their businesses. (We\u2019ve checked that contentious comment here.)\n\nDuring his speech to delegates in Tampa, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio -- widely considered a finalist for the vice presidential slot eventually given to Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan -- brought up Obama\u2019s career history again. He contrasted Obama\u2019s work experiences with those of GOP nominee Mitt Romney, whose work has primarily been as a business executive.\n\n\"Then you have Barack Obama, who never started a business--never even worked in business,\" Portman said.\n\nObama\u2019s work experience, or lack thereof, is well-plowed ground. So we thought we'd explore whether the president has ever worked in a business. (We interpreted Portman\u2019s statement to mean that Obama had never worked in a private, profit-making enterprise.)\n\nAs PolitiFact first noted two years ago, the president does, in fact, have some experience in business.\n\nIn 1983 and 1984, he had a stint as a research assistant at Business International Corp. in New York City, where he helped write a newsletter.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2004, he was an associate, and then a partner, at the Chicago law firm of Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, where his work included employment-discrimination and voting-rights cases. (The job also overlapped with his time in the Illinois Legislature.)\n\nIf you count the best-selling books that have brought Obama millions of dollars in royalties, he also knows something about entrepreneurship.\n\nOur rating\n\nClearly, Obama has had less experience in the private sector than Romney; before he became president, he spent most of his working life either in the non-profit sector or in politics. However, Portman went too far when he said that Obama has \"never even worked in business.\" We rate the statement False.", "Rob Portman, speech to the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Aug. 29, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, \"Romney says Barack Obama has no private sector experience,\" Oct. 18, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, \"Joe Scarborough: President Obama has never received a paycheck from a profitmaking business in his entire life,\" April 15, 2009", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
