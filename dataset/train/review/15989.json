Not to be confused with the federal legislation that was proposed by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and bears the same name, New York City\u2019s plan aims to reduce approximately 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. One way it seeks to accomplish that goal is by reducing \"carbon intensive consumption.\"", "\"The city will end unnecessary purchases of single-use plastic foodware, phase out the purchase of processed meat, reduce the purchase of beef by 50% and commit to a carbon neutral city fleet by 2040,\" says an outline of the plan on the city\u2019s website.", "So, the city is instituting rules for what the city government purchases and sells.

Processed meat will be replaced by healthier proteins, including an increase in plant-based options.\"", "The city\u2019s 11 public hospitals have started offering such options, the report says, and starting next school year all schools will serve vegetarian meals on Mondays (aka \"Meatless Mondays\").", "Our ruling", "New York City plans to phase out its purchase of processed meat\u2014like hot dogs\u2014as part of its efforts to confront the climate crisis and improve health inequities among residents.
