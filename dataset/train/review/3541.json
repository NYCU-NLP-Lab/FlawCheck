Gerry Connolly, D-Va., said that the U.S. has 3 percent of the world's oil reserves but consumes 25 percent of the world's oil. We checked his statistic.", "During a House floor speech on May 3, 2011, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., addressed the recent jump in gasoline prices, saying that energy independence and lower gasoline prices will come from higher automobile fuel efficiency and new sources of domestic energy, including wind, solar and biofuels.\n\nIn making the argument, Connolly cited a statistic showing how out-of-proportion the United States\u2019 oil consumption is.\n\n\"America owns 3 percent of the world\u2019s oil but consumes 25 percent of its global reserves,\" Connolly said.\n\nWe thought we\u2019d check his statistic.\n\nWe turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal clearinghouse for energy statistics.\n\nFor the first part of Connolly\u2019s statement -- \"America owns 3 percent of the world\u2019s oil\" -- we turned to a table showing proven reserves of crude oil internationally.\n\nFor 2009 -- the most recent year with full data available -- the United States had proven reserves of slightly under 20.7 billion barrels, compared with more than 1.34 trillion barrels for the world as a whole. That works out to be 1.5 percent of the world total -- about half of what Connolly said, but still a small percentage of the global total.\n\nAs for the second part of his statement -- that the U.S. \"consumes 25 percent of (the world\u2019s) global reserves\" -- we found an EIA table showing international oil consumption.\n\nFor 2009, the U.S. consumed 18.8 million barrels a day, compared with 84.3 million barrels a day for the world as a whole. That works out to 22 percent -- a little low, but once again, in the right ballpark.\n\nWhen we checked with Connolly\u2019s office, they sent us a few documents with figures more in line with the ones the congressman had cited, but when we looked at them, we noticed that they cited statistics from between 1999 and 2004. So we\u2019ll stick with our numbers.\n\nBottom line: Connolly\u2019s numbers are a little low because they are out of date, but his general point -- the U.S. consumes a disproportionate share of the world\u2019s oil -- is valid.
