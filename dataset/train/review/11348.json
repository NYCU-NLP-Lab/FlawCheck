Bernie Sanders.", "Discussion of the proposal did not stop at the debate stage. As the candidates took the topic to the cable networks over the weekend, so too did the pundits.", "In a June 30 roundtable on CNN\u2019s \"State of the Union,\" conservative commentator David Urban said Democrats will risk losing to President Donald Trump in 2020 if they continue driving each other to the left.", "Democratic strategist Jess McIntosh, the editor of Shareblue Media and former vice president of communications for Emily\u2019s List, pushed back.", "\"I just think we have this erroneous idea that some of these policies that are being perceived or portrayed in the media as super lefty are actually enjoying really widespread (support),\" she said. \"Fifty percent of Republicans are in favor of Medicare for All.\"", "Urban dismissed McIntosh\u2019s claim, cutting her off and telling her amid the crosstalk to \"be very factual.\"", "So, we checked the facts. As it turns out, Republican support for the type of Medicare for All bill that Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have put their names behind is not that high.", "A greater share of Republicans have supported similar but more incremental approaches, which would add a government insurance option but would not eliminate all private coverage.", "The term \"Medicare for All\" most often refers to Sanders\u2019 plan to create a single, national health-insurance program covering everyone in the United States. Its name makes it sound like an expansion of Medicare, but\u00a0aside from being administered by the government, it would bear little resemblance to the health plan for people older than 65.", "The Sanders plan proposes broad coverage that would replace most forms of private insurance, along with both Medicaid and Medicare. The government would set payment rates for services, drugs and medical equipment, and individuals would face no costs in the form of premiums, deductibles, copays or coinsurance.", "(For more on what Medicare for All is and is not, read our in-depth analysis of the proposal).", "Other Democrats vying for the party\u2019s nomination have made the case for so-called \"public-option\" plans, which would make government-run insurance available while keeping private insurance intact for those who want it.

She was talking instead about the Democratic field more generally \u2014 \"most of whom favor some kind of option like the one Kaiser polled,\" she said.", "But language matters. The phrase \"Medicare for All\" might call to mind different things for different people, but it ultimately refers to proposals, like Sanders\u2019, that do not leave open the option for people to retain their private insurance.", "Because the proposal\u2019s terminology is so ambiguous, its meaning can get lost and certain polling questions can be misleading.", "The same Kaiser poll also found that total support for Medicare for All dropped when pollsters said explicitly that the plan would get rid of private insurance.", "Other polls, which asked slightly less exact questions, returned different results.
