Trump continued to promote his pledge during his presidency, but Republican efforts to eliminate the law have failed.", "Trump has falsely claimed that he \"saved pre-existing conditions in your health care.\" Trump has supported the law\u2019s repeal without offering a replacement that would keep pre-existing protections intact. Meanwhile, he has promoted the expansion of short-term health policies that don\u2019t offer the ACA\u2019s protections for pre-existing conditions.", "Trump said Biden \"will destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions.\"", "There is no basis for this claim.
