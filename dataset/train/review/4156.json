It's prioritization. It's inaction & word salad on an urgent public health & safety issue. Haven For Hope in San Antonio works. Lawlessness is never the answer.\"", "Haven for Hope is a shelter-like program in San Antonio that operates using private and government funding. In its latest budget, the city of San Antonio allocated more than $500,000 for the program.", "Abbott repeated his estimate about Austin in an interview on Austin television station KXAN.", "\"The city of Austin is tapping into their taxpayers for more than $20,000 per homeless person,\" Abbott said. \"If they can\u2019t get this problem fixed by spending $20,000 or more per homeless person, the problem is not the homeless.
