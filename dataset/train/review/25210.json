Among those to previously debunk it, PolitiFact thoroughly dissected the claim in 2011.", "In reality, transcripts show King often openly rejected the party binary.", "In a 1956 speech, for example, he said: \u201cActually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic Party.\u201d The same year, in a letter citing his uncertainty about for whom he would vote for president, he wrote that, \u201cIn the past I have always voted the Democratic ticket.\u201d", "And in 1958, he\u00a0noted: \u201cI don\u2019t think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party.

L. tended to vote Democrat, but remained independent because he found weaknesses in both parties.\u201d", "Likewise, two of King\u2019s children, Martin Luther King III and Bernice King, have both denied that their father was a Republican.", "In a statement provided to the Associated Press in 2008, King III said: \u201cIt is disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican. He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican. It is even more outrageous to suggest that he would support the Republican Party of today, which has spent so much time and effort trying to suppress African American votes in Florida and many other states.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201c\u2018Desegregation and the Future,\u2019 Address Delivered at the Annual Luncheon of the National Committee for Rural Schools.\u201d The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute, Stanford University.
