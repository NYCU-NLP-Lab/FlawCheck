Strickland in this campaign bragged about his A-plus rating with the NRA,\" Portman said, when a question was posed to him about the candidates\u2019 records on gun issues. \"I\u2019m not talking about years ago, I\u2019m talking about this campaign. He has said he has a \u2018mixed and spotty\u2019 record on this issue and that he can be criticized for it. Those are his words, not mine.

Gov. Strickland, I know you are a big supporter of the president and when you campaigned for him in 2012 you wrote an article about his support for the Second Amendment.

As a congressman, I had an A and most of the time an A+ rating with the National Rifle Association. That has been my position, and it is my position.\"", "Strickland had to clarify his stance on guns in a Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board interview of Democratic primary candidates for Senate in February 2016.
