And what would that mean for Julia?\n\nObama\u2019s first law\n\nThe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first bill signed by President Barack Obama on Jan. 29, 2009, made it easier for workers to pursue wage discrimination claims. Just seven Republicans voted for the bill.\n\nIt updated 1960s civil rights and age discrimination laws to reset the statute of limitations on such claims with each new paycheck. In 2007, the Supreme Court had ruled in Ledbetter vs. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. that the 180-day statute of limitations started from the day an employer made the decision to discriminate \u2014 making it harder for employees who claimed such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay.\n\nJust what did Romney have to say about the law? We asked the Romney and Obama campaigns and conducted our own search.\n\nRomney\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond, but the Obama campaign pointed us to a Washington Post blog post and an ABC News interview.", "The Washington Post report by Greg Sargent, the week before the ABC News interview, was based on an April 11, 2012, \u00a0conference call between Romney advisers and reporters.\n\nIn a clip, Sam Stein, a political reporter at the Huffington Post, asks, \"Does Gov. Romney support the Lilly Ledbetter Act?\"\n\nA Romney adviser answers, \"Sam, we\u2019ll get back to you on that.\"\n\nSargent, in his blog post, cites a TPM report that Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul later clarified in an email: \"He supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law.\"\n\nSo, Romney\u2019s advisers didn\u2019t say \"whether he would have vetoed or signed\" the act. But it\u2019s a stretch to say he \"refused\" to say \u2014 the question wasn\u2019t about whether he would have vetoed or signed the law, but whether he supported it.\n\nWhat about the ABC News interview?\n\nOn April 16, 2012, reporter Diane Sawyer asked Romney, \" If you were president \u2014 you had been president \u2014 would you have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Law?\"\n\nHere\u2019s how Romney responded:", "ROMNEY: \"It's certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing. I wasn't there three years ago \u2014\"", "SAWYER: \"But would you have signed it?\"", "ROMNEY: \"... I'm not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say had I been there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and \u2014 and have no intention of changing that law, don't think there's a reason to.\"", "In this case, Romney did refuse to say whether he would have signed the bill. But he also said he supported \"equal pay for women\" and had \"no intention of changing that law.\"\n\nThose news reports were consistent with others we found.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Obama campaign said Romney \"has refused to say whether he would have vetoed or signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\" That\u2019s essentially what happened in Romney\u2019s ABC News interview in April, but the claim leaves out some details that matter to Julia.", "The relevant point for Julia isn't whether Romney would sign the bill \u2014 it's already the law \u2014 but his decision not to change it. Romney also said he \u00a0\"certainly support(s) equal pay for women,\" and has \"no intention of changing that law.\"\n\nStill, the Obama campaign is correct that he dodged the question, so we rate the claim Mostly True.", "CORRECTION: A previous version of this item said the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision made it \"impossible for employees who learned of such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay.\" In fact, the court declined to address the question of whether employees who learned of discrimination after the statute of limitations expired would be protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.", "Barack Obama for President, \"The Life of Julia,\" accessed May 8, 2012\n\nGovernment Printing Office, Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, accessed May 8, 2012\n\nLibrary of Congress\u2019 Thomas, CRS Summary of Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, accessed May 8, 2012\n\nU.S. Senate, Vote on Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Jan. 22, 2009\n\nU.S. House, Vote on Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Jan. 27, 2009\n\nCornell University Law School, \"Ledbetter v.
