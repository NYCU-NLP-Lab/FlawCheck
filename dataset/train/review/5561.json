In other words, the most plentiful ingredient (by weight) is listed first, and the least plentiful ingredient is last. Looking at a label of Haribo Gummy Bear ingredients, we see that carnauba wax is listed last, even after artificial colors such as Yellow #5, Red #40, and Blue #1:", "In an article discussing the ingredients of gummi candies in general (not specifically the Haribo Gold Bear brand), carnauba wax is mentioned as a 2% polishing agent. That is, the carnauba wax that is applied to the outside of the gummi candies consists of only 2% carnauba wax along with other ingredients (e.g., water, mineral oils, vegetable oils).", "No articles we could find provide an exact amount of carnauba wax used an ingredient in gummies and other candies, but its volume in a given candy appears to be fairly minor.", "On Drugs.com, carnauba wax is described as \u201ca safe, non-toxic, and inert ingredient.\u201d The melting point of carnauba wax is 180 degrees Fahrenheit, which means it doesn\u2019t melt in the human body and passes, unabsorbed, through our intestinal systems.", "In contrast, car waxes typically contain approximately 30% carnauba wax (and presumably taste quite a bit different).", "Readers may also be interested in knowing that carnauba wax not only appears in jelly beans, Gob Stoppers, Skittles, Dubble Bubble gumballs, and a variety of other candies with hard shiny exteriors, but it is also used as a coating on medications to make them easier to swallow.", "Burg, James C. \u00a0 \u201cGenerating Yummy Gummies.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Natural Products Insider. \u00a0 1 May 1998.", "Kuntzleman, Tom. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFun with M&Ms.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ChemEdExchange. \u00a0 4 May 2013.", "Oldham, DeAnn. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs Carnauba Wax Bad for You?\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 IsItBadForYou.com. \u00a0 14 April 2016.", "Stephanie Larsen is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
