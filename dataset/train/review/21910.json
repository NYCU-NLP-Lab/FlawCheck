This is a time for men and women who are ready to confront our challenges with humility and with purpose.\"", "Hold on; Texas is growing two times as fast as the other 49 states combined?", "By email, Straus spokesman Jason Embry pointed toward U.S. Census Bureau data as the basis of the claim.", "Texas\u2019s population growth", "According to the Census breakdown, from April 2010 to July 2014, the U.S. population grew 3.3 percent.
