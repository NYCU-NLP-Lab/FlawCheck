Credit: Governor Tom Wolf/Flickr", "Gov. Tom Wolf this week pushed for a severance tax on natural gas produced in Pennsylvania to help finance infrastructure improvements and a plan he hopes will put residents who lost their jobs in the pandemic back to work.", "He touted the proposed tax by describing Pennsylvania as an outlier in taxing natural gas drilling.", "\"We\u2019re the only major gas-producing state in the U.S. that doesn\u2019t have a severance tax,\" he said, referring to a tax on raw materials extracted from the ground.", "We wondered if that\u2019s true.", "Wolf is right. Among the 34 states that produce oil or natural gas, Pennsylvania is the only one that doesn\u2019t tax the extracted resources. (They\u2019re called \"severance\" taxes because they tax materials severed from the ground.) Instead, Pennsylvania charges an annual impact fee for every gas well that\u2019s drilled.", "The difference between the taxes levied by other big natural gas producers like Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, and the fee Pennsylvania charges is the revenue they generate.", "The left-leaning Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center has estimated that while the state\u2019s impact fee will continue generating up to $227 million a year, a severance tax could bring in an additional $1.7 billion over five years.", "The particulars of the severance taxes imposed elsewhere vary by state.", "For example, Texas charges a 7.5% tax on the market value of oil and natural gas extracted within its borders. Oklahoma charges 7% of the gross value of oil and gas production, in addition to a fee on new wells drilled. Louisiana\u2019s gas severance tax rate adjusts annually but never falls below 7%.", "Wolf first proposed a severance tax on natural gas drilling when he ran for governor in 2014, and he pitched one with the budget each of his first four years in office. All those efforts failed, so in 2019, after winning reelection, he tried a new approach \u2014 a tax whose revenue would be earmarked for infrastructure projects. But that effort stalled, too.", "At issue is the widely held belief among lawmakers from Southwestern Pennsylvania \u2014 where much of the state\u2019s natural gas fracturing, or \"fracking,\" takes place \u2014 that a severance tax would cripple an important industry in the state.", "One Republican lawmaker from Beaver County recently told the Beaver County Times that Wolf\u2019s latest attempt to impose a severance tax on natural gas production would be \"dead on arrival\" in the Republican-controlled state House. Even Democrats who represent the region have called Wolf\u2019s tax \"misguided.\"", "Wolf said Pennsylvania is \"the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn\u2019t have a severance tax.\" That\u2019s correct. Pennsylvania does not tax the materials extracted from the ground, as many other gas-producing states do. We rate Wolf\u2019s statement True.", "PAcast, \"Governor Wolf Unveils Workforce and Economic Development Plan to Get Pennsylvania Back to Work,\" Feb. 22, 2021", "Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \"Governor Wolf: Restore Pennsylvania is Still the Only Comprehensive Plan to Address Community Infrastructure Needs,\" Jan. 28, 2020", "WGAL, \"Gov.
