We looked at a claim about whether McCain has said he doesn't understand the economy, when then-Republican primary opponent Mitt Romney brought it up. See our ruling\n\nhere\n\n. We've also looked at whether McCain would offer any tax relief to\n\nmiddle class people\n\n.\nHere, we will look at the claims about McCain's computer acumen.", "In an interview for Yahoo News in January, Mike Allen, chief political correspondent for\n\nPolitico\n\n, a Washington-based newspaper, asked several Republican candidates at the time whether they prefer a Mac or a PC.", "\"Neither,\" McCain replied. \"I am an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that I can get.\"", "In a July 11 interview with the\n\nNew York Times,\n\nMcCain hardly sounded like he has since gone techie.", "In answer to a question about what Web sites he looks at regularly, McCain said aides \"show me\" the Drudge Report, Politico.com and sometimes Real Clear Politics.

I read e-mails all the time, but the communications that I have with my friends and staff are oral and done with my cell phone. I have the luxury of being in contact with them literally all the time. We now have a phone on the plane that is usable on the plane, so I just never really felt a need to do it. But I do \u2014 could I just say, really \u2014 I understand the impact of blogs on American politics today and political campaigns. I understand that. And I understand that something appears on one blog, can ricochet all around and get into the evening news, the front page of the\n\nNew York Times.\n\nSo, I do pay attention to the blogs.
