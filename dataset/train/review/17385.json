["On March 20, the Facebook page Unbelievable Facts shared a graphic on the origins of the 1918 flu pandemic\u2019s more common name, the \u201cSpanish flu.\u201d", "According to the post, the pandemic earned the name \u201cbecause during WWI, wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality\u201d in combating nations \u201cbut the papers were free to report the epidemic\u2019s effects in neutral Spain, which created a false impression of Spain as being especially hard hit.\u201d", "Unbelievable Facts, which brands itself as \u201cyour source for the best bizarre, strange and extraordinary stories on the internet,\u201d has more than 8.3 million\u00a0followers on Facebook. The post in question has 6,100 reactions and about 1,300\u00a0shares on the site.", "When it was discovered, the 1918 flu virus was spreading in a world at war. Because of the turmoil that World War I had wrought on societies around the globe, it\u2019s difficult for scientists and historians today to piece together the exact origins of the virus.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states there is no universal consensus as to the origins of the virus, though experts have theorized about origins as disparate as China, France, the United States and United Kingdom. Others have argued the virus was likely circulating in European armies for months \u2013 and potentially even years \u2013 before it was officially discovered. The CDC states that the first confirmed cases in the United States were military personnel in the spring of 1918.", "\u201cWe don't know and will probably never know,\u201d John M. Barry, the author of \"The Great Influenza,\"\u00a0a history of the 1918 flu, told USA TODAY. In his book, Barry advanced the theory that the virus began in rural Kansas, but \u201cwork since then has caused me to back away from that. The best evidence points to China. Other theories suggest France or Vietnam.\u201d", "Fact check:Coronavirus originated in China, not elsewhere, researchers and studies say", "The comparatively mild effect\u00a0the 1918 flu had on China has led some researchers to suspect that the virus or a related milder strain began there earlier, meaning the population had a higher level of immunity to the disease when it reached pandemic levels elsewhere. This research is\u00a0disputed, however, notably because data from China\u2019s Warlord Period is arguably less reliable.", "The 1918 flu was an H1N1 virus with genes indicating it likely originated in birds. This makes it like the H1N1 strain that caused the swine flu pandemic of 2009. Unlike swine flu, however, the 1918 flu was far more damaging for the world; an estimated third of the world\u2019s population was infected, with about 50 million people dying from the virus.", "Unlike most influenza viruses, the 1918 flu was most lethal for\u00a0people ages 20-40 and young children. Researchers don\u2019t fully understand why this was the case, though the lack of a vaccine, poor sanitary conditions and no coordinated response nations likely contributed to the disastrous impact. The possibility of a similar virus having spread during the youth of 1918's older population may be\u00a0 why those 65 and older had a lower mortality rate than would be expected.", "A key factor that made both mitigating the virus and tracing its impact difficult today is that governments at the time downplayed the issue. Countries did not want to lower national morale or cause panic while also fighting what was then the largest and most costly war in history.", "Public health officials in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States all downplayed the spread of the virus, treating it as a normal influenza virus or cases of \u201csimple pneumonia\u201d found in the ranks of soldiers.", "\u201cThe U.S. didn't formally censor,\u201d Barry said, but the mainstream press and government institutions instead opted\u00a0for a kind of \u201cself-censorship.\u201d This strategy ultimately proved more damaging, because\u00a0when the gravity of the situation became unavoidable, governments had lost their credibility about the pandemic.", "The pressures of the global conflict weren\u2019t present in the Kingdom of Spain, which was neutral in World War I. As such, Spanish public officials and media more readily reported on the crisis as it spread throughout the country.", "Additionally, King Alfonso XIII of Spain also fell gravely ill with the virus, heightening press coverage in the country and grabbing headlines elsewhere. There is no evidence, however, that the virus began in Spain, nor is there any indication that the virus was especially worse in Spain\u00a0than anywhere else in Europe.", "Though it is difficult to determine from the historical record where the 1918 flu virus originated and how it spread across the globe, the origins of its common name are not in doubt. The Spanish press, being those most likely to report on the virus and its spread, also gave the false impression at the time that the disease originated there.", "The name \u201cSpanish flu\u201d has accompanied the 1918 pandemic ever since, largely because other countries were unwilling or uninterested in reporting on the outbreak within their own borders. We rate this claim TRUE, based on our research."]
