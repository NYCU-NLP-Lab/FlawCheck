Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff.", "A May 17 attack ad from McCain against Kirkpatrick, who\u2019s running for McCain\u2019s Senate seat, is a case in point.", "In addition to the claim that the healthcare law is her \"proudest\" vote, the ad\u2019s on-screen text states, \"30,000 Arizonans may have no choice\" for healthcare coverage, citing the departure of UnitedHealthCare, the nation\u2019s largest insurer, from the state\u2019s marketplace.", "\"That\u2019s devastating, especially to rural counties,\" the ad\u2019s narrator points out.", "While folks who have United will be insured through Dec. 31, 2016, we wondered whether thousands of Arizonans really won\u2019t have a health care coverage choice come 2017. \u00a0(No coverage results in a penalty.)", "Background", "United announced in April that it would stop Affordable Care Act coverage in Arizona - and most of the 34 states it has plans in - by year\u2019s end.", "May 11 was the deadline for health insurers to submit their 2017 Affordable Care Act state coverage plans to the federal government, which runs HealthCare.gov.

Insurers note that people in rural areas tend to be sicker and rack up more health care costs. But rural areas also have fewer physicians than urban areas.", "Our ruling", "McCain\u2019s campaign ad said, \"30,000 Arizonans may have no choice\" for Affordable Care Act coverage.", "The 30,000 number is just a snapshot of how many people have bought coverage through the exchange in those eight Arizona counties.
