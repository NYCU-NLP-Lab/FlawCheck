["About this rating", "In late May and early June of 2020, following the death of an unarmed black man named George Floyd while pinned to the ground by a white Minneapolis police officer, demonstrations against police violence toward black citizens drew massive crowds in several major cities. These events drew attention not only to systemic problems in American policing, but also to police tactics used for crowd control or riots. One such observation, made in a Twitter post that went viral, was that non-uniformed NYPD police officers involved in arresting protesters wore white arm bands:", "First, a clarification. The individuals shown above are not technically \u201cundercover cops.\u201d They are, instead, plainclothes police officers. In addition to their arm bands, they also have visible police body cameras and handcuffs in their back pockets, along with other fairly obvious indications of their status as law enforcement officers. In other words, plainclothes officers are equipped with the same basic equipment a uniformed patrol officer would have, but do not conspicuously advertise their affiliation to the police with a uniform. Undercover police officers, on the other hand, would take active steps to fully conceal their connection to law enforcement.", "However, the claim that NYPD plainclothes police officers use arm bands to identify themselves is entirely factual. Known as the \u201ccolor of the day\u201d system, it was first introduced in 1971 by the NYPD\u2019s street crime unit. Because these plainclothes officers were armed and placed in positions that attracted muggings or similar crimes in public places, the NYPD was concerned about uniformed officers shooting the plainclothes officers working this job. The solution, as described in a 1979 history of the street crime unit, was colored arm bands:", "\"Elastic armbands are issued to each street crime unit member, with a color of the day being determined and relayed over the department teletype network to all commands and law enforcement agencies.\"", "Currently, the color of the day system applies to all NYPD plainclothes officers, and is a required part of the job, regardless of the presence of large demonstrations or protests, as stated in a 2017 NYPD patrol officer\u2019s manual. The color, the manual states, can be displayed as an arm band or a headband (emphasis ours):", "\"Uniformed members of the service assigned to civilian clothed enforcement duties are required to have their service 9MM semi-automatic pistol and one extra fully loaded magazine or their service .38 caliber revolver with twelve extra cartridges, handcuffs with key, ... and the 'color of the day' head/arm band on their persons.\"", "The tweet that went viral showed plainclothes NYPD officers wearing white arm bands, but the color, as previously mentioned, changes day by day. Here is a video taken of plainclothes officers from a day when the color was orange:", "Because it is publicly known that plainclothes officers identify each other with colored bands to prevent police-on-police shootings in New York City (and also in some police departments, predominantly in the Northeast), we rank this claim to be \"True.\"", "Supreme Court of the State of New York County of New York. \u00a0 \u201cAffidavit of David Cohen, Index No. 103802/2012\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2012.", "Krauss, Clifford. \u00a0 \"Subway Chaos: Officer Firing at Officer.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 24 August 1994.", "nyc.gov. \u00a0 \u201cNYPD Public Patrol Guide\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2017.", "O\u2019Brien, Robert. \u00a0 \"Friendly Fire: Identify Yourself As an Officer.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Police Magazine. \u00a0 16 May 2011.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
