["\u201cThis is the Gulf of Alaska where 2 oceans meet but never mix\u201d says a post shared in Canada on September 5. Multiple versions of posts making the same claim have been shared as far back as 2015, including this one from a Ghanaian actress which was shared nearly 900,000 times.", "The post was also popularized by multiple Facebook pages based in India (1, 2, 3), one as recently as June 2020.", "The false claim is made with one of three photos or videos, all from different sources.", "One version uses a photograph of a large two-toned body of water. Through a reverse image search in Google, AFP found that the original photograph was taken by Kent Smith on July 4, 2010 and uploaded to the photo sharing website Flickr.", "Flickr\u2019s geotagging feature shows that the photograph was taken in the Gulf of Alaska, but the photograph does not show two oceans meeting.", "Kent titled his Flickr page \u201cMerging Oceans\u201d but explains that he believes what he captured was a photo of fresh water glaciers melting into the saltier ocean.", "Melting glaciers and the expansion of ocean water as it warms from climate change accounted for most sea level rise through the 20th century, but ice sheet melt-off has become a major driver over the last decade.", "Jay Cullen, Professor of Chemical Oceanography at the University of Victoria, British Columbia, explained by email, \u201cThese are called fronts and are common in the ocean wherever there is a contrast in water density that resists physical mixing. Fronts are common anywhere you have freshwater from rivers entering the marine environment.\u201d", "A second version of this claim uses screenshots of a video which AFP determined in a previous fact-check was filmed in the Strait of Georgia, near Vancouver, Canada in July 2015.", "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible that people would steal a video and make false claims about it,\u201d\u00a0Steve-Pearson, who filmed the original video, told AFP via Facebook Messenger.", "The video\u2019s caption was clear that it was filmed from a ferry traveling from Nanaimo, Vancouver Island (Duke Point) to Vancouver (Tsawwassen). It also said, \u201cThe river water (Fraser River) flows into the ocean water (Strait of Georgia).\u201d", "The shape and logo of the ship featured in the video seems to match that of BCFerries\u2019 Coastal Inspiration ship, which travels the Vancouver to Vancouver island route.", "\u201cIf the picture comes from the Strait of Georgia, then the body of water discussed is in the Pacific Ocean basin\u201d Carolina Dufour, Assistant Professor of Physical Oceanography at McGill University told AFP by email.", "\u201cThe difference in colors is likely due to the composition of water, the grey-ish one could contain a lot of sediments suspended for instance, that could come from a river,\u201d she added.", "A third version of the claim includes a video, seemingly shot by a drone, of another two-toned body of water, claiming that it shows two oceans meeting in the Gulf of Alaska.", "Using InVid-WeVerify to get a frame-by-frame breakdown of the video, AFP was able to conduct a reverse image search.", "This showed that the original video was posted by Marlin Magazine, which specialises in big game fishing, in November 2015.", "\u201cA true showing of colors when the Gulf of Mexico meets the Mississippi River,\u201d reads the video\u2019s caption.", "\u201cI can verify that the video is indeed the Mississippi River meeting the Gulf of Mexico, so the claim of \u2018two oceans meeting but not mixing\u2019 is indeed false,\u201d a spokesperson for Marlin Magazine told AFP by email.", "McGill\u2019s Dufor explained, \u201cThe timescale for a river to discharge waters with a lot of sediments is short, days, compared to the time for the ocean to mix this new water with the rest, months or years.\u201d", "She added that many scientific papers have shown satellite images featuring the sharp contrasts in water color from these river plumes.", "\u201cWhile on site (e.g. from a boat), these contrasts might not be as sharp as the one people saw in the Strait of Georgia but the phenomenon is the same,\u201d Dufour concluded.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
