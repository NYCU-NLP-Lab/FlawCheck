Jerry Brown, perhaps tired of the job-poaching efforts of governors in Texas and Florida, shot back at Gov.

So we focused just on Brown\u2019s statement about California adding twice as many jobs as Florida, and whether there was any context missing.

One would expect California to add more jobs than Florida, to keep up with the millions more people who live here.", "For some context, we checked the states\u2019 job growth rates during this period.

Jerry Brown said California has added twice as many jobs as Florida since that state\u2019s governor visited in April 2015 on a job recruiting tour.", "Brown's claim is close on the raw numbers. But it leaves out the important context that California is a much larger state that needs to add more jobs to keep its millions more people employed.", "The federal jobs data show California added 1.86 times as many jobs as Florida during this period, a bit less than twice as many.", "California often leads the nation in overall job gains due to its sheer size. But the pace of that job growth tells a different story. Florida actually added jobs at a slightly faster rate, nearly 2.4 percent compared with California\u2019s 2.2 percent, during the period in question.
