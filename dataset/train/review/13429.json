["\u201cJoe Biden was wearing a wire, he was being fed information through an earpiece,\u201d claims a September 29, 2020 Facebook post on the night of the first presidential debate.", "Below, screenshots of the Cleveland, Ohio debate show dark areas on Biden\u2019s left wrist and chest that the post identifies as microphone components. It claims these were used to feed responses to the Delaware politician, whom he considers too \u201cincoherent\u201d to be able to debate appropriately on his own.", "Other users uploaded\u00a0low-resolution videos of the same segment on Facebook, making similar claims.", "The day of the debate, Trump\u2019s communications director Tim Murtaugh published a statement in which he declared that Biden had refused to go through a pre-debate hearing device search.", "\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s handlers several days ago agreed to a pre-debate inspection for electronic earpieces but today abruptly reversed themselves and declined,\u201d Murtaugh said in the statement, which also claimed that Biden\u2019s team had asked for multiple breaks during the debate, and that Barack Obama\u2019s vice president refused to undergo a drug test.", "\u201cOf course he\u2019s not wearing an earpiece and we never asked for breaks,\u201d Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told a Washington Post reporter the same day in response to Murtaugh\u2019s statement. Team Biden spokesman Andrew Bates confirmed Bedingfield\u2019s statement in an email to AFP.", "The first image shows something peeking out of Biden\u2019s left sleeve, as he raises his hand to cough, which posts identify as the microphone end of a wire.", "The moment can be found in CNN\u2019s footage of the debate at 3 minutes and 40 seconds, or on this ABC News footage at 2 hours 8 minutes and 19 seconds.", "However, the black spot is not a mic, but part of a rosary that the former VP wears in memory of his son Beau Biden who died of brain cancer in 2015.", "\u201cIt\u2019s Beau\u2019s rosary,\u201d Team Biden spokesman Bates said.", "Biden mentioned that his younger son Hunter bought rosaries for Beau and his dad in Mexico on the \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d show in November 2017.", "\u201cI have not taken off the rosary Beau was wearing when he passed, since then. It's my connection with him,\u201d he said at the time, after the camera zoomed in on his left wrist.", "The second image shows a thin black line briefly appearing on Biden\u2019s white shirt, on the right side of his chest, after the Democrat scratches his right shoulder.", "This segment can be found on CNN\u2019s footage starting at 34 minutes and 40 seconds, and on CSPAN\u2019s footage at one hour two minutes and 22 seconds.", "However, watching the entire segment instead of only the screenshot shows that the thin line is not a wire but a crease, caused by the movement of Biden\u2019s shirt as he scratches his shoulder. It disappears once a movement causes the shirt to stretch again.", "Biden called Trump\u2019s behavior during the debate a \u201cnational embarrassment,\u201d while on the campaign trail in Ohio. He defended his family against attacks, particularly when Trump raised his son Hunter\u2019s past drug abuse.", "Polls show Trump trailing Biden by 6.5 points. The president and his campaign team frequently attempt to portray Biden as too old and senile to serve, whether in ads or by using the nickname \u201cSleepy Joe.\u201d Online disinformation has exploited that theme, for example when a viral doctored video allegedly showed the Democrat sleeping.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
