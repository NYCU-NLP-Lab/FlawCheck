["New Zealand stunned India in the semifinal of the ICC World Cup 2019 played at Manchester. Following the sensational win by the Kiwis, social media was abuzz with the claim that an umpiring blooper had possibly cost India the match. A screenshot of the live broadcast of the match, taken right before MS Dhoni was run-out by a direct throw from the deep by Martin Guptill, has been circulated by social media users, alleging that Lockie Ferguson had bowled an illegal delivery because there were six players outside the inner circle.", "ICC rules state that only five fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle in the third powerplay of an innings, which is between overs 41-50 i.e the final ten overs of the innings. Some prominent social media users and influencers have drawn attention to this supposed error by the umpires who failed to take into account the fielding positions of the New Zealand players ahead of the delivery.", "CNN News18 anchor Anand Narasimhan posted the screenshot with a message, \u201cGlaring umpiring error?

In the course of the article, we shall analyse the field setting of each delivery starting from the first ball of the 49th over to the ball on which Dhoni was run-out by Guptill. We have corroborated the exact field setting for these three balls with visual, images and live commentary. It may be noted here that the fielders standing outside the 30-yard circle and their fielding positions are discussed in the context of the 49th over in the third powerplay, with an exception for the third ball.", "In a screenshot of the broadcast taken right before the first ball, one can see that there are five fielders outside the circle. The fielding positions were third man, deep fine leg, deep point, deep square leg and long-on.

The second delivery from Ferguson to Dhoni is fuller and straighter, and results in a dot.", "The field setting before the third ball, when Dhoni lost his wicket in the 49th over, was deep point, deep fine leg, deep square leg, deep mid-wicket and long-on.

The claim has become a major talking point on social media, with several prominent Twitter handles tweeting about the half-baked conspiracy theory and mainstream media outlets validating the same.
