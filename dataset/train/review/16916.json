["By Robert Farley", "Posted on August 22, 2019", "President Donald Trump has claimed no fewer than seven times over the past three years \u2014 including at a recent rally in New Hampshire \u2014 that he won Michigan\u2019s \u201cman of the year\u201d award. But there\u2019s no evidence that he did.", "We scoured news archives and searched the internet, and came up empty. Other media outlets have looked into it too, with a similar lack of results. And Trump\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t commenting.", "This is what we did find: It appears that Trump is referring to a 2013 dinner hosted by a county Republican Party organization, which presented him with token gifts \u2013 including a statuette of Abraham Lincoln. But a former Republican congressman who organized the dinner said Trump did not receive an award, and the group has never given out \u201cman of the year\u201d awards.", "The boast is politically expedient; Michigan is a key swing state in presidential elections. When referencing the award, Trump often notes he was the first Republican presidential candidate to win Michigan since 1988. Trump also often mentions his narrow win in Michigan as critical to his upset victory.", "\u201cFor many many years nobody won Michigan as a Republican,\u201d Trump said at the rally in New Hampshire on Aug. 15. \u201cBut I used to complain and you know I just \u2014 I\u2019d go there and I\u2019d say, they\u2019re stealing your car business. I go, for years. In fact, five or six years before I even thought about running, for whatever reason they named me \u2018man of the year\u2019 in Michigan. I said, \u2018How come?\u2019 I didn\u2019t even understand it myself. But I was named \u2018man of the year.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t even political. That was years before I did this. But I was always complaining that our car business is being stolen.\u201d", "As we said, it\u2019s a claim Trump has made repeatedly for years, according to searchable records of Trump\u2019s public comments archived by Factba.se.", "The earliest mention we could find was during a campaign speech Trump made two days before the election, on Nov. 6, 2016, in Sterling Heights, Michigan.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been fighting for the car industry for years,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was honored five years ago, \u2018man of the year\u2019 in Michigan. That was a great honor for me. And during my speech, all I talked about is what Mexico and these other countries are doing to us, and especially what they\u2019re doing to Michigan. That\u2019s all I talked about. And I was criticized. They said, \u2018Donald, speak about something else.\u2019 I said, \u2018No, what\u2019s happening is horrible. What\u2019s happening is terrible.\u2019 One of the main reasons I ran for president is to stop it.\u201d", "In one speech in Washington, Michigan, on April 28, 2018, Trump changed the award to Republican of the Year in Michigan.", "Trump, April 28, 2018. We have many, many car companies, you see what\u2019s going on. Toyota, many companies are opening up in Michigan. The cars are coming back to Michigan. The plants are coming back, they\u2019re being expanded. And by the way, do you remember about six years ago, I wasn\u2019t even running and they gave me an award, The Republican of the Year. I guess they probably, maybe they knew what was gonna happen. I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t running, long time ago. And I made a speech in Michigan thanking them for the award, saying, \u2018How horrible. How did you let this happen where all of these plants closed, move to Mexico, they build the cars in Mexico, they sell them across the border, no tax, we lose the jobs, we lose the taxes, we lose everything. How did anybody let this happen?\u2019 Guess what? Not happening anymore, folks.", "As we said, we could not find any such award bestowed on Trump (and neither could other news outlets, including CNN, Newsweek and HuffPost).", "We found that in 2014, the Somerset County Republican Organization in New Jersey honored Trump with the group\u2019s \u201cRepublican of the Year\u201d award. Trump\u2019s award came after he developed Trump National Country Club in Bedminster, which is located in Somerset County. He also snagged Time magazine\u2019s 2016 Person of the Year, and the Republican Party of Sarasota in Florida awarded Trump the organization\u2019s \u201cStatesman of the Year\u201d in 2012.", "But Trump\u2019s comments about the Michigan \u201cman of the year\u201d award are specific to that state.", "When boasting about the award, Trump usually mentions that he was given the award for speaking out about how U.S. auto jobs were foolishly being lost to Mexico. We reached out to the White House press office, which in turn referred us to Trump\u2019s campaign. A spokesman at the campaign, however, declined to comment.", "But in mid-August, a former Republican congressman from Michigan stepped forward\u00a0to correct the record.", "Former Rep. Dave Trott said Trump is referring to the Oakland County Republican Party\u2019s Lincoln Day Dinner in 2013. Trott, who was chairman of the dinner, invited Trump to speak at the event. In an interview with Michigan Live, Trott recalled that Trump delivered a \u201crambling speech touching every topic under the sun.\u201d Afterward, the organization presented Trump with a statuette of Abraham Lincoln, a framed copy of Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address and a tie, Trott said. But there was no award, he said.", "\u201cI was the organizer and chair of that, and we weren\u2019t handing out Man of the Year awards and never have,\u201d Trott told the Detroit News. \u201cThat\u2019s not part of the club\u2019s mission.\u201d", "Trott said he made the connection to the 2013 Lincoln Day Dinner because Trump referenced the \u201cman of the year\u201d award during a CEO roundtable in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on March 15, 2017. Trott, then-a congressman was in attendance, and Trump thanked him when discussing the award.", "\u201cAnd I want to thank you Dave [Trott],\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s true about about five or six years ago, I was given the \u2018man of the year\u2019 in Michigan. And I made a speech. I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be doing this. I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be running for president. I made a speech, I said, \u2018Your car industry is being stolen from you.'\u201d", "\u201cIs that right?\u201d Trump said, gesturing to Trott.", "Trott can be heard in the video responding, \u201cGreat speech.\u201d", "Trump then continued, \u201cAnd I spoke about it. And I think the people of Michigan never forgot that speech. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. And I want to thank you for your support. You were amazing, for a long time. Thank you, David.\u201d", "Trott has since soured some on Trump. Trott said divisive comments made by Trump were a \u201cfactor\u201d in his decision not to seek reelection in 2018.", "At the time of the roundtable, Trott told the Detroit News he didn\u2019t immediately correct Trump, \u201cBecause I sure wasn\u2019t comfortable correcting him in front of a group of automotive CEOs. It maybe would\u2019ve been embarrassing to him. Maybe not. I don\u2019t know. It would have been to me. I just nodded and said it was a great speech and pivoted to that. Which it was. The speech was very well-received.\u201d", "\u201cBut now that I\u2019m out of Congress,\u201d Trott, an attorney, told CNN. \u201cI feel comfortable correcting the story.\u201d", "The context of Trump\u2019s comments at the roundtable in Ypsilanti lends credence to the idea that Trump believes he received an award at the Lincoln Day Dinner in Michigan in 2013 \u2014 an event at which Trott says Trump was not awarded Michigan\u2019s \u201cman of the year.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s claim is vague enough \u2014 he hasn\u2019t provided an exact year or the name of the organization that supposedly honored him \u2014 that it makes it nearly impossible to entirely disprove. But the responsibility to back-up political claims rests with the politicians who made them, and in this case, neither the White House nor Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has provided any information on the president\u2019s boast. If any such proof ever emerges, we\u2019ll update our story.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
