["\u201cWal-Mart just told me they are not excepting cash,\u201d\u00a0claims a misspelled post\u00a0shared more than 100,000 times in Canada the United States. It continues: \u201cI showed them all a letter from a lawyer which says - if you\u2019re not accepting \u2018legal tender\u2019 in Canada or the United States, the debt is considered paid with no legal recourse.\u201d", "The post does not specify which Walmart store it is referring to or where the store was located.", "During the novel coronavirus pandemic, a shift toward cashless payments has increased, including Walmart encouraging customers to use the Walmart app for payments.", "However, a spokeswoman for the retail giant told AFP by email, \u201cWalmart Canada continues to accept cash.\u201d", "\u201cWe offer customers many choices to pay for in-store purchases, including cash, debit, credit, gift cards, prepaid debit and prepaid credit,\u201d she added.", "It is also false to claim that in either Canada or the United States a debt will be \u201cconsidered paid\u201d if an establishment refuses cash payment.", "\u201cIt is up to the seller to determine the method of payment accepted for transactions. No law requires anyone to accept bank notes or any other form of payment to settle a commercial transaction,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Bank of Canada told AFP via email.", "\u201cWhile the term \u2018legal tender\u2019 describes the money approved in a country for paying debts or settling commercial transactions, it does not force anyone to accept that form of payment,\u201d she added.", "The Bank of Canada has encouraged businesses to continue accepting cash payments despite the pandemic.", "\u201cThe risks posed from handling cash are no greater than those posed by touching other common surfaces like doorknobs, kitchen counters and handrails\u201d the spokeswoman added.", "As long as the merchant notifies the consumer that he refuses cash, \u201che can legally do so in Canada,\u201d said Alexandre Plourde, a lawyer and analyst at Option Consommateur, a Montreal-based consumer rights non-profit.", "\u201cThe \u2018letter from a lawyer\u2019 means nothing. It\u2019s just an opinion on a paper and you can\u2019t enforce anything with that.\u201d he added.", "The US Federal Reserve says on its website that \u201cThere is no federal statute mandating that a private business, a person, or an organization must accept currency or coins as payment for goods or services.\u201d", "Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst from the American Civil Liberties Union, argued even before the pandemic that cashless stores were hard on low-income communities. \u201cParticipation in a cashless society presumes a level of financial stability and enmeshment in bureaucratic financial systems that many people simply do not possess,\u201d he said.", "AFP Fact Check debunked similar claims that Whole Foods Market would no longer accept cash.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
