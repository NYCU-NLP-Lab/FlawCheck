The congresswoman\u2019s unwieldy hair and reddish face, combined with the night\u2019s darkness and other people nearby, makes the closeup of the two politicians\u2019 faces look like it could have been taken during a party.", "However, the photo used in posts was cropped and stripped of its original context.", "A Google reverse image search\u00a0leads to\u00a0an article from The Daily Caller featuring the same cropped version of the photo, credited to photographer Kevin Lamarque of Reuters.", "Searching for \u201cBarack Obama Nancy Pelosi Kevin Lamarque Reuters\u201d on Google reveals the original photo on the news agency\u2019s website.", "Its original caption reads \u201cU.S. President Barack Obama kisses House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi upon their return from Israel to Joint Base Andrews in Washington,\u201d and is dated September 30, 2016.", "Obama, Pelosi, and an entire US delegation were returning from an official visit to Israel, where they had attended the state funeral of former president Shimon Peres.", "\u201cThere is nothing to it,\u201d the photographer Lamarque told AFP in an email, confirming the trip but dismissing the claim that Pelosi was out of control.", "\u201cHe is not kissing a drunk Nancy Pelosi at a party,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wind was probably howling, like always on the airstrip, and one would usually look a bit disheveled after such a long journey!\u201d", "The original uncropped photo shows someone holding the handle of a travel suitcase in front of Obama and Pelosi, while the Speaker holds what appears to be a garment bag. A man who appears to be then-secretary of state John Kerry was also pictured, looking on from behind.", "Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, said that the she \u201cdoesn\u2019t drink\u201d alcohol in general. \u201cThis is false,\u201d he said of the recent claims that she was drunk.", "His statement echoes another from Pelosi\u2019s daughter Christine, who spoke up on Twitter in May 2019 after a doctored video making her mother appear drunk circulated on social media. Pelosi appeared to be slurring her words, but the video had in fact been slowed down to create such an effect, AFP Fact Check reported at the time.", "Republicans and their conservative allies have been pumping this despicable fake meme for years!

I fell, my husband fell and my employees fell. She dresses with really high heels, so the last thing I needed her to do was fall,\u201d she said on the phone.", "Morneault rejected the allegation that Pelosi was drunk in the photo.", "\u201cShe does not drink alcohol,\u201d she said.", "Pelosi is a regular visitor to Stackpole, Moore and Tryon.
