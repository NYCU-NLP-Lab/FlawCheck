Why is it especially challenging and difficult now? Because the entire system under United States law that has been in place throughout administrations of both parties was dismantled in its entirety by the Trump administration,\" Mayorkas told ABC News\u2019 Martha Raddatz on March 21.", "The Biden administration is \"rebuilding the system\" to address the needs of unaccompanied children making their way to the southern border, he said.", "How accurate is Mayorkas\u2019 claim that the Trump administration \"dismantled\" the \"entire system\"?", "There\u2019s some truth to his broad claim, but the challenges the Biden administration faces can\u2019t all be blamed on the prior administration, immigration experts said.", "\"The border surge is just the latest symptom of a broken immigration system,\" said Laura Collins, director of the George W.

Recently, hurricanes in Central America made things worse for many people, ruining their crops and displacing them from their homes. The coronavirus pandemic has also left many people without a job.", "On the U.S. side of the issue, Congress hasn\u2019t passed meaningful legislation to modernize the legal immigration system or to better prepare the federal government for surges at the border. (The last big immigration law was enacted in 1986, when Ronald Reagan was president.)", "It\u2019s also worth noting that there are seasonal trends at play \u2014 migration tends to increase in the spring.", "DHS directed PolitiFact to a statement Mayorkas issued March 16 about the Trump administration dismantling the asylum system. Many people who make it to the southern border ask for asylum.", "\"We have had to rebuild the entire system, including the policies and procedures required to administer the asylum laws that Congress passed long ago,\" Mayorkas said.", "Under federal law, immigrants may be granted asylum if they have been persecuted or fear they will be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. To apply for asylum, people have to be physically present in the U.S. They can apply even if they arrive without legal permission.", "A backlog of cases existed before Trump took office and continued to grow during his tenure, despite his attempts to limit the number of people filing cases.", "The Trump administration revamped the asylum-seeking process in many ways, including by:", "Denying asylum to people who did not ask for protection in another country first;", "Entering into agreements with Central American countries so that they\u2019d take asylum seekers who would have otherwise applied for protection in the United States; and", "Launching the \"Remain in Mexico\" program that sent asylum seekers to Mexico to wait there for a resolution of their case.

(It can take years for cases to be resolved.)", "Trump\u2019s administration also tried to discourage people from coming to the U.S. to apply for asylum by implementing a policy that ultimately separated parents and children upon arrival at the border. The Biden administration got rid of that policy and launched a task force to help reunify families. Biden\u2019s administration has also begun letting in asylum seekers stranded in Mexico.", "Separately, Trump also weakened another venue for legal migration \u2014 the U.S. refugee program. People apply for refugee admission from outside the U.S. (in their home countries or in refugee camps elsewhere). Before leaving office, President Barack Obama said the U.S. should let in as many as 110,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017. When Trump took over, he said that was too much and capped it at 50,000. Trump continued to lower the caps every year he was in office. Biden has pledged to significantly raise the admissions cap.", "Mayorkas\u2019 statement also said that Trump \"tore down\" the Central American Minors program \u2014 created in 2014 by the Obama administration to address a surge of children fleeing gang violence and arriving alone at the border.

Children ineligible for refugee admission but at risk of violence were eligible for immigration parole (allowed into the U.S. temporarily, but not formally admitted under the U.S. immigration system).", "The Trump administration in 2017 decided to end the program. Mayorkas and Democratic lawmakers argue that its absence contributes to the current surge.", "But Democrats are overstating the program\u2019s impact, experts said.

But they also emphasized that other factors likely carried more weight in people\u2019s decision to migrate.", "Obama\u2019s administration in 2014 decided that improving living conditions in Central America would be beneficial to the U.S. and approved a new strategy to increase annual foreign aid to the region.
