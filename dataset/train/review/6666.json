["About this rating", "In a letter shared by the joint labor union Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) on Feb. 4, 2021, former U.S. President Donald Trump resigned as a member of the union. Trump\u2019s resignation came just as the union leadership was moving to expel Trump in the wake of his alleged provocation of a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.", "The letterhead appeared to carry the logo for what was called the \u201cOffice of the Former President,\u201d created by Trump\u2019s team in Palm Beach, Florida, to serve as the official outlet for Trump\u2019s statements and to share his future plans.", "However, now, the stationery on which the letter was submitted says \u201cOffice of Donald J. Trump.\u201d", "The letter was shared on SAG-AFTRA\u2019s website, along with the union's response to Trump, which was a simple, \u201cThank you.\u201d", "As seen in the document, the end of the letter is indeed signed with \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump.\u201d", "In the letter, Trump cited his own acting experience and contributions to television:", "I\u2019m very proud of my work on movies such as Home Alone 2, Zoolander and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps; and television shows including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Saturday Night Live, and of course, one of the most successful shows in television history, The Apprentice \u2013 to name just a few! I\u2019ve also greatly helped the cable news television business (said to be a dying platform with not much time left until I got involved in politics), and created thousands of jobs at networks such as MSDNC and Fake News CNN, among many others.", "He concluded with a criticism of the union\u2019s actions:", "Your organization has done little for its members, and nothing for me \u2013 besides collecting dues and promoting dangerous un-American policies and ideas \u2013 as evident by your massive unemployment rates and lawsuits from celebrated actors, who even recorded a video asking, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t the union fighting for me?\u201d These, however, are policy failures. Your disciplinary failures are even more egregious. I no longer wish to be associated with your union.", "Professor and author Seth Abramson pointed out how signing the letter this way is \u201ctroubling,\u201d given that Trump is on trial for inciting the riots:", "However, signing a letter as \u201cPresident\u201d does not appear to be out of the ordinary. Former President Barack Obama's statements are also released under \"President Obama.\" Former presidents are still addressed as \u201cPresident [insert name]\u201d or \u201cMr. President.\u201d All U.S. presidents retain their titles for life.", "Given that the official letter was shared by SAG-AFTRA, along with Trump\u2019s signature, we rate this claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
