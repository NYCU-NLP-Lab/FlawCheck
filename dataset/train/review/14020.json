["Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort says Hillary Clinton's tax returns show more shadowy connections to donors of the Clinton Foundation and State Department beneficiaries.", "Hillary Clinton\u2019s release of her 2015 tax returns last week renewed calls for Donald Trump to do the same, but it also provided the Trump campaign fodder for attack.", "CNN State of the Union host Jake Tapper asked Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort why Trump has yet to release his tax returns, especially since his lawyers have said Trump\u2019s 2008 returns were no longer under audit, unlike more recent years. Manafort deflected by turning the tables on Clinton.", "\"Mr. Trump\u2019s position has been clear from the beginning: He\u2019s under audit. When the audit is completed, he\u2019ll release his returns,\" Manafort said. \"By the way, in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s returns, you saw a lot of income coming from donors to the Clinton Foundation and people who benefitted from her State Department term as well. I haven\u2019t seen any stories on that yet.\"", "Does the former secretary of state\u2019s tax return really show pay-the-Clintons-to-play politics?", "Not exactly.", "About 15 percent of Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2015 income came from two educational businesses with ties to the Clinton Foundation. It is a lot of money in raw dollars, but not a lot compared to the couple\u2019s other sources of income.", "What\u2019s more, we found no evidence that the firms paying Bill Clinton for his consulting work profited from the State Department, as Manafort said.", "According to their returns, the Clintons made about $10.5 million in 2015, the bulk from their speaking fees ($5.5 million) and book royalties ($3.1 million). Here\u2019s a breakdown:", "Though the forms do not specify who paid the couple to speak in 2015, they do show that Bill Clinton also made about $1.6 million after expenses for consulting services. His clients were Laureate Education and GEMS Education, two international education firms that donated between $1 million and $5 million each to the Clinton Foundation.", "Laureate Education, a network of more than 80 institutions based in Baltimore, has also partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative \"on a number of initiatives since 2008,\" according to its website. It named Bill Clinton an honorary chancellor between 2010 and 2014 (his tax returns do not show income earned from that role). The Laureate network is controversial partly for the stigma of for-profit education (which has been criticized by Hillary Clinton) and partly for racking up debt while marketing and expanding aggressively.", "Similarly, GEMS Education, one of the world\u2019s largest private-school operators based in Dubai, is a Clinton Global Initiative strategic partner and, along with UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), is helping train principals in Kenya, Ghana and India. The company enrolls 150,000 students in 90 K-12 schools worldwide.", "Older tax returns show the Clintons received more money from the groups in other years. Bill Clinton was paid $16 million by Laureate and $5.6 million by GEMS between 2010 and 2014 for his consulting services. Politico has additionally reported that a former Clinton fundraiser who was given a special State Department post also had business ties to both firms.", "But while all of this demonstrates a strong link between Laureate and GEMS and the Clintons, it doesn\u2019t prove corruption, as Manafort implies. His suggestion that they \"benefited from (Clinton\u2019s) State Department tenure\" is not backed by the record.", "We searched www.usaspending.gov, a comprehensive database that tracks government grants and contracts, to see if either firm received not just State Department but any federal funding. Our search turned up nothing for Laureate or GEMS. (The Clinton campaign referred us to our previous reporting debunking the link between Laureate and the State Department.)", "The Clintons did disclose who paid for their speeches in 2013. Hillary Clinton received between $225,000 and $400,000 per speech from Wall Street clients such as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, while Bill Clinton\u2019s highest fee was $750,000 from a Swedish bank. Many of the firms have government interests, according to the Associated Press.", "The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment to back up Manafort\u2019s claim.", "Our ruling", "Manafort said, \"In Mrs. Clinton\u2019s returns, you saw a lot of income coming from donors to the Clinton Foundation and people who benefitted from her State Department term as well.\"", "The returns for 2015 do show that two educational firms that have donated millions to the Clinton Foundation also paid about $1.6 million to Bill Clinton for consulting services. That\u2019s just 15 percent of the Clintons\u2019 total income in 2015, but \"a lot\" of money to most people.", "But we found no evidence that either of those businesses profited from Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions at the State Department. The Trump campaign did not respond to our query with examples of other businesses donating to the foundation and then profiting from the department, and we did not find any in our search.", "We rate Manafort\u2019s claim Half True.", "CNN, \"State of the Union,\" Aug. 14, 2016", "Hillary Clinton, Tax returns 2007\u00a0to 2015, \u00a0accessed Aug. 14, 2016", "Clinton Foundation, Contributor\u00a0and Grantor Information, \u00a0accessed Aug. 14, 2016", "USASpending.gov searches", "PolitiFact, \"Did Hillary Clinton launder millions of dollars while she was secretary of state?,\"\u00a0July 1, \u00a02016", "Email interview with Josh Schwerin, Clinton spokesman, Aug. 14, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
