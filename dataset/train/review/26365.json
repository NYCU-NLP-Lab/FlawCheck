["About this rating", "A four-line poem, also known as a quatrain, allegedly written by 16th-century philosopher Michel de Nostradamus described predictions of a future \u201cplague\u201d that would \u201cfall upon the world.\u201d (Some assumed that this so-called plague referred to the COVID-19 pandemic, which Snopes has previously debunked here.)", "The alleged quatrain went on to describe a \u201cfeeble man\u201d who was set to \u201crule the western world with a jezebel\u201d after the plague. According to Snopes readers, renditions of this poem appeared to suggest that this man and jezebel either referred to U.S. President Donald Trump or President-elect Joe Biden, depending on the person sharing the poem. In the end, this \u201cfool ruler\u201d will cause the \u201cgreat eagle\u201d \u2014 presumably the United States \u2014 to \u201csuffer and fall.\u201d", "The below meme circulated in early 2021:", "It is unclear where this quatrain originated from or who the original poster was. Nostradamus, who was also a French physician, first published Les Proph\u00e9ties in 1555. It is thought that his collection of poems, which are compiled in 10 sets of verses of 100 quatrains each, contain mythological and astrological predictions for the future world. In the centuries that followed his original publication, he has remained prominent in modern popular culture, often among internet users who share fabricated predictions falsely attributed to him.", "Nostradamus is credited with accurately predicting many historical events, according to Rare Books Digest. And though many of his poems are largely vague and could apply to a number of events, some of his predictions do come eerily close to actual events.", "But the meme in question does not appear to make that list. A look through The Compleat Works of Nostradamus did not reveal any mention of a \u201cjezebel\u201d or a \u201cfeeble man.\u201d And though the word \u201cplague\u201d was mentioned more than 30 times in the Nostradamus text, there is no instance where it occurs alongside the same wording as in the meme.", "Furthermore, it is also important to note that the quatrains written by Nostradamus do not follow chronological order. So, while they may be broken down into what the author considered to be \u201ccenturies,\u201d these do not directly translate to the century in which any prediction was anticipated to occur.", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
