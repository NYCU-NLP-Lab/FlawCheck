["President Donald Trump reviews border wall prototypes, Tuesday, March 13, 2018, in San Diego. Evan Vucci / AP Photo", "During his visit to the U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego, President Donald Trump made this confounding claim: \"The state of California is begging us to build walls\" along the border.", "Deep blue California is \"begging\" the federal government to build a wall? Really?", "The president\u2019s statement seemed false on its face, but we dug in for a fact-check just to make sure.", "Our research", "Here\u2019s Trump\u2019s full statement made March 13, 2018:", "\"For the people that say 'no wall,' if you had no walls over here, you wouldn\u2019t have a country. The state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas. They don\u2019t tell you that. And we said no, we won\u2019t do it until we build the whole wall.\"", "We asked Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s office about Trump\u2019s statement. A spokesman for the governor indicated he had no idea what Trump was talking about.", "\"We gave up trying to translate \u2013 and fully understand \u2013 the tweets and extemporaneous thoughts of the president long ago,\" Evan Westrup said in an email.", "Others rejected Trump\u2019s claim outright:", "Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democratic candidate for governor and top Trump critic, tweeted:", "\"California is not \"begging\" you for this wall. Your wall is a waste of money and is literally impossible to complete. It will look more like a piece of swiss cheese than an insurmountable barrier. It's nothing more than a 6th century solution to a 21st century problem.\"", "\"Not exactly sure where he got that from\"", "Immigration and environmental experts said the state of California, at least in recent years, hasn\u2019t expressed any desire to build a border wall.", "\"Not at all,\" said Louis DeSipio, a UC Irvine political science professor who studies immigration. \"I\u2019m not exactly sure where (Trump) got that from. Perhaps he heard it from some local sheriff who wants a wall.\"", "\"It\u2019s been increasingly difficult to make sense of the things this administration says, and President Trump in particular,\" added Randy Serraglio, a spokesman for the Center for Biological Diversity.", "The environmental group and state government were part of a recent lawsuit against the federal government\u2019s plans to build the wall in California. Federal judge Gonzalo Curiel rejected their argument about environmental concerns and ruled the Trump administration could move forward on the project.", "Not the first confusing claim", "This is not the first time Trump has made a strange claim about California\u2019s desire to build sections of a border wall. On Feb. 28, 2018, following the judge\u2019s ruling, Trump tweeted:", "\"I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved. Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!\"", "National news outlets attempted to make sense of that tweet, without success.", "A Politico\u00a0article assessed the tweet this way: \"It was not clear what Trump meant in suggesting that 'California wants'\u00a0a border wall 'now,'\u00a0since the state opposed his administration\u2019s efforts. White House spokespeople did not immediately return emails seeking further clarity regarding the president\u2019s post and whether the administration intends to delay work in California even after securing a judicial victory.\"", "We found an interview with one top California Democrat, Attorney General Xavier Beccera, indicating he could support a barrier at the border, but no statements where top leaders are \"begging\" for a wall.", "Becerra told the Los Angeles Times in September 2017 that he supports \"doing what our experts tell us we should do\" on border security, whether that includes a physical barrier, more troops on the ground or virtual enforcement through aerial detection or surveillance.", "On the day of Trump\u2019s California visit, Becerra was stronger in his response to Trump. He told Fox News, \"We\u2019ve always called for border security on a bipartisan basis, but building walls, that\u2019s a medieval technology that really doesn\u2019t have a place in the 21st century\"", "Perhaps Trump meant Californians, and not their state government, want the wall? But even in that case, the president is wrong. A September 2017 survey showed 68 percent of likely voters in the state oppose building a wall along the entire southern border.", "The White House responded to a request for evidence after publication. We have included its response at the end of this fact check.", "Our ruling", "President Trump claimed \"the state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas,\" along the border. \"They don\u2019t tell you that.\"", "There\u2019s no evidence backing up the president\u2019s mystifying statement. If anything, California and its Democratic leaders are some of the strongest opponents of Trump\u2019s border wall, at least as he\u2019s promoted it.", "Some state leaders rejected Trump\u2019s claim outright while others said they had no idea what he was talking about.", "We rated Trump\u2019s claim Pants On Fire.", "UPDATE:\u00a0A White House spokesman responded to our request for evidence after publication. He cited \"great efforts\" by the federal government \"to collaborate with local and state authorities\" on a two-mile border wall replacement project in Imperial County east of San Diego. The federal government plans to replace an existing barrier in that county with a 30-foot high bollard-style wall.", "The spokesman also cited a budget plan to create \"14 miles of new border wall system that will replace existing secondary fence in the San Diego Sector.\" While this show the federal government\u2019s interest in replacing sections of border barriers, they do not support or even speak to\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim \"the state of California is begging to build walls\" along the border.", "Our rating remains Pants On Fire.", "PANTS ON FIRE \u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.", "President Trump, March 13, 2018", "Evan Westrup, spokesman for Gov.
