Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said that everyone should be able to vote by mail if they want to this year \u2014 and that the vast majority of the public agrees with her.", "Klobuchar in March proposed a bill that gives states more money to handle increased mail-in voting and to make in-person voting sites safer amid a pandemic. She said that she doesn\u2019t want to make everyone vote by mail, but that it is a safer option. The Republican-led Senate has not voted on the bill.", "\"The voters are with us, the people are with us,\" she said. \"80% of the people want this option and they want to have the polls open early.\" (She made that statement in a conversation with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison April 24 and tweeted a portion May 16.)", "We found that Klobuchar\u2019s figure was close to one reported in a poll by a liberal group.

In some states, any qualified voter may vote by mail, while five states conduct all elections entirely by mail: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah.", "While President Donald Trump and some GOP leaders have opposed efforts to expand voting by mail, concerns about the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is expected to increase demand for absentee ballots among people who fear exposure at in-person voting sites.

The online poll of 1,550 Democrats, Republicans and independents in March asked respondents, \"Do you agree or disagree that: in the 2020 election, all states should be required to allow vote by mail or unexcused absentee ballots to ensure people can vote with ease and without being in long lines or crowds?\"", "In response, 78% said they agreed. Support was higher among Democrats (97%) and independents (79%) than Republicans (57%).", "Polling experts noted that Brennan asked the question in a way that suggests positive reasons for voting by mail, which can lead to higher support among respondents.", "The question was worded in a way that puts voting by mail in the current context of the pandemic, said Joel Benenson of the Benenson Strategy Group, which conducted the poll for Brennan. He argued that phrasing the question in a generic way doesn\u2019t make sense because the current conversation is about changing policies this year for the pandemic, not permanently.", "The phrasing was different from the questions in a poll done for the Republican National Committee. That poll asked voters of both parties and independents for their views on \"mailing a ballot to all registered voters, including those who are inactive, meaning they have not voted in recent elections and not responded to an address verification mailing or have moved.\" The results showed 53% opposed that idea.", "A separate question from that same RNC poll asked \"And, if your state changed current voting procedures to enact universal vote by mail, would you be concerned about the integrity of the election results and the ability for widespread fraud?\" Sixty-two percent answered yes.", "We asked the RNC why it didn\u2019t ask a straight question about respondents\u2019 views on voting by mail.

Geer, co-director of the Vanderbilt poll (who wasn\u2019t involved in these vote by mail polls).", "National polls done in April by nonpartisan media outlets or research groups showed between 58% and 72% favoring voting by mail overall.
