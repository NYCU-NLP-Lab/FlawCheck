It found that gun homicides (or more specifically, the rate of gun homicides per 100,000 residents) had declined by 49 percent between their peak in 1993 and 2010, a period of 17 years. We double-checked Pew\u2019s calculations of the CDC figures and found that they were correct.

However, the time frame raises important issues.", "For one thing, the CDC data show that the big decline in gun homicides came between 1993 and 2000, which happens to coincide with the years Bill Clinton was president. While Clinton and his policies are hardly the only reason for this decline, his signing of tighter gun-control legislation makes him unpopular among the kinds of gun supporters who might have created this meme. By contrast, by framing the decline as happening over the past 12 years, the meme implies that George W. Bush -- a president much more friendly to gun-rights supporters -- can take some credit for the decline.", "More importantly, by making this mistake, the meme misunderstands the overall trend lines of gun homicides. Gun homicides didn\u2019t decline 49 percent over the last 12 years -- rather, they declined precipitously over six years in the 1990s, then have remained basically stagnant for the past decade or so.", "Why is this important? Because the decline, to a large degree, has to do with a specific reason -- the end of the crack epidemic.", "The decline in gun homicides in the 1990s \"was largely a reversal of an upward trend that occurred in the mid-to-late 1980s,\" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. \"There would not have been much of a downturn were it not for the surge. This up-and-down change was primarily in cities and among offenders under age 25, and indeed have much to do with crack markets and gang activity.\"", "In fact, the Pew study made the same point, noting that \"by the early 1990s, crack markets withered in part because of lessened demand, and the vibrant national economy made it easier for even low-skilled young people to find jobs rather than get involved in crime. At the same time, a rising number of people ages 30 and older were incarcerated, due in part to stricter laws, which helped restrain violence among this age group.\"", "Fox said another reason for the decline in gun homicides overall was a specific decline in cases that involved intimate partners. After 1993, when the pro-gun-control Brady Law was passed, \"there was a decline in gun homicides by women against their partners, but no decline in non-gun killings,\" he said.", "Media bias?", "The meme also takes a shot at the media for burying this large decline.

During the past dozen years, gun homicide rates have been largely static; their big decline mostly came in the years before the meme even started counting.
