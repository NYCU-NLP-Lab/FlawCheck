["Barbara Shields-Johnson, director of Nursing Services at Loretto Hospital, gets her 2nd and final dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at Norwegian American Hospital in Chicago, Jan. 5, 2021. (Ashlee Rezin Garcia/Sun-Times)", "Illinois\u2019 entry into the second phase of its COVID-19 vaccination plan means many more residents are eligible, but not everyone agrees the state is prioritizing the right groups as vaccine demand still outpaces supply.", "In an image shared on Facebook and Twitter, the Illinois Republican Party said Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s \"Hierarchy of Vaccine Priorities\" puts prisoners, politicians, and college students into Phase 1B \u2014 the current vaccination phase \u2014 ahead of \"individuals with high-risk health factors, and everyone else.\"", "Like other states, Illinois\u2019 vaccination plan is modeled from federal guidelines, but states aren\u2019t required to uniformly implement the non-binding guidance.", "So we decided to take a look at the groups the state GOP claimed are now eligible in Illinois.

Both the state House and Senate also canceled session days scheduled for February..", "State lawmakers in Colorado, Hawaii and Maryland are also being vaccinated in the second phase. Members of Congress have been receiving vaccines since the distribution began.", "Still not eligible are individuals with high-risk health conditions from ages 16 to 64 who are not frontline essential workers. Pritzker recently announced the group will be added Feb. 25, which would make Illinois the 18th state to include them in their first two phases, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation comparison. Chicago and suburban Cook County, which receive doses separately from the federal government, have opted out of the expansion because of supply shortages.", "CDC guidelines say people younger than 65 years with high-risk medical conditions do not need to be prioritized until the next phase of eligibility, Phase 1C. That means the state remains in line with federal guidance.", "There is nothing in the Illinois vaccination plan allowing college students as a group to qualify.", "A spokesperson for the Illinois Republican Party said its assertion that college students currently qualified for vaccinations was based on a WCIA-TV report in which a student is seen receiving the vaccine at the I Hotel Conference Center in Champaign.", "The report also identifies her as a medical student, which according to the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District puts her squarely into another group that is eligible \u2014 healthcare workers.", "Spokespeople for the Illinois Department of Public Health and the governor\u2019s office confirmed college students who do not work in healthcare or another position covered in the current phases do not qualify.", "The Illinois Republican Party says \"Pritzker\u2019s Hierarchy of Vaccine Priorities\" puts prisoners, politicians and college students into Phase 1B, ahead of \"individuals with high-risk health factors, and everyone else.\"", "It\u2019s true inmates and state lawmakers currently qualify for vaccinations, and those under the age of 65 and others who are not frontline workers do not \u2014 including people with underlying health risks.", "But it\u2019s not true college students as a group are eligible.
