And there are many dimensions to it, sir. The biggest dimension is agriculture pricing, the kind of prices we are giving. All the controls that we have placed on the farmers will also have to be removed. A farmer can sell only in the mandi, why can\u2019t he sell outside of it? Why can\u2019t he sell in other states, why only in his own state? All these controls that we have put on the small farmer. They are opposing the same controls that you are unhappy with. I think these need to be removed, there needs to be deregulation. The government needs to step off and reconsider the prices that we are offering, I\u2019m just giving a small example\u2026\u201d", "Bagga claimed that Kejriwal welcomed the farm bills introduced by the Modi government.
