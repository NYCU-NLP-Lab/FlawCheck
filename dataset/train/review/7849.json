Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, had to say in a statement:", "\"With less than ten days before early voting starts in Texas and Wisconsin, I am pleased with the judicial decisions yesterday striking down burdensome photo ID laws in those states.\"", "Did the brief Supreme Court order \"strike down\" the Wisconsin statute?", "The DNC leader was in a minority in using that terminology, we found in reviewing media reports and reactions from legal and political observers.", "But the New York Times\u2019 headline on its story may have influenced some -- and in fact a DNC spokesman pointed it out to us in providing backup for Wasserman Schultz\u2019s \u00a0claim.", "\"Courts Strike Down Voter ID laws in \u00a0Wisconsin and Texas,\" \u00a0the \u00a0paper\u2019s online headline declared Oct. 9, 2014.", "The story beneath that headline, though, used \"struck down\" only when referring to the Texas ruling.
