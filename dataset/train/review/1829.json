Not all Buffalo Billion projects had a promise of a specific amount of jobs.\u00a0We reached out to Empire State Development, the state\u2019s economic development agency, for details on these projects and looked at other sources for information.", "Perhaps the most recognizable project is the Tesla solar panel factory at the waterfront site known as RiverBend\u00a0in South Buffalo, into which the state has invested $750 million. An agreement between the state and SolarCity in 2014\u00a0called for the creation of more than 1,450 direct manufacturing jobs at the new facility and more than 2,000 other jobs throughout the state to provide solar services within five years, as well as the creation of 1,440 indirect jobs to support the factory. The expectation was that the solar panel factory would create 5,000 jobs, and under Tesla ownership, that is still the goal. But parts of the agrement\u00a0have changed. A\u00a0series of amendments have revised job creation requirements. For example,\u00a0a requirement to bring in 1,440 jobs through local suppliers was taken out of the agreement. The current agreement calls for 1,460 jobs by April 2020, including 500 manufacturing jobs at the factory, and 5,000 jobs in the state by 2028. Some of those jobs have been created by Panasonic, also located at RiverBend.", "According to Empire State Development, there are 730 full-time employees and 43 contingent contractors working at RiverBend, which satisfies the current agreement at this time. If the company does not make its hiring requirements next year, Cuomo said he will fine the company $41.2 million.

Two years later, he goal was still 250 jobs, but the state subsequently said that AMRI was to create 250 jobs with the help of other partners. The job goal now is 55 jobs, and the company reports having 58 employees in Buffalo, which meets its contractual requirement, according to Empire State Development.

The state claims\u00a0indirect jobs are being created, but it is not tracking them. One\u00a0concrete job promise as part of this project:\u00a0Edison Welding Institute, or EWI, was expected to create 30 to 35 jobs within five years, the state announced in March 2014.

However, when the\u00a0employment schedule was finalized in June 2015, the deadline was set at Feb. 1, 2024, according to ESD. An amendment this year pushed the deadline for the 490 jobs back to Feb. 1, 2025. The state agency now reports that the institute has helped create 51 new jobs and is on track to meet next year's cumulative goal of 70 new jobs. The institute has \"key industry partners\" that are expected to create over 200 jobs in Buffalo, and are \"on track\" to meet their commitment to create 490 jobs, according to the state.\u00a0Job creation goal: Deadline moved, in progress.", "\u2022 Hotel Niagara: The state spent $4.4 million to acquire this Niagara Falls hotel for redevelopment.

In Dunkirk, the goal for direct jobs created is 450 within five years of completion of a new facility, at least 300 of which will be created within the first two-and-a-half years,\u00a0according to a 2017 company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The facility is under construction. In Buffalo, the job commitment is 250 jobs by October 2020, according to Empire State Development. The state agency\u00a0reports that there are 176 employees in Western New York, and that the company is \"on track\" to create 500 jobs between Buffalo and Dunkirk by 2022.
