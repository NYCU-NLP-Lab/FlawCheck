Even worse to the Fox News gang is how much President Barack Obama\u2019s administration is leaning on Sharpton as \"a de facto contact and conduit\" on race issues, according to a Politico Magazine profile.", "Appearing on The O\u2019Reilly Factor on the same night as Brown\u2019s funeral, Kelly criticized Sharpton for getting ahead of the facts in his fiery speeches to emotional crowds. It was the same segment in which she and O\u2019Reilly debated the concept of \"white privilege,\" with Kelly presenting several economic, social and educational statistics to show how blacks are disadvantaged in this country.", "\"What they don't need in this case, or in any case, is people like Al Sharpton going in there and declaring as a matter of fact that the, that Michael Brown didn't use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer,\" Kelly said.", "O\u2019Reilly said, \"Absolutely, that just alienates everybody.\"", "\"If you have somebody come in and prejudge -- someone you trust and rely upon -- come and tell you the facts are one way, you believe him,\" Kelly said of Sharpton. \"That's why he is abusing his power.\"", "We wanted to know if Sharpton flat-out said Brown \"didn\u2019t use any deadly force\" before he was killed.", "What happened", "The official story of what happened before Brown was shot at least six times is not entirely known -- a factor driving the unrest against law enforcement. A grand jury is weighing evidence in the case and will decide whether to indict Wilson, and the St. Louis County Police Department and FBI are investigating the shooting.", "CNN and Vox have compiled guides to varying accounts from witnesses and law enforcement about what happened. Before noon, there was an alleged strong-arm robbery involving Brown and friend Dorian Johnson at a convenience store. Shortly after, Wilson stopped the men for walking in the middle of a street, without knowing they were suspects in the robbery, Ferguson\u2019s police chief has said.", "Some witnesses and Brown\u2019s advocates say Brown had been shot and was turning around to face Wilson with his hands raised when Wilson fired at him again, hitting his head.

The issue is not what he did before,\" Sharpton said Aug. 17. \"The issue is how a young man with no deadly threat, no life-extenuating circumstances, was shot multiple times.
