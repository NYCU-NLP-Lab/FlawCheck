White van drivers around the U.S. have spoken out about harassment and threats they have received as the result of the hoax.", "A Facebook spokesperson told us that the platform has reduced the distribution of such posts, saying in a statement that, \"Posts with this claim have been rated as false by third-party fact-checkers and we\u2019re dramatically reducing their distribution.
