["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on September 14, 2018 | Updated on August 28, 2019", "Q: Is California registering noncitizens to vote?", "A: No. A state motor-voter program and a San Francisco school board measure have fueled that false claim.", "A\u00a0text-based photo on Facebook asks whether \u201call votes from California should be nullified and Federal Representatives from the State be removed from Congress for the benefit of all the States?\u201d", "The state\u2019s purported offense? \u201cCalifornia is registering non-citizens to vote and has refused to Cooperate with the Federal Election Integrity Program.\u201d", "But that text \u2014 the same that appeared in a July tweet by\u00a0the chairman of a national group called Students for Trump\u00a0\u2014 is rooted in false and misleading information.\u00a0California is not registering noncitizens to vote, save for one city allowing certain illegal immigrants to vote only in school board elections.", "The Sept. 10 photo was shared more than 22,000 times on Facebook, and the original tweet was retweeted nearly 17,000 times.", "Some websites posted a story this summer with the misleading headline\u00a0that San Francisco was giving \u201cillegal aliens the right to vote in elections\u201d \u2014 when in fact the measure only\u00a0affords certain noncitizens the right to vote in school board elections, as we wrote in July.", "The measure, which voters approved in 2016, gives all immigrants living in the city who are of legal voting age and who are parents, guardians or caregivers of a child under the age of 19 permission to vote in school board elections. The local policy doesn\u2019t permit noncitizens to vote in any other elections,\u00a0including federal contests \u2014 which is the subject of the Facebook photo.", "Earlier this year, we debunked\u00a0a similar false assertion about California\u2019s\u00a0New Motor Voter Program. That program is\u00a0an effort to increase voter turnout by automatically registering people to vote when they renew or obtain a new license, unless they opt out.", "Critics claimed California would therefore register illegal immigrants to vote because the state also has a measure in place that allows noncitizens to\u00a0obtain special driver\u2019s licenses.", "But California officials maintain that only eligible voters would be automatically registered. A spokeswoman for the state\u2019s DMV told us in March that \u201cundocumented Californians are not eligible to register to vote and [the] DMV has programming measures to prevent that from occurring.\u201d", "\u201cOne example is the technician is unable to enter information that would allow the undocumented customer to register. It is automatically greyed out and cannot be bypassed,\u201d Jessica Gonzalez told us in an email.", "We could also find no record of the \u201cFederal Election Integrity Program\u201d mentioned in the text of the image. That is likely a reference to the\u00a0short-lived\u00a0Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.", "The federal commission, created in 2017 to examine \u201cfraudulent voting\u201d and other issues, faced opposition in obtaining voter data from California and\u00a0other states, some citing concerns over voters\u2019 privacy. The panel was\u00a0dissolved\u00a0in January, about eight months after it was created.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Update, Aug. 28, 2019: In late 2018, the California Secretary of State\u2019s office\u00a0said\u00a0roughly 1,500 people \u2014 including noncitizens \u2014 were erroneously registered to vote through the state\u2019s motor-voter program. The office has said those registrations have since been cancelled, but this month it announced that\u00a0six people\u00a0who were erroneously registered \u201cdue to DMV errors\u201d actually voted in the 2018 elections. Paula Valle, a spokeswoman for the office, told us none of the individuals wrongly registered were licensees under the AB-60 program, which allows immigrants in the country illegally to obtain a license.", "\u201cExecutive Order on the Termination of Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.\u201d WhiteHouse.gov. 3 Jan 2018.", "Hale Spencer, Saranac. \u201cNoncitizens Get Narrow Access to Polls in San Francisco.\u201d FactCheck.org. 26 Jul 2018.", "\u201cPresidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.\u201d WhiteHouse.gov.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
