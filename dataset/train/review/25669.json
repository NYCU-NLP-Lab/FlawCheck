Study shows than top of all beverage cans are more contaminated than public toilets.\u201d", "Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacteria leptospira, which can be found in infected animal urine and tissue. Humans are typically infected with leptospira through contact with contaminated animals, soil or water. Symptoms of the disease include fever, chills, headaches, nausea and diarrhoea.", "A similar claim about the disease has also been\u00a0shared tens of thousands of times by Facebook users around the world since at least 2013.

The Institute of Environmental Science and Research has recorded 40 cases of leptospirosis in New Zealand in 2020; see the data here.", "\u201cIn NZ we associate leptospirosis with people who produce food, it\u2019s not because people are getting it through their food -- it\u2019s because they are in contact with animal urine,\u201d Benschop said.", "Leptospirosis.org addressed similar misleading social media posts here\u00a0that have\u00a0circulated\u00a0online since 2002.", "In a 2005 blog post, the organisation\u00a0states the \u201cstatistical risk\u201d of catching leptospirosis from a soft-drink can \u201cis extremely small\u201d.", "\"Leptospira require constant immersion in water to survive, and so drying of the surface for any length of time will permanently kill the bacteria.
