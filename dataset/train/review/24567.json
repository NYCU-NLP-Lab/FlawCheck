["About this rating", "An image supposedly showing Kim Kardashian wearing mirrored sunglasses at a poker table is frequently shared on social media along with disparaging comments about the reality star's perceived intelligence. One common caption, for instance, is, \"Whenever you feel like a moron, just remember that Kim Kardashian played poker with mirrored sunglasses.\"", "This is a genuine photograph of the reality television star wearing reflective sunglasses at a poker table. However, this fashion choice isn't as moronic as the meme would suggest.", "The photograph was taken in July 2018 at the first annual \"If Only\" Texas Hold'em charity poker tournament at The Forum in Inglewood, Calif.

Most Texas Hold'em players don't even even lift their cards up off the table, opting instead to just bend up an edge for a sneak peek:", "The image of Kardashian wearing mirrored sunglasses while playing poker is indeed real. However, it's not nearly as stupid as presented in this meme.", "TMZ. \u00a0 \"Kim Kardashian West, Kris Jenner Wheelin' and Deelin' Cards for Massive Charity Event.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 10 July 2018.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
