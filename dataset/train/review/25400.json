In fact, Crist has tried to portray his evolution as being in line with that of President Barack Obama, who came out in favor of gay marriage in 2012 after favoring civil unions.", "Like Obama, \"I always supported civil unions,\" Crist told reporters outside a Fort Lauderdale fundraiser Jan. 28. \"But I thought about it just as President Obama thought about it, and I have come to the conclusion, as the Pope said himself, \u2018Who am I to judge?\u2019 I\u2019ve always been a live-and-let live kind of guy.

Marriage is a relationship like my mother and father had. Like I had before I got divorced. It is one of those unique institutions, not only in America but across the world where a man and a woman commit to one another.
