["About this rating", "On 9\u00a0March\u00a02016, the web site Nevada County Scooper published an\u00a0article suggesting former White Stripes drummer Meg White was selected as a replacement drummer for the band Rush:", "Fans of the Progressive Canadian rock band Rush breathed a collective sigh of relief after lead guitarist Alex Lifeson announced that former White Stripes drummer will replace the ailing Neil Peart on an upcoming North American tour. There have been numerous reports that Mr. Peart was sadly unable to continue due to increasing chronic arthritis pain, and many fans thought that Rush\u2019s critically acclaimed R40 tour last year was in fact the final Rush tour of their career.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked very closely with Meg White over the past few months,\u201d said Mr. Lifeson in a Scooper telephone interview earlier this week. \u201cNeil has been intimately involved with showing her the set. As you can imagine, there\u2019s no one to replace him on drums, but we believe that Meg will bring a fresh perspective to some of our classics.\u201d", "Megan Martha \u201cMeg\u201d White (b. 1974) is an American drummer known for her work with Jack White in the Detroit rock duo The White Stripes. Her drumming style has been called \u201cprimal\u201d for its simplicity, and drew both praise and criticism from fans and critics.", "The article's image was a digitally altered existing photograph of White with a Rush logo added on to it, not a newly-taken image.\u00a0Nevada County Scooper's terms and conditions advised users not to take it (or themselves) seriously:", "This website is satirical in scope and intent.

Please have fun and lightened up.", "The article appeared following recent\u00a0coverage of Rush's \"uncertain future\" and drummer Neil Peart's presumed retirement. White made news for herself when she decided to retire permanently from performing in 2012, and\u00a0former bandmate Jack White confirmed that Meg declined any future collaborations.", "The\u00a0Nevada County Scooper\u00a0had similar successes on social media with satirical items claiming that Sen.
