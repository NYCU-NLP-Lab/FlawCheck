L. Douglas Wilder, who was Richmond\u2019s mayor from 2005 to 2009.", "We wondered if Berry was correct that the city\u2019s teachers went a decade without a pay hike. Berry, the outgoing director of Venture Richmond, told us he based his statement on several articles about teacher pay in RVANews and Richmond Magazine.", "The articles note that teachers used to get milestone raises based on the number of years they worked in the school system.", "But it\u2019s been 10 years since the Richmond School Board provided teachers a salary bump based on tenure, according to a chart sent to us by Charlotte Hayer, president of the Richmond Education Association, which represents many of the city\u2019s teachers. During the Great Recession from December 2007 to June 2009, that salary scale was frozen.", "\"We haven\u2019t moved (on the pay scale),\" Hayer said. \"We haven\u2019t gained anything for our experience.\"", "That doesn\u2019t mean there have been no raises at all for Richmond teachers during the past decade. They received five cost-of-living increases, based on information we got from the school system and the Richmond Education Association during the following fiscal years, which run from July 1 to June 30:", "\u20222014-15, 3 percent", "\u20222013-14, 2 percent", "\u20222008-09, 4 percent", "\u20222007-08, 4 percent", "\u20222006-07, 2 percent", "Ralph Westbay, the Richmond school system\u2019s assistant director of financial services, said the cost-of-living pay increases were funded using a mix of city and state funds and were provided to all district teachers regardless of performance.", "This school year, teachers are getting an additional 1.5 percent in pay, but that\u2019s because they have to work an extra three days, so Westbay said he wouldn\u2019t characterize it as a raise.", "It also should be noted that teachers got a 1 percent bonus in 2012 but, because that was a one-time payment, it doesn\u2019t count as a raise.", "We don\u2019t suggest Richmond teachers are living in luxury. In 2013, they had to take five unpaid furlough days, which cut into their pay that year. And, there have been five years in the past 10 in which they received no raises at all: this school year and during the post-recession era from 2010 to 2013.", "When we called Berry and told him about our findings, he said his remarks at the candidates\u2019 forum referred to the lack of tenure-based raises - not cost-of-living increases. We didn\u2019t find the elaboration in a tape of the forum nor in a Berry campaign flier that says, \"It is inexcusable for teachers to be denied a pay raise for almost 10 years, and for buildings to be falling apart.\"", "In case you\u2019re wondering, teachers in Chesterfield, Henrico and Hanover counties generally saw the same pay hike pattern as Richmond during the past 10 years. Educators in those three counties got pay hikes until 2009 and then generally saw little or no raises from 2010 through 2013, but they have gotten raises in recent years.", "Our ruling", "Berry said Richmond teachers have not gotten a raise \"for almost 10 years.\"", "Berry told us he was referring to the lack of tenure raises for teachers when they reach certain years of service. Such raises haven\u2019t been offered for a decade. But he didn\u2019t make that distinction at the candidates\u2019 forum or in his campaign literature.", "His statement makes it sound as if teachers haven\u2019t gotten any pay increase at all. That runs counter to figures from the school system and the Richmond Education Association that show they\u2019ve gotten five cost-of-living increases during the past 10 years.", "We rate his claim Mostly False.", "Jack Berry\u2019s comments at Richmond mayoral candidates forum, April 6, 2016.", "Interview with Jack Berry, April 13, 2016.", "Email from Jack Berry, April 13, 2016.", "Interviews with Ralph Westbay, Richmond Public School district\u2019s assistant superintendent for financial services, April 12-14, 2016.", "Interviews with Charlotte Hayer, president of the Richmond Education Association, April 13-14, 2016.", "Email from Charlotte Hayer, April 13, 2016.", "Interview with Kimberly Gray, Richmond school board member, April 12, 2016.", "Richmond Magazine, \"\u2018No one else is going to fight for us,\u2019\" March 17, 2016.", "RVA News, \"What\u2019s all this about teacher salaries?\" March 3, 2016.", "Richmond Magazine, \"Raising their voices,\" Jan. 4, 2016.", "Richmond Public Schools, \"Superintendent\u2019s estimate of needs,\" 2016", "Virginia Department of Education, \"Education workforce and data reports,\" accessed April 14, 2016.", "Richmond Times-Dispatch transcript of mayoral candidates debate, April 7, 2016.", "Jack Berry for Mayor, \"Jack Berry announces he is a candidate for mayor,\" April 5, 2016.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
