["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on September 14, 2016", "Donald Trump distorted the facts when he claimed New York\u2019s job losses during Hillary Clinton\u2019s eight years as the state\u2019s U.S. senator were \u201cworse than just about any place in the country.\u201d During that time, 14 states had steeper job declines than New York, and the state\u2019s\u00a0unemployment rate was lower than the national average.", "The Republican presidential nominee made his remarks during a speech in Pensacola, Florida.", "Trump, Sept. 9: Take a look at New York state. When she was a senator from New York state, she campaigned by saying that she was going to bring jobs back to New York state. New York state is a disaster. She got elected, she did nothing. She said see you later in four years. She got elected. Take a look at what happened to New York state. The jobs left. The jobs left. Worse than just about any place in the country. She didn\u2019t do a thing. It was all talk and no action. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen here. She\u2019s all talk. She\u2019s no action. Believe me, she wouldn\u2019t know a job if it stared her in the face.", "Trump has criticized Clinton for failing to deliver on a promise to create 200,000 jobs when running for Senate in 2000, citing among other sources an Aug. 7 Washington Post article. He\u2019s right about that.", "He\u2019s also right that New York lost jobs, as did many states during the Great Recession. But Trump exaggerates when he says New York\u2019s job losses were \u201cworse than just about any place in the country\u201d when she was senator.", "It\u2019s not even one of the worst in the its region \u2014 the nine-state Northeast, which the Census Bureau defines to include\u00a0New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.", "Blaming a US. Senator for job losses in their home state makes little sense, particularly during a global recession, which in this case began December 2007 \u2014 more than a year before Clinton left the Senate in January 2009 to join the administration of President Barack Obama.", "We have long cautioned readers to be wary about jobs claims, which need to be put into the context of regional and national trends. Such claims are\u00a0usually made by or about governors, and even they have little influence on job creation or loss during a recession.", "Nevertheless, Trump made the claim, so let\u2019s look at the facts.", "When Clinton took office, in January 2001, the state had 8,682,500 jobs and the unemployment rate was 4.2 percent. When she left, in January 2009, the state had 8,659,000 jobs and the unemployment rate was 7.2 percent. (We are using the standard measure for job growth \u2014 total nonfarm jobs, seasonally adjusted \u2014 and the official unemployment rate, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.)", "So, the state lost 23,500 jobs \u2013 which was a decline of about one-quarter of 1 percent \u2013 and the unemployment rate jumped by a full three percentage points. Of course, she left office when the national economy was bleeding jobs at the start of the Great Recession.", "How does New York compare to other states? We\u2019ve been told by experts when doing such exercises that it is best to compare neighboring states or those within the same region. So, let\u2019s first look at the unemployment rate of states in the Northeast.", "The unemployment rate went up in all nine Northeast states, but\u00a0New York had the third smallest increase in the unemployment rate. New York\u2019s rate went from 4.2 percent to 7.2 percent, an increase of 3 percentage points, behind only New Hampshire (2.6) and Pennsylvania (2.9).", "The worst was Rhode Island, where the unemployment rate increased by 6.1 percentage points, from 4.1 percent\u00a0 to 10.2 percent. We ranked the nine Northeast states by percentage point increase in the unemployment rate in the chart below.", "We also looked at the change in New York\u2019s unemployment rate compared to the nation as a whole, and found that the state\u2019s rate grew more slowly than the national average.", "The unemployment rates were identical \u2014 4.2 percent \u2014 in New York and the U.S. in January 2001. But the nation\u2019s unemployment rate jumped 3.6 percentage points, to 7.8 percent in January 2009, while New York\u2019s rate climbed by 3 percentage points to 7.2 percent.", "We also ranked all 50 states by the increase in unemployment rates, with No. 1 having the smallest percentage point increase and No. 50 having the largest. New York ranked 22nd \u2014 better than most other states.", "Louisiana, which ranked No. 1,\u00a0saw its unemployment rate during this time increase by just 0.3 percentage points, from 5.8 percent to 6.1 percent. The largest increased occurred in Michigan, where the unemployment rate climb from 4.4 percent to 11.2 percent \u2014 a jump of 6.8 percentage points. (Our 50-state data can be found here.)", "As for job growth, \u00a0New York did lose jobs \u2014 as did all but one state in the Northeast \u2014 from January 2001 to January 2009. New Hampshire was the only Northeast state to gain jobs (7,000) during this time.", "New York\u2019s 23,500 job losses represented about a one-quarter of 1 percent loss in jobs during Clinton\u2019s term in office.\u00a0That was the second smallest rate of decline behind only Pennsylvania. The worst was Massachusetts, which lost 142,000 jobs, or 4.2 percent of its total nonfarm jobs.", "We ranked the nine Northeast states by the percent change in total jobs from January 2001 to January 2009 in the chart below.", "We also looked at job growth in the nation as a whole during this eight-year period when Clinton was senator, and how New York compared.", "There were 18 states that lost jobs, including New York.\u00a0As we mentioned, New York lost 23,500 jobs, which represented about one-quarter of 1 percent fewer total jobs than it had in January 2001. That ranked New York 36th\u00a0\u2014 which is low, but not \u201cworse than just about any place in the country.\u201d", "Wyoming ranked No. 1 with a 21.5 percent increase in jobs; the state saw its number of jobs increase from 242,600 jobs in January 2001 to 294,800 in January 2009.\u00a0Michigan ranked dead last, losing nearly 662,000 jobs \u2014 14.4 percent of its job base. Other big jobs losers, in order, were Ohio (7.1 percent), Massachusetts (4.1 percent), Illinois (4 percent), Indiana (3.6 percent) and Rhode Island (2.6 percent).", "Trump has every right to criticize Clinton for failing to keep her promise to create jobs, but he exaggerates when he claims that New York\u2019s job losses were \u201cworse than just about any place in the country\u201d when she was senator.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/607cd8b0-69be-44e4-a226-131b834c7020", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
