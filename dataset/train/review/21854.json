(AP)", "An article sounding alarm bells about \"Islamic Extremism\" and migrants said that a new law designed to combat terrorism in the Czech Republic allows citizens to carry guns.", "\"Breaking: Czech Republic arms citizens.

In fact, the same story appeared on multiple websites and Facebook in June 2017.", "While patriotnetwork.one portrayed the law as a done deal, it was only approved by one chamber of the government and so has not actually become law.", "In 2015, Czech president Milos Zeman called for an international military effort against terrorism and the Islamic State group.", "Speaking at a Holocaust commemoration forum in Prague, Zeman said such military action would prevent what he called a \"super Holocaust,\" in which hundreds of millions would die.", "Zeman said in 2016 interview that Czechs should obtain guns to protect themselves against terrorists.", "''If it is necessary, people will have to be ready for a situation where they will have to use those guns,'' he said.

But it was rejected by the Senate in December when it fell short of the needed three-fifths majority.

The Muslim population was less than 4,000 in the 2011 census, but participants weren\u2019t required to fill out information about their religion.
