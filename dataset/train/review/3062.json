The amount on Social Security checks is closer to the truth.", "One of the main things that\u2019s off about the claim is its characterization of refugees as \"illegal.\" Refugees are not here illegally. They enter the country legally under a refugee status and must apply for permanent lawful status one year after their arrival. The implication that they don\u2019t have a legal status is baseless.", "Refugees come to the United States because they are fleeing wars or persecution in their homelands.

Palmer then told us.", "A State Department spokesperson told PolitiFact that the department provides a Reception and Placement per capita grant to nine national resettlement agencies to cover a portion of the initial reception, basic services, and material goods that resettlement agencies are required to provide to arriving refugees during their first 30 to 90 days in the United States.", "In fiscal year 2018, each grant totals $2,125 per refugee, according to the State Department. That includes assistance with rent, furnishings, necessary clothing, and food, as well as funding for the resettlement agency affiliate to provide case management services, cultural orientation, and connect refugees with employment services and English language classes, among other services, the State Department said.", "The specific $3,874 figure mirrors a 2017 Facebook post falsely claiming that\u2019s how much one \"illegal\" refugee in Canada received per month from the \"federal assistance program.\"", "Besides wrongfully labeling refugees as \"illegal,\" the post had several other shortcomings. For instance, the payment was not for one refugee, but for a family of five; and the $3,874 was not a recurring monthly payment. That amount did include some regular monthly benefits for housing, food, and transportation, but it also listed one-time \"start-up\" benefits and a loan, Snopes found in 2017.", "More than a decade ago, the Canadian government debunked a version of a false comparison of payments to refugees and pensioners.
