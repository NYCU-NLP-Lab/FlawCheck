Many speculate that the organization has been bribed by Big Food companies who want a hold on what the FDA deems as healthy so that adults and children can be misguided about what to eat.", "Based on a rudimentary system of saying that any food that\u2019s low in fat, sodium, and cholesterol, as well as full of some \u201cbeneficial nutrients,\u201d many processed foods are healthier than wholesome produce in the eyes of the FDA.", "Alternative health sites Natural News and Complete Health & Happiness published versions of the same article, adding:", "According to the FDA's definition, avocados are not considered healthy because 1 ounce contains 4.5 grams of fat. It doesn't matter to them that it is the \"good\" type of fat. Likewise, almonds, with their 14 grams of fat per ounce, and salmon, with its 11 grams of fat per 3-ounce serving, are also considered unhealthy foods despite their well-documented health benefits.", "Pop Tarts, Spaghetti-Os and Frosted Flakes are better than salmon and almonds?", "On the other hand, some of the foods that make the cut according to their criteria are absolutely laughable.

The FDA rescinded that demand last month, though Kind made other tweaks to its labels based on the FDA\u2019s missive.", "Food can only be marketed as healthy if it meets five criteria: fat, saturated fat, sodium, cholesterol and beneficial nutrients, such as vitamin C or Calcium.
