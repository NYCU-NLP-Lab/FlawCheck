USA TODAY has debunked those claims.", "Related to allegations of election fraud, an Instagram post claims a\u00a019th century\u00a0act of treason led to a far harsher sentence than prison.", "\"Did you know in 1863 4 people where HUNG for TREASON....all because they tried to STEAL the ELECTIONS from Lincoln!\" writes one Facebook user in a Dec. 18 post, which has 7,300 shares.\u00a0Another user posted the same claim on Dec. 31.", "It is unclear whether the posts\u00a0were intended to be satirical.

Lincoln died the next day.", "Booth, a Confederate sympathizer who was \"deeply disappointed\" the Confederacy lost the war, regarded Lincoln as his personal enemy, said Terry Alford, author of \"Fortune's Fool \u2013 The Life of John Wilkes Booth,\"\u00a0to WTOP News in 2014.", "The original plot\u00a0against Lincoln, concocted some time before his\u00a0assassination, was actually a kidnapping.
