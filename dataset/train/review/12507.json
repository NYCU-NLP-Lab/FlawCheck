To make yourself heard, you have to do something out of the ordinary. There, inherently, is this expression of creativity that comes with protests, so you can say, 'I am important. I am a human.'\"", "The articles don\u2019t quote Sinema as saying anything specifically against the troops.

Text in that flyer said, \"You can help us push back U.S. terror in Iraq and the Middle East.\" The Senate Leadership Fund said this was evidence showing the accuracy of McSally\u2019s claim. Sinema\u2019s campaign told CNN, however, that Sinema did not approve or design the flyers. The flyers were not used in McSally's ad claiming that Sinema denigrated troops. McSally's campaign did not send PolitiFact the flyers \u2014 or any other material \u2014 as evidence for the claim. McSally's ad focused on Sinema wearing a tutu. Contemporaneous reporting of the event in which Sinema wore a tutu did not say that Sinema denigrated troops.
