Rose noted that the presentation in question centered on race relations and referenced a popular existing Twitter hashtag that was not created by Binghamton RAs:", "A program facilitated by three student resident advisors (RA\u2019s) as part of an educational program for RA staff training has prompted public and internal comment and inquiry. The program title \u201c#StopWhitePeople2K16\u201d was drawn from a familiar hashtag in use on Twitter, and was not invented by the program facilitators. It is my understanding that the hashtag is commonly used ironically.", "The optional program was developed by the students themselves, supported by a young professional staff person. Its purpose, as conceived, was to facilitate a discussion among the RA\u2019s that would improve their ability to handle conflicts among residents around issues of diversity.", "Upon learning of the concerns expressed over the session\u2019s title by some off-campus groups and individuals, the university\u2019s student-affairs office reviewed the session and the program content more closely to obtain an accurate understanding.", "We verified that the actual program content was not \u201canti-white\u201d. The inclusion of the program in the educational session was not driven by any university administration initiative to advocate any specific viewpoint on diversity. About 40-50 RA\u2019s chose to attend the session which ran concurrently with some other sessions. Topically the discussion in the program was far-ranging, student driven and explored reverse racism, the relationship of communities of color with police, whiteness, crime and segregation in an open conversation format. Post session feedback predominantly described the session as a respectful and productive conversation. Professional staff followed up directly with a few participants who had a mixed reaction to the program in support of those participants.", "What we strive to do from an administrative level is cultivate an environment where our students listen to one another, learn from one another and do so in a manner that doesn\u2019t cause unnecessary harm. I have no indication that this particular program was inconsistent with the respectful environment we hope to support and sustain.", "Nevertheless, rumors quickly spread on social media indicating that Binghamton was offering a full course in their curriculum called \"Stop White People,\" and a number of web sites and online users reacted to that misinterpretation.", "We contacted the university's media relations department and a representative with whom we spoke reiterated that the RA-only presentation was student-led and student-managed, adding that Binghamton at no time has offered a \"Stop White People\" class as part of any school curriculum.", "Hecht, Howard. \u00a0 \"Binghamton University\u2019s Office of Student Affairs Supports \u201c#StopWhitePeople2K16\u201d RA Event, Despite Its Controversial Title.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Binghamton Review. \u00a0 24 August 2016.", "Starnes, Todd. \u00a0 \"University Hosts 'Stop White People' Workshop.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Fox Nation. \u00a0 25 August 2016.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
