In 1717, Lady Mary Montagu, the wife of the British ambassador in Istanbul, wrote a letter to some of her friends telling them that in Istanbul there was something \u2018called vaccination\u2019 to treat people with smallpox in Istanbul.", "\u201cLady Mary explained that women and children were gathered and then there was an incision on their arms. After that they were given something and they would experience a mild fever, and they became immune. This letter was\u00a0the oldest document related to the production and use of vaccines. The letter was dated April 1, 1717.\u201d", "Lady Mary Wortley Montagu was an essayist and feminist, as well as the wife of Edward Wortley Montagu, who in 1716 was appointed as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica.", "The same claim has been shared more than 180 times after it was posted on Facebook here, here, here\u00a0and here.", "The claim is misleading; the first vaccine was introduced in 1796\u00a0by British physician Edward Jenner, according to multiple historical accounts; the medical procedure prior to that was known as \u201cvariolation\u201d or \u201cinoculation\u201d.", "The first smallpox vaccine, created by Jenner in 1796 as an alternative to variolation, was the first successful vaccine to be developed, according to the World Health Organization here and the US National Library of Medicines here.", "\u201cThe first vaccine was introduced by British physician Edward Jenner, who in 1796 used the cowpox virus (vaccinia) to confer protection against smallpox, a related virus, in humans,\u201d says Encyclopaedia Britannica here.", "Lady Mary Wortley Montagu", "Lady Montagu\u2019s letter that mentioned\u00a0immunization in Constantinople\u00a0dated April 1, 1717, can be read here.", "She sent the letter to her friend Sarah Chiswell in London, explaining a medical procedure in the Ottoman Empire to treat smallpox.", "AFP has highlighted part of the letter that mentions\u00a0the procedure:", "It says: \u201cShe immediately rips open that you offer to her with a large needle (which gives you no more pain than a common scratch) and puts into the vein as much venom as can lie upon the head of her needle, and after binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell, and in this manner opens four or five veins.\u201d", "The procedure described by Lady Montagu in her letter was known as \u201cvariolation\u201d, according to this\u00a0timeline on historyofvaccines.org, a website by the College of Physicians of Philadelphia.", "According to the timeline, variolation, also known as \u201cinoculation\u201d, was practiced in China, Africa and the Ottoman Empire before spreading to Europe.
