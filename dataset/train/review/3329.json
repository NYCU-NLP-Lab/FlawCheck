["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on October 13, 2020", "President Donald Trump made false and misleading statements in an attempt to contrast his stance on law enforcement with that of Joe Biden, his Democratic opponent in the presidential race:", "Trump made his claims from a White House balcony, addressing a crowd of supporters on the South Lawn, in the event organized by the conservative group Blexit, which calls for Black Americans to exit the Democratic Party. And he repeated some of the claims in an Oct. 12 campaign rally in Florida.", "The president\u2019s reelection campaign has cultivated a \u201claw and order\u201d theme, falsely portraying Biden as a supporter of defunding the police. Biden has said repeatedly that he does not support defunding the police, as he wrote in\u00a0an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0published in\u00a0USA Today\u00a0on June 10.\u00a0While he\u00a0has said\u00a0he would support shifting some funding from law enforcement to social service agencies, Biden also has talked about increasing funding for departments that agree to \u201cimplement meaningful reforms.\u201d", "The Biden campaign also told us in a statement in June that Biden supports more money for initiatives that would strengthen the relationship between the police and the community and for body-worn cameras.", "Trump referred to what Biden said, or didn\u2019t say, at the Sept. 29 presidential debate.", "Trump, Oct. 10:\u00a0The other day in the debate Biden couldn\u2019t even use the words law enforcement. I said, \u201cSay law enforcement. Say law enforcement,\u201d and he was bailed out by the anchor. Then I said, very simply I said, \u201cName one law enforcement group that\u2019s supporting you,\u201d he couldn\u2019t do it, but he was bailed out by the anchor. Second time bailed. He got bailed out by that anchor a lot. Taking their funds away, their firearms, their fundamental authorities, taking everything away, including your freedom. Joe Biden even said, \u201cWhen you call 911, a therapist should answer the call.\u201d That doesn\u2019t work. That doesn\u2019t work.", "In an Oct. 12 rally in Florida, Trump repeated a few of those claims, saying: \u201cAt our debate, Biden could not name a single law enforcement organization that supports him, not one.\u201d And: \u201cThen I said, say the words \u2018law enforcement,\u2019 just say it. Couldn\u2019t do it, he couldn\u2019t say it.\u201d", "At one point in the debate, Trump said to Biden: \u201cYou can\u2019t even say the word \u2018law enforcement\u2019 because if you say those words, you\u2019re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren\u2019t you saying those words, Joe? Why don\u2019t you say the words \u2018law enforcement\u2019?\u201d", "After Trump finished his comments, moderator Chris Wallace turned to his next question, saying, \u201cAll right. I want to return to the question of race.\u201d So Biden didn\u2019t respond to Trump\u2019s comments then, but Biden said \u201claw enforcement\u201d in his answer to Wallace\u2019s question about race, going on to say \u201cthe vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women.\u201d", "Here\u2019s what was said immediately after Trump finished asking Biden to \u201csay the words law enforcement\u201d:", "Wallace, Sept. 29 debate: All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, quote \u201cwhether justice could be equally applied in America.\u201d Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?", "Biden: Yes, there is. There\u2019s systemic injustice in this country. In education, in work and in law enforcement and the way in which it\u2019s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us. But there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable.", "And what I\u2019m going to do as president of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups to the police officers, the police chiefs, and we\u2019re going to work this out.", "We\u2019re going to work this out so we change the way in which we have more transparency in when these things happen. These cops aren\u2019t happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren\u2019t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don\u2019t like it. But we have to have a system where people are held accountable.", "And, by the way, violence in response is never appropriate. Never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.", "Later in the debate, Biden again used the words \u201claw enforcement\u201d when Wallace asked him about language in the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations, a document containing policy recommendations from Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, released in early July.", "Wallace: I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though, and in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote, \u201creimagining policing.\u201d First of all, what does reimagining policing mean and do you support \u2026 If I might finish the question. What does reimagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call for community control of policing?", "Biden: Look, what I support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face. I\u2019m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact, local police. The only one defunding, and his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance.", "They need, when they show up for a 911 call, to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before, where the officers get to know the people in the communities.", "Trump claimed in his Oct. 10 event that \u201cBiden even said, \u2018When you call 911, a therapist should answer the call.'\u201d That appears to be a reference to Biden\u2019s remark that the police should \u201chave someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down.\u201d While Trump added, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work,\u201d the president, in fact, has proposed a similar policy.", "On June 16, Trump signed an executive order on policing that called for \u201cco-responder programs, which involve social workers or other mental health professionals working alongside law enforcement officers so that they arrive and address situations together.\u201d", "Executive Order on Safe Policing for Safe Communities, June 16: The Attorney General shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services as appropriate, identify and develop opportunities to train law enforcement officers with respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental health, homelessness, and addiction; to increase the capacity of social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies; and to provide guidance regarding the development and implementation of co-responder programs, which involve social workers or other mental health professionals working alongside law enforcement officers so that they arrive and address situations together.", "The Biden-Sanders policy document contains similar language, calling for: \u201cFederal funding to create a civilian corps of unarmed first responders such as social workers, EMTs, and trained mental health professionals, who can handle nonviolent emergencies including order maintenance violations, mental health emergencies, and low-level conflicts outside the criminal justice system, freeing police officers to concentrate on the most serious crimes. Fund initiatives to partner mental health professionals, substance use disorder experts, social workers, and disability advocates with police departments to respond to calls with police officers to better de-escalate interactions with citizens and when appropriate, to divert individuals to the social services they need.\u201d", "We asked the Trump campaign what the difference was between Biden\u2019s call for mental health professionals to respond with police to calls and Trump\u2019s executive order supporting \u201cco-responder programs\u201d with \u201csocial workers or other mental health professionals.\u201d We haven\u2019t received a response.", "As for Biden\u2019s claim in the debate that Trump\u2019s budget \u201ccalls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance,\u201d Trump\u2019s 2021 budget did call for a reduction in funding, compared with what Congress enacted in 2020, for a host of federal Justice Department programs that pertain to state and local law enforcement. Our fact-checking colleagues at PolitiFact found the net reduction was $515 million, though $100 million of that concerns security at the national party conventions (which wouldn\u2019t be needed in a 2021 budget).", "The largest proposed reductions were to the Community Oriented Policing Services program (which the Trump budget proposed reorganizing), the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants (which provides criminal justice grants to state and local governments) and the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (which pays state and local entities for salary costs associated with incarcerating immigrants who are in the country illegally and committed certain crimes).", "But one expert told PolitiFact that some of the programs fund what\u2019s better described as public safety goals rather than direct assistance to law enforcement.", "Trump also claimed that at the debate, he asked Biden to \u201cname one law enforcement group that\u2019s supporting you\u201d and Biden \u201ccouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that Biden didn\u2019t name anyone at the debate when Trump asked him to do so. But, as we wrote in our story on the debate, Biden is\u00a0backed by some current and former law enforcement officials. The campaign released a list of more than 190 officials who say they support Biden, including current and former police officers, sheriffs, attorneys general and district attorneys.", "Trump has been endorsed by the National Association of Police Organizations and the Fraternal Order of Police, as well as state and local police organizations, such as the union for New York City officers.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
