Pence recycled a flawed GOP talking point that the foundation is a cash cow to enrich the Clintons and their friends.", "\"10 cents on the\u00a0dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes,\" Pence said.", "This is based on a misunderstanding of how the foundation operates. In brief, it raises money to deliver services and projects itself. The amount of money it gives away as grants is a small sliver of its activities.", "We\u2019ll use the Clinton Foundation\u2019s most recent IRS tax form, for 2014, as an example. (It starts on Page 28 of this document.) The foundation reported total expenses in 2014 of a little over $91 million but grants of just $5.1 million. That\u2019s close to 6 percent of the foundation\u2019s money being spent on grants.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean everything else is overhead, people who monitor charities and their practices say, or that only 10 cents of every dollar went to a charitable cause.", "\"Although it has \u2018foundation\u2019 in its name, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity,\" Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University\u2019s Fisher College of Business, wrote in the Chronicle of Philanthropy. \"In practical terms, this means both that it relies heavily on donations from the public and that it achieves its mission primarily by using those donations to conduct direct charitable activities, as opposed to providing grants from an endowment.\"", "What are some of the foundation\u2019s programs?", "The Clinton Development Initiative helps farmers in Malawi, Rwanda and Tanzania raise more crops and get higher prices at the market.", "The Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership launched the Acceso Centro de Formacion to provide job training for people in Cartagena, Colombia.", "The Clinton Health Access Initiative, for instance, has gotten credit for providing access to lower-cost drugs for millions of people with HIV/AIDS.", "Financial statement rules require a nonprofit to split its expenses between program services, fundraising and management/general costs (the latter two are collectively what are referred to as \"overhead\"), Mittendorf told us.", "He said that in 2014, 87.2 percent of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s expenses were on program services.", "\"Of course, this only speaks to how the organization used its funds and not whether that 87.2 percent was allocated to the most effective program efforts, but it is all we have in terms of verifiable data on this question,\" Mittendorf said.", "The American Institute of Philanthropy\u2019s Charity Watch, reached the same conclusion.
