["By Jessica McDonald and Catalina Jaramillo", "Posted on January 22, 2021 | Updated on August 11, 2021", "A viral video makes a series of inaccurate and unfounded arguments for why people should not receive any vaccines, including those for COVID-19.", "The full ingredient list for any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website and in a variety of documents on the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s website, including in a fact sheet for vaccine recipients that\u2019s available in numerous languages.", "Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines contain messenger RNA, or mRNA; a variety of fatty molecules, or lipids, to protect the mRNA; and a few other ingredients, including salts and sugar, to keep the vaccine stable and at the proper pH, or balance of acidity and alkalinity. The Novavax vaccine contains coronavirus spike proteins, an adjuvant made from soapbark tree bark to boost the immune response, and lipids, along with salts and stabilizing agents.", "There are no preservatives, egg or latex in the vaccines.", "Link to this", "The authorized or approved vaccines were initially tested in animals and early phase clinical trials, in which scientists evaluated different doses, checked for the expected immune responses and monitored for potential safety issues. To find out whether the shots prevent disease and are safe, the vaccines that passed the first set of tests were then evaluated in phase 3 trials.", "The Moderna and Novavax phase 3 trials each included about 30,000 volunteers, while the Pfizer/BioNTech\u00a0and Johnson & Johnson trials included about 44,000 each. In each of these trials, half of the participants received a placebo, while the other half received the vaccine, and the volunteers were followed over time to see if they fell ill with COVID-19 and had any adverse reactions.", "The trials were overseen by independent data and safety monitoring boards, and the results were reviewed not only by the Food and Drug Administration, which made the decision to authorize the vaccines for emergency use, but also by an outside panel of experts advising the agency. Another independent group, the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, also reviewed the data and recommended use of the vaccines.", "Following analysis of additional data from the phase 3 clinical trials, safety surveillance data and a review of the manufacturing process, including inspections of production facilities, the FDA granted full approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Aug. 23, 2021,\u00a0and the Moderna vaccine on Jan. 31, 2022.", "Pediatric versions of the mRNA vaccines were\u00a0authorized\u00a0based on\u00a0immune response data, which showed vaccinated kids had similar immune responses to vaccinated young adults, for whom\u00a0a clinical trial previously demonstrated efficacy.", "Booster doses of the original vaccines were also\u00a0authorized\u00a0primarily\u00a0based on data showing the additional shots increased levels of virus-specific antibodies.", "For omicron-updated vaccines, including the\u00a0bivalent doses\u00a0available in 2022-2023, and the\u00a0monovalent doses for the 2023-2024 season,\u00a0the FDA used an approach similar to how it approves flu vaccines each year, in which clinical studies are not required since the changes to the vaccine are minor.", "Link to this", "As COVID-19 cases continue to rise across the globe, anti-vaccination activists try to undermine people\u2019s confidence by spreading misinformation around the safety, efficacy and value of the COVID-19 vaccines.", "A 14-minute long video posted on January 13 by Steven Baker, a licensed chiropractor from Idaho, on Facebook and Instagram gives people five reasons why they \u201cshould definitely never vaccinate.\u201d The video has been liked since by 1,600 viewers on Facebook and viewed by over 50,000 on Instagram.", "Baker, who describes himself as a healer who\u2019s not anti-vaccine but anti-everything, has created a business selling misinformation about vaccines. In April, Facebook removed Baker\u2019s ad account and page after he falsely claimed that a \u201csilver spray\u201d sold on his website protected people from COVID-19. In another video shared on TikTok and fact-checked by PolitiFact, he said people were dying because of the economic collapse caused by the pandemic, not from COVID-19.", "In this video, Baker adds a disclaimer saying he\u2019s not giving medical advice. But he is.", "The first reason Baker gives to not get vaccinated is the ingredients in the vaccines. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t give your kid a shot of thimerosal, aluminum, aborted fetal tissue, chicken and eggs embryo \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he argues.", "But the fact is you probably already have for most of those items, and research shows the ingredients in vaccines are not harmful. Also, the two U.S. authorized COVID-19 vaccines don\u2019t contain any of those ingredients.", "Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative used in multi-dose vaccines to help prevent potentially deadly contamination from harmful microbes. Although most vaccines for children don\u2019t use it anymore, some influenza vaccines still do. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, a kind of mercury that\u2019s safer than methylmercury, which can be found in certain fish and animals. Ethylmercury is less toxic because it is broken down and excreted rapidly by the body. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the amount of mercury contained in a vaccine is roughly the same amount contained in a 3 ounce can of tuna fish.", "Aluminum salts are present in some vaccines. They are also found in some health products such as buffered aspirin and antacids, as well as in many foods and beverages, including fruit and vegetables, cereals, nuts, dairy products, flour, honey, and baby formula. The quantities of aluminum contained in vaccines are low and regulated. According to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, the amount of aluminum infants receive in their first six months of life from vaccines is about eight times lower than what they receive from formula, and about half of what they receive from breast milk in that same amount of time.", "Some vaccines are made in eggs \u2014 the influenza and yellow fever vaccines \u2014 therefore they contain egg proteins. Eggs from chickens raised on a farm are technically chicken embryos if fertilized by a rooster.", "Finally, Baker names fetal tissue as a vaccine ingredient. That\u2019s not accurate. Fetal cells obtained from two aborted pregnancies in the early 1960s, one in Sweden and one in England, were made into cell lines that are used to grow virus to make some vaccines, such as varicella (chickenpox), rubella and hepatitis A. But those cells aren\u2019t present in the vaccines themselves, since the virus is purified before it goes into a syringe.", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve\u00a0explained, the\u00a0Pfizer/BioNTech\u00a0and the\u00a0Moderna\u00a0COVID-19 vaccines\u00a0aren\u2019t made from a virus. According to the CDC, neither vaccine contains eggs, preservatives or latex.", "Vaccines do not go directly into the bloodstream, as Baker says in the video. Instead, most vaccines are injected into muscle or skin.", "Baker goes on to incorrectly say that vaccines \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d because they don\u2019t \u201cprevent the virus or bacteria from getting in your body. What they do is that they reduce the amount of symptoms that you have from that bacteria or virus.\u201d", "Many vaccines are in fact helpful precisely because they reduce symptoms \u2014 less severe disease means less suffering and fewer deaths. This is a huge part of why vaccines have been so beneficial to society.", "It is true that not all vaccines can prevent infection, or do so fully. But that\u2019s not a requirement for a vaccine to be effective. A vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a \u201cproduct that stimulates a person\u2019s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease.\u201d", "The idea is to train the immune system to recognize a particular pathogen so that if someone does encounter the germ, they will either not become infected or will not get sick \u2014 or if they do have symptoms, they will be less severe. This usually involves introducing a piece of or a small amount of weakened or killed virus or bacteria into the body.", "Some vaccines produce what\u2019s called sterilizing immunity, which is when antibodies glom onto a pathogen and remove it before it has a chance to enter cells and set up an infection. This happens, for example, with the measles, hepatitis A and human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccines.", "\u201cIf you\u2019re given the measles vaccine \u2014 two doses \u2014 you have a 97% chance of being protected against measles for the rest of your life. And not just disease \u2014 also asymptomatic infection,\u201d Dr. Paul A. Offit,\u00a0a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us, referring to when someone is infected but doesn\u2019t have symptoms. \u201cYou\u2019re done with that virus.\u201d", "Many other vaccines, Offit said, including seasonal influenza, rotavirus, whooping cough and pneumococcal vaccines, keep people from becoming seriously ill but aren\u2019t able to prevent infection. \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he said, because \u201cthe main goal you\u2019re trying to do in these cases is prevent children or adults from being hospitalized or killed.\u201d", "Importantly, many vaccines can still reduce the spread of a disease even if they don\u2019t stop infection, contrary to Baker\u2019s other claim that vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, \u201cdon\u2019t prevent transmission.\u201d", "That can happen, Offit said, because a vaccinated person often sheds less virus, making them less contagious.", "It\u2019s not known yet whether the authorized COVID-19 vaccines prevent transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but it\u2019s likely the same dynamic will be at play and the vaccines will limit transmission to some degree.", "Until more is known, it\u2019s important that people who receive a COVID-19 vaccine don\u2019t assume they can\u2019t pass the virus on to others \u2014 and continue to wear masks and physically distance \u2014 but it\u2019s also premature for Baker to declare the vaccines to be useless in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.", "As part of Baker\u2019s specious argument that vaccines \u201cdon\u2019t work,\u201d he brings up the example of polio and falsely says the disease subsided because of sanitation, not vaccination.", "\u201cObviously, polio went away because of sanitation because it\u2019s a fecal-oral disease,\u201d Baker says. \u201cAnd if you start washing your hands and not drinking water in the streets, you\u2019re probably not going to get polio.\u201d", "While better sanitation helps reduce the spread of poliovirus, which is passed along primarily through feces but can also be spread through infectious droplets from sneezes or coughs, it is vaccination that is credited with eliminating the virus in the U.S.", "After all, sanitation was quite good in 1950s America, but polio was still a major threat to families every summer.", "Perhaps counterintuitively, improved sanitation is thought to be why there was a surge in polio cases in the U.S. in the beginning of the early 20th century.", "\u201cBefore 1910, polio was silently circulating,\u201d explained Micaela Martinez, an infectious disease ecologist at Columbia University who has studied the history of the disease.", "The virus was rampant, she said, but because virtually everyone would become infected as an infant when there is a low risk of getting severe disease and developing paralysis, it wasn\u2019t particularly noticed.", "As sanitation improved, however, children wouldn\u2019t encounter the virus until they were older, when the risk of paralysis was greater. \u201cSo sanitation actually led to this first emergence of polio as being a widespread paralytic disease,\u201d Martinez told us.", "Polio epidemics became even worse after World War II with the baby boom, as more children were around to further spread the disease, she added. It wasn\u2019t until vaccines arrived that cases began to fall \u2014 from more than 15,000 paralysis cases every year, according to the CDC, to fewer than 100 annually in the 1960s and fewer than 10 each year in the following decade.", "The disease was eliminated in the U.S. in 1979, meaning there is no ongoing transmission of polio in the country, and no cases have originated in the U.S. since that time. Polio vaccination is still important, however, as the disease could be introduced at any time by travelers.", "Baker proceeds to incorrectly say that there is \u201cno such thing as a safe trial with vaccines,\u201d because no vaccines are tested against what he considers true placebos. This is categorically false.", "\u201cWhat they do is they actually compare the vaccine that they\u2019re testing to a different vaccine, or they will compare the vaccine they\u2019re testing to a syringe that is full of aluminum and everything in the vaccine, except for the antigen,\u201d he says, referring to the part of the vaccine that will trigger the specific immune response.", "In fact, many vaccines have been tested against a saline, or saltwater, placebo in randomized controlled trials, including influenza and certain mumps, polio and measles vaccines. But there are also good reasons to use different placebo controls in trials \u2014 and it does not mean a vaccine has not been fully vetted for safety.", "For example, as outlined by a World Health Organization expert panel, if a safe and effective vaccine against a specific disease already exists, then the real question becomes whether the new vaccine performs similarly or better, and in many cases it would be unethical to deprive a group of people of a protective vaccine.", "It is also argued, Offit said, that it\u2019s not fair to enroll participants in a vaccine trial and not give them something of benefit, which sometimes means giving a different vaccine as a control.", "Another potential reason for deviating from a saline placebo is preserving the blinding of a trial, making sure volunteers in trials don\u2019t know whether they have been randomly assigned to the control group, since many vaccines do have some minor, temporary side effects, such as arm soreness, that can clue participants into which shot they received.", "Baker gets his facts wrong once again when says the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was tested against a meningitis vaccine. Both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, which are the only two COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for use in the U.S., were tested against a saline placebo.", "Some arms of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial did include a meningococcal vaccine as a control to reduce the chance that control volunteers would know they didn\u2019t get the COVID-19 vaccine. That\u2019s true of the U.K. portion of the trial and part of the Brazilian trial, which used the meningococcal group A, C, W and Y conjugate vaccine as a control for the first dose, but not the second.", "Saline, however, was used for the South African arm of the trial and the 30,000-person trial in the U.S., which is still ongoing.", "Baker also argues people should not get vaccinated because vaccines are not safe and companies are not liable.", "\u201cYou cannot sue them, but yet they have a special court. And that special court to date has paid out over $4 billion in damages,\u201d he says.", "Baker is referring to the National Vaccines Injury Compensation Program, created by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.", "Vaccines are extensively tested to ensure they\u2019re effective and safe. But just like any other medication, they\u2019re not risk-free and can cause adverse events or side effects. Most vaccines can cause pain, redness or tenderness where they were injected, and some can cause more severe events.", "Beginning in the mid-1970s, several lawsuits were filed against vaccine-makers and health care providers, which led manufacturers to stop their production. They were forced to pay for damages despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting injury claims. The threats of a vaccine shortage moved Congress to pass the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which creates a compensation fund. According to the\u00a0latest data, the government has paid out nearly $4.2 billion in compensation since 1988.", "But as we have previously explained, the fact that there have been payouts doesn\u2019t mean that vaccines caused an injury. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration, approximately 70% of all compensation awarded by the fund is a result of a negotiated settlement between the parties, previous to any review of the evidence, to save time and money.", "Still, the number of complaints and compensations is very low. Over 3.7 billion doses of covered vaccines were distributed in the U.S. from 2006 to 2018, according to the CDC. In that same period of time, only 7,589 petitions were adjudicated and of those 5,317 were compensated.", "The World Health Organization estimates that\u00a0immunizations prevent 2 to 3 million deaths every year globally.\u00a0In the U.S., the CDC estimates flu vaccines averted 105,000 hospitalizations and 6,300 deaths in the 2019-2020 season, according to preliminary data.", "The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act also requires health care providers to report side effects occurring after immunization to the Vaccines Adverse Event Reporting System, a program created in 1990 and co-administrated by the CDC and the FDA.", "The act also allows individuals to pursue legal action against a vaccine manufacturer under certain conditions, including negligence on the part of the vaccine-maker.", "In the video, Baker falsely claims that unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated children and cites a study published in November 2020 in International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, an open-access journal. The journal says it is peer-reviewed but its lack of rigor has been cause for concern. The quality of its publisher, Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute, has also been questioned \u2014 in 2018, 10 senior editors resigned, saying they were being pressured to receive mediocre studies.", "Update, Aug. 11: The study,\u00a0which claimed that\u00a0kids with fewer vaccinations had fewer office visits\u00a0at one of the authors\u2019 private practices, was\u00a0retracted\u00a0by the journal on July 22, following concerns \u201cregarding the validity of the conclusions.\u201d \u201cAdhering to our complaints procedure, an investigation was conducted that raised several methodological issues and confirmed that the conclusions were not supported by strong scientific data,\u201d the retraction reads.", "The study is\u00a0co-authored by James Lyons-Weiler and Paul Thomas, and funded by The Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, a nonprofit directed by Lyons-Weiler, a scientist who has been spreading misleading information on COVID-19 and vaccines for years.", "Thomas, a pediatrician in Portland, Oregon, had his license revoked in December for failing to adequately vaccinate patients. According to the Oregon Medical Board, his conduct \u201chas breached the standard of care and has placed the health and safety of many of his patients at serious risk of harm.\u201d One of his unvaccinated patients developed a severe case of tetanus that required a two-month stay in an intensive care unit.", "In the video, Baker baselessly accuses the CDC of profiting off vaccines and falsely states that Dr. Thomas\u2019 license was removed because of the \u201ctruth\u201d revealed in his study. \u201cThe CDC is not in the business to make you safe or help you and your kids, the CDC is in the business of marketing vaccines and profiting off of you and your family getting vaccinated, period,\u201d he argues.", "Vaccination is essential because it helps provide immunity and prevents potential life-threatening diseases, according to the CDC. All vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, meet rigorous safety criteria set by the FDA.", "\u201cThe fact of the matter is, not shockingly, people who are vaccinated are healthier because they\u2019re not likely to catch bacterial and viral infections,\u201d Offit said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a year that goes by at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia where we do not see a child suffer and die from a vaccine-preventable disease because the parent chose not to vaccinate them.\u201d", "The top reason to avoid all vaccinations, Baker baselessly says, is that vaccines cause autoimmune diseases. He even goes so far as to say that COVID-19 vaccines will \u201ccreate millions and millions of people with an autoimmune disease.\u201d There is no evidence for that.", "Baker betrays his lack of knowledge on the subject by claiming this happens because with vaccines you are \u201cbypassing natural defenses\u201d instead of \u201chaving a true actual immune response\u201d and by likening vaccination to getting an organ transplant in which you need drugs to suppress the immune system.", "But vaccination is nothing like an organ transplant. And vaccines only temporarily activate the immune system, doing so in a safer way than natural infection.", "\u201cSince vaccines don\u2019t drive the immune response nearly as vigorously as natural infections do, it is less likely that they would induce autoimmunity,\u201d explains the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia\u2019s website.", "Scientists have looked into whether vaccines trigger autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, and have come up empty, with no clear signal that they do.", "\u201cIt\u2019s okay to ask the question,\u201d Offit said, \u201cbut when study after study after study shows that vaccines don\u2019t induce autoimmunity and it doesn\u2019t make sense they would induce autoimmunity, people should believe them.\u201d", "One autoimmune disorder, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, has been linked to influenza vaccination, but inconsistently so \u2014 and at very low frequencies, around 1 to 2 in 1 million doses. Most people who develop the condition fully recover, although some people are left with permanent nerve damage and some people die.", "Cases of the disease also follow infections, and research shows that the risk of developing Guillain-Barr\u00e9 from flu is much higher than after immunization with a flu shot.", "In another rare instance, a pandemic flu vaccine in Europe in 2009-2010 may have provoked some people with a genetic predisposition to develop an autoimmune reaction that led to narcolepsy. But in that case as well, it\u2019s not entirely clear what role the vaccine played, and it\u2019s possible natural infection with influenza poses a similar or higher risk.", "While scientists continue to monitor for any sign that immunizations might lead to autoimmunity, there is no basis for Baker\u2019s claim that vaccines, including those for COVID-19, are dangerous because they cause autoimmune diseases.", "Clarification, Jan. 28: We have removed the \u201cDr.\u201d title for Baker. As we wrote in our story, Baker is not a medical doctor.", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
