["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on April 11, 2019", "A meme targeting\u00a0Rep. Ilhan Omar uses an edited quote to cast doubt on her \u201callegiance\u201d to the United States.", "Online falsehoods about Rep. Ilhan Omar are in no short supply. We\u2019ve previously covered deceptive claims about the Minnesota Democrat\u2019s religion, her\u00a0election\u00a0and her\u00a0commitment\u00a0to the U.S. Constitution.", "The latest work of fiction about Omar \u2014 one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress \u2014 uses a doctored quote to cast doubt on her fidelity to the U.S.", "\u201cI should not be expected to pledge allegiance to any country \u2026 including America,\u201d the popular meme\u00a0on Facebook reads.", "The meme further asserts that it\u2019s a \u201cDem representative Ilhan Omar quote.\u201d", "But there\u2019s no evidence Omar ever said that. Instead, the supposed quote is likely a modified version of a\u00a0remark\u00a0that Omar made in relation to Israel.", "For context: In early February, Omar was criticized\u00a0for comments she posted on Twitter about a pro-Israel lobbying group,\u00a0American Israel Public Affairs Committee, that many viewed as anti-Semitic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats denounced \u201cCongresswoman Omar\u2019s use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel\u2019s supporters\u201d in her tweet as \u201cdeeply offensive.\u201d\u00a0Omar\u00a0apologized.", "Then, later that month, at a panel discussion, Omar addressed the criticism and in doing so said:\u00a0\u201cI want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is O.K. for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.\u201d", "That comment drew further criticism, with some interpreting the comment as another suggestion of \u201cdual loyalty\u201d on the part of Jewish people. A\u00a0spokesman for Omar, in a statement to media outlets, argued the quote was being misinterpreted and was about \u201cthe undue influence of lobbying groups for foreign interests of all kinds.\u201d", "In a March 3 tweet, responding to a fellow Democratic congresswoman\u2019s criticism, Omar wrote: \u201cOur democracy is built on debate, Congresswoman! I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on committee. The people of the 5th elected me to serve their interest. I am sure we agree on that!\u201d", "So, while Omar said she \u201cshould not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country,\u201d she did not say the same about the U.S. In fact, her tweet noted that her loyalty was with her constituents in Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cDemocratic Leadership Statement on Anti-Semitic Comments of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.\u201d Press release, Office of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 11 Feb 2019.", "Fabian, Jordan and Brett Samuels. \u201cTrump calls on Omar to resign over remarks condemned as anti-Semitic.\u201d The Hill. 12 Feb 2019.", "Facebook Live video of Progressive Issues Town Hall.
