And thanks greatly to their efforts, finally a peace was brokered in a historic deal.", "This is what we call smart power, using every possible tool and partner to advance peace and security, leaving no one on the sidelines, showing respect even for one's enemies, trying to understand, and insofar as psychologically possible, empathize with their perspective and point of view, helping to define the problems, determine the solutions \u2014 that is what we believe in the 21st century will change, change the prospects for peace.", "So, whereas the purveyors of the deceptive clip above would like us to think that Clinton implored Americans to \"respect our attackers\" and \"empathize with ISIS,\" what she actually said was that attempting to understand the point of view of one's enemies is one of many tools that can be employed in the service of \"smart power.\"", "Her speech in full can be viewed here:", "Georgetown University. \u00a0 \"Clinton: Including Women Essential to Peace Processes.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 3 December 2014.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
