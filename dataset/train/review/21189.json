The source confirmed there was little truth to the rumors about cancellations, describing the concerns as largely \"pedagogical\":", "As far as I can tell, most of the student concern about Wednesday (day after the election) exams was that the drama of the election night had led [many] to stay up very late, get very little sleep and very little studying done. This applied to both Trump and Clinton supporters; both groups [inquired about sitting for exams in a] less exhausted state. A very few students were facing a more serious issue, as they are from immigrant families with members who, they suddenly believed, rightly or wrongly, might face deportation.", "Adding that \"[s]ome faculty made accommodations to 9 November 2016] tests (but \"most did not\"), the source continued:", "None of the Wednesday exam accommodations were offered only to students \"upset by Trump,\" they also applied to happy but exhausted Trump supporters, or to anyone else for that matter ... In any case, [most] students took the exam yesterday at the regular time ... almost all students were functioning just fine on Wednesday, even if tired ... To my knowledge, no Yale faculty member offered on-going extensions or relief from work ... no student was freed from learning any material, as the final exam is comprehensive, long, and difficult. I would invite any critics of \"snowflake students\" to pass it!", "[Faculty] teaching social science courses [] want students to observe the election and think hard about [implications to relevant coursework], which probably [engendered] sympathy for those students transfixed by the late-night results. There is an article in the Harvard Crimson that quotes [a Yale professor], emphasizing his sympathy for exhausted students.", "Finally, the source stated that in hindsight, the distraction presented by the election in general was suboptimal with respect to exam timing. However, that individual confirmed that student exhaustion from staying up late to follow close election results (not being \"upset by Trump\") was largely the cause of modification to coursework, and that the students affected by the phenomenon include both Trump supporters and opponents.
