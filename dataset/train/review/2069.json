["On September 26, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) interrogated actress Deepika Padukone over her alleged involvement in the drug probe linked to actor Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s death. In the backdrop of this, an image of Padukone wearing a t-shirt with the slogan \u2018I stand with Indian farmers\u2019 is circulating on social media. It is noteworthy that farmer groups have been protesting against the Modi government\u2019s farm bills the last few months.
