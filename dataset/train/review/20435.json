["About this rating", "In late 2019, for reasons unknown, a two-year-old story about former Vice President Joe Biden's niece Caroline pleading guilty to charges related to a $110,000 credit-account theft circulated on social media.", "It's true that Caroline Biden in 2017 admitted to charges of grand larceny and petty larceny in a deal under which she was sentenced to two years' probation, along with her agreeing to pay restitution, perform 10 days of community service, and avoid being arrested again for a year. A 2017 report from CBS News noted that Biden, who was 29 at the time, \"used a borrowed credit card to open a customer account at [a Manhattan drug store] without the cardholder's OK then racked up the [$110,000] tab over a year.\"", "Prosecutors alleged Biden was given a credit card and permission to spend $672, but she ran up many times more than that amount at Bigelow Pharmacy on Sixth Avenue in Greenwich Village. In July 2018, the New York Post reported that Biden had expressed remorse for her actions at a court hearing in the case, stating: \"I not only acknowledge my conduct and take responsibility but deeply regret the harm caused.\" The Post also reported that Biden's felony conviction was tossed out in 2018 as part of her plea arrangement, and she pleaded to the lesser charge of petty larceny.", "The story was shared in the context of the privilege afforded to the children of world leaders, although it's unclear from the information available whether Caroline Biden was given preferential treatment. For example the right-leaning website TruePundit used the headline \"RIGGED: Joe Biden\u2019s Niece Skates from $110,000 Credit Card Scam; Judge Appointed by Biden Pal Bloomberg Spares Her Jail Time.\" However, prosecutors and not judges are generally responsible for crafting the plea deals offered to defendants.", "CBS News.\u00a0\"Caroline Biden, Joe Biden's Niece, Pleads Guilty in $110,000 Theft.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a010 June 2017.", "SRosenberg, Rebecca.\u00a0\"Biden\u2019s Niece Shows Remorse After Avoiding Jail in Credit Card Scam.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0New York Post.\u00a026 July 2018.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who started her career as a daily newspaper reporter and has covered everything from crime to government to national politics.
