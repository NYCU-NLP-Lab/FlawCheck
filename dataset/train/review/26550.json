["About this rating", "In 2019, explorers made five submersible dives to the Titanic wreck with the DSV Limiting Factor. It concluded that the ship was rapidly deteriorating.", "It was misleading for a December 2020 online advertisement to make it appear as if the expedition had just happened.

And Patrick Lahey \u2013 expedition member and president of Limiting Factor owner Triton Submarines \u2013 explained as much in a press release from Triton. Lahey revealed, \u201cThe most fascinating aspect [of the expedition] was seeing how the Titanic is being consumed by the ocean and returning to its elemental form while providing refuge for a remarkably diverse number of animals.\u201d", "And much has vanished, too. For example, one artifact known as the \u201ccaptain\u2019s bathtub\u201d \u2013 which has become famous thanks to various photographs \u2013 is no longer to be seen at the site. But what is left of the ship \u2013 as well as the thriving undersea wildlife that lives on the wreck \u2013 has been stunningly captured in the 4K footage that the divers were able to shoot.", "[Titanic history expert Parks] Stephenson emphasized the state of the vessel, too, when in August 2019 he told the BBC in August 2019, \u201c[The] Titanic is returning to nature.\u201d Powerful ocean currents, the corrosive action of salt water and bacteria that eat metal are all contributing to the disappearance of the the ship\u2019s wreck.", "It was true that a 2019 expedition found that the wreckage of the Titanic was rapidly deteriorating. Explorers took the DSV Limiting Factor submersible down to the ship five times.

He told USA Today that he didn't find the purported discovery to be \"shocking\":", "While photos of the ship may look ghostly, oceanographer David Gallo said the deterioration doesn't look much different than when he co-lead [sic] a remotely operated expedition to the Titanic in 2010. Gallo stressed that it's too soon to tell how long the ship will take to decay and more research needs to be done.", "\"I don\u2019t see what was seen as being 'shocking,'\" Gallo said. \"It's been over 100 years and the ship shows wear, but it certainly looks like it\u2019s going to last another 100 years,\"", "A documentary from the 2019 expedition titled \"Back to the Titanic\" was released on Disney+ and National Geographic.", "We recently covered other claims about the Titanic.
