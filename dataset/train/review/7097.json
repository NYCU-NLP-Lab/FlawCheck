We brought in the man seen in the clip for questioning. His name is Mohammed Yusuf Ilyas Shaikh, a resident of Valsad. During the questioning, we found that his right hand is paralysed after he had met with an accident. His right hand does not function properly which is why the notes fell out of his hand. A complaint has been filed against him for travelling from Valsad to Navsari during the lockdown.\u201d", "Brahmabatt was further asked if Ilyas is coronavirus positive or has symptoms for the disease. \u201cWe took him for a medical examination and found that he does not have symptoms. He has been advised home-quarantine,\u201d the inspector replied.", "We also contacted Ilyas who described the events of April 22. \u201cI had left in the morning to travel to Dabhel and stopped at a gas station en route to fill petrol. Since I was riding on the highway I was wearing spectacles and a mask. I met with an accident in 2009 and since then, I am unable to hold things in my right hand. There is movement in the hand but I cannot use it effectively. I didn\u2019t even realise when the notes fell out of my hand.\u201d", "Ilyas further said, \u201cIf you notice the video carefully, I used my left hand to reach my pocket and make the payment.

He then makes the payment using his left hand.", "Upon being asked about the FIR filed against him, Ilyas informed that he was called to Valsad police station for questioning. \u201cI informed the police that I hadn\u2019t gone to Navsari but Dabhel which comes in the highway route. I have implants in my spine which sometimes pain. So I have to visit the hospital in Dabhel for a check-up every 2-3 months. A few people came from Navsari police station and took me to the rural police station. I was then taken to Navsari government hospital for a check-up. The doctors found that I was perfectly fine and had no symptoms for coronavirus. I didn\u2019t even know what exactly was going on,\u201d he said.", "\u201cWhen I told the police about the paralysis in my right hand, they accepted that I dropped the note unintentionally. The people from the petrol pump also came to the police station. When they saw my hand, they understood that it was a mistake. I was subsequently given bail and have been staying at home as advised by the doctor,\u201d he continued.", "Ilyas also gave a video statement to Alt News that can be watched below. The video shows severe injuries on his right hand.", "Ilyas\u2019s statement was corroborated by Sunilbhai Patel, the owner of Krishak petrol pump. \u201cHe has an injury on his hand due to an accident that he met years ago which is why notes fell from his hand,\u201d he told Alt News.", "Photographs of Ilyas\u2019s X-ray report are attached below.", "A conspiracy theory was manufactured around a benign incident caught on CCTV camera.
