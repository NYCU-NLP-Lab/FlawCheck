The misleading tweet remained live for nearly 24 hours before being deleted:", "Not only did \"Stone Cold\" misspell Mallinger's surname, he also attached the image of a different person. The woman in the image is Hungarian-born photographer Ata Kand\u00f3, who passed away in 2017 just before her 104th birthday. It's a copyrighted portrait taken by Dutch photographer Koos Breukel, who weighed in to warn that he was considering legal action for the misuse of his work:", "This is my picture of Ata Kand\u00f3 , she became 101 years old in The Netherlands and died of old age. It was made in Bergen. This is not Rose Malinger. Do not use my photos for these purposes, otherwise we'll sue.
