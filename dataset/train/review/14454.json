West Virginia Public Broadcasting did so in early July. (Both outlets are PolitiFact West Virginia partners.)", "Both news reports cited data from the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources showing that emergency responses for suspected overdoses had increased by close to 50%.

That was a 42% increase.", "The article also reported a more than fivefold increase for June in average weekly overdoses that are reversed by naloxone, a medication used to rapidly reverse opioid overdoses. Overdoses reversed by naloxone averaged 16 per week in June 2020, compared with norms of three per week and 12 per month, according to the article.", "Miller\u2019s office referenced the articles when we inquired, but because the articles had appeared several weeks before Miller\u2019s tweet, we looked for state Health Department data that was available closer to the date of her statement.

Emergency response for suspected overdoses increased by 64% in May and 30% in June.", "So for the three months combined, the number increased by 33% from a year earlier, but during May and June alone, the numbers rose by 47%, which is close to Miller\u2019s figure. July numbers were on par with those in 2019, but Miller wouldn\u2019t have known about that data point when she sent her tweet.", "The department also offers another metric: emergency room visits related to overdoses.
