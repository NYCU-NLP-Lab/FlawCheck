It has been going on since 2010. The only period of calm we get is when winter sets in,\" the statement said. \"The reason crime and violence rise in the summer is NOT due to the hot weather, leading to short tempers, like so many think. It rises in summer months because you have more human interaction due to more people being on the streets enjoying what little summer we have.\"", "There\u2019s little doubt about summer being too short.", "But is \"violence\" up since 2010, with the only let up in the winter?", "To get at the question, we examined the trend in homicides, non-fatal shootings and the broader violent-crime index by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That index \u00a0includes homicide, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault.", "Homicides", "After a sharp drop in 2008 and 2009, homicides were at their lowest count since the 1980s.
