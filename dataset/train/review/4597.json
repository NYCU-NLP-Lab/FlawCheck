(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)", "President Donald Trump warned supporters at a rally in Pittsburgh this week that if Joe Biden wins the presidency, the future of the natural gas and coal industries looks bleak.", "Trump said Biden\u2019s plan for net-zero emissions \"would instantly shut down all fracking and all mining immediately in Pennsylvania.\"", "Here\u2019s what Trump said:", "\"Biden reiterated his pledge to require net-zero carbon emissions. That\u2019s basically saying, do you know what that is? There\u2019ll be no more oil, there\u2019ll be no more gas, there\u2019ll be no more nothing, there\u2019ll be no more industry, there\u2019ll be no more country. That\u2019s what it\u2019s saying really. And that would instantly shut down fracking and mining immediately in Pennsylvania, sending your jobs overseas, sending your money to somebody else, not you.\"", "We wondered whether the president accurately characterized Biden\u2019s net-zero emissions plan.", "Trump is right that Biden wants to shift toward clean energy, but he\u2019s got the timeline wrong. Biden wants the country to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels over the next 15 years, not right away like Trump said.", "Net-zero emissions is what scientists and many world leaders agree is needed to stop climate change from spiraling out of control. The term describes the process of substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions and then offsetting what can\u2019t be eliminated through activities like forest restoration.", "In July, Biden released a sweeping $2 trillion plan to tackle climate change that he said would set the United States on \"an irreversible path\" to net-zero emissions by 2050. Twenty countries and regions around the world have adopted similar targets.", "To achieve that goal, Biden wants to create a pollution-free power sector by 2035; increase energy efficiency by upgrading 4 million buildings and weatherizing 2 million homes; and shift major cities toward public transportation.", "The first plank in that plan, creating a pollution-free power sector by 2035, would require phasing out coal in western Pennsylvania over the next 15 years. The plan does not, however, call for ending hydraulic fracturing \u2014 the controversial drilling technique known as fracking \u2014 instantly, or at all.", "We\u2019ve examined Biden\u2019s position on fracking several times now, so we know he hasn\u2019t called for banning the practice.", "He wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public land, but would allow existing fracking operations to continue. The Biden campaign has also noted previously that 90% of fracking today takes place on private land.", "Biden\u2019s position on fracking became muddled earlier this year when he misspoke during a March debate with Bernie Sanders, who was then his last opponent standing in the Democratic primary.", "Here\u2019s an excerpt of their exchange:", "\"I\u2019m talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,\" Sanders said. \"I\u2019m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet \u2014 no ifs, buts, and maybes about it.\"", "\"So am I,\" Biden replied.", "\"Well, I\u2019m not sure your proposal does that,\" Sanders said.", "\"No more \u2014 no new fracking,\" Biden said.", "Biden seemed to be saying he wanted to ban fracking \u2014 a sharp departure from his official position. And the former vice president\u2019s opponents pounced.", "Republican operatives quickly cut a short video of Biden\u2019s remarks to use as a cudgel in races against moderate House Democrats, the Washington Post reported.", "The Biden campaign retracted his remarks the night of the debate, but that hasn\u2019t stopped conservative media outlets or the Trump campaign from inaccurately claiming that Biden supports a total ban on fracking.", "Trump said Biden\u2019s net-zero emissions plan would shut down the fracking and coal mining industries \"instantly\" and \"immediately.\" Biden\u2019s plan calls for a gradual transition to clean energy.
