Jolly said that wasn\u2019t his opinion, it\u2019s actually what the highest court in the land had ruled. Jolly said it was up to elected officials to make sure seniors get their benefits.", "\"In 1960, the United States Supreme Court in the Flemming decision said Social Security is not guaranteed,\" he said. \"My fight is to make sure that is guaranteed.\"", "Jolly\u2019s claim made us curious about what the courts have said about Social Security, so we decided to open the law books.", "Flemming vs. Nestor", "The case to which Jolly was referring is Flemming vs. Nestor, a 1960 case about a Bulgarian immigrant\u00a0named Ephram Nestor who was deported in 1956 for having been a member of the Communist Party between 1933 and 1939. Nestor was not a citizen but had lived in the United States since 1913.", "Nestor retired in 1955 after paying into the Social Security fund for 19 years, since the program was created in 1936. When he was deported, his benefits were terminated under amended provisions of the Social Security Act of 1935.", "Nestor sued the federal government, claiming the benefits constituted a contract and that he deserved his payments after so many years of contributing to the system. (The other party in the case was Arthur S. Flemming, the secretary of health, education and welfare during Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s presidency.)", "In a 5-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled there was no contractual obligation for the government to pay out Social Security benefits to Nestor.", "The ruling meant payments into the Social Security system could not be considered a person\u2019s property rights if that person violated a rule set forth by Congress, UCLA law professor Katherine Stone told PolitiFact Florida.", "In Nestor's case, Congress made rules against belonging to the Communist Party, though it's worth pointing out the law didn't exist when Nestor actually was in the party. Still, the court said the after-the-fact prohibition was valid.", "\"People who are denied (benefits) can\u2019t say their property was taken from them, unless the change is arbitrary or lacks rational reasoning,\" Stone said, noting the denial couldn\u2019t be punitive or violate a person\u2019s right to due process.", "What could be considered unreasonable? \"Just ending the program suddenly could be an irrational measure, \" Stone suggested. \"Moving the money into tax cuts for the rich could, too.\"", "Changing or suspending the program because of budget constraints, though, would likely pass muster with the courts.", "Jolly\u2019s interpretation of that ruling is interesting, Stone said, because the case only deals with one specific category of beneficiary being denied payments for a specific reason.", "But beneficiaries could be denied benefits for any reason if Congress passed a law making it so, as long as the change wasn\u2019t arbitrary. The court said Congress had the power to modify the rules, which it has done several times -- such as gradually raising the full retirement age over time.", "Political debates over Social Security payouts have been fueled by budget projections illustrating the widening chasm of the program paying out more than it is taking in. A 2005 Congressional Research Service report on Social Security reform pointed out that beneficiaries were not guaranteed \"full benefits in the case of a shortfall, unless Congress amends applicable laws.\"", "Our ruling", "Jolly said the Supreme Court ruled \"Social Security is not guaranteed.\" It\u2019s a position he has repeated at debates and on the campaign trail.", "The 1960 Flemming vs. Nestor case Jolly cited indeed said citizens don\u2019t have a right to Social Security benefits, no matter how long they paid into the system.
