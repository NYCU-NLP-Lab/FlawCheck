["About this rating", "An otherworldly picture of the alien-like inside of a penguin\u2019s mouth shocked the internet when it made the charismatic, tuxedo-clad bird look as though it came straight out of a horror flick. It also had Snopes readers asking: Could this photograph possibly be real?", "A reverse-image search returned more than 1,500 results on social media platforms like Reddit and Imgur, as well as in a variety of news publications since its original publication in 2015. But the original picture was captured by National Geographic Your Shot contributor Clinton Berry.", "Titled \u201cWhen Penguins Attack,\u201d the photograph was shot with a GoPro on Antarctica\u2019s sea ice, about six miles from the continent\u2019s permanent research outpost, Casey Station.", "\u201cI studied the movements of the penguins for weeks,\u201d Berry wrote in National Geographic. \u201cThey walked in the same area almost every day. We would get maybe a dozen or less going by. The day this was taken there were over 60 penguins. It was a bit of luck involved too.\u201d", "There are 18 species of penguins, five of which live in Antarctica and another four that live on sub-Antarctic islands. The bird in the photograph is known as an Ad\u00e9lie penguin, which goes by the scientific name Pygoscelis adeliae. The region has more than 80,000 breeding pairs, all of which are distinguished by the white ring that surrounds their eyes.", "Penguins are insulated by heavy fat reserves, which make them well-suited for the frigid temperatures of the southernmost continent. And though they can\u2019t fly, the Oreo-colored birds make up for this inability with their excellent swimming talents. Ad\u00e9lie can dive to depths of more than 500 feet, though they usually feed on fish, amphipods, and krill in the upper 200 feet of the water column. It is this unique form of predation that makes their bizarre mouths so useful.", "Penguins don\u2019t have teeth, but they do have teeth-like spikes known as papillae on the tongue and palate that are made of keratin, the same protein found in the nails and hair of humans. Though they lack tastebuds, these keratinized bristles help penguins swallow their prey.", "\u201cFirst off, you may notice that those spiky papillae all point toward the back of the penguin\u2019s mouth. Those work a bit like a fish hook,\u201d wrote the nonprofit conservation organization, Penguins International. \u201cThe penguin can grab onto a slippery fish and that food will now only move in one direction \u2014 down the penguin\u2019s throat!\u201d", "All tongues have papillae \u2013 even ours. Known as \u201cprotruding papillae,\u201d those found on penguins are just more obvious and typical of food collectors. (If you thought the penguin's tongue was creepy, check out those found in this leatherback turtle.) On the Ad\u00e9lie penguins\u2019 tongue, these papillae look sharp on the top and curve backward toward the back of the mouth, which helps the birds to efficiently slurp down fish at impressive depths.", "Archives of Histology and Cytology", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
