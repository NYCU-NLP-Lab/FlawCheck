If not, report\u201d.", "\u201cThat's about right.. Report on your neighbours \u2026 Your friends... Your family.. Yes\u2026 Even your own Children\u2026 Clearly the Nazi System was never squashed,\u201d the post's caption read.", "The HSE logo can be seen in the poster\u2019s bottom right-hand corner. The poster also mimics the health authority's\u00a0typeface, layout and Covid-19\u00a0advice symbol (in the top right-hand corner).", "The image also circulated on\u00a0Facebook pages in Britain\u00a0and\u00a0Portugal, as well as in Ireland.", "In the midst of a third wave of coronavirus infections, Ireland has become\u00a0the nation with the highest transmission rate in the world.
