(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "In the 1:20 minute clip of a March 10 CNN interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden\u2019s chief medical adviser on COVID-19, CNN anchor John Berman asked about the Biden administration\u2019s pledge to \"make its decisions based on science.\"", "\"What\u2019s the science behind not saying it\u2019s safe for people who have been vaccinated \u2014\u00a0received two doses \u2014\u00a0to travel?\" the reporter asked.", "Fauci responded that it was a good question and said \"the CDC is carefully heading in that direction.\" He mentions the recent announcement made by Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can gather indoors without masks.", "\"That was the first in a multi-step process that they are going to be rolling out,\" Fauci said on CNN. \"They\u2019re being careful, understandably. They want to get science, they want to get data, and then when you don\u2019t have the data, and you don\u2019t have the actual evidence, then you've got to make a judgment call. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to be seeing in the next weeks. You\u2019re going to see little by little, more and more guidelines, getting people to be more and more flexible. The first installation of this is what can vaccinated people do in the home setting. Obviously the next one is going to be what you\u2019re asking, what about travel, what about going out, what about getting a haircut, what about doing things like that. That\u2019s all imminently going to be coming out.\"", "The post\u2019s headline implies that there is a scientific consensus and Fauci is deliberately ignoring it. But that\u2019s not what Fauci said. Fauci talked about making a judgment call when there\u2019s no science and data available to inform a policy position.", "The Rumble post says as much in its single line of text beneath the video: \"During an interview on CNN Fauci said that when you don\u2019t have the data you have to make a judgment call.\"", "According to the CDC, fully vaccinated people shouldn\u2019t travel if they can help it. Walensky said that because the vast majority of Americans are still unvaccinated the agency would wait to update its travel guidance until \"we have more protection across the communities and across the population.\"", "While some experts have said they believe that guidance to be overly cautious, others say the caution is needed given the emergence of more contagious variants of the virus.", "But Fauci clearly didn\u2019t say he was advocating for a policy in spite of scientific evidence, as the headline on this post states. We rate that claim False.", "Rumble post, Fauci admits he isn\u2019t listening to the science when advocating policy, March 10, 2021", "PolitiFact, You\u2019re fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
