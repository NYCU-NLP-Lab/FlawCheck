A warning is now also attached: \"This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public\u2019s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\"", "A post on Facebook shares two images that make it appear that another tweet from Trump was blocked by Twitter.", "The first shows what looks like a tweet from the president at 3:23 p.m. on Oct. 5. \"My blood IS the vaccine!!!!!\"", "The second image shows a screenshot of four tweets from Trump and what was a fifth tweet that has been removed. The message says: \"This Tweet is no longer available because it violated the Twitter Rules.\"", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "We reached out to Twitter about the post but did not immediately hear back.", "Here\u2019s what we know. Trump didn\u2019t tweet that his blood is a vaccine.", "The screenshot of Trump\u2019s Twitter feed that shows a message saying a tweet was removed stemmed from a separate tweet from the commander in chief: one posted at 5:54 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time Oct. 5 that included the email address of a New York post reporter, according to the website Trump Twitter Archive.", "He tweeted the same message again at 7:56 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, only this time he swapped out the reporter\u2019s email for her Twitter handle and @NYPost.", "As the Twitter account @hoaxeye noted, Trump never tweeted \"my blood is the vaccine,\" according Trump Twitter Archive. The archive shows other tweets that Twitter has flagged \u2014\u00a0like the one claiming COVID-19 can be less lethal than the flu \u2014 but nothing about his blood being a vaccine.", "We also searched an archive of Trump\u2019s deleted tweets for the word \"vaccine\" on Facba.se but found none.", "Searching more broadly online, we also found no news coverage about Trump claiming his blood was a vaccine, or articles about Twitter removing such a tweet. It\u2019s unbelievable that Twitter deleting the tweet that appears in the Facebook post wouldn\u2019t draw wide media attention. News outlets around the world have reported on past instances of the social media platform hiding tweets by the president.", "We rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "Facebook post, Oct. 8, 2020", "Donald Trump tweet, Oct. 6, 2020", "HoaxEye tweet, Oct. 9, 2020", "PolitiFact, Donald Trump\u2019s false claim that COVID-19 is less deadly than the flu, Oct. 6, 2020", "Factba.se, Donald Trump - deleted tweets, visited Oct. 9, 2020", "Trump Twitter Archive, visited Oct. 9, 2020", "BBC, Twitter hides Trump tweet for \u2018glorifying violence,\u2019 May 29, 2020", "CBS News, Twitter removes tweet shared by Trump with false coronavirus statistics, Aug. 31, 2020", "The Washington Post, Facebook, Twitter, penalize Trump for posts containing coronavirus misinformation, Aug. 7, 2020", "NBC News, Twitter removes tweet highlighted by Trump falsely claiming COVID-19 \u2018cure,\u2019 July 28, 2020", "Al Jazeera, Facebook removes Trump COVID-19 post, Twitter hides similar tweet, Oct. 6, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
