Expanding our self-driving pilot allows us to continue to improve our technology through real-world operations.

San Francisco comes with its own nuances including more bikes on the road, high traffic density and narrow lanes.", "According to the San Francisco Examiner, the footage was taken by a dashboard camera of a Luxor cab:", "Charles Rotter, operations manager at Luxor, confirmed to the Examiner that the video was from Wednesday.", "\u201cYes, the dashcam of one of our ramp vans at 10:37 this am,\u201d he wrote, in an email.", "The cab pulls up to a red light on Third Street in South of Market, by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. A pack of cars flies through a yellow light, and one even drives through the first moment of a red light.", "About three seconds after the light turned red, an Uber self-driving car can apparently be seen traveling through the red light at moderate speed as a pedestrian walks across the intersection on the right side of the intersection.", "While the video does show an Uber vehicle driving through a red light, it was not initially clear whether the vehicle was self-driven at the time.

All told, the mapping programs used by Uber\u2019s cars failed to recognize six traffic lights in the San Francisco area. \u201cIn this case, the car went through a red light,\u201d the documents said.", "In March 2018, a self-driving Uber hit and killed a woman in Arizona.
