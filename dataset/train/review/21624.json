Others would have to decide whether they wanted to sign up for the public option.", "That isn\u2019t different from the way Biden described it.

We didn\u2019t separate families.\u201d", "Biden was referring to the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy on illegal immigration that resulted in children being separated from their parents who were criminally prosecuted for entering the U.S. illegally. The parents were placed in adult detention centers under the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, while their children were held in separate facilities before being transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services for placement in a juvenile facility, foster care or with another relative in the U.S.", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve written\u00a0before, experts told us there were some separations under the Obama administration, but no blanket policy to prosecute parents and, therefore, separate them from their children. And an\u00a0HHS inspector general report\u00a0released in January noted that \u201chistorically\u201d such family \u201cseparations were rare and occurred because of circumstances such as the parent\u2019s medical emergency or a determination that the parent was a threat to the child\u2019s safety.\u201d", "But Biden was wrong to say that the Obama administration did not \u201clock people up in cages,\u201d as Democrats\u00a0have criticized\u00a0the Trump administration for doing.", "U.S. Customs and Border Protection under Obama did use similar structures to house thousands of minors who tried to illegally enter the U.S. without a parent or a guardian, as can be seen in the gallery of Associated Press photos featured in a 2014\u00a0Arizona Republic\u00a0story\u00a0about a processing facility in Nogales, Arizona. \u201cThe children, mostly of high-school and junior-high-school age, are housed behind 18-foot-high chain-link fences topped with razor wire,\u201d the story said.", "Even Jeh Johnson, who served as the second secretary of Homeland Security under Obama, has acknowledged that the same structures were used to hold an influx of migrant children before Trump became president.", "\u201cChain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages, whatever you want to call them, were not invented on January 20, 2017, okay?\u201d Johnson said at the\u00a0Aspen Ideas Festival\u00a0in June. He said children were only kept there for a short period of time.", "\u201cBut during that 72-hour period, when you have something that is a multiple \u2014 like four times \u2014 of what you\u2019re accustomed to in the existing infrastructure, you\u2019ve got to find places quickly to put kids. You can\u2019t just dump 7-year-old kids on the streets of McAllen or El Paso. And so these facilities were erected \u2026 they put those chain link partitions up so you could segregate young women from young men, kids from adults, until they were either released or transferred to HHS,\u201d Johnson said.", "CBP\u2019s standards generally limit the detention of minors to no more than 72 hours. But the inspector general\u2019s office found that under the Trump administration about a third of the minors were being held longer than 72 hours \u2014 many for more than 10 days \u2014 in the facilities it inspected.", "Sanders misled when he repeated his claim that the average American isn\u2019t making any more money now than 45 years ago, and that \u201cdisastrous\u201d trade policies are partly to blame.", "Sanders: In the last 45 years, the average American today, despite an explosion of technology and worker productivity, is not making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago. And one of the reasons is that, for decades, we have had disastrous trade policies.", "In fact, \u201creal\u201d (inflation-adjusted)\u00a0median family income\u00a0in the United States hit a record $78,646 last year, the\u00a0Census Bureau reported\u00a0just a few days before the debate, on Sept. 10. That income is nearly 29% higher than in 1973 \u2014 45 years earlier \u2014 when it was $61,047 (stated in 2018 dollars).", "So by that measure, the typical American family has never had it so good. That\u2019s hard to square with the picture Sanders paints.", "Sanders is most likely referring to a different and much narrower statistic \u2014\u00a0weekly wages for rank-and-file workers\u00a0\u2014 as tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But that leaves out self-employed individuals, executives, supervisors and of course all government workers, not to mention retirees. Furthermore, even for those rank-and-file workers, real weekly wages took their big plunge in the 1980s and early 1990s, hitting bottom in January 1996. That was barely two years after the\u00a0North American Free Trade Agreement\u00a0\u2014 for which Sanders partly blames the decline \u2014 took effect.", "Since that low point, real weekly wages for rank-and-file workers have gone up 20 percent \u2014 despite all the trade policies Sanders says have been \u201cdisastrous.\u201d", "Several candidates cited broad support for gun control measures among the public. However, both Biden and Warren overstated the support for an assault weapons ban and government buybacks.", "Biden: Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street\u2014period.", "Warren: The question we need to ask is, when we\u2019ve got this much support across the country, 90 percent of Americans want to see us do \u2014 I like registration \u2014 want to see us do background checks, want to get assault weapons off the streets, why doesn\u2019t it happen? And the answer is corruption, pure and simple.", "According to the most recent poll from\u00a0Washington Post-ABC News, 56% of people surveyed support a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons. A joint\u00a0USA Today\u00a0and Suffolk University\u00a0survey found that 60% of people supported banning the sale of some semi-automatic assault-style weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AR-15.

And unless we\u2019re willing to address that head-on and roll back the filibuster, we\u2019re not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let\u2019s do background checks, let\u2019s get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster. Until we attack the systemic problems, we can\u2019t get gun reform in this country. We\u2019ve got to go straight against the industry and we\u2019ve got to change Congress, so it doesn\u2019t just work for the wealthy and well-connected, so it works for the people..", "Warren\u2019s first example is on target.

Applying that percentage to the federal court\u2019s most recent annual count of\u00a0750,489 non-business bankruptcy filings produces just under half a million bankruptcies that involved medical issues. The survey did not report data on specific medical conditions.", "While Sanders\u2019 statement is generally backed by the results of the survey, the findings only suggest that medical bills or an illness\u00a0contributed\u00a0to a bankruptcy \u2014 not that a \u201cterrible disease\u201d was the sole reason.", "David Himmelstein, an author of the editorial article, told the Washington Post that even if one limits the calculation to the 37% of respondents who said medical expenses \u201cvery much\u201d contributed to their bankruptcy, it\u2019s still about a half million people who are affected because there are on average 2.71 people in each household.

And because the wealth tax is a significant tax on savings, he said, it will discourage people from holding on to assets, which will reduce the tax base.", "Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, noted that while Warren\u2019s plan anticipates some tax avoidance, \u201cit will be very difficult for the IRS to keep up with the tax planning that highly-paid lawyers and accountants can devise. With so much money at risk, the wealthy will have powerful incentives to hire smart advisers to help avoid, or at least reduce, their tax liability.\u201d", "Saez and Zucman pushed back against some of these concerns in a\u00a0point-by-point written response\u00a0to the Summers-Sarin post.
