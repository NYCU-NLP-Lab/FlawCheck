And now, you\u2019ve got a person who is supporting Marco Rubio who gets to appoint 30 of the 99 delegates.

The state party and our chairman have been consistently clear that we have and will continue to remain neutral during this process.\"", "Ingoglia stayed out of the presidential primary and avoided bashing Trump.

However, he gets to recommend 15 delegates to the state party\u2019s executive board, which then takes a vote. So Lewandowski doubled the number and exaggerated Ingoglia\u2019s power.
