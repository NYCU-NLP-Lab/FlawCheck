His second conviction was later expunged from his record.", "Niec\u2019s sister, Iwona Niec Villaire, told the Washington Post, \u201cIt\u2019s shocking . . . No one can really understand what happened here.\u201d She told CNN that Niec does not even speak Polish.", "While news of the doctor\u2019s detention surprised many, Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, called it \u201csomething that happens all the time.\u201d She told us:", "An expunged conviction doesn\u2019t really matter in the world of immigration. It\u2019s still an issue on your record. In fact a lot of people have to go back and get previously-expunged crimes un-expunged when they apply for naturalization because the immigration agency needs to see what that crime was and whether or not it renders you ineligible to apply for naturalization.", "The Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives parameters for the detention and removal of immigrants, even those who are in the U.S. legally, allows the deportation of immigrants who have committed crimes \u201cinvolving moral turpitude.\u201d", "ICE officials said in a statement that Niec was \u201camenable to removal proceedings as a result of two 1992 state convictions for malicious destruction of property and receiving stolen property, both of which are crimes involving moral turpitude.\u201d", "An ICE spokesperson told us that two convictions of this nature can make a lawful permanent resident subject to deportation regardless of the amount of time they have lived in the U.S.", "Pierce said that Niec could be eligible to apply for a \u201ccancellation of removal.\" Lawful permanent residents can avoid deportation if they can prove that his deportation would cause what the Justice Department calls \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to dependents who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.", "The Justice Department also stipulates that cancellation of removal is possible for residents whose records do not include aggravated felonies.", "Niec's employer, Bronson Healthcare, issued a statement supporting a speedy resolution to the situation:", "While Bronson Healthcare, like others, respects the laws and regulations concerning United States immigration, we are following the situation surrounding the detention of Dr. Lukasz Niec closely and are doing everything we can to advocate for Dr. Niec. We have been in contact with our elected representatives and we have our immigration counsel coordinating with Dr. Niec\u2019s attorney to explore all options to secure his prompt release from detention.\n\n[...]\n\nSince 2007, Dr. Niec has been a skilled and caring physician, a valued employee and respected member of the Bronson medical staff. His detention in a county jail while awaiting deportation proceedings simply does not make sense. Given all that he has contributed in the form of exemplary patient care, and Bronson\u2019s ongoing need for Dr. Niec\u2019s continued service as a hospitalist, we are requesting the community\u2019s best interest be considered and he be allowed to return to work and his family as soon as possible.", "At press time, Niec was still in ICE detention and had not been deported. It is unclear how long Niec will stay in detention.
