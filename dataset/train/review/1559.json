This year in the primary he will face Democratic candidates Louis Lanni, Marni Snyder and Ben Waxman.", "On Saturday, Sims\u2019 camp sent a fundraising email to his supporters addressed from him in which he said, \"I never expected to have this big of a target on my back. The right-wing extremists are trying to take this seat so they can push their anti-choice and anti-equality agenda through our State House.\"", "Though Sims has competition from Democrats in the primary, he does not have any from Republicans. No Republicans are on the ballot, according to the City Commissioners Office. And because no candidates are running as Republicans in the primary, no candidates can run as Republicans in the general election.", "None of the Democrats Sims is facing appear to be \"right-wing extremists.\" Like Sims, Lanni is openly gay. He\u2019s run as a Republican in the past, unsuccessfully, but has stated the importance of a hate crimes statute for Pennsylvania and describes himself as a moderate on his campaign\u2019s official Facebook page. Waxman and Snyder have also promoted progressive issues, such as gay rights, increased education funding, school reform, women\u2019s rights and criminal justice reform.", "\"I don\u2019t think any of us are right-wing extremists,\" Snyder said.", "Snyder, who described Sims\u2019 email as \"extremely poorly worded,\" said she received a call from Sims the day the email went out while she was out \"knocking on doors\" in the district.", "\"He called my cell phone and said, \u2018I want you to know that this email went out and was terribly worded,\u2019\" she said.", "Waxman also said Sims called him to apologize after sending the email. Lanni could not be reached for comment.", "Both Snyder and Waxman said they were not bothered by the email, citing their concerns for the district and their respective campaigns.", "Sims followed up his fundraising email the same day with another email saying he was \"sincerely sorry for offending my challengers for the State House.\" He said in the email, \"when I wrote about the right-wing extremists and their anti-choice, anti-equality agenda, I was referring to the Donald Trumps and Koch brothers of the world, not the Democrats running for my State House seat.\"", "Dan Siegel, a lead consultant on Sims\u2019 campaign, said the original email was meant to capture the same meaning as the clarification email but was worded poorly.", "\"It read another way to people,\" he said.", "Joe DeFelice, chairman of the Philadelphia Republican City Committee, called Sims\u2019 actions \"political puffing.\"", "\"The people at the other end of his emails probably don't know what his district looks like,\" DeFelice said. \"It's normal campaign rhetoric but frankly disingenuous in this point.\"", "Our ruling", "Democratic State Rep. Brian Sims sent a fundraising email to his supporters notifying them of an attack on his seat: \"The right-wing extremists are trying to take this seat so they can push their anti-choice and anti-equality agenda through our State House.\"", "But no Republicans are running for his seat, and it\u2019s too late for any to enter the race as Republicans.
