["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on October 16, 2019", "In announcing \u201cphase one\u201d of a tentative trade deal with China, President Donald Trump wrongly stated that the \u201call-time high\u201d for U.S. agricultural exports to China was \u201c$16 or $17 billion.\u201d Actually, it was nearly $26 billion in 2012.", "By misstating the record value of exports, Trump also greatly exaggerated the potential impact of the tentative trade deal.", "Trump made his remarks on Oct. 11 at a joint appearance with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.", "The president called \u201cphase one\u201d of the tentative trade deal a \u201ctremendous deal for the farmers.\u201d Mnuchin said China had agreed to increase the purchase of U.S. agricultural goods over the next two years, and that the Chinese would reach the point where they will be buying $40 billion to $50 billion annually.", "We don\u2019t have any details on the deal, which Trump has said will take three or four weeks to get into writing.", "But what we do know is that Trump was wrong when he repeatedly claimed that China has never purchased more than $16 billion to $17 billion in U.S. agricultural products before.", "Trump, Oct. 11: So, they were purchasing $16 or $17 billion at the highest point, and that\u2019ll be brought up to $40 billion to $50 billion. \u2026 They intend to go up, ultimately, once the agreement is signed, from $40 to $50 billion. And, really, from \u2014 that was from a base of probably $16 billion, and right now it\u2019s $8 billion. \u2026 Going from $8 billion and then to $16 billion, which was their all-time high, to $40 to $50 billion.", "At another point, Trump said \u201cit was about $2 or $3 billion; they got down pretty low. But if you take \u2014 the highest it ever was was $16 billion, and we\u2019re bringing that to $50 billion.\u201d", "Jason Grant, director of the Center for Agricultural Trade at Virginia Tech University, told us, \u201cThere seems to be some careless numbers being thrown out here.\u201d", "For one thing, Trump\u2019s claim that China\u2019s purchase of U.S. agricultural goods \u201cgot down pretty low\u201d at just \u201c$2 or $3 billion\u201d is misleading, because that came the year after China became a member of the World Trade Organization on Dec. 11, 2001. \u201cIn 2002 \u2013 right after China acceded to the WTO \u2013 we exported only $2 billion worth of ag exports to China,\u201d Grant said.", "And Trump is wrong about his figure for the \u201call-time high.\u201d", "Both Grant and Chad E. Hart, an associate professor of economics and crop markets specialist at Iowa State University, told us the record high was set in 2012 at $25.9 billion.", "U.S. Department of Agriculture data confirms that the figures were indeed $2 billion in calendar year 2002 and nearly $26 billion in 2012. In 2018, the figure was $9.2 billion \u2014 the lowest it had been since 2007, a direct outcome of the ongoing trade war that Trump initiated with China that resulted in higher tariffs.", "Using USDA data, we produced the chart below:", "In presenting false and misleading low figures, the president made the tentative trade deal seem larger than it may be.", "Trump, Oct. 11: A purchase of \u2014 from 40 to 50 billion dollars\u2019 worth of agricultural products. To show you how big that is, that would be two and a half, three times what China had purchased at its highest point thus far.", "That\u2019s wrong, too.", "If U.S. ag exports to China do reach $40 billion in the future, that would be a 54% increase, and $50 billion would be 93% \u2014 not \u201ctwo and a half, three times what China had purchased at its highest point.\u201d", "That is still a substantial increase, but not nearly as high as Trump said, and we don\u2019t know if U.S. agricultural exports to China\u00a0will ever get that high.", "Hart, the Iowa State University professor, said that \u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine that you can suddenly double the amount of imports going into there with its economy slowing down.\u201d Hart said the biggest commodity that China imports from the U.S. is soybeans, which are used to feed livestock, particularly pigs. But African Swine Fever is \u201cendemic across China,\u201d as the USDA put it, so Hart questions China\u2019s need to import more soybeans.", "\u201cWhat is China going to do with it?\u201d Hart said, referring to soybeans that are usually fed to pigs. \u201cIt\u2019s not whether we can produce it; yeah, we can. Is there demand enough in China? Probably not.\u201d", "Hart said he is cautiously optimistic about the president\u2019s direct involvement in the trade talks \u2014 a possible sign that there will be a deal this time after several false starts in a trade war that has driven down U.S. agricultural exports to China. But, he added, the impact on farmers won\u2019t be known for quite some time.", "\u201cThe real devil here will be in the details,\u201d he said.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
