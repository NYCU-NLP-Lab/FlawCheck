Jon Erpenbach, D-West Point, during the debate over the state budget. He noted an increased gas tax that was proposed by Gov. Tony Evers -- and subsequently rejected by Republican lawmakers -- would bring in additional money.", "\"If out-of-state drivers paid (the) gas tax, they would contribute $73 million to fix our roads,\" Erpenbach tweeted June 6, 2019.", "Erpenbach\u2019s tweet was prompted by action by the GOP-controlled Joint Finance Committee, which inserted its own roads funding plan inmto the budget instead of the 8-cent per gallon gas tax increase proposed by Evers.", "The GOP-passed budget is now in front of Evers.", "So, let\u2019s pause for a moment and look at this aspect of the debate.", "Are we really missing out on $73 million worth of revenue from out-of-state drivers because the Evers plan was not adopted?", "The background", "Wisconsin\u2019s gas tax is currently 32.9 cents per gallon.", "The 8-cent per gallon increase was part of a larger proposal by Evers to tie the tax to the consumer price index beginning in spring 2020. The governor also sought to raise the registration fee for heavy trucks and the fee for transferring or obtaining an original vehicle title.", "Instead, Republicans voted to increase title and registration fees. Under the GOP plan, the title fee, which is paid when cars are bought and sold, would increase by $95 increasing the cost from $69.50 to $164.50.
