["\u201cThousands of Seattle Democrats gather to demand mail-in voting because it\u2019s too dangerous to vote in-person,\u201d reads the caption of the photo showing a large crowd gathered at a city intersection. The photo was shared 11,000 times after a group supporting president Donald Trump published it on August 17, 2020.", "The irony of the caption was lost on many online users, who took it seriously at a time of heightened concern over whether millions of voters will be able to effectively cast their ballots by post in the November 3 presidential election.", "\u201cONLY FROM THE PARTY OF HYPOCRISY!!!\u201d one Facebook user commented, while others mocked \u201cStupid dems,\u201d or argued that \u201cif they can go there to rally then they can go to polls.\u201d", "However, the photo was taken out of context and there was no mass protest for mail-in voting in Seattle, Washington, a state that mails ballots to every registered voter at least 18 days before the election.", "The miscaptioned photo was originally posted on Twitter on August 16, 2020, by the account @CronkiteSays, a satirical account impersonating legendary news anchor Walter Cronkite, and which labels itself as \u201c#FakeNews.\u201d", "The photo used in the joke actually shows a June 6, 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in Seattle, at the moment protesters gathered at the corner of California Avenue SW and SW Alaska Street in the neighborhood of West Seattle.", "The photo was taken by aerial photographer Paul Weatherman, who published it on Twitter on June\u00a06, 2020.", "Democrats in the Northwestern state of Washington did gather in Seattle in support of mail-in voting on August 17, 2020, The Seattle Times reported.

This would\u00a0allow an estimated three-quarters of Americans to cast ballots from home this fall, rather than risk\u00a0infection during a visit to a polling center.", "Trump has repeatedly claimed mail-in voting leads to fraud, an assertion contested by many election experts.", "Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a recent Trump appointee, announced on August 18 that changes to post office operations, \u201craised as areas of concern as the nation prepares to hold an election in the midst of a devastating pandemic,\u201d have been suspended until after the vote.", "\u201cThe Postal Service is ready today to handle whatever volume of election mail it receives this fall,\u201d DeJoy said in a statement.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
