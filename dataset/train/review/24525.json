Council chairman when the ban was enacted. \"We had to isolate and contain the problem. We thought a handgun law would do that.\"", "Passed in the mid 1970s, the ordinance continued with several legal challenges until 2007, when a federal court invalidated the law. That decision was upheld in a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that the handgun ban and \"trigger lock\" provisions of the ordinance violated the Second Amendment.", "Before the Supreme Court ruling, city leaders fought hard to keep the ban, saying that its continued implementation reduced the number of stolen firearms and guns used in other crimes.", "In their appeal to the Supreme Court, the city government filed a petition with the court specifically citing the dangers posed to children if the gun ban was lifted.", "\"The smaller the weapon, the more likely a child can use it, and children as young as three years old are strong enough to fire today\u2019s handguns,\" the petition stated (page 25).", "The same petition also addressed the history of the ban, saying that in 1976 that the Council determined existing law didn\u2019t sufficiently address gun violence and specifically cited the \"chilling regularity with which handguns were taking the lives of children.\"", "But protecting children isn\u2019t the only reason cited by the 30-page petition filed by the city\u2019s government \u2014 the city also addressed general violent crime trends and other legal arguments in asking the Supreme Court to hear the case.", "And the court\u2019s decision in Heller went far beyond just overturning the city\u2019s gun ban, as it broadly affirmed for the first time an individual right to private gun ownership.", "Clinton\u2019s campaign referred us to a gun control group claiming that gun locks and child access prevention laws help prevent unintentional firearm deaths for young children.", "PolitiFact has previously looked into whether the city\u2019s gun ban had any effect on violent crime, finding that violent crime levels varied year-to-year and that other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws.", "Our ruling", "Clinton said her opposition to the 2008 Heller case was because \"what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns.\"", "City leaders did specifically cite the danger posed to children in trying to keep in place gun regulations, but the regulations were also a widespread ban on unregistered weapons, not just gun safety measures. Child safety wasn\u2019t the sole topic cited by defenders of the city\u2019s gun control ordinance, and the Heller decision dealt with a much broader issue than protecting toddlers from firearm deaths or injuries.", "We rate the statement Half True.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a1279632-b0c9-4856-8bc2-c64555f9f78f", "Email interview with Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin, Oct. 19, 2016", "Oyez, \"District of Columbia v.
