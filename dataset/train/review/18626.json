["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on January 15, 2021", "A bogus headline on social media claims that President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration has been cancelled and that major TV networks are set to \u201close\u201d their \u201clicenses.\u201d The falsehood relies on a debunked post wrongly claiming that President Donald Trump has \u201cinvoked\u201d the Insurrection Act and will remain in power.", "Days before President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration, social media users are being served a fabricated tale claiming the event has been \u201ccancelled\u201d \u2014 and wrongly claiming that major news networks are set to \u201close\u201d their licenses.", "A Jan. 15 story on a website called \u201cBefore It\u2019s News\u201d was headlined: \u201cABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CNN, MSNBC to Lose Licenses, Trump Remains in Office, Inauguration Cancelled.\u201d", "The website has shared\u00a0misinformation in the past. It also ran the same story under a similar headline a day earlier, which was spread on Facebook and also republished by other dubious websites.", "First of all, we should note that the 20th Amendment to the Constitution makes clear a president and vice president begin their terms on Jan. 20. And the Electoral College results have been verified and accepted by Congress, affirming that Biden will become the next president.", "Instead, the bogus report on Before It\u2019s News cites as its source a message purporting to be from President Donald Trump, saying that he has \u201cinvoked the Insurrection Act of 1807\u201d and will \u201cremain president indefinitely until all domestic enemies are arrested.\u201d", "But that\u2019s a claim we\u2019ve already debunked: The message is the same one that appeared recently on Parler, from an account made to look like a Trump account.", "As we\u2019ve explained, there\u2019s no evidence that \u201c@TeamTrumpNews\u201d is an official account, and it\u2019s not true that Trump has \u201cinvoked\u201d the Insurrection Act \u2014 which permits the president, in certain cases, to deploy the military to quell civil unrest.", "So, no, Biden\u2019s inauguration has not been cancelled; organizers are pairing traditional elements of the ceremony with virtual components in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and security has been heightened in Washington, D.C. following the Capitol riot. And there is no evidence that major television networks are set to lose their licenses, either.", "Contrary to the bogus report, the transfer of power and planning for the inauguration continue. On Jan. 15, the Presidential Inaugural Committee for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\u00a0released\u00a0a schedule of inauguration events; the Associated Press\u00a0reported\u00a0that Vice President Mike Pence had called to congratulate Harris, as well as offer assistance ahead of the inauguration; and Republican Sen. John Cornyn\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he will attend the inauguration.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
