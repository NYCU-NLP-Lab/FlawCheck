ICE wanted to deport him, but Orange County released him \u2014 like a sanctuary city. Linda Coleman supports sanctuary cities. George Holding opposes sanctuary cities that protect criminals.\"", "The radio ad goes into a little more detail:", "\"An illegal immigrant was arrested for a DUI in Durham. However, he was released instead of being deported. Then, he committed a second crime. He sexually assaulted an 11-year-old child in Carrboro.

He was initially charged with felony indecent liberties with a child and felony second-degree kidnapping.", "However, The Herald-Sun reported, an agreement with prosecutors allowed Aguilar-Castellanos to plead guilty to the lesser charge and to be released immediately because he had served 293 days in jail awaiting trial. The maximum sentence he could have received for the sexual battery charges was 150 days, the paper reported.", "The time served by Aguilar-Castellanos isn\u2019t mentioned in the Holding ad.
