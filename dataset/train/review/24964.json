HE WAS NOT TREATED AND WAS DRAGGED OUT BECAUSE HE LACKED INSURANCE. HE DIED LATER THAT NIGHT\":", "In reality, the man shown in the photograph within the meme is Billy Ray Harris, who was the subject of news reports throughout the world in 2013 after a woman named Sarah Darling accidentally dropped her diamond engagement ring into a cup being held by Harris, who was homeless at the time and living on the streets of Kansas City, Missouri.", "Although Harris considered pawning the ring, he did not and instead returned it to Darling a few days later. In response, Darling and her fianc\u00e9 set up an online crowd-funder for Harris, which raised in excess of $190,000 and allowed him to buy a house and a car:", "\ufeff", "No-one by the name of \"Duane Devane\" has ever received the Medal of Honor, according to a list published by the the U.S. Army Center of Military History.
