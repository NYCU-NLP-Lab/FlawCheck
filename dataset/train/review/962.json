["The controversy\u00a0over\u00a0the president's tax returns reignited when the New York Times obtained more than two decades of\u00a0tax return data, which\u00a0reportedly show\u00a0Trump paid\u00a0$750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017.", "The president called the claim that he paid no federal income taxes for 10 of the past\u00a015 years\u00a0\"fake news\" during a press conference, but he dodged specific questions about what he paid and when.", "\"Actually I paid the tax, and you'll see them as soon as my tax returns are done,\"\u00a0Trump told White House reporters. \"It's under audit. They've been under audit for a long time. The IRS does not treat me well.\"", "That's the standard response from Trump whenever he's asked about releasing his tax returns \u2014 an act that was long considered standard practice for people who wanted to be America's chief executive.", "But it's also led some of his supporters to claim on social media that \"IRS Code section 7213 makes the unauthorized disclosure of any return or return information a felony.\" Therefore, \"Trump is required by law not to show his taxes to nosey liberals.\"", "Attempts to reach the poster through social media were not successful.", "More:President Trump's tax returns show he has company: How rich Americans avoid taxes", "The section of code referenced in the Facebook post outlines all the different people who are prohibited from sharing someone's tax returns and the penalties they could face.", "For example, federal employees could face felony charges and fines of up to $5,000.", "It does not, however, prohibit a person from releasing his or her own tax returns.
