["The Democrats have been attacking Mitt Romney and the Republicans for their opposition to abortion rights. On the eve of the Republican convention in Tampa, they got some help from Republican turned independent Charlie Crist, the former governor of Florida.\n\nCrist endorsed President Barack Obama in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times, and complained about growing Republican extremism, including on women\u2019s issues.\n\n\"Look no further than the inclusion of the Akin amendment in the Republican Party platform, which bans abortion, even for rape victims,\" Crist wrote.\n\nCrist refers to Todd Akin, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Missouri. The GOP establishment , including Mitt Romney, called for Akin to withdraw after he said that \"legitimate rape\" rarely results in pregnancy. Akin apologized for his comment but refused to back out. Democrats have been tying Akin to the GOP and Romney ever since.\n\nTo assess the accuracy of Crist\u2019s statement, we asked whether Akin\u2019s views are part of the GOP 2012 platform and whether there is such a thing as an Akin amendment in the first place.\n\n What the platform says\n\nA party\u2019s platform document is supposed to capture the values and policies its presidential candidate will advance if she or he wins the White House. We should note that presidential candidates don\u2019t always agree with every element of the platform, but it is a statement of the party\u2019s overall principles.\n\nThe 2012 platform remains unofficial until a formal vote by the convention delegates but the staff of the Republican National Committee sent PolitiFact the current text of the section on abortion.\n\nThe key portion reads \"We assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protections apply to unborn children.\"\n\nWhat these words mean is subject to interpretation, but at the very least, they call for nullifying Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that affirmed the right to an abortion as a private decision that should be left, within limits, to the woman.\n\nWe attempted to reach Crist to hear why he believes this language would ban abortion in cases of rape, but we were unsuccessful.\n\nWe did speak to David O\u2019Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee, a group that opposes abortion. O\u2019Steen said the platform does not prohibit abortion when rape produces a pregnancy.\n\n\"It states a broad policy,\" O\u2019Steen said. \"It says Roe should be reversed and human life should be protected and that elected representatives should have the right to pass those protections.\"\n\nBut O\u2019Steen said those protections are not absolute, and Congress and individual states would have to decide what exceptions to allow. O\u2019Steen compared those exceptions to laws regarding capital punishment. For example, homicide is a crime but killing a person in self-defense is not.\n\n\"It all depends on the circumstances,\" O\"Steen said. Similarly, Congress and states could pass laws that allow or prohibit abortion in cases of rape. O\u2019Steen says this would hold true if Congress passed the human life amendment or other legislation that declares that legal personhood begins at the moment of conception.\n\nThat legal opinion is far from universal.\n\nAlexa Kolbi-Molinas, a staff attorney at the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project, told Mother Jones magazine, \"Anywhere they give legal rights to and define 'person' as beginning at fertilization, you have the 'personhood' effect.\" In the article, the personhood effect is defined as effectively banning all abortions.\n\nAs for whether states would have the flexibility to set their own conditions for abortions, Suzanne Novack, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in the same magazine article, \"It wouldn't go back to the states. It would be the law of the land.\"\n\nWe should note that the current wording in the GOP platform has been in place at least since 2004. Republican candidates have run on that platform and have endorsed exceptions for abortion in cases of rape and incest. As PolitiFact has reported before, since about 2000, the human life amendments introduced in Congress have included those exceptions, too.\n\nHowever in 2008, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., failed in an effort to include the rape and incest exceptions in the platform itself. Also, O\u2019Steen says while the National Right to Life Committee has endorsed Romney, the \"ideal policy would have an exception to protect the health of the mother only.\"", "An \"Akin\" amendment?\n\nSo is the personhood amendment fairly described as the Akin amendment?\n\nAs far as we can tell, there is no Akin amendment. We were unable to reach Crist to ask what he meant by the term. O\u2019Steen told us that Akin \"was nowhere close to the platform committee.\"\n\nRomney\u2019s running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., has joined Akin on legislation to limit Medicaid funding for abortions to cases of \u2018forcible rape.\u2019 PolitiFact has found that Ryan opposes \u00a0the rape exception for abortion, as does Akin.\n\nThe advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America told us that \"someone started to refer to the abortion language in the GOP platform as the \"Akin amendment\" because it did not explicitly include exceptions for rape and incest. That said, Akin didn\u2019t play a role in drafting that language.\"\n\nWe found an article that credits the Obama campaign for applying that label to the GOP platform position on abortion, which we believe is quite a stretch given Akin has not been involved.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCrist said the GOP platform includes \"the Akin amendment ... which bans abortion, even for rape victims.\"\n\nThe platform clearly opposes most abortions but is vague on the details. It does not specifically say that it bans abortion for rape victims.\n\nAlso, there is no official Akin amendment, and the legal implications of a human life amendment and some versions of personhood bills are debatable.\n\nHowever, there is no dispute that all such measures would nullify Roe v. Wade. Some leading anti-abortion groups would like to ban abortions even in cases of rape and believe personhood bills would help them do this.\n\nWe rate the statement Half True.", "Tampa By Times, Charlie Crist: Here\u2019s why I\u2019m backing Barack Obama, 8/26/12\n\nABC News, GOP approves abortion amendment, keeps silent on cases of rape, August 21, 2012\n\nEmail exchange with Republican National Committee\n\nInterview with David O\u2019Steen, executive director, National Right to Life Committee, August 26, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Samantha Gordon, NARAL Pro-Choice America, August 27, 2012\n\nCBS News, Republicans approve platform with strict anti-abortion language, August 21, 2012\n\nABC News, This Week with George Stephanopoulos, August 26, 2012\n\nNational Committee for a Human Life Amendment, Human Life Amendment Highlights: 1973-2003\n\nRepublican National Committee, 2004 Republican Party Platform\n\nRepublican National Committee, 2008 Republican Party Platform\n\nPolitiFact, Obama says Ryan supports banning all abortions, August 17, 2012\n\nBoston Globe, Romney, Ryan seek distance from \u2018legitimate rape\u2019 remark, August 20, 2012\n\nThomas, H.R.212 -- Sanctity of Human Life Act, January 7, 2011\n\nNBC News, Ryan backed more than one \u2018forcible rape\u2019 abortion bill, August 22, 2012\n\nNational Review, More silliness on Ryan and personhood, August 15, 2012\n\nPersonhood Wisconsin, Policy paper 2011-2012 legislative session\n\nMississippi Center for Public Policy, Initiative 26 Analysis, 2011\n\nAmerican Thinker, The constitution, deprivation of life and personhood, May 12, 2012\n\nLife Site News, Republican party platform rejects abortion, civil unions for gays, August 21, 2012\n\nNational Right to Life Committee, Republican party reaffirms commitment to life, August 22,\n2012\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund, Statement on GOP platform, August 21, 2012\n\nMother Jones, Romney tries to have it both ways on \u2018personhood\u2019, November 22, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, Obama ad says Romney opposed abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, July 25, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
