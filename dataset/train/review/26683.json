["In challenging President Donald Trump to release his tax returns, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said he had released 21 years of his returns and then claimed relative poverty for himself.", "\"I entered as one of the poorest men in Congress, left one of the poorest men in government \u2014 in Congress and as vice president,\" Biden said.", "Biden, who turns 77 on Nov. 20, was born into a working-class family in Scranton, Pa. He entered Congress in 1973 after being elected to represent Delaware in the U.S. Senate at the age of 29. He served there until becoming vice president under Barack Obama, a post he held until January 2017.", "To back up Biden\u2019s first claim, that he \"entered as one of the poorest men in Congress,\" Biden\u2019s campaign sent us a 1974 Delaware newspaper article.

Those rankings don\u2019t account for the fact that Biden remained in government for another decade.", "The rankings are from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which annually ranks the wealth of government officials including members of Congress and top officials in the executive and judicial branches.", "Biden ranked near the bottom in the center\u2019s data in the years before he became vice president: Biden ranked 570th of 585 officials in 2005; 614th of 636 officials in 2006; and 626th of 639 officials in 2007.", "Because officials report their assets and liabilities on official forms as ranges, the rankings use estimates. Biden\u2019s estimated net worth was -$47,494 in 2005; -$12,492 in 2006; and -$52,493 in 2007. In other words, it appeared that his debts outpaced his cash and other assets.", "The center\u2019s rankings only go back to 2004.", "(Biden\u2019s campaign also sent us reports indicating that Biden\u2019s net worth when he left office as vice president was far less than that of former vice president Al Gore and Dick Cheney, and less than current Vice President Mike Pence.
