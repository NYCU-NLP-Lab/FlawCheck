On reverse searching one of the key frames on Google, we found it matched a video claimed to be of a Muharram procession in Dehri, Bihar. It was uploaded on YouTube on Nov 17, 2017. Unlike the video posted by Sudarshan News, this video has no incendiary slogans with reference to the lynching of Tabrez Ansari. The only audio that can be heard is a loudspeaker announcement saying \u201cdheere dheere badte rahe\u2026 Aapse guzarish hai ke dheere dheere badte rahe (Keep moving, you are requested to keep moving slowly)\u201c. The traditional Moharram chants of \u201cHassan Hussain\u201d can be heard in the background.", "To illustrate that an old video was shown by Sudarshan News as recent, we did a side-by-side comparison of frames taken from the Sudarshan News broadcast and the 2017 video that Alt News found, an example of which can be seen below. In the juxtaposition below, a hand holding a blue coloured mobile can be seen in both the videos. However, the original video has none of the incendiary slogans shown by Sudharshan News. Moreover, this is a 2017 video thus, cannot be representative of any protest against the mob-attack on Tabrez Ansari in Jharkhand in June 2019.", "Alt News found the same audio morphed into the video broadcast by Sudarshan News in a clip of a recent SDPI protest rally against Tabrez Ansari\u2019s mob lynching.", "We also found other videos of the rally where similar sloganeering can be heard.", "An old video of a Moharram procession, where people can be seen carrying swords, was doctored to include slogans calling for the killing of RSS workers. Sudarshan News shared the video in its broadcast thereby misinformation its viewers.
