["By Brooks Jackson", "Posted on August 10, 2018", "A Republican TV ad accuses Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri of profiting from \u201ca corrupt Washington subsidy\u201d \u2014 failing to mention that what\u2019s being subsidized is housing for low-income people.", "The ad also fails to note that the very news article on which it is based found no evidence that McCaskill had any part in directing those subsidies to her husband\u2019s affordable-housing business. She doesn\u2019t even sit on the committees that oversee such payments.", "The National Republican Senatorial Committee released the ad Aug. 8, along with a news release accusing McCaskill and her husband of \u201crunning a lucrative grift\u201d and getting rich \u201cat taxpayers\u2019 expense.\u201d", "In the ad, the announcer says, \u201cHer husband\u2019s companies received one hundred thirty one million dollars in federal subsidies. McCaskill votes for subsidies. Her husband receives them. They both get rich. And you pay for it.\u201d", "The ad is based entirely (but selectively) on a July 24 story in the Kansas City Star and other McClatchy newspapers. The story did indeed report that during McCaskill\u2019s first 11 years as a U.S. senator more than $131 million in federal subsidies have flowed into the hundreds of housing projects in which her husband has invested.", "It also reported that he received somewhere between\u00a0$365,374 and $1,118,158 from his many housing projects in 2017. (Members of Congress report their own and their spouse\u2019s outside income in broad ranges, not exact amounts.)", "But the newspaper found nothing \u201ccorrupt.\u201d The story also contradicts the ad\u2019s claim that McCaskill\u2019s husband \u201creceived\u201d subsidies directly. He didn\u2019t. The story says, \u201cThe federal payments don\u2019t go directly into Shepard\u2019s pocket.\u201d Such money \u201chelps apartment owners offer reduced rents to low-income tenants,\u201d according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, one of the agencies that paid the subsidies.", "McCaskill\u2019s husband is Joseph Shephard, founder of Sugar Creek Capital, which invests in low-income housing subsidized by federal and state governments alike. He is a limited partner in nearly 300 low-income housing projects in several states, according to McCaskill\u2019s 2017 personal financial disclosure.", "Shephard began investing in subsidized low-income housing in the 1970s, decades before he married McCaskill in 2002. Opensecrets.org estimates the couple\u2019s net worth at more than $60 million as of 2015,\u00a0ranking her as the fifth richest U.S. senator.", "But the Star story cited by the NRSC ad found nothing \u201ccorrupt\u201d about the subsidies. To the contrary, the story said:", "Kansas City Star, July 24: There\u2019s no evidence that McCaskill played any part in directing federal funds to businesses affiliated with her husband.", "The senator does not sit on committees that oversee the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agencies that award affordable housing contracts and loans to developers and pay out the subsidies.", "She has voted for some massive government spending bills that would have benefited affordable housing programs, but she also voted against others.", "We find that the NRSC\u2019s claim that the affordable-housing subsidies are \u201ccorrupt\u201d and that Shephard\u2019s business is a \u201cgrift\u201d (meaning a petty swindle) are not supported by the facts.", "This issue has been raised before.", "During McCaskill\u2019s first re-election campaign in 2012, the Associated Press reported that nearly $40 million in low-income housing subsidies had flowed into his businesses during her first five years in office \u2014 \u201cthough it appears only fraction of that has made it to the family\u2019s bank accounts.\u201d", "At the time, her Republican challenger, Rep. Todd Aiken, called that \u201ca conflict of interest and a breach of trust with the citizens of our state.\u201d", "But the AP said, \u201cThere is no evidence that McCaskill personally routed the money to her husband\u2019s businesses.\u201d McCaskill cruised to victory that year, winning nearly 55 percent of the vote to Aiken\u2019s 39 percent.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
