(AP)", "Biden said \u201clook, fat,\u201d \u201cold\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re a damn liar\u201d to an Iowa man during a campaign stop when the man asked about Burisma. He also said \u201cyou\u2019re a lying dog-faced pony soldier\u201d to a college student in New Hampshire.", "While he did say \u201cyou\u2019re full of s--\u201d to a Detroit factory worker in an argument about gun rights, Biden did not appear to say \u201cI\u2019ll slap you,\u201d as the Facebook post claims.", "President Donald Trump is known for creating pejorative nicknames for his opponents. But Joe Biden could give him a run for his money.", "A popular Facebook photo of the former vice president includes several purported quotes from him. The post says the statements come from times that Biden has \"attacked voters\" during Democratic primary elections.", "\"There is something seriously wrong with Joe Biden. He is unfit for office,\" reads the caption from conservative Facebook page Robertson Family Values.", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "(Screenshot from Facebook)", "After winning big on Super Tuesday and in several state primaries March 10, Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has a history of verbal gaffes on the campaign trail, so we wanted to look at each statement in the Facebook post to see if it\u2019s accurate.", "While some quotes need additional clarification, Biden did say most of them.", "This checks out.", "Biden said this during a campaign stop in Iowa in December. In a video depicting the event, a man confronts Biden about his son\u2019s connection to Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.", "\"You\u2019re selling access to the president just like he is,\" the man says in the video.", "\"You\u2019re a damn liar, man,\" Biden responds.", "Later in the exchange, Biden challenges the man to do push-ups and says \"look, fat, look, here\u2019s the deal\" while addressing him. He also refers to the man as \"Jack\" and challenges him to an IQ test.", "This statement is also accurate, but it needs more context.", "Biden said it during a February campaign event in New Hampshire. In a video of the event, he responds to a woman\u2019s question about his fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.", "\"How do you explain the performance in Iowa, and why should the voters believe that you can win the national election?\" she asks.", "\"That\u2019s a good question,\" Biden responds. \"No. 1: Iowa\u2019s a Democratic caucus. You ever been to a caucus?", "The woman said yes. But Biden didn\u2019t believe her.", "\"No, you haven\u2019t. You\u2019re a lying dog-faced pony soldier,\" he said.", "It sounds like an attack, but the audience laughed after Biden made the joke. His campaign said the line \u2014\u00a0which Biden has used before \u2014 comes from a John Wayne movie, but it\u2019s not clear that it does. (Email us if you know the source of the line.)", "This quote is partially accurate.", "Biden made the statement before the March 10 Michigan primary while touring a Fiat Chrysler plant in Detroit.

Don\u2019t be such a horse\u2019s ass.\"", "A Facebook post lists three times that Biden has allegedly \"attacked voters this primary.\"", "The assertion that Biden said \"look, fat,\" \"old\" and \"you\u2019re a damn liar\" to an Iowa man checks out. The second quote, \"you\u2019re a lying dog-faced pony soldier,\" is also accurate, although it was said to a college student in jest. The final claim, that Biden said \"you\u2019re full of s---\" and \"I\u2019ll slap you\" to a factory worker, is half right. Another angle of the confrontation does not show Biden saying, \"I\u2019ll slap you.\"", "The Facebook post is accurate but needs clarification and additional information.
