Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who has been in office since 2001. The site only offered a signup for email updates and a link to a \"Kid Rock for U.S. Senate\" web store.", "Previously, Kid Rock\u2019s biggest foray into politics was a trip to the White House with Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent in April.", "He confirmed the site was real on July 12, 2017, via Twitter and Facebook, leading to a flurry of news stories saying he\u2019s now a devil with a cause.
