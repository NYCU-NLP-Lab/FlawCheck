["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on April 11, 2018", "The United States had a trade surplus with China for passenger cars of $8.9 billion in 2017. Exports of cars\u00a0to China totaled $10.5 billion, while imports from China were $1.6 billion. Yet President Donald Trump claimed that China \u201cwon\u2019t take\u201d U.S. cars.", "The president made his claim during a roundtable discussion about taxes in West Virginia on April 5. He said: \u201cIf we make a car and try and get it into China, number one, they won\u2019t take it. But if they did, it\u2019s 25 percent tax. So they pay 2.5; we pay 25. They don\u2019t even want to take it. That doesn\u2019t sound so good.\u201d", "Trump is correct on the countries\u2019 respective tariffs, but despite that imbalance, U.S. automakers export a lot more cars to China than China sends to the U.S.", "Is China refusing to \u201ctake\u201d U.S. cars?", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve heard of before,\u201d said\u00a0Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research, an independent, nonprofit research center. She told us the forecast is for the U.S. to export about 250,000 cars to China this year.", "China, in fact, is the second largest market for U.S. exported cars, behind Canada, according to data from the Census Bureau\u2019s foreign trade division.", "Two other experts also questioned the president\u2019s claim about China not wanting to take U.S. cars.", "\u201cThat isn\u2019t really true,\u201d Brad W. Setser, the Steven A.\u00a0Tananbaum\u00a0senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us in an email. \u201cMercedes, BMW and Jeep/ Chrysler all have exported cars from the US to China successfully.\u201d", "General Motors and Ford have long-established joint ventures with Chinese businesses in that country, Setser said, allowing them to manufacture cars there and avoid the tariff. \u201cThey consequently haven\u2019t really looked to export from the US to China,\u201d he said.", "Marina v.N. Whitman, a former vice president at the General Motors Corp. and professor emerita of business administration and public policy at the University of Michigan, told us there was a \u201ckernel of truth\u201d in Trump\u2019s full statement, \u201cbut it is combined with a lot of misrepresentation and or downright falsehoods.\u201d", "She said that it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely true\u201d that \u201cwe have an ongoing beef against China for the way in which it has forced the transfer of American technology to China in an attempt to catch up and get ahead of us.\u201d China requires U.S. companies manufacturing cars in that country to enter into a joint venture with a Chinese company.", "But in terms of Trump\u2019s statement that China \u201cwon\u2019t take\u201d U.S. cars, Whitman said the substantial amount of U.S. car exports to China \u201ccertainly doesn\u2019t indicate that they aren\u2019t taking them.\u201d", "Here\u2019s the balance of trade in new and used passenger cars from 2008 to 2017, according to foreign trade statistics from the Census Bureau.", "We asked the White House press office for support for the president\u2019s claim, but it didn\u2019t provide any.", "Some have argued that China should change its tariff on car imports, among other measures. New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman wrote\u00a0about \u201ca real trade problem with China\u201d last month and cited those lopsided tariff numbers.", "Those tariffs were set through membership in the World Trade Organization, Dziczek explained, with the idea being that developing markets \u201ccould set more protective barriers\u201d to allow them to grow their industries. China is the largest automotive producer in the world, however, and has been since 2009.", "Many of the cars the U.S. exports to China are luxury vehicles or iconic cars, where that 25 percent tariff \u201ccan be borne by that customer on the other end,\u201d Dziczek said.", "On April 10,\u00a0Chinese President Xi Jinping did say China would \u201csignificantly lower\u201d its tariffs on imported cars in general. CNN noted, however, that China made a similar statement in November.", "U.S. exports to China increased significantly from 2010 to 2014 and then leveled off, but in 2016 and 2017 the small number of cars imported from China has grown. \u201cOver the last few years, Chinese demand growth has cooled and investment in China has caught up with Chinese demand,\u201d Setser told us, \u201cand there is a general incentive to manufacture more in China to jump over the tariff so long as a firm isn\u2019t scared off by the JV requirement.\u201d", "That joint-venture requirement calls for a U.S. company operating in China to establish a partnership with a Chinese business.", "\u201cSince 1983, any foreign automaker that has wanted access to the local market has had to set up a JV with a domestic firm, in which the Chinese ownership must be at least 50%,\u201d explains a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit for PwC on setting up partnerships in the country.", "Foreign companies have set up shop in China, including U.S.-based companies. In fact, the trade ratio is expected to change \u201cquite dramatically,\u201d Dziczek told us, with imports from China surpassing exports to China by 2022. The amount of cars China sends to the U.S. is expected to grow from\u00a058,000 in 2017 to about 450,000 by then and top 500,000 in 2024. But it won\u2019t be Chinese-branded vehicles fueling that; it\u2019s international producers who will send Fords, Buicks, Volvos to the U.S., she said.", "Trump is right about the tariff imbalance between the two countries. Setser writes in a blog post on the topic that the tariff is a \u201creal barrier\u201d and \u201cclearly encourages production in China for the Chinese market.\u201d But China does take U.S. cars, contrary to Trump\u2019s statement, and in fact is one of the largest markets for U.S. cars.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
