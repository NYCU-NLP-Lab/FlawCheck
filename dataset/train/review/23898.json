They\u2019ve been trying for about a decade to change state law. They are back lobbying the Georgia General Assembly this year.", "In the meantime, craft beer, generally defined as beer brewed by relatively small regional breweries, continues to become more popular and profitable.", "The national Brewers Association, based in Colorado estimates that, 207,000 barrels of craft beer were produced in Georgia in 2013 and that the industry contributed $33.9 billion to the national economy, $671 million to Georgia\u2019s economy, taking into account its impact on breweries, wholesalers, retailers, jobs even brewpub restaurants and taprooms.", "Legislatures across the country in recent years have wrestled with changing their alcohol and tax laws while weighing the competing interests of the craft beer brewers, the powerful big \u00a0beer manufacturers and wholesalers. Part of the argument for the law change in Georgia is the relatively unique restrictions that exist here on beer brewers.", "Georgia \u00a0\"is one of only five states that do not allow beer factories or 'production breweries' to sell beer for neither on-premise consumption (pints) nor off premise consumption (packaged beer),\" Nancy Palmer, executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild said Monday.", "Politifact decided to check the claim.", "We reached out to Palmer, who warned us that \u00a0\"this issue is a little complicated.\"", "\"Section 2 of the 21st Amendment provides huge amount of leeway to the states to regulate alcohol, and each has come up with as many laws about it as there are stars in the sky,\" she said. \"The laws on alcohol vary from state to state significantly more than gun control or the control of illicit drugs.\"", "She said her research showed that only four states, besides Georgia, have laws prohibiting direct sales by breweries to consumers. They are West Virginia, Hawaii, Mississippi and North Dakota.", "We contacted Palmer\u2019s counterpart with the brewers\u2019 associations in Mississippi.
