["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on July 19, 2019", "A popular meme falsely claims that each month refugees in the United States receive over three times more money in \u201cfederal assistance\u201d than Social Security beneficiaries. That\u2019s a new version of an old claim we debunked over a decade ago.", "A bogus comparison of benefits for \u201cillegal refugees\u201d and Social Security recipients is stirring up anger online.", "The claim, which has been shared as a meme, says: \u201cInsanity is when illegal refugees get $3,874 a month in federal assistance while Social Security checks average $1,200 a month.\u201d", "That sounds a lot like an old falsehood that started in Canada in 2004, and later migrated to the U.S. We wrote about it first in 2007, then again in 2009, and again in 2010.", "This most recent version isn\u2019t true, either, and it also may have borrowed from another Canadian viral claim. The figure this meme uses for refugee benefits is the same one used in what Snopes called a \u201cmostly false\u201d Facebook posting about benefits in Canada.", "To start with, there are no \u201cillegal refugees.\u201d Under U.S. law, refugee status is given to those who are admitted to the country after demonstrating that they have fled persecution. The number of refugees that the U.S. takes in each year is capped by the president under the Refugee Act of 1980 \u2014 for fiscal year 2019, the cap is set at 30,000, which is the lowest it has been since 1980.", "While refugees are eligible to apply for some federally funded programs, not all of them do, a spokesman at the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Administration for Children and Families told us.", "An internal report from the Department of Health and Human Services in 2017 estimated that the annual per refugee cost was $7,134 for federal, state and local governments combined between 2005 and 2014. Programs funded by the federal government were 74 percent of that total, so, on average, the federal government spent $440 per refugee, per month, during the study\u2019s time period.", "That\u2019s a lot less than the nearly $3,900 a month the meme claims \u2014 which would work out to be about $47,000 per year.", "Also, many of the programs that refugees are eligible to apply for are temporary. Two of the primary assistance programs available to refugees are Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, and Refugee Cash Assistance, or RCA.", "TANF is a program for needy families that is funded jointly by federal and state governments and is administered by states. It is available to refugee families for their first five years in the U.S. RCA is a federally funded program that is also administered by states, and is available to refugees who do not qualify for TANF. It is available for the first eight months that a refugee is in the country.", "The amount of money given out under each program varies widely depending on the state. For example, monthly TANF payments for a single-parent family of three ranged from $170 to $1,021 in 2017.", "As for the second part of the claim in the meme \u2014 \u201cSocial Security checks average $1,200 a month\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s close to the correct figure. The average monthly Social Security benefit for all retired workers in 2019 is $1,461, according to the Social Security Administration.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
