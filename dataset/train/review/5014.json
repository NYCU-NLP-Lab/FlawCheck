["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on June 17, 2020", "A conspiracy theory on Facebook is falsely claiming that the killing of George Floyd was \u201cfilmed before covid19\u201d because \u201c[n]ot a single person is wearing a mask\u201d in the videos. Some of the officers and officials in the videos can clearly be seen wearing masks.", "Since the May 25 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, conspiracy theories about his death have swirled online as posts have falsely suggested that the death was \u201cstaged\u201d or that \u201ccrisis actors\u201d were involved.", "Now, a repeatedly posted image on Facebook feeding into that narrative wrongly claims that the killing was \u201cfilmed before covid19\u201d because \u201cnot a single person is wearing a mask\u201d in the videos.", "\u201cIt just dawned on me the most glaring component of the Floyd psyop\u2026 it was filmed before covid19\u2026 How do I know\u2026 Not a single person is wearing a mask\u2026\u201d the post claims. It specifically asserts that Floyd and \u201cthe cops,\u201d among others, were not wearing masks.", "But the claim is undercut by a review of footage that is publicly available.", "Take the\u00a0viral video that shows former Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck, for example. The video, captured by a bystander, shows that two EMTs who arrived at the scene, and who helped put Floyd into an ambulance, can be seen wearing surgical masks.", "Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder, second-degree manslaughter and second-degree unintentional murder while committing a felony.", "Other footage captured by surveillance cameras at a nearby restaurant also shows that former Officer Thomas Lane \u2014 one of three officers charged with aiding and abetting unintentional second-degree murder, and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter \u2014 was also wearing a mask.", "Another officer who was present at the scene can also be seen wearing a face covering, the surveillance video shows. More footage captures a firefighter, who arrived after the ambulance left, also wearing a mask.", "So the assertion that \u201c[n]ot a single person is wearing a mask\u201d in the videos is false. The footage, in fact, undercuts the baseless theory that Floyd\u2019s death was \u201cfilmed before covid19.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
