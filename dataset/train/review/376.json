Each state gets to decide how poor a household must be in order to qualify.", "Missouri covers children newborn to age 1 at 196 percent of the poverty level, meaning babies qualify as long as their families make just less than $40,000 dollars a year. For children 1 to 18 years old, Missouri covers them at 150 percent of the poverty level, or a yearly family income of about $30,000 dollars, according to\u00a0Medicaid.gov. However, their parents are only covered if they make less than about 18 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, or about $3,600 dollars per year.", "The Missouri Department of Social Services\u00a0charts income guidelines for parents to qualify for Medicaid; it shows the maximum income to qualify for a family of three is $301 dollars per month, or $3,612 dollars per year.

That\u2019s not the case in 32 other states. \"The states that have expanded Medicaid qualify adults without children who make 138 percent of the poverty level \u2014 in some states, even those who make more than that,\" Orbann said.", "In other words, a woman without children in Illinois or Arkansas could make around $16,000 dollars per year and be covered by Medicaid, but a woman in Missouri with two children making above $3,600 would not.", "Even among states that have not expanded Medicaid,\u00a0only Texas and Alabama had lower maximum income caps\u00a0for parents on Medicaid than Missouri, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan information source on health issues.
