["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on June 15, 2016 | Updated on June 16, 2016", "The National Rifle Association\u2019s chief lobbyist claimed \u2014 without offering any evidence \u2014 that the FBI was prevented from fully investigating Omar Mateen prior to his attack on an Orlando nightclub because of \u201cthe Obama administration\u2019s political correctness.\u201d Others, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, have made similar claims.", "But FBI Director James Comey has said that the FBI over the course of two preliminary investigations in 2013 and 2014 recorded Mateen\u2019s conversations, followed him, introduced him to confidential sources, interviewed him, \u201creview[ed] transactional records from his communications, and search[ed] all government holdings for any possible connections.\u201d\u00a0Both investigations closed without the FBI taking any action against Mateen, because, Comey said, there was no reason at that time to suspect Mateen had terrorist ties or intentions.", "\u201cWe\u2019re also going to look hard at our own work to see whether there is something we should have done differently,\u201d Comey said at a June 13 press briefing. \u201cSo far, the honest answer is: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t see anything in reviewing our work that our agents should have done differently, but we\u2019ll look at it in an open and honest way, and be transparent about it.\u201d", "In an op-ed for USA Today, Chris Cox \u2014 who heads the NRA\u2019s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action \u2014 explained\u00a0why the NRA opposes new gun-control measures \u2014 particularly the reinstatement of a federal ban on certain military-style, semi-automatic firearms \u2014 in response to the nation\u2019s worst mass shooting in modern history on June 12 in Orlando. Of course, Cox has a right to that opinion.", "But in stating his case, Cox makes an unsubstantiated claim about the FBI\u2019s prior contact with Mateen, a U.S.-born Muslim who pledged\u00a0allegiance to\u00a0the terrorist Islamic State on the night of the attack.", "Cox, June 15:\u00a0The terrorist in Orlando had been investigated multiple times by the FBI. He had a government-approved security guard license with a contractor for the\u00a0Department of Homeland Security. Yet his former co-workers reported violent and racist comments. Unfortunately, the\u00a0Obama administration\u2019s political correctness prevented anything from being done about it.", "We asked NRA-ILA spokeswoman Amy Hunter what evidence Cox has that political correctness prevented the FBI from fully investigating Mateen. We have yet to receive a response, and we will update our article if we do.", "But what we know so far does not support Cox\u2019s claim, and in fact contradicts it.", "At his June 13 press briefing, the FBI director said the agency became aware of Mateen in May 2013, when Mateen was working as a security guard at a local court house.", "\u201cHe made some statements that were inflammatory and contradictory that concerned his co-workers about terrorism,\u201d Comey said. \u201cFirst, he claimed family connections to al Qaeda. He also said that he was a member of Hezbollah, which is a Shia terrorist organization that is a\u00a0bitter enemy of the so-called Islamic State, ISIL. He said he hoped that law enforcement would raid his apartment and assault his wife and child so that he could martyr himself.\u201d", "Mateen\u2019s odd behavior was reported to the FBI, and its Miami office opened a preliminary investigation. Under its Domestic\u00a0Investigations and\u00a0Operations Guide, the FBI must complete its preliminary investigation in six months, although it can get\u00a0an extension of up to six additional months.", "Comey said the first investigation in 2013 lasted 10 months, so it must have received an extension.", "\u201cOur investigation involved introducing confidential sources to him, recording conversations with him, following him, reviewing transactional records from his communications, and searching all government holdings for any possible connections, any possible derogatory information,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then interviewed him twice. He admitted making the statements that his co-workers reported, but explained that he did it in anger because he thought his co-workers were discriminating against him and teasing him because he was Muslim.\u00a0After 10 months of investigation, we closed the preliminary investigation.\u201d", "The fact that the preliminary investigation closed after 10 months indicates that the agency felt its investigation was completed. FBI rules discourage conducting preliminary investigations beyond a year, but a longer extension can be approved \u201cby the appropriate FBIHQ operational section for \u2018good cause.'\u201d", "Don Borelli, a retired FBI counterterrorism supervisor in New York, told the New York Times\u00a0that the danger in keeping an investigation open without good cause is the impact that it can have on innocent people.\u00a0\u201cImagine if you can\u2019t get a job because you\u2019re on some watchlist and there\u2019s no basis for it,\u201d Borelli told the Times.", "Or imagine that someone cannot buy a gun because he or she is on a terrorist watch list and there\u2019s no basis for it.", "In fact, that is the very argument that the NRA chief lobbyist makes in response to gun-control advocates who want to give the attorney general the power to prevent people from buying guns if they are on the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Watchlist \u2014 which, as we have written, contains\u00a0about 800,000\u00a0names, including foreigners and U.S. citizens. (Mateen, a U.S. citizen, was on the watch list while under FBI investigation.)\u00a0In a press release\u00a0issued June 15, Cox said that \u201cdue process protections should be put in place that allow law-abiding Americans who are wrongly put on a watchlist to be removed.\u201d", "Two months after it closed its preliminary investigation of Mateen, the FBI opened a second one after discovering that he knew a Florida man who carried out a suicide mission in Syria. That was in July 2014.", "\u201cOur Miami office was investigating the Florida man who had blown himself up for the Nusra Front in Syria. Again, the Nusra Front being a group in conflict with ISIL. We learned from the investigation that the killer knew him casually from attending the same mosque in that area of Florida,\u201d Comey said. \u201cOur investigation turned up no ties of any consequence between the two of them.\u201d", "Comey said the FBI again interviewed Mateen \u201cto find out whether he had any significant contacts with the suicide bomber,\u201d and determined that he did not,\u00a0and that ended the second investigation. We asked the FBI how long that investigation lasted and whether any other investigative actions were taken, besides interviewing Mateen, but \u200bit declined to comment beyond Comey\u2019s earlier remarks.", "We understand that there are legitimate questions of the FBI.\u00a0On CNN\u2019s \u201cAt This Hour,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Lindsey Graham also questioned why the FBI closed its investigation. \u201cWhat do you have to do to stay on the terrorist watch list? What are the criteria to close a file? To me, I want to know the answer to that question,\u201d he said.", "Fair enough. But Cox goes too far \u2014 and Huckabee even further \u2014 in blaming political correctness without any evidence.", "In a June 14 blog post, Huckabee\u00a0said that\u00a0\u201cpolitical correctness kills, and it just set a new US record.\u201d", "There is simply no evidence to support such a claim.", "Clarification, June 16: This article was updated to clarify that Chris Cox is executive director of the NRA\u2019s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, and Amy Hunter is its spokeswoman.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4bbbceac-fcf9-4ae2-82fa-65e3391ae6ef", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
