Scott Walker has sought to make business development and job creation a foundational part of his legacy in the state \u2014 a drive boosted by the announcement that Foxconn Technology Group plans to build a $10 billion plant here.", "So it\u2019s no surprise the state\u2019s business climate has been a common refrain in the push to win the plant and in the victory laps since Foxconn\u2019s decision. That included this July 19, 2017, tweet from Walker:", "\"We took Wisconsin from the Bottom 10 for business to the Top 10. Our reforms are working and more are on the way!\"", "The same claim showed up in a column published Aug. 4, 2017, in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.", "What does it mean to be in the \"Top 10\" for business, and who decides that? Let\u2019s dig in.", "Many surveys, many results", "Walker\u2019s tweet didn\u2019t cite a source, but Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said it referred to a ranking from Chief Executive Magazine, which placed Wisconsin No. 10 in its 2017 Best & Worst States for Business. The same survey ranked Wisconsin 41st in 2010, the year Walker was elected. That\u2019s the bottom 10 of his claim.", "The ranking \u2014 which Walker\u2019s touted in a news release when it was released in May \u2014 is based on a survey asking CEOs their perceptions of each state.", "Many national groups do similar surveys with a variety of methodologies, but most others aren\u2019t so keen on Wisconsin\u2019s business climate. Here\u2019s a sampling of the most recent ratings from prominent sources:", "CNBC\u2019s 2017 scorecard ranked Wisconsin 21st in economic climate, based on an analysis of more than 60 measures, such as workforce, infrastructure, cost of doing business, economy and quality of life.", "The Tax Foundation\u2019s 2017 ranking of state tax climate pegs Wisconsin at 39th for how well a state\u2019s tax system is structured for business.", "Site Selection Magazine ranked Wisconsin 25th for overall business climate in 2016, which it calculates by combining a survey of corporate site selectors and data on recent projects sited in the state.", "Forbes ranked Wisconsin 27th in 2016 among its best states for business based on a combined ranking that included business cost, labor supply, regulatory environment, economic climate, growth prospects and quality of life.", "The Kauffman Index publishes three rankings on aspects of entrepreneurial activity. Among the largest 25 states in 2016, it ranked Wisconsin second for Main Street entrepreneurship (per capita small businesses and business owners), 23rd for growth entrepreneurship (how much new businesses have grown) and 25th for startup activity (number of new businesses and business owners).", "An undated ranking from US NEWS & World Report puts the state\u2019s business environment at 32nd, based on private business birth rate and number of patents per capita.", "Among the prominent national rankings, the Chief Executive Magazine one cited by Walker is the only one that does not have some objective, data-based component.", "Mike Winkleman, the magazine\u2019s editor in chief, said the survey was sent to CEOs of the 42,000 largest companies in the country, of which about 500 responded.

Wisconsin ranked an average of 20th among those four.", "Moving in the right direction", "Chief Executive Magazine is an outlier in how highly it ranks Wisconsin\u2019s current business climate, but Wisconsin\u2019s rankings have improved across the board since 2010.", "The CNBC ranking rose from 29 to 21, Forbes from 40 to 27 and the Tax Foundation a lesser uptick from 42 to 39.
