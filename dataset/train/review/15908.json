Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, speaking at a virtual get-out-the-vote rally with Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and other Wisconsin politicians.", "Urging people to head to the polls, Moore said in the Oct. 20, 2020 call that voters can use an ID \"even if that ID is expired or you\u2019ve moved.\"", "Anyone voting in person Nov. 3 will have to show a photo ID in Wisconsin. Typically voters use a driver\u2019s license, state-issued identification card, military ID or passport. Some kinds of school IDs are also allowed, but employee IDs or membership IDs are not, according to the Wisconsin Election Commission.", "With Election Day fast approaching, let\u2019s see what the commission says about Moore\u2019s address and expiration claims.", "Photo IDs can indeed be expired, but with a key caveat.", "The commission says expired IDs are allowed as long as they were valid as of the last general election \u2014 that is, Nov. 6, 2018. An ID that expired before that date would not be acceptable to vote.", "On the address side, we again have a largely accurate claim with one caveat.", "Here\u2019s what the commission says: \"An acceptable Photo ID for voting does not have to include a current address. You only prove your address when registering.\"", "So previously registered voters only need to worry about whether the ID is active, and didn\u2019t expire before November 2018 \u2014 not the address.", "But voters who haven\u2019t yet registered need to provide documentation with a current address as proof of residence. That could be the same as the ID card \u2014 using a state driver\u2019s license or ID card \u2014 or a separate document such as a real estate tax bill, utility bill, bank statement or paycheck.", "Moore said you can vote in Wisconsin with an ID \"even if that ID is expired or you\u2019ve moved.\"", "There\u2019s a caveat for both halves of that claim.", "The ID can be expired, but for the Nov. 3 election it can\u2019t have expired before Nov. 6, 2018. And it\u2019s OK if the address is wrong, as long as the voter is already registered or provides some other document as proof of residence.", "So this statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
