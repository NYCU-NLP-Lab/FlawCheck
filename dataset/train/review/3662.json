["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on October 17, 2018", "Q: Was the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade made because Jane Roe said she was raped?", "A: No. \u201cJane Roe\u201d falsely claimed she was gang raped, but that accusation was not a factor in the court ruling.", "A viral video is circulating online framed by text that says: \u201cDid you know Roe v. Wade was passed only because Roe lied about being raped?\u201d That\u2019s not true.", "Rape played no part in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, the case that made access to abortion legal across the country. Rather, the court ruled, in a 7-2 opinion, that women had a constitutional right to abortion under the 14th Amendment\u2019s right to privacy.", "In fact, the court\u2019s decision didn\u2019t mention the circumstances that led to the plaintiff\u2019s pregnancy at all. It just said: \u201cRoe alleged that she was unmarried and pregnant; that she wished to terminate her pregnancy by an abortion \u2018performed by a competent, licensed physician, under safe, clinical conditions\u2019; that she was unable to get a \u2018legal\u2019 abortion in Texas because her life did not appear to be threatened by the continuation of her pregnancy; and that she could not afford to travel to another jurisdiction in order to secure a legal abortion under safe conditions.\u201d", "The woman who brought the case in 1970 under the pseudonym Jane Roe was Norma McCorvey, who had been living in Dallas County, Texas. It is true that in seeking an abortion in Texas she had initially claimed to have been gang raped and then, in a 1987 interview, McCorvey said that she had lied about the rape.", "\u201cI found out I was pregnant through what I thought was love,\u201d McCorvey said during the interview with journalist Carl Rowan in a documentary series called \u201cSearching For Justice: Three American Stories.\u201d McCorvey had hoped that by claiming she was raped, she\u2019d be able to get around the Texas ban on abortion, which included an exception if the mother\u2019s life were in danger, according to an interview\u00a0with Rowan by the New York Times in 1987.", "But McCorvey never ended up getting an abortion. Her baby was born before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision came down, and she gave up the child for adoption, according to testimony she gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2005.", "One of the lawyers who represented McCorvey at the Supreme Court, Sarah Weddington, said in a statement shortly before the 1987 documentary aired that during the case she never \u201ctouched the issue of rape and only emphasized the question of whether the Constitution gives to the state or leaves to a woman the questions of what she can or must do with her body.\u201d", "So, while it\u2019s true that McCorvey had first claimed to have been raped and later recanted, it is not true that the claim had any bearing on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Robichaud, Paul.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
