Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz. The primary is scheduled for Aug. 30.", "We came across an advertisement attacking Kirkpatrick, which comes from the Arizona Grassroots Action Political Action Committee.", "\"She votes with her party nearly 90 percent of the time,\" the ad states, as the graphic shows Kirkpatrick and President Barack Obama side by side.", "Although the PAC\u2019s ad says it is not authorized by any candidate or committee, they\u2019ve taken a pro-McCain stance, spending wise, in this Senate race.", "According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, the PAC has spent $211,547\u00a0against Ward in the last two weeks.
