["Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver is tired of hearing people suggest that New Jersey has a problem of adequately educating its residents.\n\nIn fact, according to Oliver, New Jerseyans are the \"most educated\" in the nation.\n\nThe Essex County Democrat extolled the virtues of the Garden State during a Feb. 27 speech at the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.\n\n\"New Jersey is a great place. We probably have the best strategic position on the East Coast. We have so many natural assets,\" Oliver told the audience. \"And, I\u2019m gonna get into the subject of education in a moment, but I want to tell you New Jersey has the most educated population of all the states in this country. And we need to stop this self-fulfilling efficacy that we\u2019ve got a problem when it comes to adequately educating people in our state.\"\n\nOliver\u2019s claim about us having the \"most educated population of all the states\" is not far off, PolitiFact New Jersey found.\n\nIn recent years, New Jersey has stood in fifth place among the states for the percentage of its residents, 25 years old and over, who have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s explain the source of Oliver\u2019s statement.\n\nTo back up the claim, Oliver spokesman Tom Hester Jr. cited various education statistics, including a 2009 news article by U.S. News & World Report about, in part, New Jersey having the highest high school graduation rate in 2006.", "He also cited a Huffington Post article that claimed the state ranked sixth for the percentage of adults between 25 and 34 years old with college degrees.", "\"New Jersey has the nation\u2019s highest high school graduation rate and ranks at the very top in student achievement and college graduation rates,\" Hester said in an email. \"Quite simply, the Speaker believes that when you combine it all together, NJ has the most educated population.\"\n\nBut two experts told us the best measure to determine the \"most educated\" states is the educational attainment data compiled by the census bureau.\n\nThrough a spokesman, Thomas Snyder, director of Annual Reports for the National Center for Education Statistics at the U.S. Department of Education, said in an e-mail: \"I believe the educational attainment data are the most relevant for this question.\"\n\nDavid Bills, an associate professor at the University of Iowa\u2019s College of Education, agreed that the educational attainment data is the \"best available measure.\"\n\n\"I\u2019d call it the best available measure, with the main problem being that many people complete their education after age 25, so this measure will underestimate how many people will eventually get degrees,\" Bills said in an e-mail. \"Not everyone over age 25 has completed their schooling.\"\n\nNow, let\u2019s explain how many New Jersey residents have college degrees.\n\nIn 2009, 34.5 percent of New Jerseyans, 25 years old and over, had at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, according to the census bureau. In 2010, 35.4 percent of state residents fit the same criteria, according to the census bureau.\n\nIn both years, New Jersey was in fifth place behind Massachusetts, Colorado, Maryland and Connecticut. Even after accounting for the margins of error attached to those statistics, New Jersey doesn\u2019t place first.\n\nSo, New Jersey may not have the \"most educated\" population, but it certainly has one of them.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a speech at Rider University, Oliver claimed \"New Jersey has the most educated population of all the states in this country.\"\n\nAccording to educational attainment data from the U.S. Census Bureau, her claim is pretty much on target. In 2009 and 2010, New Jersey ranked fifth for the percentage of its population, 25 years old and over, who have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "Remarks by Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver at Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics, Feb. 27, 2012\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, Webinar: 2010 American Community Survey Single Year Estimates, Sept. 20, 2011\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, Educational Attainment in the United States: 2009, February 2012\n\nThe Star-Ledger, N.J. has most educated lawmakers in the nation, study finds, June 14, 2011\n\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education, How educated are state legislators?, June 12, 2011\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, Educational Attainment by State: 1990 to 2009, accessed March 19, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver, March 20-21, 2012\n\nPhone and email interview with David Thomas, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Education, March 20, 2012\n\nEmail interview with David Bills, an associate professor at The University of Iowa College of Education, March 20, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Lutz Hendricks, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, March 20-21, 2012\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, 2009 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, accessed March 21, 2012\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, 2010 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, accessed March 21, 2012\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, accessed March 21, 2012", "U.S. News & World Report, Which States Have the Best High School Graduation Rates?, June 12, 2009\n\nEducation Week, Report Awards Grades for Education Performance, Policy; Nation Earns a C, Maryland Ranks First for Fourth Straight Year, Jan. 12, 2012", "Huffington Post, States With The MOST College Degree Holders (PHOTOS), originally published June 10, 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
