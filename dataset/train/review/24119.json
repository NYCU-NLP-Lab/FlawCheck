["About this rating", "The agonizing pain known as \"blue balls\" is well known to just about any man who was ever a teenager, an ache caused by prolonged arousal without release \u2014 a condition often referred to by urologists as epididymal hypertension. But what causes this syndrome?", "Although anecdotal evidence suggests that epididymal hypertension is fairly common (especially in adolescent men) there is for some reason a remarkable dearth of peer-reviewed scientific literature on the topic. Case reports and speculative essays have been published, but a universally agreed-upon understanding of the mechanism is still lacking. According to one speculative paper published in Medical Hypotheses:", "Although epididymal hypertension pathophysiology has not been cleared yet, it is thought that it might be related to an increased distension of epididymis or to a pelvic venous dilatation [...]", "Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, an associate clinical professor of urology at Harvard Medical School, gave a layman\u2019s explanation in a post for BuzzFeed Health:", "The testicles produce testosterone and sperm, but they also make other fluid to help propel the sperm through the various tubes, says Morgentaler. \u201cWith more stimulation, there\u2019s more blood flow to the genital region, including the testicles. The fluid wants to get somewhere, but without there being that release, it builds up and builds pressure,\u201d he says. When they get really filled up or congested, it causes the insides to stretch as they get engorged, and that\u2019s what hurts.", "Two things are thought to be going on. First, the increase of blood to the penis, caused by the restriction of outflowing blood, fills a penile chamber called the corpus cavernosum, which in turn puts more pressure on the various \"tubes\" directing various fluids flowing through that region.", "The second factor, most agree, is that the production of seminal fluid puts even more pressure to expand (epididymal distension) within these already compressed tubes, and this can build up in a painful way absent an ejaculatory release. This is described in an October 2000 case report \u2014 the first ever peer-reviewed study of \"blue balls\" \u2014 of a 14-year-old male presenting with testicular pain:", "Perhaps if this persists and testicular venous drainage is slowed, pressure builds and causes pain. Is epididymal distension the cause of the pain? As with any disease entity, there is probably a spectrum of pain with \u201cblue balls\u201d varying from brief, mild discomfort to severe, sustained pain, as in the case described.", "There appears to be some disagreement among medical professionals regarding the \"blue\" part of \"blue balls\". Morgentaler, speaking to Buzzfeed, proffered this explanation for the name:", "The name probably refers more to the sensation than the color. \u201cThe experience is of it being bruised,\u201d says Morgentaler. \u201cIt has that kind of sensitivity and tenderness.\u201d", "Most men won\u2019t even experience any noticeable swelling, but the engorgement happening inside the testicles is what\u2019s causing all that pain.", "Speaking to Men\u2019s Health magazine, however, Weill Cornell urologist Richard K. Lee suggested a slight tint of blue may be possible, but likely not without additional confounding issues:", "There\u2019s also some evidence that a prolonged erection can cause some of the oxygen in your blood to be absorbed by the tissue in your genitals.", "This can leave the blood with a blue-ish hue, says urologist Richard K. Lee, M.D., [...] of Weill Cornell. Dr. Lee says this usually only happens when there\u2019s some type of blockage.", "\u201cErectile dysfunction drugs or blood flow-constricting devices like a penis ring could cause this, but it\u2019s not likely to occur naturally,\u201d he adds.", "Blueness aside, the existence of the potential for discomfort is well-accepted. It has also, however, become a hot-button issue in sexual politics, as pain caused by foreplay without release has sometimes been employed by men or adolescents as a tool to guilt a partner into further sexual activity (\"I could die!\"). Such a tactic, while objectively immoral, also relies on the false assumption that there are actual long-term health risks associated with \"blue balls\".", "The consensus is that, save the coincidental occurrence of a testicular torsion, there are no long-term complications from the discomfort. In the 2000 case report, the authors suggested it could be remedied through \"sexual release\" or a dubious \"heavy lifting\" mechanism, which not only sounds like it potentially adds insult to injury, but also nimbly dances around the concept of masturbation altogether.", "This point was not lost on a number of published letters in response to the report bemoaning the fact that the easiest solution was not explicitly stated:", "In the discussion of treatment, however, we wonder whether the authors\u2019 suggestion that \u201cstraining to move a very heavy object\u201d is the first choice \u201csimple maneuver [that] could bring immediate relief.\u201d As this condition is coming to light in a highly respected pediatric journal, perhaps we should resurrect the advice of former Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders and teach masturbation in the schools.", "If masturbation isn\u2019t your jam, Morgentaler has another easy solution: Just give it some time, rest a bit, and it will go away on its own. Perhaps these simple solutions are why there is such a dearth of scientific research into the ailment.", "Chalett, Jonathan M., and Nerenberg, Lewis, T. \u00a0 \"\u201cBlue Balls\u201d: A Diagnostic Consideration in Testiculoscrotal Pain in Young Adults: A Case Report and Discussion.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Pediatrics. \u00a0 October 2000.", "Segura-Sampedro, J.J. \u00a0 \"Foreplay, a Selected Strategy That Might Be Able to Increase Fertility Rates.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Medical Hypotheses. \u00a0 7 April 2017.", "Gueren, Casey. \u00a0 \"Here\u2019s What Blue Balls Actually Are.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 BuzzFeed News. \u00a0 29 April 2015.", "Andersson, K.E., and Wagner, G. \u00a0 \"Physiology of Penile Erection.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Physiological Reviews. \u00a0 January 1995.", "Heid, Markham. \u00a0 The Real Reason \u2018Blue Balls\u2019 Hurts So Much.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Physiological Reviews. \u00a0 14 April 2016.", "Rockney, Randy, et al. \u00a0 \u201cBlue Balls\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Pediatrics. \u00a0 November 2001.", "Madison, Amber. \u00a0 Hooking Up: A Girl's All-Out Guide to Sex and Sexuality.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Prometheus Books, 2006. \u00a0 1615921540.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
