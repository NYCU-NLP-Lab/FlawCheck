In medical terms, it is defined as a loss of joint contact, in other words, the separation of two bones that are usually interconnected by cartilage. When the dislocation between the bones is partial and a part of each surface is in contact with the other, it is called a subluxation. The luxation can, sometimes, be related to a bone fracture, which can make it be mistaken for a sprain or a contusion. Luxation: dislocation of a bone. Sprain: injury caused by excessive movement of a joint.
