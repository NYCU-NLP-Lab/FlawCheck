Although we have not been able to positively identify the aircraft, it appears to be a Russian Ilyushin Il-76. Both the Il-76 and C-130 release a similar flare pattern, but the aircrafts have a few obvious differences. For instance, the C-130 (right) has visible propellers, while the Il-76 (left) uses Turbofan engines:", "In addition to misidentifying the aircraft, the Facebook post also claimed that the photograph showed was releasing flares in honor of the fallen troops it was carrying. Although the flares are sometimes called \"angel flares\" due to the pattern they leave, they are deployed primarily as a defense mechanism \u2014 not to signify that they are carrying anything other than the usual crew and supplies.", "To further complicate things, the term \"angel flight\" is sometimes used to refer to an aircraft that is transporting fallen soldiers, but this does not appear to be an official military term and the two are apparently unrelated.", "Goard, Alyssa. \u00a0 \"From Iraq to Leander: A Flag to Honor Fallen Peace Officers.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 KXAN. \u00a0 15 May 2017.", "Yarborough, Chuck. \u00a0 \"Radney Foster Pays Homage to Veterans with 'Angel Flight,' Has Beachland Ballroom Date on Friday, Nov. 20.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Cleveland.com. \u00a0 20 November 2009.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
