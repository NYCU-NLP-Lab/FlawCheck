["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 9, 2020", "President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign pushed an altered image of a Washington Times front page to cast doubt on the 2020 election calls made by news outlets. The newspaper never ran the purported front page, declaring Al Gore the winner of the 2000 election.", "Numerous news outlets called the 2020 election for former Vice President Joe Biden on Nov. 7 after their projections showed that he had locked in more than the required 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.", "But President Donald Trump has refused to concede, and his campaign is pursuing legal challenges to the results. In the meantime, campaign officials have been saying that the media\u2019s call on the race should not be trusted.", "The day after Biden declared victory, a Trump campaign official shared a purported front page of the Washington Times\u00a0on social media to suggest that newspapers published front pages prematurely declaring Democrat Al Gore the winner of the 2000 election.", "But the image, which has been widely spread by others on social media, is fabricated.", "The image shows a Nov. 8, 2000, Washington Times front page with the bold headline: \u201cPRESIDENT GORE.\u201d Beneath it is a photo of Gore taking an oath (which was taken during his 1993 inauguration as vice president).", "After Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign\u2019s director of communications, tweeted the image and a photo of it plastered around campaign headquarters \u2014 as \u201ca reminder that the media doesn\u2019t select the President\u201d \u2014 the Washington Times publicly debunked the claim.", "\u201cThose photos have been doctored,\u201d the newspaper responded in a tweet. \u201cThe Washington Times never ran a \u2018President Gore\u2019 headline.\u201d", "Murtaugh subsequently deleted his tweet.", "Others on Twitter dug up the real front page of the newspaper from that day in 2000, which actually declared \u201cPresident Bush\u201d the winner.", "As readers likely know, Bush won the presidency after securing a victory in Florida by a margin of only 537 votes. Though some networks\u00a0initially\u00a0called\u00a0the state for Gore, they then pulled that call back\u00a0on election night, before projecting\u00a0Bush\u00a0the winner\u00a0and then rescinding that.", "The U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0weeks later\u00a0put an\u00a0end\u00a0to recount efforts by Gore, ending the race.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
