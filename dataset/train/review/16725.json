Cory Booker, D-N.J., is pushing for a new bill that would provide Black farmers debt relief and access to a land grant program, arguing they have historically endured discrimination from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.", "\"Overtly discriminatory and unjust federal policy has robbed Black families in the United States of the ability to build and pass on intergenerational wealth,\" Booker said in a Feb. 9 statement. \"When it comes to farming and agriculture, we know that there is a direct connection between discriminatory policies within the USDA and the enormous land loss we have seen among Black farmers over the past century.\"", "There\u2019s been a sharp decline in the number of Black farmers in that period. In 1920, there were about 925,700 Black farmers; in 2017, there were slightly more than 45,500, a roughly 95% drop.

But Black farmers were \"systematically hindered\" from growing and modernizing their farms, he said.", "\"The result of institutional racism and lack of protections from authorities caused a higher percentage of Black farmers to lose their farms or be forced out,\" Rainey said.", "A 1965 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that Black farmers received inferior treatment from USDA agencies compared with white farmers. In the South, where most Black farmers operated, federally assisted state extension services were \"administered through a separate structure and generally on a discriminatory basis,\" the report said.", "It said that a large percentage of white farmers in the South, aided by federal loans and technical advice, diversified their crops and applied modern farming practices. That helped them raise their incomes, expand their farms, improve their housing and advance their education. But about a quarter of a million Black farmers \"stand as a glaring exception to this picture of progress.\"", "Among the issues raised in the report: Black farmers got smaller loans and far less guidance than white farmers in the same economic class.

Friedman said that for decades, the USDA and county commissioners responsible for handling loans had discriminated against Black farmers.", "\"Historical discrimination cannot be undone.
