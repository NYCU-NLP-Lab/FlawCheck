Phillips has made health care a focus of his campaign.", "The same claim is mentioned in a Congressional Leadership Fund ad, which aired only three days after the NRCC ad.", "Here is the text of the NRCC ad in full, before we break it down:", "\"Dean Phillips isn\u2019t telling you the whole truth.\"", "(Clip of Phillips\u00a0speaking) \"We do offer health care to full-time employees.\"", "\"FACT CHECK.

It does, however, pay workers $15 per hour plus tips, Phillips\u2019 campaign said.", "The company now has full-time workers, and all of them get access to company-provided health care.
