But what will happen to the citizens of West Bengal?\u201d To this, the woman responds, \u201cPeople from West Bengal will stay as they do and these people will also stay as they want to. How do you get the courage to ask such questions?\u201d The crowd begins to cheer for her. \u201cAllah is there. Allah is watching. Allah will protect them. I am here and my brothers and sisters will stay here,\u201d says the woman, adding that she will not tolerate Ram naam, Hari naam and communist chants.", "When questioned about the security of West Bengal citizens in case of terrorist infiltration, the woman answers that she will handle whatever happens to the people, then asks the purported cop to take away the reporter\u2019s license. \u201cI will not let Centre\u2019s conspiracy prevail,\u201d she says amidst the anchor\u2019s \u201cwaah Didi waah\u201d statements of condemnation. The woman further tells the people that she will give him Rs 2 per kg rice, Aadhaar card and cycles, among other things.", "The video is viral with two different captions. While the first one claims that the woman in the clip is TMC Ulluberia candidate Sajda Ahmed, the other one alleges that she is TMC politician Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar. While the Trinamool Congress does have politicians by those names, their facial features do not match those of the woman from the video.", "As evident from the photo montage below, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar looks contrastingly different from the woman in the video. A similar distinction cannot be made in case of Sajda Ahmed, however, there is a slight difference in the shape of her nose and that of the unidentified woman. Furthermore, their spectacle frames are different.", "As the entire conversation between the woman and the purported cop and reporter is in Bengali, social media users who do not know the language have little at their disposal. However, the one clue that can be picked up from the video is the reporter constantly addressing the woman as \u2018didi\u2019, a word commonly used for West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Furthermore, it is also unlikely that a police officer accedes to being shot on camera while acting at the behest of a politician as the cop in the video does. The whole spectacle seemed a little out of proportion.", "This video was earlier debunked by Boomlive and is actually a part of a street play. The woman dressed in a white saree played the role of CM Banerjee. A longer version of the video was found on YouTube and was uploaded in March last year. It drew over 1.4 million views.", "The actor who played the role of the reporter says at about 2:40 minutes, \u201cYou saw all the promises our honourable Chief Minister made to them. If this state\u2019s or the country\u2019s security is at risk due to Rohingya infiltration, who will take the responsibility?\u201d", "The man referred to the woman who was similarly dressed as Mamata Banerjee as \u2018honourable Chief Minister\u2019, which makes it clear that the people in the video were a part of a play.", "Since the start of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, West Bengal and the state\u2019s Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee have been a constant target of misinformation.", "Donate Now", "Pooja Chaudhuri is a senior editor at Alt News.", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
