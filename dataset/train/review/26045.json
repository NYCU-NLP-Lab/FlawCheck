They point to larger market forces that affect prices, including the relatively high worldwide supply of oil.

That is why, if the argument is that motorists will see a difference in purchase prices, it is highly dubious.\"", "Moreover, the world can currently produce much more oil than is needed to meet demand, so \"I am confident that the cancellation or delay of the Keystone pipeline would not have any impact on gasoline prices at the pump,\" Hakes said.", "Global demand for oil has been depressed over the past year by economic slowdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Economics professor Robert Godby, deputy director of the University of Wyoming's Center for Energy Regulation and Policy, said oil prices are set in world markets and \"we don\u2019t suffer from supply constraints in this country that raise the cost of oil.\"", "The Keystone XL \"could have alleviated some local and regional pipeline bottlenecks in the upper Midwest and northern Rocky Mountain region, but overall should not have been expected to lower oil or gasoline prices in the U.S.,\" he said.", "Keystone XL was not designed to supply the U.S. market, but to deliver oil from Canada mainly for export to foreign markets, said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen.
