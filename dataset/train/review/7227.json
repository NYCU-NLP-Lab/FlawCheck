["About this rating", "The final week of April 2017 saw an outburst of vitriol on Facebook and Twitter in reaction to comments allegedly tweeted by Chelsea Clinton defending the practice of female genital mutilation.", "The World Health Organization defines female genital mutilation (FGM) as \"all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\"", "\"Genital mutilation is a culturally loaded, racist term,\" Clinton supposedly wrote. \"The correct term is genital cutting, and has many health benefits.\"", "Here is a brief sampling of the kind of responses that appeared on Twitter:", "@ChelseaClinton is an Advocate for Female Genital Mutilation.

I never minced words in describing exactly what form of cutting was involved, and there are many gradations of severity, and the terrible damage it did, and stayed away from the euphemistic circumcision, but chose to use the less culturally loaded term, genital cutting. There's a gulf between the Western (and some African) advocates who campaign against the practice and the people who follow the rite, and I felt the language use widened that chasm.", "The editor, Celia Dugger, not only expressed a preference for the term \"genital cutting\" (as Chelsea Clinton supposedly did in the tweet), but defended her choice by characterizing it as a \"less culturally loaded term.\" In terms of timing, the fake Clinton tweet appeared only a few days after the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0editorial comment, a fact some partisans attempted to use to their advantage:", "Chelsea & the NY Times decides to sugar coat Female Genital Mutilation, is there nothing sacred to the PC Nut Jobs?! https://t.co/BOnQ5McZps pic.twitter.com/zaibFD62Um", "\u2014 JC Shannon (@BillClintonTHOF) April 28, 2017", "Despite such claims, all the outrage surrounding Clinton's alleged comments about FGM was (and remains) pointless, however.
