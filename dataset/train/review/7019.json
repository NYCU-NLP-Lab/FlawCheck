["About this rating", "A petition was published to Change.org, titled \"Adele Needs To Publicly Recognize Her White Privilege.\"", "That a meaningful number of people have espoused the idea.", "Who was responsible for the petition, and whether it was a race controversy hoax.", "On 7 December 2015 the web site\u00a0National Review published an article titled \"Petition Demands Adele Admit She\u2019s Successful Only Because She\u2019s White, and Insists She Give Away Her Money,\" asserting:", "A petition addressed to Adele, President Obama, and Billboard on Change.org demands that the singer admit that she has \"little talent\" and is succeeding mainly because of her white privilege ... The petitioners also \u201cdemand that Adele donates her money to African-American causes such as #Blacklivesmatter.\u201d", "The\u00a0National Review's article was concise, primarily including quotes from the petition in question. Not addressed by the piece was whether the petition represented a legitimate effort to elicit such an admission from Adele. \u00a0It also did not look into who might be responsible for the petition, or even whether any significant portion of Black Lives Matter activists (or people in general) had ever objected to the singer's \"white privilege.\" Neither did a range of other outlets that covered the petition, including\u00a0WND, The Inquisitr,\u00a0and\u00a0IJ Review.", "National Review author Katherine Timpf addressed the petition as definitively authentic, rather than a possible hoax, and wrote:", "Although Jones\u2019s petition had just 31 supporters at the time of publication, its very existence is ridiculous enough \u2014 and for so many reasons. After all, even if Adele did have a privileged upbringing and was a size 0 with D-cups, saying that she has just \u201ca little talent\u201d is objectively wrong. \u201cA little talent\u201d is the kind of phrase you use to describe someone who had the best voice in the high-school choir before going on to realize she needed to get a real job. Fan or not, anyone with ears and the ability to know what words mean would have to admit that Adele falls into a different category.", "What was true was that a petition titled \"Adele Needs To Publicly Recognize Her White Privilege\" was published to Change.org on 30 November 2015. The petition was credited to an individual named \"Rihanna Jones,\" who didn't return any hits in a Google search restricted to before 30 November 2015. Jones (or a\u00a0hoaxer using that name) wrote:", "Adele sold over 3.38 million copies of her album \"25\" and the media is praising her as if Adele's success has everything to do with talent. Rather, it's her white privilege that has put her on top.", "Adele's album has sold more than albums from Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, and Janet Jackson, although these three beautiful ladies all had much better albums that were talked about more. The fawning over Adele by fans and the press continue to show how minorities are repressed in the music business.", "We demand that Adele publicly acknowledge that although she has a little bit of talent, it's her white privilege that is selling her album. We also demand that Adele donates her money to African-American causes such as #Blacklivesmatter.", "A simple way to determine whether the petition was likely a hoax or joke would be to locate any extant complaints of that nature. On 30 November 2015, the web site RollingOut published an article titled \"Real talk on race: Adele\u2019s talent shouldn\u2019t blind anyone to her privilege\" (which appeared to be the sum of all examinations of Adele's privilege across the internet.) The article, which was created\u00a0on the same day as the petition, said:", "It doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you think Adele\u2019s music is brilliance or trash \u2014 she benefits from White privilege, regardless. She can be marketed to adult contemporary audiences who would\u2019ve never considered buying a Tamia or Deborah Cox album 20years ago. She can be marketed to angsty suburban youth who have never heard of Jazmine Sullivan, Elle Varner or Teedra Moses. If you put \u00a0White people in a set of circumstances and compare it to Black people in a similar set of circumstances, White people will generally have the advantage because White people won\u2019t have the extra hurdle of racism to overcome. That\u2019s the privilege. So if Michael Jackson could sell 25 million copies of Thriller, then I have to believe that a White artist with the same album, same videos and same fortuitous timing would\u2019ve sold even more. Because it\u2019s good to be great, but it\u2019s even better to be White.", "As such, it was true that a 30 November 2015 editorial piece suggested that Adele's success was partly possible due to the fact she was white. However, we were unable to locate any larger campaign to decry the singer's \"white privilege.\" Although multiple media outlets covered the Adele petition as legitimate, there didn't appear to be any movement behind it.", "Moreover, the \"Rihanna Jones\" to whom the petition was attributed appeared to not exist (a significant detail elided in coverage of the petition.) It's possible that the Change.org campaign was genuinely created by a person who believed Adele's white privilege enabled her success, but that opinion was neither popular nor espoused by many.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
