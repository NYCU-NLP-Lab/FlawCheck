This photograph was taken by Alex Brandon and is available via The Associated Press with the following caption:", "Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, center, smiles as he watches an opening day baseball game between the Washington Nationals and the New York Yankees at Nationals Park, Thursday, July 23, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)", "The above-displayed image was widely circulated on social media along with comments about how Fauci was setting a bad example or acting hypocritical by wearing a mask below his mouth and not social distancing, but the above-displayed picture may not be as \"damning\" as some are presenting it.", "The woman on Fauci's left is his wife, Christine Grady, and the man on Fauci's right is a \"close friend\" of the NIAID director. This man was also described in a photograph from USA Today as one of Fauci's \"guests\" at the event. In other words, the two other people in this photograph appear to be part of Fauci's inner circle, which may reduce the need for social distancing in this instance.", "It should also be noted that a water bottle can be seen directly in front of Fauci, and that the NIAID director and his guests are sitting outside. In many cities where restaurants and other businesses have reopened, people are allowed to remove their masks when they are eating or drinking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also notes that outdoor activities, such as attending a baseball game in an open-air stadium, is safer than indoor activities.", "The above-displayed photograph shows Fauci outdoors with his wife and a close friend while he was presumably drinking a bottle of water. Although wearing a mask at all times is certainly the safest option, it doesn't appear that Fauci was acting contradictory to the recommendations offered by himself, the NIAID, or the CDC.", "On July 24, Fauci was asked about this photograph during an interview on Fox News. Fauci said:", "The other person is a very close friend of mine. John, I think this is sort of mischievous with this thing going around. I had my mask around my chin, I had taken it down. I was totally dehydrated and I was drinking water trying to rehydrate myself. And by the way, I was negative Covid literally the day before.", "So I guess if people want to make a thing of that, I wear a mask all the time when I'm outside. To pull it down, to take some sips of water, and put it back up again, I guess if people want to make something about that, they can. But to me, I think that\u2019s just mischievous.", "Yahoo News. \u00a0 \"Does Fauci Wear a Mask When He Goes Running?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 12 June 2020.", "Lacques, Gabe. \u00a0 \"Dr. Anthony Fauci Throws First Pitch at Nationals-Yankees MLB Opener.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 USA Today. \u00a0 23 July 2020.", "Edelman, KJ. \u00a0 \"Fauci Slams Critics Attacking Him for Not Wearing Mask at Nationals Game: \u2018Just Mischievous\u2019 for People to Make This an Issue.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Mediate. \u00a0 24 June 2020.", "Wagner, James. \u00a0 \"Baseball\u2019s New Rules: No Spitting, No Arguing, And Lots of Testing.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. &bsp; 24 June 2020.", "Fottrell, Quentin. \u00a0 \"Fauci Tells MarketWatch: I Would Not Get on a Plane or Eat Inside a Restaurant.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 MarketWatch. \u00a0 24 July 2020.", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u00a0 \"Personal and Social Activities.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 23 July 2020.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
