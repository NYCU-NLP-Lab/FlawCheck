Twitter users were confused by Clinton's seemingly vast medical improvement in the space of two hours and referenced a widely-circulated clip of a visibly recovered of the presidential candidate:", "Here is Hillary Clinton leaving Chelsea's apartment.

Secret Service would never allow this unless it was staged. No spontaneous actions like this would happen. \u2014 Wylde Rhoads (@WyldeRhoads) September 11, 2016", "Among further evidence circulating on Twitter was a screenshot from a post attributed to Barnwell about a particularly intensive gig impersonating Clinton for an event:", "Here's #HillarysBodyDouble @teresa_barnwell claiming she was contracted to double for Hillary last June pic.twitter.com/SVO8SxrNWI \u2014 Deplorable (@JaredWyand) September 12, 2016", "The referenced post was legitimate, but it was clear that Barnwell had previously appeared as a political impressionist and not as part of any attempts to trick people into believing she was genuinely Hillary Clinton.", "Images circulating under the #HillarysBodyDouble hashtag contrasted earlier shots of Clinton with enhanced photographs of her second 11 September 2016 appearance:", "#HillarysBodyDouble Clinton's 'body double twin', Teresa Barnwell, 61, earns $1000's monthly impersonating Hillary pic.twitter.com/Wx36rO58aZ", "\u2014 A World of Truth (@aworldoftruth) September 12, 2016", "Rumors of #HillarysBodyDouble maybe True!

However, if that unprotected \"Hillary Clinton\" were seriously wounded or killed by an assassin, it would be impossible for the real Clinton to recover from the subterfuge and go on to win the 2016 election, so the risk of fallout from such a large cover-up would far outweigh the benefits of Clinton's faking a \"body double\" reappearance on 11 September 2016.", "It also doesn't require a denial from Teresa Barnwell to determine she was not the woman depicted in the 11 September 2016 footage of Clinton following her early exit from a 9/11 memorial event. Whether Clinton looked the same in the two photosets is a subjective assessment, but video and photographs of the subsequent appearance reveal a woman who is clearly not Teresa Barnwell. There is no way the two women could be confused for each other, given their clear facial dissimilarities.", "Kitching, Chris. \u00a0 \"Is This the Greatest Hillary Lookalike In the World?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Daily Mail. \u00a0 11 July 2016.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
