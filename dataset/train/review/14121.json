["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "In the months leading up to the gubernatorial primary, Chris Christie was busy flying off to various political events around the country, paying little attention to urban blight, soaring property taxes and double-digit unemployment plaguing some New Jersey neighborhoods.", "That\u2019s the suggestion of a new Internet ad released Tuesday by a group called ChristieNotForNJ.com. Buono, a Democratic state senator from Middlesex County, is running against Christie, a Republican, in November\u2019s governor\u2019s race.", "In the ad, Christie is seen campaigning with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney at a fundraiser in Iowa, followed by a shot of boarded up homes in a blighted neighborhood.", "\"Guess what, governor? There\u2019s no fried butter in Newark,\" Buono says in the ad, as a shot from the Iowa State Fair \u2013 where fried butter is a staple delicacy \u2013 plays in the back. \"Just 13 percent unemployment.\"", "We\u2019ll leave the butter assessment for the culinary crowd and look instead at the unemployment claim since New Jersey\u2019s had unusually high unemployment figures even after the recession ended in 2009. But 13 percent for the state\u2019s largest city? It turns out that Newark\u2019s unemployment rate since Christie\u2019s been governor has been quite a bit higher than Buono\u2019s estimate.", "Before looking at unemployment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, let\u2019s note that the data we reviewed was not seasonally adjusted. As a result, BLS spokeswoman Stacey Standish told us it\u2019s best to use the same month to compare data from different years.", "We decided to look at two time frames: February 2010 \u2013 Christie\u2019s first full month as governor \u2013 to February 2013, and May 2010 to May 2013, the last month for which BLS has unemployment data on Newark. Each time frame allows us to review three years of data. We also looked specifically at the unemployment rate.", "Standish confirmed that our methodology for determining Newark\u2019s unemployment rate was correct.", "First, the February comparisons.", "Newark\u2019s unemployment rate was 15.9 percent in February 2010 and 14.6 percent this past February. For the months in between, the jobless rate seesawed between 14.3 percent and nearly 16.5 percent.", "Now let\u2019s compare May unemployment rates in Newark for 2010 and 2013.", "The rate was 15.1 percent in May 2010. The preliminary rate for this past May is 13.7 percent.", "The only months where unemployment fell to 13 percent during Christie\u2019s entire tenure thus far was in April 2012 (13.8 percent), this past April \u00a0(13.2 percent) and May (13.7 percent), according to BLS data.", "Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner and Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts did not respond to our requests for comment.", "We also looked at unemployment rates in Camden and Trenton \u2013 other major New Jersey urban centers with large minority populations -- and found those rates were as high or higher.", "So why has Newark\u2019s unemployment rate been so high?", "The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has acknowledged previously to PolitiFact New Jersey that there\u2019s a high rate of unemployment for blacks. Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP\u2019s Washington bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy, noted in 2011 that initiatives such as education and more training and employment services could help improve those statistics.", "Our ruling", "Buono said in a new online ad about Christie\u2019s trips to other states, \"Guess what, governor? There\u2019s no fried butter in Newark. Just 13 percent unemployment.\"", "Data from the BLS shows that for almost all of Christie\u2019s tenure as governor, Newark\u2019s unemployment rate has been at least a full percentage point or two higher than what Buono\u2019s ad claims. There have only been three months in which the city\u2019s unemployment rate was in the 13 percent range: April 2012, April 2013 and a preliminary rate in that range for May.", "The point of Buono\u2019s claim is that Newark has had consistently high unemployment, whether during the few months it was in the 13 percent range or when it stagnated in the 15 percent range. We rate her claim True.", "To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "NJ.com, Buono ad highlights Christie\u2019s out-of-state travels, July 9, 2013", "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment database, accessed July 9, 10 and 11, 2013", "Phone interview with Stacey Standish, spokeswoman, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, July 10, 2013", "ChristieNotForNJ.com website, accessed July 10, 2013", "Buono for Governor website, accessed July 10, 2013", "PolitiFact New Jersey, New Jersey Tea Party blames Barack Obama for unemployment of 540,000 blacks since January 2009, Nov. 27, 2011, accessed July 10, 2013", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
