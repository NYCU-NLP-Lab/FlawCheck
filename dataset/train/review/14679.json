["A Twitter user, Ritesh Kumar, posted a collage of pictures featuring journalist Ravish Kumar and CPI\u2019s Begusarai candidate Kanhaiya Kumar at a roadshow. The message posted with the photo-montage is trying to make a claim according to which a man was set up to garland Kanhaiya in presence of Ravish Kumar. The tweet below has three pictures which claims to represent a sequence of events in which a worker [volunteer] was hiding a BJP cap that was later given to a man standing in front of Kumar. It further claimed that the man donned the BJP cap just before garlanding Kanhaiya Kumar. The post attempted to tarnish the credibility of the journalist by calling the entire episode \u201cpropaganda\u201d.", "\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0936 \u092c\u093e\u092c\u0942 \u092c\u0947\u0917\u0941\u0938\u0930\u093e\u092f \u0915\u0940 \u0927\u0930\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930 \u092d\u0940 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u091f\u0940\u092e \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u092e\u093f\u0932 \u0915\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u094b\u092a\u0917\u0902\u0921\u093e \u092b\u0948\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u091b\u094b\u0921\u093c\u0947\u0964 Pic 1 BJP \u0915\u0947 \u091f\u094b\u092a\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u091b\u0941\u092a\u093e \u0915\u0930 \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u0930\u0916\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u090f\u0915 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093e Pic 2 \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u0909\u0938 \u091f\u094b\u092a\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0915\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0948\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925\u0940 \u092a\u0939\u0928\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0942\u090f Pic 3 \u092c\u0940\u091c\u0947\u092a\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u091f\u094b\u092a\u0940 \u092a\u0939\u0928 \u0915\u0930 \u0915\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0948\u092f\u093e \u0915\u094b \u092e\u093e\u0932\u093e \u092a\u0939\u0928\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u0914\u0930 \u0930\u0935\u093f\u0936 \u092c\u093e\u092c\u0942 \u0930\u093f\u092a\u094b\u0930\u094d\u091f\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f pic.twitter.com/KIdZ8WQLa3", "\u2014 Ritesh kumar (@Minkkeybihari) April 12, 2019", "The sequence of images posted above was also converted into a meme and several individuals on Twitter and Facebook have shared this.", "#RavishKumarMC \u0938\u093e\u0939\u0947\u092c \u0906\u092a \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u091c\u093e\u0924 \u092c\u0947\u0936\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u092f\u093e \u092c\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u0915\u094b\u0908 \u0915\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0938 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948 ?#BloodyPrestituteTraitor pic.twitter.com/ep8yWRICzX", "\u2014 Bhaiyya ji [ Chowkidar ] (@shrialokmishra) April 12, 2019", "A Facebook user, Gandhar Agarwal, was among those who posted the meme with an identical narrative.
