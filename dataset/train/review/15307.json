He described the footage, voicing his distaste for the many participants who either shoved Nwanguma or failed to intervene:", "When I first saw the short 37-second news clip of this young girl being forcefully pushed and shoved by large grown men, my blood began to boil. In my lifetime, I have never seen grown men, many who at first appeared to be complete strangers, violently shove a young girl around like that. Some seem to just be pushing her for fun to the left and to the right, just because it's what other people were doing. While it all goes down, the hate for her is visible in the eyes not just of the adult men who repeatedly shove her, but in the surrounding women who look on. Nobody, not a single soul, offers to help protect her or escort her out in a way that is remotely safe.", "On 3 March 2016, King tweeted a follow-up editorial (also published by New York Daily News).\u00a0In that piece,, King linked to additional footage of the incident (during which Trump can be heard in the background speaking about \"when we were less politically correct\"):", "Things getting a little heated at the Trump rally pic.twitter.com/X974Ih3tZI \u2014 Carly Price (@CarlyPrice18) March 1, 2016", "King maintained that Pryor \"bragged\" about his role in the incident on Facebook (we were unable to find those particular postings) and wrote:", "On Wednesday afternoon, the United States Marine Corps quietly decided to discharge a young man named Joseph Pryor.

Hatred toward any group of individuals is not tolerated in the Marine Corps, and he is being discharged from our Delayed Entry Program.\"", "So while it was true the individual depicted was Joseph Pryor, Pryor was not yet a Marine.
