["In the weeks since the election, numerous false claims\u00a0have\u00a0cropped up about\u00a0Dominion Voting Systems, a company that sells electronic voting software\u00a0used to help conduct elections across the United States.", "Some users claimed that the company's machines deleted and switched votes cast for President Donald Trump. USA TODAY debunked that.", "Others\u00a0claimed links between the company and Democrats, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Diane\u00a0Feinstein. USA TODAY found those claims to be misleading, too.", "Smartmatic, another\u00a0company that makes electronic\u00a0voting software, has also been the subject of post-election misinformation \u2014 including false assertions that it owns or is owned by Dominion. (They have no relationship, and are actually competitors.)", "Now, users on Facebook have claimed that both Dominion and Smartmatic have shuttered, and their executives are \"on the run.\"", "\"Dominion and Smartmatic have closed up shop all around the WORLD and all exec's have gone on the run,\" the posts read. \"What does that tell you ???\"", "Charlie Regenfuss\u00a0\u2014\u00a0whose Nov. 21 post has been shared 1,800 times \u2014 said in a statement to USA TODAY that he \"called the company in Toronto they are out of business.\"", "\"I believe this to be true,\" he added. \"Therefore I shared it.\"", "(Dominion is headquartered in Toronto. The\u00a0phone number posted on its\u00a0website went to voicemail. There was no other indication\u00a0it is permanently closed.)", "In reality, neither Dominion nor Smartmatic has closed down in the wake of the election.", "Dominion addressed the claim in a statement on its website.", "\"Dominion is not shuttering its offices,\" it\u00a0reads. \"Employees have been encouraged to work remotely and protect their social media profiles due to persistent harassment and threats against personal safety.\"", "The company has also\u00a0continued\u00a0to aggressively fight misinformation. Michael Steel \u2014\u00a0a partner at\u00a0Hamilton Place Strategies, which is representing Dominion \u2014\u00a0staunchly defended its integrity in a nearly 10-minute interview on Fox News\u00a0on Sunday.", "Samira Saba, a spokesperson for Smartmatic, told USA TODAY that it has not shuttered, either.", "\"All our current projects are on track,\" she wrote in an emailed statement. \"All our executives, management team and employees continue to work hard to deliver them.\"", "In a statement, Smartmatic also noted\u00a0that two of its founders,\u00a0Antonio Mugica and Roger Pi\u00f1ate, \"continue to run the company as CEO and President, respectively.\"", "Based on our research, the claim that\u00a0Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic have closed and their executives are on the run is FALSE. Neither Dominion nor Smartmatic has closed in the aftermath of the election and their CEOs are not \"on the run.\"", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
