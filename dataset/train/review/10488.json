Bush was president, but Democrats still plan to run against him. Certainly, that\u2019s what Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz promised on the eve of the first Democratic presidential debate.", "\"There are so many people who are focused on making sure we can look at the fact that, when we had a conservative Republican president, we were losing 750,000 jobs a month,\" Wasserman Schultz said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union Oct. 11, 2015. \"We\u2019ve come through that -- 67 straight months of job growth in the private sector. People are no longer losing their homes. That\u2019s the contrast we\u2019ll talk about.\"", "The DNC press office told us that Wasserman Schultz was thinking of President George W. Bush, and that the time period she had in mind were the last few months of his presidency, November through January. President Barack Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009, so it\u2019s reasonable to count that month as part of the Bush legacy.", "We pulled up the Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers and Wasserman Schultz is on solid ground.", "Month", "Jobs (000\u2019s)", "Loss", "Nov", "135,469", "-765", "Dec", "134,773", "-696", "Jan", "133,977", "-796", "Average", "-752", "Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics Benchmark comparison", "The number is particularly high because Wasserman Schultz chose the three worst months of the Bush presidency. If she had chosen a longer period, say the last full year, the losses would have averaged about 365,000 per month. The losses would shrink even more if you look at longer period of time.", "Wasserman Schultz didn\u2019t mention that the economy continued to shed jobs\u00a0at or above the 700,000 mark for the first two months of Obama\u2019s presidency before the trend\u00a0began to ease. This chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u00a0gives a more complete jobs picture.", "The Great Recession saw employment declines of historic proportions. Government analysts compared the relative losses from 2007 to 2009 to past downturns. The bottom purple line on their chart tracks jobs in the Great Recession which officially began December 2007.", "Of course, Wasserman Schultz\u2019s statement implies that conservative Republican policies alone brought about a massive loss of jobs and the reality is more complicated. Some analysts believe that a portion of the blame goes back to policies that enjoyed Democratic support, including changes in financial regulation passed during the Clinton administration. But Wasserman Schultz did not make that claim specifically.", "Our ruling", "Wasserman Schultz said that under a conservative Republican president the country was losing 750,000 jobs a month. Wasserman Schultz was speaking of President George W. Bush and at the end of his term, the monthly job losses averaged about 750,000 jobs.", "The average would of course be less if she had included Bush\u2019s final 12 months -- or a period longer than that. There is an element of cherry-picking here, but the overall point holds up.", "We rate the claim Mostly True.", "CNN, State of the Union, Oct. 11, 2015", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, Comparison of All Employees, seasonally adjusted", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, Payroll employment in 2009: job losses continue, March 2010", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, The Recession of 2007\u20132009, February 2012", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Survey data", "PolitiFact, Debbie Wasserman Schultz says Obama has created \"millions\" of manufacturing jobs,Nov. 15, 2011", "Email interview, Miryam Lipper, spokeswoman, Democratic National Committee", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
