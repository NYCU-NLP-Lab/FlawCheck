["When it comes to illegal campaign cash, the wheels of justice move slowly. So when a May 2011 court filing brought fresh attention to old claims involving illegal campaign contributions to U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, Democrats jumped, airing\u00a0a radio ad\u00a0in his Florida district.", "\"Congressman Vern Buchanan. His old business was caught illegally funneling over $60,000 in campaign donations to Buchanan to influence his election,\" the narrator of the ad says. \"Tell Buchanan to come clean.\"\n\nThe ad ran from June 13-17 and was paid for by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. It relied on\u00a0news articles\u00a0about\u00a0a lawsuit filed\u00a0by the\u00a0Federal Election Commission\u00a0against a business Buchanan once owned, the DCCC said.\n\nThe 'old business'", "Buchanan, 60, is a\u00a0wealthy Republican\u00a0from Longboat Key serving his third term in Congress representing Florida's\u00a013th Congressional District. He built his wealth founding a chain of print shop franchises in Michigan, leaving for Florida in the 1980s\u00a0as the chain struggled\u00a0and investing in a range of new businesses, including Florida auto dealerships.\n\nOne of those dealerships is at the heart of this claim.\n\nBuchanan had owned a majority interest in Hyundai of North Jacksonville,\u00a0the FEC says, when his business partner Sam Kazran arranged for dealership employees and relatives to donate to the Vern Buchanan for Congress committee, then be reimbursed by the business. This went on during the 2006 and 2008 campaigns, the FEC says.\n\n(We should note that the date Buchanan legally parted ways with the dealership is a matter of disagreement.\u00a0The FEC says\u00a0Buchanan owned 51 percent of the dealership until Kazran completed his purchase of Buchanan's stake to become the sole owner in 2008 \u2014 after the suspect contributions were made. Buchanan spokeswoman Sally Tibbetts says Buchanan sold the dealership to Kazran in 2005, putting more distance between the congressman and the illegal contributions.)\n\nWhat's the big deal with reimbursing contributions? It violates federal election law, which says \"(n)o person shall make a contribution in the name of another person.\" The Federal Election Campaign Act also limits how much a single contributor may give to candidates' campaign committees. Funneling cash through employees would have made it possible for the dealership to bust through that limit.\n\nThe Buchanan campaign said they brought the questionable contributions to the attention of the FEC, which then launched the investigation. We can't independently confirm if that's the case, because the FEC does not comment on open cases. However, we found no evidence to the contrary.", "The commission combined the complaint with\u00a0one filed in 2008 by a Washington group\u00a0and two employees of a Venice dealership, which you can read more about here.", "The FEC investigated,\u00a0finding probable cause\u00a0to believe that the Hyundai dealership and Kazran had illegally reimbursed $67,900 in campaign contributions, but it didn't go after Buchanan.\n\nInstead, it's now seeking $67,900 in fines from Kazran.\n\nKazran, for his part,\u00a0admits reimbursing\u00a0campaign contributions, but told the\u00a0Bradenton Herald\u00a0he did it at Buchanan's direction. \"I've been caught in this political nightmare that I have nothing to do with,\" he told PolitiFact Florida. But he failed to reach an agreement with the Federal Election Commission \u2014 and\u00a0failed to respond to the complaint\u00a0on behalf of Hyundai North Jacksonville, which is no longer in business. That means facts in the case stand uncontested. So the commission voted to sue him to collect the fines, asking a judge for a default judgement.\n\nThe FEC told the U.S. District Court that the dealership \"illegally spent $67,900 in an attempt to influence an election for Congress, presumably believing this to be a worthwhile investment.\"", "And that's the May suit that prompted stories in a\u00a0WSJ.com blog, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune\u00a0and the\u00a0Bradenton Herald\u00a0that the DCCC cited as it released the script for its Florida radio ad. Jesse Ferguson, speaking on behalf of the committee, the\u00a0official campaign arm\u00a0of the Democrats in the U.S. House, used partial quotes from the lawsuit when he said, \"The FEC is seeking fines from a business that Vern Buchanan owned at the time for an 'extensive and ongoing scheme' of 'secret illegal contributions' to help his campaign and we\u2019re going to make sure his constituents know about it.\"\n\nBuchanan's response\n\nWhat does Buchanan's team say? That the FEC has cleared Buchanan himself \u2014 so the ad linking the behavior of Kazran and his dealership to the congressman is \"misleading and dishonest.\"\n\n\"It creates the false impression that Vern Buchanan has done something wrong when in fact he has been fully exonerated by the FEC,\" said Sally Tibbetts, his spokeswoman.\n\nA\u00a0related news release\u00a0that says Buchanan \"has been completely exonerated\" is the subject of its own fact-check, and we found the claim to be Barely True. But we'll summarize here by saying that what little information is available so far from the FEC doesn't fully clear Buchanan \u2014 though it does mean the commission won't take any further action against him in the case.\n\nInformation's limited because the case isn't yet closed, so\u00a0confidentiality rules\u00a0apply.\n\nThat means for the purposes of this fact-check, we'll rely on what's in the public record \u2014 information that the DCCC had access to when it scripted its ad.\n\nThe ruling\n\nThat ad starts by naming the congressman, then says his \"old business was caught illegally funneling over $60,000 in campaign donations to Buchanan to influence his election.\"\u00a0\n\nThe FEC and Buchanan's team agree that he owned a significant stake until at least 2005, when suspect campaign contributions started. The FEC says the dealership reimbursed more than $60,000 in contributions. The money went to Buchanan's main campaign committee, and the FEC says the money was spent \"in an attempt to influence an election for Congress.\"\n\nWhat is contested is Buchanan's role in the scheme.\n\nThe FEC has said it will take no further action against him, closing his file. But it didn't go further to declare it had no probable cause to believe he was involved \u2014 which would have better supported his team's claim that he's been cleared. Meanwhile, his former business partner still says Buchanan put him up to it, and says he plans another lawsuit to prove it.\n\nWhile we think the DCCC could have done a better job noting it was Buchanan who turned in the illegal contributions, we rate this ad Mostly True.", "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,\u00a0New DCCC Ad Holds Representative Vern Buchanan Accountable For Campaign Finance Scheme, June 13, 2011", "Federal Election Commission,\u00a0Motion for Default Judgment, May 27, 2011", "Federal Election Commission,\u00a0Ongoing Litigation: FEC v.
