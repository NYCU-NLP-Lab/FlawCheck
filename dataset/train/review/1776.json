This advice has not been issued by us to our staff and the content is not official NHS advice.\u201d", "Many of the claims in the purported guidelines are false or lacking evidence. Below are some that have previously been\u00a0debunked by AFP Fact Check.", "1. Holding your breath is not an effective test for COVID-19", "Claim: \u201cExperts suggest doing this simple verification every morning: Breathe in deeply and hold your breath for 10 seconds. If this can be done without coughing, without difficulty, this shows that there is no fibrosis in the lungs, indicating the absence of infection. It is recommended to do this control every morning to help detect infection.\u201d", "The World Health Organization stated that holding your breath for more than 10 seconds is not an effective test for the novel coronavirus.", "2. No evidence that the virus \u2018dies\u2019 under heat", "Claim: \u201cThe virus hates heat and dies if it is exposed to temperatures greater than 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C).\u201d", "Research on the resilience of the novel coronavirus is still underway. The US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated here that it is \u201cnot yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19\u201d.", "3. Drinking hot water or cold water? It doesn\u2019t matter", "Claim: \u201cTherefore hot drinks such as infusions, broths or simply hot water should be consumed abundantly during the day. These hot liquids kill the virus and are easy to ingest. Avoid drinking ice water or drinks with ice cubes.\u201d", "Brandon Brown, a professor at the University of California Riverside\u2019s Center for Healthy Communities, previously told AFP\u00a0\u201cthere is no need to change the temperature of your drinking water\u201d and that \u201cdrinking water is always important, not just for coronavirus prevention.\u201d", "4. Drinking water every 15 minutes does not prevent coronavirus", "Claim: \u201cEnsure that your mouth and throat are always wet, never DRY. You should drink a sip of water at least every 15 minutes.\u201d", "Health experts say drinking water every 15 minutes does not prevent coronavirus infection.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
