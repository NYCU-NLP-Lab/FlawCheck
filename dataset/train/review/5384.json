However, this chilling scene did not originate with a photograph taken during the Holocaust.", "This picture is a de-colorized version of a promotional image for the 2011 film Auschwitz, directed by Uwe Boll:", "A version of Boll's Auschwitz exists on YouTube, and the scene which this image represents (i.e., the cold-blooded murder of a crying child) can be glimpsed around the 28:58 mark:", "NSFW warning: Video contains nudity and violence", "https://youtu.be/utPM2YLUVxo\n\nAlthough this viral Facebook message employed an image from a film and not a real-life photograph, the visual reference to the killing of children by Nazis is unfortunately and undeniably true.

It would devour the dearest of us, those who arouse the greatest compassion\u2014our innocent children.\u201d", "In the ghettos, Jewish children died from starvation, exposure, and a lack of adequate clothing and shelter. The German authorities were indifferent to this mass death. They considered most of the younger ghetto children to be unproductive and hence \u201cuseless eaters.\u201d Because children were generally too young to be used for forced labor, German authorities generally selected them, the elderly, ill, and disabled, for the first deportations to killing centers, or as the first victims led to mass graves to be shot.", "The documented camps include not only \"killing centers\" but also thousands of forced labor camps, where prisoners manufactured war supplies; prisoners-of-war camps; sites euphemistically named \"care\" centers, where pregnant women were forced to have abortions or their babies were killed after birth; brothels, where women were coerced into having sex with German military personnel.", "Lichtblau, Eric. \u00a0 \"The Holocaust Just Got More Shocking.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 1 March 2013.", "United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. \u00a0 \"Life in the Shadows: Hidden Children and the Holocaust.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 28 August 2003.", "United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. \u00a0 \"Children During the Holocaust.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Retrieved 3 October 2018.", "United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. \u00a0 \"Documenting Numbers of Victims of the Holocaust and Nazi Persecution.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Retrieved 3 October 2018.", "Ecarma, Caleb. \u00a0 \"I Was at the Sad White Supremacists Gathering.
