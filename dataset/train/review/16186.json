About three weeks later, an Austin American-Statesman news story described Cole and another mayoral aspirant, Council Member Mike Martinez, as supporters of a proposal by Council Member Kathie Tovo to create a $5,000 homestead exemption, reducing the city tax bill of a median-valued home by $24.", "So, is Cole right about the council granting the described exemptions?", "A council resolution", "According to the Statesman news story posted online Aug. 26, 2014, Tovo\u2019s proposed $5,000 exemption would apply to about 130,000 owner-occupied homes. Later the same week, the council approved a resolution, which we read on the city\u2019s website, directing the city manager to return to the council no later than Dec. 1, 2014, with a percentage-based proposal resulting in a $5,000 a year exemption for each residential homeowner. The resolution noted, too, that under state law, if a city grants such an exemption, it must be for at least $5,000. The resolution also said the exemption would cost the city $3.1 million a year in forgone revenue.", "A city spokeswoman, Melissa Alvarado, told us by email city staff are preparing the ordinance to bring before the council for approval. Asked if the exemption could possibly apply to property taxes due for 2014, Alvarado indicated not, noting that state law requires such an exemption to be adopted by a governing body before July of the first affected tax year. Alvarado said: \"The $5,000 exemption, if adopted, would first affect property tax bills associated with FY 2015-16 (i.e. property tax bills due in January of 2016).\"", "Expanded exemption", "The council acted earlier in 2014 to increase an exemption benefiting elderly and disabled homeowners.", "On March 20, 2014, according to an American-Statesman news story, the council by 5-2 voted to raise the property tax exemption for homeowners older than 65 or disabled, from $51,000 to $70,000 -- saving the typical elderly homeowner about $100 a year starting with the 2014 tax year.", "The city\u2019s tax exemption for senior or disabled homeowners was established, at $3,000, in 1974, the story said, and had been last increased, to $51,000, in 1986.

But Opp maintained the August resolution calling for city officials to draft an ordinance for the $5,000 exemption was tantamount to adopting the exemption. Cole \"took action on the Council this year, and it will go into effect at the earliest possible date for the next property tax bill,\" Opp wrote.", "Our ruling", "Cole, speaking of the Austin City Council, said this year, \"we granted a small homestead exemption of $5,000... applied equally to everyone.

That is, a $5,000 homestead exemption might be adopted by the council later this year or in 2015, but it hasn\u2019t been granted or applied to anyone already.
