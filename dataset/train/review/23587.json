["About this rating", "A video supposedly showing a clip from the 1960s show \"The Munsters\" in which Herman Munster, the Frankenstein-esque patriarch of the family, imparts a life lesson about how a person's character matters more than a person's appearance, has been widely circulated on social media:", "This is a genuine clip (apart from the music) from \"The Munsters.\" This clip comes from an episode entitled \"Eddie's Nickname,\" which aired during the show's first season in 1965.", "In the clip, Herman Munster says: \"The lesson I want you to learn is it doesn't matter what you look like. You can be tall or short or fat or thin or ugly or handsome, like your father, or you can be black or yellow or white -- it doesn't matter -- what does matter is the size of your heart and the strength of your character.\"", "Sources: The Odyssey Online / IMDB / Twitter", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
