["About this rating", "In the days following a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump on Jan. 6, 2021, Snopes readers asked for verification of online rumors that an unspecified Apple software update would remove the emergency alert system on iPhones.", "This is a false rumor that appears to have originated with Lin Wood, an attorney and Trump ally with a track record of making false and incendiary statements.", "Wood rose to prominence by making inflammatory and false public statements.
