We examine five claims made in the debate, covering gender-based violence, education, renewable energy, the economy and municipal functionality.", "A claim about a drop in gender-based violence during Covid-19 lockdown was unproven. A claim that half of grade 1 pupils will never write matric was incorrect.", "The two correct claims covered renewable energy procurement and economic recession before the coronavirus outbreak. A claim that most municipalities were dysfunctional was misleading.", "\u201cPlease keep your masks on and sit in your designated area,\u201d Amos Masondo, chairperson of South Africa\u2019s national council of provinces, told the scattered group of parliamentarians gathered for the annual debate on the state of the nation address, known as Sona.", "President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s 2021 Sona speech was held on 11 February 2021, an event Covid-19 regulations stripped of its usual fanfare. In the debate that started five days later, government ministers and members of parliament lowered their masks to praise and criticise the president, his government and the state of the country.", "This fact-check examines five claims made in the debate.

The claim was made by Hlengiwe Mkhize, the presidency\u2019s deputy minister for women, youth and persons with disabilities, who suggested that the decrease in this violence was due to South Africa\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown.", "Africa Check has contacted Mkhize\u2019s office to find out what period she was referring to and what data set was used to support the statistic. Despite numerous requests, we have not received a response.", "The South African Police Service (SAPS) has previously told Africa Check that they consider all contact crime against women \u2013 including murder, rape and physical abuse \u2013 to be gender-based violence.", "Without confirmation from Mkhize about the time frame she was referring to it is difficult to verify the claim.", "The police\u2019s latest crime statistics reveal that 171,070 contact crimes against women were reported between 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. But this includes just three months of 2020 and five days of the country\u2019s hard Covid-19 lockdown, which started at midnight on 26 March 2020. The crime statistics for 2020/21 will be released later this year.", "The police recently started releasing crime statistics per quarter: April to June, July to September, October to December and January to March. But while the annual crime statistics provide a breakdown of crimes against women, the quarterly reports do not.", "Despite this, the quarterly report for the April to June 2020 indicates a significant decrease in reports of sexual offences (against all sexes) compared to the previous period. This period coincided with level 5 and level 4 of lockdown.", "It shows that sexual offences \u2013 a broad category including a number of crimes \u2013 decreased by 39.7% compared to the same three-month period in 2019.", "Rape decreased by 40.4%, sexual assault by 35.9%, attempted sexual assault by 40.3% and contact sexual crimes by 36.2%. There were also significant decreases in reported crimes across the board, including murder, common robbery and carjacking.", "Other statistics, released by police minister Bheki Cele for the first month of hard lockdown (27 March to 22 April 2020), showed more dramatic decreases in crime. Rape decreased by 87.2%, murder by 72%, and domestic violence by 69.4% compared to the same period in 2019.", "Based on a lack of data supporting or refuting the claim, we rate it unproven.", "It is not clear what period Mkhize was referring to or what statistic she was citing. But Chandre Gould, a senior research fellow for the justice and violence prevention programme at the Institute of Security Studies Africa, told Africa Check that using reported incidences as an indicator of a real decrease in gender-based violence was not recommended.", "In an article for the institute, she wrote that despite fears that gender-based violence would increase in South Africa during the hard lockdown, some rape reporting centres said calls had decreased by as much as 50%.", "She said the ban on alcohol may have contributed to this decrease as it may have \u201creduced the severity of domestic violence cases and the opportunity for rape (outside of the home)\u201d.", "Women may have found it much more difficult to report domestic violence during this period because they could not get to a police station or make private calls away from their partner.", "\u201cI think the important point is that we are talking about reported cases, so the actual violence may not have decreased,\u201d she told Africa Check.", "\u201c50% of grade 1 pupils will never write a matric examination.\u201d", "South Africa\u2019s 2020 matrics \u2013 final-year high school students \u2013 achieved a 76.5% pass rate.

When Africa Check asked him for the source of the claim, he sent us an official party statement that calculated a \u201creal\u201d pass rate for public schools. This pegged the rate at 41% by comparing the number of students enrolled in grade 1 in 2009 to the number of students who passed the matric exams in 2020.", "According to data from the Department of Basic Education, 1,071,905 students were in grade 1 in 2009. Twelve years later, in 2020, 578,468 matric students wrote the school-leaving exams.", "A basic assessment of these figures (which experts don\u2019t recommend \u2013 see below) does not support Nodada\u2019s claim. It suggests that 53.97% of grade 1 students went on to write the final exam. (Note: This is based on public school data. Private school students write a separate set of final exams under the Independent Education Board.)", "But Martin Gustafsson, a researcher with the department of economics at Stellenbosch University, advises against this type of calculation.", "He told Africa Check that high repetition in schools meant it was inappropriate to compare the number of students in grade 1 with the number of matric students who subsequently wrote (or passed) the final exams 12 years later.", "\u201cMy warning would always be please don\u2019t compare grade 1 to grade 12 because grade 1 has lots of repeaters,\u201d Gustafsson explained. \u201cSo you\u2019re double-counting people.\u201d", "Statistics published in 2020 by the department of basic education indicate that 15% of grade one students repeat and 10% of grade 2 and grade 3 students repeat.", "\u201cRepetition is like the fly in the soup.
