["On September 10, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Sambit Patra tweeted a video clip from Aaj Tak\u2019s debate show Dangal.

The debate was held a day after Birhanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolished parts of her Pali Hill office in Mumbai amid a public row with Maharastra\u2019s ruling party Shiv Sena, which also controls the corporation. The Bombay High Court has stayed the demolition of what the BMC alleges to be unauthorised structures.", "Responding to Shrivastava\u2019s question on security provided to the actor, Patra said, \u201cWhen Kasab was fed biriyani from their money, he never for one day said that he \u2013 Kasab \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be fed biriyani from my money\u201d.", "\u0930\u0935\u093f \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0935 : \u0915\u0902\u0917\u0928\u093e \u0915\u094b security \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0926\u094b \u0917\u092f\u0940? \u092e\u0947\u0930\u093e \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930 : \u091c\u092c \u0905\u091c\u092e\u0932 \u0915\u0938\u093e\u092c \u0915\u094b \u0906\u092a\u0915\u0947 \u092a\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u093f\u0930\u092f\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0926\u094b \u091c\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0925\u0940 \u0924\u092c \u0906\u092a\u0915\u094b \u0915\u094b\u0908 \u0926\u093f\u0915\u093c\u094d\u0915\u093c\u0924 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0925\u0940\u0964 pic.twitter.com/OuqGuzfOJS", "\u2014 Sambit Patra (@sambitswaraj) September 10, 2020", "This fabricated story was cited in the past by the top brass of the BJP, Home Minister Amit Shah, who was then the party president.

During the trial, Nikam, who had argued on behalf of the state, had manufactured a story about Ajmal Kasab being fed biryani in jail to counter an emotional wave supposedly being created in Kasab\u2019s favour. \u201cKasab neither asked for biryani nor it was served by the government.
