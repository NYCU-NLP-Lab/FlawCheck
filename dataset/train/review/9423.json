More government spending did not solve Japan's 'lost decade' in the 1990s. As such, it is a triumph of hope over experience to believe that more government spending will help the U.S. today,\" the ad says. \"Lower tax rates and a reduction in the burden of government are the best ways of using fiscal policy to boost growth.\"", "The Cato ad has 203 signatories, including three recent Nobel Prize winners.", "We talked to one of the Nobel winners, Edward Prescott of Arizona State University, who won in 2004, about Obama's plan.", "\"I agree with his wants, but just because you want something, that doesn't make it happen,\" Prescott said. \"I guess he thinks that everything can be solved by people's goodwill and good actions coming from Washington, D.C.\"", "Prescott advocates for a permanent reductions of the income tax or, failing that, nothing.", "\"I hope Obama succeeds, but benign neglect is a good policy,\" he said.", "Before we go much further, we should point out that there are many economists who  do  believe a stimulus is needed, and yesterday.

But for those who are interested in how economists deal with facts, we would point you to the very interesting blog and podcasts of  economist Russell Roberts  of George Mason University.
