So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine.\u201d", "The caption of the Instagram post states: \u201cALL THOSE BLOCKING INFORMATION ON HCQ ARE COMMITTING GENOCIDE INCLUDING FAUCI, DAN ANDREWS AND THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.\u201d", "Dr. Anthony Fauci has been the director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) under the US Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 1984.", "Chloroquine (CQ) is a malaria and amebiasis drug. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a less toxic metabolite of chloroquine, is used to treat rheumatic diseases, according to this 2020 study.", "The claims were also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here; on Twitter here, here, here and here; and on various websites here and here.", "The claims, however, are false.", "2005 study", "The study cited in the misleading post is\u00a0this 2005 paper titled \u201cChloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread\u201d. It was published following the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an infectious disease caused by a SARS-associated coronavirus, known as\u00a0SARS-CoV.", "The paper states in part: \u201cChloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection. In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds.\u201d", "The study adds that all experiments were conducted \u201cextracellularly\u201d -- in a controlled environment outside of a living organism, and not on humans or other animals.", "In response to the misleading posts,\u00a0Dr. Eric Bergeron of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who co-wrote the 2005 paper, said: \"This is totally absurd.\"", "\u201cThis paper only shows that chloroquine works in cell culture experiments, later studies in mice suggested that chloroquine was not effective against SARS-CoV,\" he said\u00a0in an\u00a0email on August 5.", "\u201cOur results published suggested that chloroquine should be considered in human trials but trials demonstrated that it is ineffective against SARS-CoV-2\u00a0(which causes COVID-19). This is very common, many drugs show efficacy in cell culture but no clinical benefit. This is what people should care about: no clinical benefit. We treated cells in culture not humans.\u201d", "Fauci claim", "The 2005 paper was published in the Virology Journal, an \u201copen access, peer reviewed journal that considers articles on all aspects of virology, including research on the viruses of animals, plants and microbes,\u201d according to information on its website here.", "The Journal belongs to the UK for-profit science publisher BioMed Central Company, which is a part of the British-German academic publishing company Springer Nature. It is not associated with Dr. Fauci or the NIH as stated in the misleading claim.", "A spokesperson for\u00a0NIAID told AFP in an email dated August 5: \u201cDr. Fauci has previously stated that there is a lack of good evidence from randomized placebo-controlled trials to indicate that hydroxychloroquine is an effective therapeutic for COVID-19. The 2005 paper you are referring to was a cell-culture experiment with a different virus than SARS-CoV-2, and the study was conducted by CDC investigators. Virology Journal is published by BMC, part of Springer-Nature.\u201d", "Fauci has become a target of COVID-19 misinformation as the novel coronavirus\u00a0continues to spread globally, AFP reported here.", "'No cure'", "In the wake of the COVID-19\u00a0pandemic, the debate over hydroxychloroquine has become politically charged. Leaders including US President Donald\u00a0Trump and some fellow US conservatives have voiced strong support for the drug as a treatment for the novel coronavirus, AFP reported here.", "As of August 7, 2020, the WHO states\u00a0on its website that \u201cthere is currently no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID-19\u201d and that \u201cthe misuse of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness and even lead to death.\u201d It also ruled out the use of HCQ a treatment for hospitalised COVID-19 patients since \u201chydroxychloroquine does not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care,\u201d according to this June 17 announcement.", "Similarly on June 15, the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) to use HCQ and CQ to treat COVID-19. \u201cWe made this determination based on recent results from a large, randomized clinical trial in hospitalized patients that found these medicines showed no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery,\u201d the FDA states here.", "AFP previously debunked false claims that HCQ can cure COVID-19 here and here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
