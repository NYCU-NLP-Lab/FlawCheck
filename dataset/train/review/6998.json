Right now, federal background checks are only required for sales through licensed gun dealers.", "Here\u2019s how background checks work.", "The FBI maintains the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.", "When you buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer, you fill out a form with personally identifying information. The dealer uses the NICS to match that information with various records to make sure you\u2019re not, for example, a felon who\u2019s not allowed to own a weapon. It\u2019s a computerized process that\u2019s only supposed to take about 30 seconds, but in the case of an unclear match, can take up to three days.", "If you\u2019re cleared to purchase a gun, the government is required to destroy all identifying information about you before the next business day. Instead, the dealer is required to store the form.", "That\u2019s right: Federal law requires destruction of records and bans creation of a federal gun registry.", "Does S. 649, sponsored by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., change that?", "Several attorneys we spoke to said no, it didn\u2019t \u2014 it leaves those provisions in place. More people would be subject to background checks, but a federal database of that information would remain as illegal as ever.", "But Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, says the language of the bill leaves a door open for a new kind of record of sales between private sellers \u2014 as opposed to sales by federally licensed gun dealers \u2014 a record that may not be subject to the registry ban.", "\"We have a real fear with this particular legislative language that this would result in new records being created,\" he said.", "He points to a legal phrase in the bill \u2014 \"notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter\" \u2014 as perhaps allowing creation and, later, collection of those records, even though existing law rules out \"a system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions.\"", "So, even if there\u2019s no intent to create such a loophole in the registry ban, the law doesn\u2019t explicitly rule it out, he argues.", "Call it the possibility of a partial registry.", "\"I don't think it's a crazy idea to say that if the records exist, there would be a push to use them for other things,\" \u00a0Calabrese said.", "He contrasts the bill\u2019s vague language with an amendment proposed by Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that would explicitly bar any such registry and adds the possibility of up to 15 years in prison for violators.", "But even if the federal government created a new type of record for gun sales between private sellers \u2014 and tracked them \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t be \"universal registration of all firearms and their owners,\" as suggested by the Arizona group\u2019s email message.", "\"There are at least 300 million guns in private ownership in America today, and I am not aware of any provision of S. 649 that would require the registration of those guns or assist the federal government in determining precisely who owns them,\" said Clark Neily, who was co-counsel to Dick Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller.", "(Still, he said, mentioning the ACLU\u2019s worry, the Arizona email \"touches upon a genuine concern.\")", "So what does the Arizona Citizens Defense League say about its claim that the bill \"is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners\"?", "Essentially, that the government will violate its own rules against keeping background check records.", "\"This is where background knowledge of the issue is so important, and goes WAY beyond what is written in statute,\" said Charles Heller, a radio host and spokesperson for the Arizona Citizens Defense League.
