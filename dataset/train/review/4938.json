["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on August 16, 2019", "A viral meme on Facebook falsely claims that members of Congress have received a \u201c231%\u201d increase in pay in the last 30 years. Automatic cost-of-living adjustments have resulted in an increase of 94.4% from 1989 to 2009.", "Members of Congress haven\u2019t received a salary increase in a decade.", "Prior to that, congressional salaries climbed nearly 95% from 1989 to 2009, as a result of an annual adjustment formula based on economic factors, according to a May report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.", "It is not the case that salaries \u201chave gone up 231%\u201d in the \u201cpast 30 years,\u201d as a Facebook meme shared by tens of thousands of users claims.", "In 1989, according to the CRS, most representatives and senators collected a salary of $89,500. Today, members of Congress \u2014 with the exception of congressional leaders \u2014 make $174,000. That\u2019s a 94.4% increase.", "Again, that change is decided by an automatic adjustment formula that was established by a 1989 law, which we\u2019ve written about before. The adjustment formula is \u201cbased on changes in private sector wages and salaries as measured by the Employment Cost Index,\u201d the CRS report\u00a0notes.", "The percentage increase cannot surpass that for \u201cGeneral Schedule\u201d federal employees, and the adjustment automatically goes into effect unless Congress statutorily denies\u00a0it. Congress has done just that every year since 2009, therefore freezing their salaries.", "Accordingly, the CRS report says, \u201c[m]ember salaries, when adjusted for inflation, decreased 15% from 2009 until 2019.\u201d", "The meme also asserts that \u201c[n]ow Congress is saying they need a $4,500 raise.\u201d As we\u2019ve previously reported,\u00a0legislators were\u00a0considering\u00a0allowing the automatic pay raise \u2014 of 2.6%, or $4,500 \u2014 to go into effect for 2020 as scheduled.\u00a0House Democratic leaders postponed any action on that in June. Congress is currently on recess until after Labor Day.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
