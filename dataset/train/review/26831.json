["About this rating", "On July 17, 2020, the Associated Press reported that the Pentagon had banned display of the Confederate flag on U.S. military installations in such a way as to \"avoid the wrath\" of President Trump, who had repeatedly defended retaining monuments and institutions named in honor of Confederate figures:", "After weeks of wrangling, the Pentagon is banning displays of the Confederate flag on military installations, in a carefully worded policy that doesn\u2019t mention the word ban or that specific flag. The policy, laid out in a memo, was described by officials as a creative way to bar the flag\u2019s display without openly contradicting or angering President Donald Trump, who has defended people\u2019s rights to display it.", "Signed by Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the memo lists the types of flags that may be displayed at military installations. The Confederate flag is not among them \u2014 thus barring its display without singling it out in a \u201cban.\u201d", "Shortly afterwards, social media users began circulating an image of a purported tweet from Trump in which he railed against the ban and supposedly declared that \"The flag is a tremendous part of our history,\" that it's a \"symbol of LOVE!\" and that \"Plantations kept black people employed and gave them free food and housing!\":", "This image was just a fabrication intended to mock the chief executive and not real tweet issued by Trump, however.  Such a tweet did not appear in his Twitter timeline, it was not recorded in databases that track deleted tweets, and we found no other evidence that the alleged tweet had ever existed or been retweeted on the Twitter platform itself.", "Scott, Eugene. \u00a0 \"Trump\u2019s Ardent Defense of Confederate Monuments Continues as Americans Swing the Opposite Direction.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 1 July 2020.", "Baldor, Lolita C. \u00a0 \"Pentagon Bans Confederate Flag in Way to Avoid Trump\u2019s Wrath.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Associated Press. \u00a0 17 July 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
