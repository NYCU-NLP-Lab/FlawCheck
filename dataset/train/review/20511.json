["By Jessica McDonald and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on June 16, 2020 | Updated on June 18, 2020", "In the days leading up to President Donald Trump\u2019s first campaign rally since the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, Trump and his supporters are making false and misleading claims about COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and testing:", "Trump is set to speak at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 20.", "In a June 15 tweet, Trump once again bragged about America\u2019s ability to test for the coronavirus, leaving the misleading impression that better testing is responsible for the country\u2019s large number of cases.", "\u201cOur testing is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a great job on this!) that it shows more cases,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout testing, or weak testing, we would be showing almost no cases.\u201d", "Later in the day, Trump repeated the sentiment, saying in a roundtable at the White House, \u201cIf you don\u2019t test, you don\u2019t have any cases. If we stopped testing right now, we\u2019d have very few cases, if any.\u201d", "To some extent he\u2019s right \u2014 if there were less testing, then the reported number of cases would be lower, although of course those infections would still exist.", "But experts say Trump is wrong to claim that the U.S. is more advanced on testing \u201cthan any other country.\u201d", "\u201cThe US may have done the most tests, but not the highest # of tests per capita. And our positivity is higher than many other countries,\u201d Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said on Twitter in response to the president\u2019s tweet.", "\u201cIn summary: we still haven\u2019t done enough testing for the size of our epidemic, which is largest in world,\u201d she added.", "As we have explained before, the total number of tests completed is not necessarily reflective of how well a country is meeting the challenge of diagnosing its COVID-19 patients. Typically, a superior indicator is tests per capita, which takes into account a country\u2019s population. And even better is the test positivity rate, or the proportion of tests that are positive, which can show how much testing has been done relative to the size of an outbreak.", "As of June 14 \u2014 the latest data available when Trump made his claim \u2014 the U.S. had completed just over 23.5 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project.", "That is the largest number of total tests performed by a single country, per statistics collected by Our World in Data. But it is not the top per-capita rate. On that metric, 16 other nations best the U.S., including Iceland, Denmark, Russia, Italy and Australia.", "And with nearly 9% of all tests having come back positive, the U.S. is not even close to being in the vanguard for low test positivity: The U.S. ranks behind at least 50 other nations.", "As we\u2019ve mentioned\u00a0before, there are limitations with the figures\u00a0compiled by\u00a0Our World in Data, since different countries report their testing statistics differently. So the numbers may not be directly comparable, but they are widely viewed as the best available international data on the subject.", "A Johns Hopkins website that uses slightly different calculations based on daily averages \u2014 which Nuzzo told us was done because different countries are in different stages of their pandemics \u2014 also shows the U.S. lagging behind numerous other countries on per-capita tests, test positivity or both.", "The website notes that countries\u2019 testing programs \u201cshould be scaled to the size of their epidemic, not the size of the population\u201d and says the positivity rate \u201cis the most reliable way to determine if a government is testing enough.\u201d", "The World Health Organization suggested on May 12 that nations achieve a 5% or lower test positivity rate for at least two weeks before considering loosening public health measures.", "The cumulative test positivity rate in the U.S. has yet to go that low, although the U.S. is close to reaching that two-week benchmark, as data from the COVID Tracking Project demonstrates.", "The national number, however, still obscures vast differences in locations across the country. A Johns Hopkins data visualization shows that as of June 16, 34 states plus Washington, D.C., have had 5% or fewer tests come back positive, as averaged over the past seven days, while 16 states and Puerto Rico are still above that level.", "In an interview on CNN about COVID-19, Kudlow inaccurately attributed rising hospitalization numbers in some parts of the country to elective procedures. Those figures are specific to people diagnosed with COVID-19, and therefore are unaffected by elective procedures.", "Kudlow also suggested that increased testing was responsible for the uptick in cases. But more testing only partially explains the trends.", "Kudlow made his remarks in a June 14 interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d with Jake Tapper.", "He first acknowledged that some places in the U.S. have recently seen a rise in the number of COVID-19 infections.", "\u201cWe have had an increase in cases in some states. I don\u2019t want to hide that. That\u2019s a fact,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Texas, North Carolina, and South Carolina and Florida. There have been some small metropolitan areas that have had an increase.\u201d", "But then he pointed out that testing has increased, and said that hospitalizations were up because of elective procedures now being allowed.", "\u201cNow, remember, Jake, we are now testing at about a hundred times the rate we were back in March, when the pandemic first exploded,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201c[H]ospitalizations may be going up,\u201d he added, \u201cbut that\u2019s because elective procedures are now permitted. And maybe, most importantly, Jake, although the case rate has increased a bit, we\u2019re not talking about a second round here.\u201d", "But hospitalizations are not up in some areas because of elective procedures. \u201cStates should be tracking COVID-related hospitalizations,\u201d said Johns Hopkins\u2019 Nuzzo in an email to FactCheck.org, \u201cnot all hospitalizations.\u201d", "And indeed, they are, although not all states report hospitalizations or document them over time. Texas posted a record-high of 2,287 \u201cCOVID-19 hospitalizations\u201d on the day Kudlow made his remarks \u2014 a tally that has since climbed to 2,518, according to the state dashboard.", "The number is the sum of all \u201clab-confirmed\u201d COVID-19 patients in hospitals across the state\u2019s trauma service areas, which has risen nearly 40% since Memorial Day.", "State data in Arkansas also shows a surge since the end of May, with 214 \u201ccurrently hospitalized COVID-19 patients\u201d as of June 16 \u2014 approximately double the number two weeks ago.", "North Carolina, too, has seen a steady rise in the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations for the past month. The state notes that the figures reflect the \u201ccurrent hospitalizations due to COVID-19,\u201d which are self-reported by hospitals.", "There is another hospital metric \u2014 bed use rates, or hospital capacity \u2014 that could change as hospitals reopen and begin to do more surgeries. As Nuzzo said, \u201cBed availability is another element to track and that would be influenced by the resumption of elective procedures.\u201d", "But even if that is what Kudlow meant \u2014 and we asked the White House for clarification, but didn\u2019t hear back \u2014 it isn\u2019t what he said.", "Kudlow\u2019s more fundamental claim, which Trump echoed and Pence also suggested, is that the increases some states are now seeing in their COVID-19 cases are because of expanded testing.", "The New York Times reported on June 15 that Pence told governors in a private call to \u201cmake sure and continue to explain to your citizens the magnitude of increase in testing,\u201d and that in \u201cmost of the cases where we are seeing some marginal rise in number, that\u2019s more a result of the extraordinary work you\u2019re doing.\u201d", "In the call, Pence also repeated Kudlow\u2019s false claim that \u201cbecause people are going back to hospitals and elective surgery and getting ordinary care, hospitalization rates may be going up.\u201d", "At a roundtable the same day, the vice president said, \u201cWe really believe that the vast majority of new cases is a reflection, as you said, of a dramatic increase in testing.\u201d", "He then gave the example of California, which he said had flat hospitalization and test positivity numbers. \u201cAnd in those areas where \u2014 just a few states \u2014 where we\u2019re seeing positive rates go up, we\u2019ll be talking to governors today, in states like Georgia and Arizona and Texas, about deploying additional CDC personnel to help them identify where those outbreaks are occurring and how we can mitigate those efforts.\u201d", "\u201cWith more than 22 million tests having been performed across the country, we \u2014 we continue to see overall that what\u2019s called a positive test rate remains very stable in the country,\u201d he continued. \u201cAs we said earlier, Mr. President, there is a few states where the positivity rate is climbing, and we\u2019re working very closely with those governors to identify that.\u201d", "Pence is right that at least for now, the nation\u2019s test positivity rate hasn\u2019t gone up, and that California\u2019s increased COVID-19 caseload is likely explained by bolstered testing.", "But that\u2019s not true everywhere \u2014 and it\u2019s not just a \u201cfew\u201d states that have reported growth in their test positivity rates.", "\u201cIt is true that the number of cases reflects not just how many cases there are in the community, but also testing capacity,\u201d Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us during a press call. But, she added, \u201cI think that the signals that we\u2019re seeing from across the country are real, and they correspond to what we knew would happen when society started to open up, which is that we get more mixing, and we\u2019ll start to see the emergence of the virus spreading again.\u201d", "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Wall Street Journal in a June 16 interview that while more testing leads to more cases, higher positivity rates in many states \u201ccannot be explained by increased testing.\u201d", "\u201cTesting positivity is going UP in nearly half of US states, which is a sign that increasing case numbers is not just due to more testing,\u201d noted Nuzzo in a tweet.", "Test positivity is an important metric because it should stay steady or decrease if increased testing is behind a higher number of identified cases. An increasing percentage of positive tests, as long as testing hasn\u2019t dropped off, indicates a surge in infections.", "According to a Johns Hopkins data visualization that tracks the weekly change in\u00a0states\u2019 test positivity numbers, many of the states with increases in the percentage of positive tests are located in the South.", "Caitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, noted that testing could explain some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the upticks.", "\u201cAre increased case counts partially attributable to increased testing?\u201d she asked in a tweet. \u201cProbably in part. But in places where hospitalizations and the % of tests that come back positive is high or rising, those are sure signs of trouble.\u201d", "In a June 11 call with reporters, Dr. Tom Inglesby, the director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins, also emphasized looking at the hospitalization figures to understand what is happening \u2014 a point he later iterated in a Twitter thread.", "\u201cIn Texas, if you look at the numbers in detail, you can see that hospitalization rate is going up. Similarly, in Arizona, ICU beds, hospitalization rates for COVID patients are going up. So those are real changes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are more sick people than there were a month ago, substantially more.\u201d", "He said California, though, did not have the same concerning trends. \u201cIn California, even though the number of daily cases is higher on a day-to-day basis than it was weeks ago, the overall hospitalization rate on their dashboard is stable,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that would suggest perhaps there\u2019s more testing going on in California and maybe they\u2019re finding more mild and moderate cases, but they aren\u2019t seeing a rise in the number of very sick people.\u201d", "\u201cOther states like Florida aren\u2019t reporting hospitalization,\u201d he added. \u201cSo you can\u2019t really make any determinations without having access to that data.\u201d", "Many public health experts suspect that reopening policies are behind the rise in some states, although Inglesby noted that not all states have experienced increases.", "\u201cIn some cases, some states that have reopened have not had sharp rises. I think as reopening goes forward, we\u2019ll be able to know more,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we do know is that this virus transmits person to person, the more activity that\u2019s allowed that is based on close personal interaction, the more opportunities there will be for transmission.\u201d", "Buckee said it was too early to know what will happen for certain, but that the rising number of cases in some places will likely lead to more severe illnesses and deaths, even if it hasn\u2019t shown up yet.", "\u201cI think that there\u2019s no question that we\u2019re going to see a surge in hospitalizations and deaths in places like Arizona, due to that uptick in cases,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of waiting for a few weeks.\u201d", "Cases that happen now, she said, will result in deaths in about three weeks.", "In addition to the increase in cases, she said many of the states in the southeastern U.S. have worrying demographic factors as well, which put those populations at higher risk.", "\u201cThe concern is not just the policies and the reopening and spreading of the virus, but the significant risks of morbidity and mortality in those populations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that African American communities are being hit particularly hard, diabetes is a risk factor, and so on. Those are all going to mean that we expect more illness and more death from COVID.\u201d", "On ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Sen. Lankford of Oklahoma was asked whether the president should postpone his Tulsa rally due to health concerns.", "\u201cI do not believe so, actually,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through phase one, phase two, and phase three. We continue to see hospitalizations decline, deaths decline in Oklahoma.\u201d", "The senator is right about COVID-19 deaths, but not about hospitalizations.", "In its most recent Weekly Epidemiology and Surveillance Report for the week of June 5 through June 11, the Oklahoma Department of Health said there has been an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.", "Oklahoma Department of Health, June 12: Oklahoma has begun experiencing over the past two weeks an increase in the number of cases and hospitalizations due to COVID-19, though the number of deaths have remained approximately the same and the percentage of positives remains low at 3.7%. The increase in the number of cases is caused by both ongoing community transmission and outbreaks that affect specific populations. The threat of COVID still exists and we anticipate it to grow.", "For the two-week reporting period, from June 1 to June 12, the number of \u201cCOVID-19 Cases Currently Hospitalized\u201d increased from 69 to 86, according to separate Executive Order Reports that the state Health Department publishes every weekday.", "As of June 15, there were 98 current hospitalizations \u2014 the highest since May 7, when there were 113 people hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, which tracks hospitalization data for 42 states, including Oklahoma.", "Prior to Lankford\u2019s appearance on \u201cThis Week,\u201d the Executive Order Reports showed a one-day drop on June 11, from 97 to 86. But, until the June 11 drop, there were six straight days of more COVID-19 hospitalizations, the reports show.", "The most recent weekly epidemiology report also said there were 719 confirmed cases for the week ending June 11, an increase of 12.9% from the previous week, while deaths had declined 11.6%.", "Despite the current uptick in COVID-19 hospitalizations, there are still far fewer than there were in mid-April, according to the Carlson School of Management\u2019s hospitalization tracking website. The Sooner State recorded the highest number of hospitalizations on April 13, when 194 people were hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the university website.", "(Technical note: The state also issues \u201csituation update\u201d reports every weekday that provide \u201ccurrent hospitalizations,\u201d which the state Health Department says represent \u201ca combination of hospitalized positive cases and hospitalized persons under investigation.\u201d The Carlson School\u2019s website reports \u201conly the confirmed cases of hospitalizations\u201d when a state provides the data, as Oklahoma does, according to Pinar Karaca-Mandic, a professor of health care risk management and a project team leader. We, too, are using only confirmed cases for this story.)", "Oklahoma has been slowly reopening its businesses since April 24, when it entered what Gov. Kevin Stitt called phase 1 of a three-phase plan.
