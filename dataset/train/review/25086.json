["About this rating", "A piece of Hollywood lore was recirculated on social media in October 2017 after Newsweek claimed that actress Judi Dench, who recently spoke out against Weinstein's alleged history of sexually harassing women, had a tattoo of Harvey Weinstein's initials on her backside in a tweet (and presumably an accompanying \"exclusive\" article):", "Reports about Dench's Harvey Weinstein \"tattoo\" have been circulating since at least 2011 when the actress made a joke about the cheeky ink while accepting a British Film Institute award in London. Page Six reported:", "The Oscar-winner for \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d said the former Miramax mogul gave her a break when others said she \u201cdidn\u2019t have a face for film.\u201d \u201c[He] said, \u2018Mrs. Brown\u2019 should be a film,\u201d Dench said of the 1997 project that launched her Hollywood career after Weinstein took it from the BBC to US cinemas. \u201cIt was thanks to Harvey, whose name I have had tattooed on my bum ever since.\"", "Dench took this joke a step further when she reportedly mooned Weinstein at a New York restaurant in 2014. The actress explained in a Q&A with The Hollywood Reporter that she had her makeup artist draw a temporary tattoo on her backside before meeting Weinstein for dinner:", "I once said to him, \u201cI have your named tattooed on my bum.\" He laughed and was, well, quite embarrassed, actually. It\u2019s quite difficult to embarrass Harvey, but I did! And then, we went out to lunch, to the Four Seasons. Charlie Rose was there and I think my agent was there. Beforehand, I got my makeup lady to actually write Harvey\u2019s name. [laughs] Then I brought it up at lunch and said, \u201cYou know, I do have it on my bum\u201d -- and then I actually got up and showed him! I\u2019ve never seen a man more embarrassed and I\u2019ve never let him forget it. [laughs] Perhaps I should have it done and really shock him!", "Weinstein told a similar story during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show, although the producer appeared to be under the false impression that Dench's tattoo was genuine:", "Dench didn't get her first tattoo until the age of 81, several years after the Harvey Weinstein tattoo rumors started to circulate, when she got the words \"carpe diem\" (seize the day) written across her wrist. Vanity Fair reported:", "She did not get Weinstein\u2019s name immortally etched into her arm, though. Instead, she got the words \u201ccarpe diem\u201d inscribed on her wrist as a gift from her daughter, Finty Williams. In an interview with Surrey Life, Dench explained the ink: \u201cThat\u2019s my motto: seize the day. Finty gave it to me for my 81st birthday\u2014she\u2019s wonderful with surprises.\u201d", "As of this writing, Newsweek's tweet incorrectly stating that Dench has a \"Harvey Weinstein tattoo\" on her derriere is still on Twitter, though the publication has added an update to their article:", "This article has been updated to reflect that Judi Dench's tattoo dedicated to Harvey Weinstein was not a permanent fixture.", "Although Dench was close to the producer throughout much of her career, she released a statement on 9 October 2017 condemning Weinstein for his alleged history of sexual harassment:", "\"Whilst there is no doubt that Harvey Weinstein has helped and championed my film career for the past 20 years, I was completely unaware of these offences which are, of course, horrifying and I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered, and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out.\"", "Kantor, Jodi. \u00a0 \"Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Times \u00a0 5 October 2017.", "Ahmed, Tufayel. \u00a0 \"Exclusive: Judi Dench, Who had Harvey Weinstein 'Tattoo' on Her Butt, Says Sexual Harassment Reports are 'Horrifying.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Newsweek. \u00a0 9 October 2017.", "Guglielmi, Judi. \u00a0 \"Judi Dench Calls Harvey Weinstein's Alleged Sexual Misconduct 'Horrifying' and Asserts She Was 'Unaware.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 People. \u00a0 9 October 2017.", "Miller, June. \u00a0 \"At 81, Dame Judi Dench Gets Her First Tattoo.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Vanity Fair. \u00a0 30 June 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
