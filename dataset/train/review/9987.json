The post includes a screenshot of a tweet by a Twitter account called Naija congratulating \u201cTiwa Savage on winning Grammy award tonight (sic)\u201d.", "Another Facebook post further claimed that \u201cTiwa Savage, Femi Kuti and Made Kuti also won a Grammys tonight for their collaboration on Coldplay\u2019s album\u201d after the British band was nominated in the Album of The Year category.", "Similar claims have been shared here, here\u00a0and here.", "The 63rd Annual Grammy Awards ceremony hosted by the Recording Academy was held on March 14, 2021. The event was both onsite at the Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles and online across the world due to COVID-19 restrictions. The awards recognised the best recordings, compositions\u00a0and artists of last year--running from September 1, 2019\u00a0to August 31, 2020.", "Two Nigerian artists \u2013 Wizkid and Burna Boy \u2013 each won a Grammy: Ayo Balogun, popularly known as Wizkid, for Best Music Video for his role in Beyonce\u2019s Brown Skin Girl and Damini Ogulu (Burna Boy) for\u00a0Best Global Music Album for Twice as Tall.", "Savage and the Kutis had worked with Coldplay on the album Everyday Life, which was nominated for Album of The Year. Savage provided backing vocals for the track \u00c8k\u00f3, while the Kutis joined in on Arabesque as instrumentalists.", "Femi Kuti is the son of Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti who died in 1997. Femi and his son Made have been carrying on Fela's musical legacy.", "Before Burna Boy and Wizkid\u2019s were announced as winners, Nigerians home and abroad were anticipating their victories on social media. Media houses in and outside\u00a0the country were writing about Burna Boy\u2019s chances, but no mention of Savage.", "Using Tweetdeck, AFP Fact Check traced the first tweets from the people driving\u00a0the conversation. About 40 minutes before the start of the event, a Twitter user in Nigeria asked why no one was talking about Savage\u2019s nomination. This tweet was shared more than 400 times.", "About 21 minutes into the ceremony, Wizkid\u2019s win was announced, alongside Beyonc\u00e9 and Blue Ivy. At about 9:21pm WAT on Sunday, Burna Boy picked up his award. A few minutes later, the head of content at a Nigeria streaming website NotJustOK tweeted a win for Savage.", "He would later correct the error with an update an hour later, but by then\u00a0much of social media already believed that Savage was a winner. Within that hour, multiple misleading tweets had\u00a0already been sent out at 9:57pm, 10:13pm, 10:22pm, and 10:27pm. The correction came in at 10:36pm.", "Coldplay eventually lost out to Swift\u2019s album Folklore, ending any hope that Savage and the Kutis could add their names to Nigeria\u2019s two winners on the night.", "Had Coldplay won, there is no guarantee that Savage and the Kutis would have shared the award. We checked the Grammy\u2019s website and found awards go to\u00a0 \u201cArtist(s) and to Featured Artist(s), Songwriter(s) of new material, Producer(s), Recording Engineer(s), Mixer(s) and Mastering Engineer(s) credited with at least 33% playing time of the album, if other than Artist.\u201d", "Everyday Life has 16 tracks which make up a 52-minute playing time, according to Apple Music. \u00c8k\u00f3 runs for two minutes and 37 seconds, while Arabesque lasts for five minutes and 40 seconds. Thirty-three percent of the album is a little over 17 minutes. Hence, neither Savage nor the Kutis\u00a0had up to 33% playing time on the album.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
