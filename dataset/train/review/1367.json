["On August 22, the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) tweeted an infographic listing the projected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth percentages in 2020 of nine countries\u2014India, China, United States, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, United Kingdom and Canada. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is cited as the source of the data. \u201cWhile the world continues to grapple with economic bloodbath with major economies projected to register negative growth in the aftermath of #COVID pandemic, India will be a shining spot with positive growth in 2020. It will also retain its status of the fastest growing economy,\u201d read the BJP\u2019s tweet.

The tweet said, \u201cIndian economy is strong enough to withstand the impact of #Corona pandemic.

While the BJP\u2019s April infographic was rightly based on the IMF data released in April, its August infographic was also based on the same data. \u2018World Economic Outlook: The Great Lockdown\u2019 was published in April which indeed projected 1.9% and 7.4% growth for India in 2020 and 2021 respectively.", "However, in June, the IMF released an update on the report\u2014\u2018World Economic Outlook Update\u2019. According to this report, \u201cEconomic data available at the time of the April 2020 WEO forecast indicated an unprecedented decline in global activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data releases [released] since then suggest even deeper downturns than previously projected for several economies.\u201d", "In its June report, the IMF revised its April estimates and projected a contraction of -4.5% in 2020. \u201cIndia\u2019s economy is projected to contract by 4.5 percent following a longer period of lockdown and slower recovery than anticipated in April,\u201d the report stated.", "Therefore, the BJP\u2019s tweet claiming \u201cIndia will be a shining spot with positive growth in 2020\u201d is false. The ruling party used four-month-old data to reflect positive growth. According to the IMF\u2019s updated report released in June, India is projected to experience a negative growth rate by 4.5%.", "While the BJP attempted to portray that India is projected to \u201cretain its spot as the fastest growing economy in the world\u201d, the IMF data forecasts better growth rates for China and ASEAN-5. In fact, China\u2019s estimated growth rate for 2020 is 1%. It is evidently misleading to suggest that India will be at the top when the country is predicted to have negative growth while China is the only country predicted to experience positive growth.", "It is to be noted that the IMF\u2019s projections in June may alter in the next report as the pandemic continues to evolve.
