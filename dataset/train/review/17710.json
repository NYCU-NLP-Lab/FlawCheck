["About this rating", "In the span of just over three years, humanity will have witnessed both the shortest total lunar eclipse of the 21st century as well as the longest.", "According to NASA, the shortest total lunar eclipse this century will see occurred on 4 April 2015 and lasted a mere 4 minutes and 48 seconds. The longest, spanning 1 hour 42 minutes and 57 seconds, is slated to occur on 27 July 2018.", "The length of a total lunar eclipse varies based how far the moon is from the Earth at the time of the eclipse. As described by EarthSky, the 27 July eclipse will occur when the moon is coincidentally at its farthest point from Earth:", "In 2018, the July full moon and July lunar apogee \u2014 the moon\u2019s most distant point from Earth in its monthly orbit \u2013 both fall on the same date: July 27, 2018. Therefore, the July 2018 full moon showcases the most distant and smallest full moon of the year. Sometimes called an apogean full moon (or micro-moon or mini-moon), this smaller and slower-moving full moon takes more time to cross the Earth\u2019s shadow than does a full moon that\u2019s closer to Earth and moving faster in orbit. That\u2019s why a full moon at or near lunar apogee adds to the duration of a total lunar eclipse.", "Unfortunately for readers residing in portions of North America that are not on the most eastern side of Newfoundland, they will effectively miss out on the action. However, the eclipse will be visible, to some degree, from every other continent on the planet.", "How does this century\u2019s longest duration total lunar eclipse compare to other centuries\u2019 record holders? Though the Gregorian calendar was not a thing at the time, the longest total lunar eclipse occurring in the five millennia (or 50 centuries) between 2000 BCE and projected into 3000 CE occurred on 31 May 318 CE and lasted 1 hour, 46 minutes, and 36 seconds \u2014 a full three minutes and 39 seconds longer than this July's eclipse will be.", "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. \u00a0 \"Five Millennium Catalog of Lunar Eclipses: 2001 to 2100 (2001 CE to 2100 CE).\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 3 July 2018.", "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. \u00a0 \"Total Lunar Eclipse of 2018 July 27.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 3 July 2018.", "McClure, Bruce. \u00a0 \"Century\u2019s Longest Lunar Eclipse July 27.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 EarthSky. \u00a0  Accessed 3 July 2018.", "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. \u00a0 \"Index to Five Millennium Catalog of Lunar Eclipses: -1999 to +3000 (2000 BCE to 3000 CE)\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 3 July 2018.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
