For that matter, Australia isn't even the first country where self-chipping has taken place; it's been going on in the U.S. for years.", "Australia has not begun microchipping its public. The claim that it has is, at best, misinformation and, at worst, a lie.", "And it's also not true that, as claimed in the example at the head of this page, NBC predicted that \"all Americans will receive a microchip implant in 2017.\"", "Reynolds, Emma.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Australians Embracing Super-Human Microchip Technology.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0News.com.au.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a025 August 2016.", "Thompson, Cadie.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This Man Sells a Kit That'll Turn Anyone Into a 'Cyborg.'\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tech Insider.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a029 July 2015.", "Organic & Healthy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Australia Becomes First Country to Begin Microchipping Its Public.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0October 2016.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
