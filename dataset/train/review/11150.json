But the amendment failed to win the necessary 60 votes to proceed to a final vote.", "The day after the vote, Giffords wrote an op-ed for the New York Times decrying that vote.", "In her op-ed, Giffords wrote, \"Some of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died. These senators have heard from their constituents \u2014 who polls show overwhelmingly favored expanding background checks. And still these senators decided to do nothing. Shame on them.\"", "Under current law, background checks are required in sales made by federally licensed gun dealers, but not for gun sales by private sellers. President Barack Obama wants to require criminal background checks for all gun sales. The National Rifle Association, which opposes universal background checks, argues that an expansion would fail to deter criminals.", "Here, we will check Giffords\u2019 claim that polls show that Americans \"overwhelmingly\" support \"expanding background checks.\"", "To do this, we will look at national survey data from media and academic polls taken in the month prior to Giffords\u2019 column.

We think any reasonable person would conclude that those percentages qualify as \"overwhelming.\"", "Giffords would have had more trouble finding support for her claim had she either set a numerical threshold or had she been more specific about the kind of background checks Americans are comfortable with.", "For instance, when Obama spoke shortly after the amendment\u2019s failure in the Senate, he cited 90 percent support for an expansion of background checks not once but five times in fairly brief remarks. In the survey results we found, half of the polls crossed that threshold and half did not (though those that didn\u2019t are fairly close).", "Meanwhile, the results of the CNN poll suggest that Americans do not support all possible expansions of background checks to the same extent. Checks at gun shows found 83 percent support, but private sales between a willing seller and a willing buyer garnered 70 percent backing, while checks for transfers to family members or for the purchase of ammunition only reached the mid 50-percent range.", "Our ruling", "In her op-ed, Giffords said polls show that Americans \"overwhelmingly\" support \"expanding background checks.\" Four independent polls taken in the previous month showed that some sort of expansion of background checks earned the support of between 83 percent and 91 percent of respondents, a level of backing we think qualifies as \"overwhelming.\" We rate her statement True.", "Gabrielle Giffords, \"A Senate in the Gun Lobby\u2019s Grip\" (New York Times op-ed), April 17, 2013", "White House, statement by the president in the Rose Garden, April 17, 2013", "Washington Post-ABC News poll, April 2013", "pollingreport.com, gun poll data archive, accessed April 18, 2013", "CNN, \"CNN Poll: Popular background checks also cause worry,\" April 10, 2013", "Quinnipiac University, \"Background Checks Could Lead To Gun Confiscation, Many Voters Tell Quinnipiac University National Poll; But 91 Percent Want Universal Gun Checks,\" April 4, 2013", "CBS News, \"Americans' Views on Washington, the President, & the Budget Deficit,\" March 20-24, 2013", "PolitiFact Texas, \"Lee Leffingwell says polls show 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of NRA members support criminal background checks before all gun buys,\" April 4, 2013", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
