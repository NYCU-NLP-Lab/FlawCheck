["By Eugene Kiely and Lori Robertson", "Posted on April 24, 2019", "Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report concluded that \u201c[t]he Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion\u201d \u2014 contrary to Jared Kushner\u2019s claim that Russia\u2019s effort amounted to little more than \u201ca couple Facebook ads.\u201d", "The report details how the Russians \u201ccarried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton,\u201d and \u201cconducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents\u201d to damage the Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s campaign.", "It also lays out how eager the Trump campaign was to use the stolen material to its political advantage, even after the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint public statement on Oct. 7, 2016, \u201cthat the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.\u201d", "Although investigators \u201cdid not establish\u201d the Trump campaign \u201cconspired or coordinated\u201d with Russia\u2019s \u201celection interference activities,\u201d Mueller\u2019s report said \u201cthe [Trump] Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.\u201d", "Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, made his comments during\u00a0an interview at the Time100 Summit\u00a0(starting at the 3:57 mark).\u00a0He said the \u201cinvestigations and all of the speculation\u201d over the past two years \u201chas had a much harsher impact on our democracy than a couple Facebook ads.\u201d", "Kushner, April 23: And quite frankly, the whole thing is just a big distraction for the country.\u00a0You look at what Russia did, you know, buying some Facebook ads to try to sow dissent\u00a0and do it, it\u2019s a terrible thing. But I think the investigations and all of the speculation that\u2019s happened for the last two years has had a much harsher impact on our democracy\u00a0than a couple Facebook ads. I think they said [Russians] spent about $160,000. I spent $160,000 on Facebook every three hours during the campaign. Now if you look at the magnitude of what they did and what they accomplished, I think the ensuing investigations have been way more harmful to our country.", "Kushner downplays the extensive social media influence campaign the Russians waged to help elect his father-in-law and ignores entirely the Russian cyberattack on Clinton and her supporters that was designed to undermine Clinton\u2019s campaign.", "Here we recap what the Mueller report said about Russia\u2019s election interference efforts.", "The FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation of Russia began in late July 2016 \u2014 a few days after WikiLeaks began releasing emails that had been stolen from the Democratic National Committee. The investigation was sparked by a tip it received from a foreign government official who learned from\u00a0George Papadopoulos, a Trump foreign policy adviser, \u201cthat\u00a0the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton,\u201d\u00a0according to the Mueller report.", "The federal investigation uncovered a sophisticated hacking operation by two units of the\u00a0Main Intelligence Directorate,\u00a0or GRU, which is responsible for intelligence collection for the Russian military. One unit was responsible for developing a \u201cspecialized\u201d malware, while the other unit \u201cconducted large-scale spearphishing campaigns,\u201d according to the Mueller report.", "The targets, of course, were the DNC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign committee.", "The scope of the hacking operation:\u00a0Beginning in March 2016, the GRU \u201chacked the computers and email accounts of organizations, employees, and volunteers supporting the Clinton Campaign, including the email account of campaign chairman John Podesta,\u201d the report said. The\u00a0GRU gained access to 29 DCCC computers and more than 30 computers on the DNC network, including the DNC email server and shared file server.", "\u201cIn total, the GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks,\u201d the report says.", "The groups behind the release of the stolen documents:\u00a0The GRU publicly released emails and documents stolen from the Democrats \u201cthrough two fictitious online personas that it created \u2014 DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 \u2014 and later through the organization WikiLeaks,\u201d the report said.", "The Washington Post\u00a0reported\u00a0on June 14, 2016, that hackers had gained access to DNC servers \u2014 the first public disclosure of a cyberattack on a U.S. political committee.", "A day later,\u00a0Guccifer 2.0 \u2014 a \u201c[f]ictitious online persona operated by the GRU\u201d \u2014\u00a0took credit in a blog post\u00a0for hacking the DNC computers and released a few documents, including the Democratic Party\u2019s 200-page opposition research report on Donald Trump. Guccifer falsely attributed the DNC hack \u201cto a lone Romanian hacker.\u201d", "\u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to Wikileaks. They will publish them soon,\u201d Guccifer 2.0 says in its blog post.", "Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, opposed Clinton\u2019s candidacy.

With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities., dems+media+neoliberals will be mute . \u2026 She\u2019s a bright, well connected, sadisitic sociopath.'\u201d", "The timing of the public release of the stolen documents:\u00a0According to the Mueller report, \u201cThe release of the documents was designed and timed to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine the Clinton Campaign.\u201d", "About five weeks after Guccifer 2.0 took credit for hacking DNC servers, WikiLeaks released\u00a0more than\u00a020,000 stolen DNC emails and other documents. (It would eventually release more than 44,000 DNC emails and 17,000 attachments, WikiLeaks\u00a0says\u00a0on its website.) The first drop came on July 22, 2016 \u2014 three days before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.", "The timing proved damaging to party unity, and Clinton\u2019s attempts to use the convention to woo supporters of her top rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders.\u00a0The released documents\u00a0embarrassed party officials who were seen as working behind the scenes at the DNC to undermine Sanders\u2019 campaign, and forced the DNC chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, to resign on the eve of the convention.", "The timing was no coincidence.", "The Mueller report said WikiLeaks sent a direct message on Twitter to Guccifer 2.0 on July 6, 2016, seeking information that would disrupt the DNC convention and Clinton\u2019s attempts at unity. \u201c[I]f you have anything hillary related we want it in the next tweo [sic] days prefab le [sic] because the DNC is approaching and she will solidify bernie supporters behind her after,\u201d WikiLeaks wrote to Guccifer 2.0.", "\u201c[W]e think trump has only a 25% chance of winning against hillary \u2026 so conflict between bernie and hillary is interesting,\u201d WikiLeaks wrote.", "On Oct. 7, 2016, WikiLeaks began releasing emails \u201cthe first set of emails stolen by the GRU from the account of Clinton Campaign chairman John Podesta.\u201d Those emails were released \u201cless than an hour\u201d after the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0published a 2005 video\u00a0that caught Trump on a hot mic during a filming of \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d bragging about grabbing and kissing women because\u00a0\u201cwhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.\u201d", "Trump campaign\u2019s use of stolen documents:\u00a0In downplaying Russia\u2019s interference in the election, Kushner ignored the campaign\u2019s interest in the stolen documents and Trump\u2019s extensive use of them to his advantage.", "\u201cThe Trump Campaign showed interest in WikiLeaks\u2019s releases of hacked materials throughout the summer and fall of 2016,\u201d the Mueller report said.", "After DNC emails were released in July, Trump tweeted, \u201cThe Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!\u201d At the same time, Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, told Gates that he \u201cwanted to be kept apprised of any developments with WikiLeaks,\u201d according to the Mueller report.", "\u201cAccording to [Deputy Campaign Chairman Rick] Gates, by the late summer of 2016, the Trump Campaign was planning a press strategy, a communications campaign, and messaging based on the possible release of Clinton emails by WikiLeaks,\u201d the report said.", "The report also said that Trump and \u201cother Campaign advisors privately sought information [redacted] about any further planned WikiLeaks releases.\u201d", "Donald Trump Jr., exchanged direct messages on Twitter with WikiLeaks, expressing interest in any new document dumps.

Four days later, WikiLeaks released Podesta\u2019s emails.", "After the first set of Podesta\u2019s emails was released, Trump took to Twitter on numerous occasions to draw attention to the stolen documents and away from the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201c video.\u00a0Here are some of his tweets, which also came days after the U.S. intelligence community\u00a0identified Russia as the source of the hacked emails:", "Oct. 11, 2016: \u201cI hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks.

(Read our item \u201cTrump Twists Facts on WikiLeaks\u201d for more information on how Trump distorted the facts on those and other topics.)", "\u201cIn sum, the investigation established that the GRU hacked into email accounts of persons affiliated with the Clinton Campaign, as well as the computers of the DNC and DCCC. The GRU then exfiltrated data related to the 2016 election from these accounts and computers, and disseminated that data through fictitious online personas (DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0) and later through WikiLeaks,\u201d the Mueller report said. \u201cThe investigation also established that the Trump Campaign displayed interest in the WikiLeaks releases.\u201d", "Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, an\u00a0online propaganda\u00a0operation,\u00a0began social media operations in the United States as early as 2014, creating social media accounts using fictitious personas.", "In the 2016 campaign, \u201cSome IRA employees, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated electronically with individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the staging of political rallies,\u201d the report said.\u00a0\u201cBy the end of the 2016 U.S. election, the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S. persons through their social media accounts.\u201d", "The figures cited on the reach and amount of these social media accounts are significantly greater than \u201ca couple Facebook ads,\u201d as Kushner said.", "Mueller report:\u00a0Multiple IRA-controlled Facebook groups and\u00a0Instagram accounts had hundreds of thousands of U.S. participants. IRA-controlled Twitter accounts separately had tens of thousands of followers, including multiple U.S. political figures who retweeted IRA-created content. In November 2017, a Facebook representative testified that Facebook had identified 470 IRA-controlled Facebook accounts that collectively made 80,000 posts between January 2015 and August 2017. Facebook estimated the IRA reached as many as 126 million persons through its Facebook accounts. In January 2018, Twitter announced that it had identified 3,814 IRA-controlled Twitter accounts and notified approximately 1.4 million people Twitter believed may have been in contact with an IRA-controlled account.", "Much of the material in the report on the structure of the IRA and its social media operations is redacted, due to \u201charm to ongoing matter.\u201d In February 2018, the special counsel indicted\u00a013 Russian nationals and three Russian entities, including the IRA. The group was funded by\u00a0Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin, who was sanctioned by the U.S. in December 2016 and has reported ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and companies he controlled.", "According to the indictment,\u00a0the IRA\u2019s monthly budget was more than $1.25 million (U.S. dollars) by September 2016.", "The U.S. social media operation was\u00a0known as the \u201cTranslator\u201d internally at the IRA, the Mueller report said. It included the creation of social media pages falsely claiming to be associated with U.S. political groups or mimicking them. For instance, the IRA Twitter account\u00a0@TEN_ GOP suggested it was affiliated with the Tennessee Republican Party. \u201cMore commonly,\u201d the Mueller report said, \u201cthe IRA created accounts in the names of fictitious U.S. organizations and grassroots groups and used these accounts to pose as anti-immigration groups, Tea Party activists, Black Lives Matter protestors, and other U.S. social and political activists.\u201d", "The operation was aimed at supporting Trump\u2019s candidacy and opposing Clinton. One of the directions to IRA operators included: \u201cMain idea: Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary [Clinton] and the rest (except Sanders and Trump \u2013 we support them).\u201d", "As for Facebook ads, the IRA bought more than 3,500 of them, not just \u201ca couple,\u201d spending about $100,000, the special counsel\u2019s report said, attributing those figures to Facebook.", "The special counsel said the IRA bought its first known ad backing Trump\u2019s campaign on April 19, 2016 \u2014 an ad for an Instagram account called \u201cTea Party News\u201d encouraging people to help\u00a0\u201c\u2018make a patriotic team of young Trump supporters\u2019 by uploading photos with the hashtag \u2018#KIDS4TRUMP.'\u201d The IRA bought dozens of ads supporting the Trump campaign in the months that followed, \u201cpredominantly through the Facebook groups \u2018Being Patriotic,\u2019 \u2018Stop All Invaders,\u2019 and \u2018Secured Borders.'\u201d Other bogus Facebook groups created by the IRA included:\u00a0\u201cBlack Matters,\u201d \u201cLGBT United\u201d and \u201cUnited Muslims of America.\u201d These accounts \u201cattracted hundreds of thousands of followers.\u201d", "On Twitter, the IRA created fake accounts and also automated bot accounts to spread its content. One IRA account \u2014\u00a0@march_for_trump \u2014 promoted rallies in support of the campaign. The IRA would organize rallies by direct messaging followers, asking them to attend, and finding a real U.S. person to agree to serve as the coordinator of the event. The special counsel\u2019s office identified \u201cdozens\u201d of such rallies, the first of which was a \u201cconfederate rally\u201d in November 2015. Some rallies attracted just a few people, but others attracted hundreds. The Trump campaign actually posted on its Facebook page about an IRA-organized rally in Miami in August 2016.", "One poster for IRA-organized rallies in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia used an image of a now-deceased West Virginia coal miner with the words, \u201cMiners For Trump, Bring Back Our Jobs.\u201d", "The bogus social media accounts were realistic enough to fool some U.S. media outlets, which quoted tweets they thought were from real U.S. people, and well-known figures who retweeted or responded to these accounts, including former Ambassador Michael McFaul, Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, Trump informal adviser Roger Stone and Michael Flynn Jr., son of the campaign\u2019s foreign policy adviser and later national security adviser in the administration.", "The IRA also had interactions with the Trump campaign. On \u201cmultiple occasions, members and surrogates of the Trump Campaign promoted\u2013typically by linking, retweeting, or similar methods of reposting\u2013pro-Trump or anti-Clinton content published by the IRA through IRA-controlled social media accounts,\u201d the report said. For instance, posts from that @TEN_GOP Twitter account were cited or retweeted by Donald J. Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Kellyanne Conway,\u00a0Brad Parscale and Michael T. Flynn.", "Also, there were \u201ca few instances\u201d in which IRA employees asked members of the campaign for help with rallies the IRA had organized. The Mueller report concluded: \u201cWhile certain campaign volunteers agreed to provide the requested support (for example, agreeing to set aside a number of signs), the investigation has not identified evidence that any Trump Campaign official understood the requests were coming from foreign nationals.\u201d", "Kushner equates the Russian interference effort to \u201ca couple Facebook ads\u201d and $160,000. But as the Mueller report makes clear, it was a sophisticated, yearslong hacking and social media effort to influence an election.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
