["A video featuring Abhishek Banerjee has been trending recently on social media. Banerjee is a Trinamool Congress MP and the nephew of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. In the video, he alleges that UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath made an objectionable statement about women from the Muslim community. He claims that the BJP leader spoke of raping Muslim women. \u201cYogi Adityanath, the Chief Minister of one of the largest states of the country is saying, \u2018We will take Muslim women out of graves and rape them\u2019,\u201d said Banerjee.", "Facebook user Nisar Bhatt posted this video which was shared more than 25,000 times and received over 16,000 likes as of this writing.", "Ban Bang", "BJP Bakht SUSHIL PANDIT Got Bashed By a Youth.", "Posted by NBTV on Wednesday, 16 September 2020", "Abhishek Banerjee had made this statement in February of this year during a televised debate. The Telegraph held a debate show called \u2018The Telegraph National Debate 2020\u2032 at the Calcutta Club on February 15. Also present at the debate were actress Swara Bhaskar and JNUSU President Aishe Ghosh. The purpose of the program was to discuss the \u2018anti-national\u2019 label ascribed to anyone dissenting against the government.

He also said that the two cultures could not coexist. He had made these comments during a speech at the Virat Hindu Chetna Rally in 2007-08 when his supporters and Hindu Yuva Vahini activists also took to the stage to make abusive and objectionable remarks against Muslim women. At around the 3-minute mark in the video posted below, a man can be heard saying, \u201cNow is the time to get their mothers and daughters out of graves and rape their children. This is the need of the hour, friends. And only the Hindu Yuva Vahini can do it.\u201d Yogi Adityanath was on-stage when the statement was made by a co-speaker.", "In March 2017, BJP won the UP Assembly elections with a huge margin and Yogi Adityanath was handed the position of Chief Minister. Adityanath\u2019s associated with a radical Hindutva school of thought and demands for the establishment of a Hindu nation are not unknown. At the time, a number of media outlets (Article 1, Article 2, Article 3) and journalists had questioned his selection as Chief Minister. Amidst these criticisms, several reports had covered the communal and objectionable speeches he had made in the past.", "In one such speech, he said, \u201cWe have decided that if they capture one Hindu girl, then we will bring back at least 100 Muslim girls. If they kill one Hindu, then we will also kill 100. Our response will be a hundred times worse than their act.\u201d He made these comments while discussing cases of \u2018love jihad\u2019 in Uttar Pradesh. These comments are part of a documentary from 2011 and can be heard at the 56-minute mark onwards.", "At another Hindu Virat Chetna rally, Adityanath said, \u201cWe are all preparing for a religious war. Only this religious war can fight Jihad. People say, \u2018What was the point of creating the Hindu Vahini?\u2019 I say necessity. Hinduism is a different culture, Islam is a different culture, the two cannot coexist. Two cultures can never live together in harmony. A collision between both will happen, it will come eventually. And when two cultures cannot live together, the division of this country is inevitable, it simply must happen. This is a warning and that\u2019s why we have organised this Hindu Chetna rally, which is being held in every region of Uttar Pradesh. Brothers, the Virat Hindu Chetna rally is not just about creating consciousness, it is about more than just awakening the Hindu consciousness. One of our workers rightly said, \u2018This is also a rally to warn Hindus.\u2019 If you want to save the country, then create this kind of emotion inside this country, create conditions to organise Hindus. Take steps that will bring together different strands of the Hindu society into one thread. Aggressively do things that will execute our vision. That is why we created the Hindu Vahini.\u201d", "While it wasn\u2019t Yogi Adityanath who made the statement about raping dead bodies of Muslim women, an activist of the Hindu Yuva Vahini made the remark in his presence. Adityanath did not object to the speech. We were unable to find any reports of legal action taken against the activist. It is noteworthy that the founder of the Hindu Yuva Vahini is Yogi Adityanath himself.", "To sum it up, Abhijeet Banerjee\u2019s claim that Yogi Adityanath spoke of raping women of the Muslim community is incorrect. The objectionable remarks were in fact made by a worker of his organisation in his presence.", "Donate Now", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
