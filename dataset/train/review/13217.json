["Shortly after the governor of Nigeria\u2019s southern Ondo state, Rotimi Akeredolu, and his wife, Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, cast their votes during a local election on October 10, 2020, footage from a Nigerian TV station showing armed police shooting in the air surfaced on social media along with different claims.", "Akeredolu contested the election under Nigeria\u2019s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to secure his second term in office.", "But before he was officially declared the winner on October 11, 2020, numerous online posts, including this one on Facebook with more than 122,000 views, claimed that the TV clip showed an attack on voters by Akeredolu\u2019s security guards, leaving three people dead and his wife injured.", "The video clip was also shared in this tweet with claims that it shows an attack by supporters of Nigeria\u2019s main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).", "But the video is not recent and was taken more than two years earlier.", "Using the InVID-WeVerify tool, AFP Fact Check ran several reverse image searches on keyframes of the video. We then found a longer version of the clip published on YouTube in October 2018 by Nigerian television station ChannelsTV.", "The clip is the second in a series of reports shot by the network during a PDP primary election for an MP seat in Nigeria\u2019s southern Delta state ahead of the country\u2019s 2019 general elections.", "According to ChannelsTV, violence broke out at the polling venue in the capital Asaba following an argument among party delegates, which later prompted police to fire into the air.", "The TV banner in the original video reads: \u201cDELTA STATE PDP HOUSE OF REPS PRIMARY\u201d.", "The text was manipulated in the versions now being shared on social media, to read: \u201cAKEREDOLU\u2019S WIFE INJURED, 3 KILLED AS GOVERNOR\u2019S DETAILS INVADE PU\u201d as well as \u201cJEGEDE\u2019S WIFE SHOT, OTHERS INJURED AS PDP THUGS INVADE POLLING UNIT\u201d.", "Eyitayo Jegede was PDP\u2019s candidate in the state election.", "The ticker beneath the TV banner has also been changed to include\u00a0a message about face masks and then another about the governorship election, though it jumps choppily from one to the other and back again.", "AFP Fact Check confirmed the footage was indeed recorded in Nigeria\u2019s Delta state.", "Using Google Maps, we found a picture showing the exact location in Asaba called The Cenotaph. It serves as an event centre for special occasions, according to the state government.", "Physical features in the video, including the military statue, can be seen on the Google Maps image.", "ChannelsTV also spoke out against the misuse of its report.", "\u201cFAKE NEWS: The video below is doctored and is not part of Channels Television\u2019s coverage of the Ondo 2020 Governorship Election,\u201d reads a tweet by the TV station.", "FAKE NEWS: The video below is doctored and is not part of Channels Television's coverage of the Ondo 2020 Governorship Election.\n\n\t\tThe events playing out in the video is from an incident in Delta State two years ago.\n\n\t\tSee link to the original video: https://t.co/Q3AHXtNWaR pic.twitter.com/jZyTyrOHHO", "Anyanwu-Akeredolu has repeatedly dismissed the claim as untrue. \u201cThat is insane, that is absurd,\u201d she said in an interview with Channels Television alongside her husband.", "Shortly after the claim went viral, she addressed her purported\u00a0injury in a Facebook video, saying \u201cit\u2019s all false\u201d and that the claim shows what \u201cdistractors are trying to do to damage the exercise\u201d.", "Although there were reports of politically-fuelled clashes at some voting stations in Ondo state, no credible media organisations in Nigeria reported on violence at this particular venue.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
