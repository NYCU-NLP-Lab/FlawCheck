The Obama Government has outsourced the counting of votes for the 2012 election. But since WHEN does the nation need to outsource a task as uncomplicated and straightforward as vote-counting?", "2.) Obama outsourced the counting to a Tampa Florida company, named SOE, that had previously been used to administer the vote counting process for over 500 American jurisdictions.", "3.) But recently, SOE software has now been sold to a company named SCYTL, owned by George Soros, headquartered in Spain.", "4.) The votes will go to SCYTL, the question becomes as to WHY Must local votes for each precinct will be downloaded to SCYTL\u2019s main server \u2013 leaving no TRACEABLE record of how many, and what votes were scored! Which of course means that said votes will be MERGED; and any discrepancies at lower levels will be IMPOSSIBLE to track.", "5.)

In October 2010, officials in Washington, D.C., set up an Internet-based system for overseas and military voters to cast their ballots.", "During a one-week test period, the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics asked the public to test its integrity. Students from a University of Michigan class obliged and within 36 hours had posted the Michigan fight song on the website.", "\"Not only were they able to penetrate the system, but also they were monitoring what was going inside the system itself,\"  Alexander Shvartsman, professor at the University of Connecticut's Center for Voting Technology Research, said.", "He added that the students were also able to see the electronic signatures of hackers based in both China and Iran probing the D.C. site.

The big problem is that we make two demands of it that cannot be met simultaneously. We want voting to be very, very secure. And we want it to be very, very anonymous.", "Internet security is difficult under the best of conditions. But voting has the additional complication that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to remedy a breach. Most of the time, all that is at stake is money, and we know how to fix that. Identity theft is more complex but still there are remedies. A stolen vote is gone forever.", "Anonymity complicated the problem immensely. The usual way to secure an internet transaction to make certain that both the server and the person at the other end and who or what they claim to be. To cast a ballot at a polling place or vote an absentee ballot, you have to produce identification or, at a minimum, a signature that matches one on file. It's not perfect. but it's generally better than we can do on the internet. Then you are given a ballot or a card that activates an electronic voting machine, but there is no link between the ballot and  your identity, guaranteeing anonymity. This is really, really hard to simulate online. The more that is done to assure your identity, the harder it is to separate that identity from the vote that is cast.", "Furthermore, trust is central to elections and people, rightly, have their doubts about trusting online voting.", "We will see more trials in this year's voting. But widespread internet voting is still waiting for a day that may never come.", "Other experts in electronic voting security concur that such systems are very unlikely to be implemented in U.S. national elections for a long time yet:", "Some experts worry that security flaws still haven't been fixed and that federal elections are still decades away from going fully online.", "While some states and localities are taking baby steps to embrace new voting technology, it's not likely that online voting will come to the masses anytime soon, experts say.", "\"We still do not know as a society how to build secure electronic systems,\" said Alexander Shvartsman, professor at the University of Connecticut's Center for Voting Technology Research. \"Obviously an electronic voting system makes everything easier, but it has to be auditable.
