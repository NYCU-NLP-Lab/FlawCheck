The group pictured in the photograph was not \"celebrating abortions\" outside of a Planned Parenthood; rather, they were a\u00a0group of juggalos (fans of hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse) and the image has been circulating online since at least 2014:", "Although Fox News The FB Page is deliberately styled to visually mimic the official Fox News Facebook page, the two entities are not affiliated.
