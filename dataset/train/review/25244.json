The document\u00a0features a session called \u201cEpidemiological FAQs\u201d.", "The sentence highlighted in the image in the misleading posts can be found under the subheading \u201cCan reinfection occur?\"", "Below is a screenshot of the corresponding text on the Department of Health document highlighted in red by AFP:", "This section explains that recovered COVID-19 patients may still test\u00a0positive. This is because while COVID-19 tests can detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, it cannot detect whether the virus is \u201clive\u201d i.e. infective, or non-infective.", "In an email to AFP on June 29, a Department of Health spokesperson said: \u201cThe social media post contains selectively chosen information taken out of context from the Department of Health factsheet for Clinicians, along with complete inaccuracies.", "\u201cIn Australia, the benchmark test to diagnose acute COVID-19 infection is called a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. This test is very sensitive and detects tiny fragments of genetic information that are specific to the virus that causes COVID-19. The factsheet is actually dealing with COVID-19 positive people continuing to test positive after the infectious period has passed. It is true that the PCR may still result in a positive test, because of remaining non-infectious viral load within the patient.\u201d", "The spokesperson stressed the PCR test for COVID-19 is designed specifically for SARS-CoV-2: \u201cReal time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for SARS-COV-2 is specific to SARS-COV-2 and will reliably detect SARS-COV-2 RNA whether the virus is viable or not. The specific test for SARS-COV-2 will not detect other pathogens. Specific tests for other pathogens will not detect SARS-COV-2.\u201d", "Professor John Mathews, an epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne, also told AFP in an email dated June 29: \u201cThe claim that the PCR test cannot distinguish Covid from other viruses is FALSE, as the RNA is specific for each virus, and the PCR test for covid virus will not give a signal with swabs from people infected with other viruses.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
