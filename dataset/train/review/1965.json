It has functioned like a \"primary control knob\" that\u2019s been dialed up dramatically since humans began releasing significantly more amounts of CO2 into the air, mostly by burning fossil fuels, at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.", "\"A reasonable analogy can be drawn between the way that atmospheric CO2 controls the global temperature of the Earth, and how your house thermostat controls the temperature of your house,\" said Andrew Lacis, a climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.", "The NASA graph below shows the influence of greenhouse gas emissions, including a 40 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 since 1750 (green line), on the Earth\u2019s temperature (black line).", "Energy Secretary Rick Perry said, \"Most likely the primary control knob (for the earth\u2019s temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.\"", "Perry\u2019s claim contradicts settled science. While natural factors certainly affect the climate, human factors are the main contributor to global warming, and carbon dioxide has acted as the \"primary control knob\" governing the earth\u2019s relatively recent uptick in temperature.", "We rate Perry\u2019s statement False.", "CNBC interview with Rick Perry, June 19, 2017", "Bloomberg Businessweek, \"What\u2019s Really Warming the World?\" June 24, 2015", "National Aeronautics and Space Administration study published in Science, \"Atmospheric CO2: Principal Control Knob Governing Earth\u2019s Temperature,\" Oct. 15, 2010", "National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u00a0(NASA), \"CO2: The Thermostat that Controls Earth's Temperature,\" Oct. 2010", "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), \"Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers\"", "Time Magazine, \"Climate: Why CO2 Is the \"Control Knob\" for Global Climate Change,\" Oct. 14, 2010", "National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), \"Global Climate Change: Causes\"", "Climate Feedback, \"Energy Secretary Rick Perry incorrectly claims CO2 is not primary cause of climate change,\" June 20, 2017", "PolitiFact, \"EPA head Scott Pruitt says carbon dioxide is not 'primary contributor' to global warming,\" March 10, 2017", "Email interview with Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, June 21-22", "Email interview with Andrew Lacis, a climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, June 21-22", "Email interview with Reto Ruedy, a climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, June 21-22", "Email interview with Mark C.
