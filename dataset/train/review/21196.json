After that, it was on the employee.\"", "Now, we should note that in November 1994, voters narrowly approved Ballot Measure 8, which required public employees pay their share into retirement. The proposal was later invalidated by the Oregon Supreme Court, but in response some government bodies made plans to increase workers\u2019 pay to offset the pension pickup.", "That\u2019s what happened in Portland schools.

State government does that for 100 percent of its employees. Cities and counties for 85 percent of workers. School districts pick up the employee share for only 55 percent of its workers -- the lowest of any employer group.", "The ruling: Portland schools employees have paid the employee share of PERS pickup for years.
