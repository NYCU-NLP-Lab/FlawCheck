She proceeded to thank the questioner and added that it\u2019s a \"challenge\" to overcome the perception that the Democrats are captive to Wall Street.", "\"When you said, \u2018Wall Street,\u2019 I'm like, no -- Wall Street comes out en masse with its money against House Democrats every election,\" Pelosi said.", "Is Pelosi correct about Wall Street giving patterns to House Democrats and Republicans? Partly, but she leaves out some important context.", "We turned to the opensecrets.org website of the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign-finance data. The group compiles donation data by industry sector, so we looked at the category \"securities and investment.\" We looked specifically at dollars from PACs and individuals employed in the securities and investment sector that were given to Republican and Democratic House members.", "Here\u2019s the rundown going back to 1990, the earliest year available in the database.", "Election cycle", "To Democrats", "To Republicans", "More money given to", "Incumbent majority party", "2016", "$11.3 million", "$18.6 million", "R", "R", "2014", "$11.3 million", "$18.0 million", "R", "R", "2012", "$9.2 million", "$17.1 million", "R", "R", "2010", "$13.7 million", "$10.0 million", "D", "D", "2008", "$13.0 million", "$8.2 million", "D", "D", "2006", "$8.1 million", "$9.6 million", "R", "R", "2004", "$6.9 million", "$8.9 million", "R", "R", "2002", "$3.9 million", "$5.6 million", "R", "R", "2000", "$4.4 million", "$7.4 million", "R", "R", "1998", "$2.5 million", "$3.5 million", "R", "R", "1996", "$2.9 million", "$3.8 million", "R", "R", "1994", "$3.2 million", "$1.6 million", "D", "D", "1992", "$3.1 million", "$1.3 million", "D", "D", "1990", "$2.4 million", "$1.3 million", "D", "D", "We see two key takeaways.

The unshakeable pattern going back to 1990 is that the securities and investment sector has given to whichever party is holding the majority in the House at the beginning of the election cycle. Recently, that\u2019s been the Republicans -- but for five previous cycles, that\u2019s been the Democrats, including two when Pelosi herself served as speaker.", "In other words, contrary to Pelosi\u2019s implication, Wall Street doesn\u2019t have a firm ideological or partisan allegiance to the GOP. Rather, it has hedged its bets by disproportionately sending its money to whichever party holds the reins of power.", "Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist said it does seem like Wall Street has tended to support whatever party is in charge in the House. He dated that patten back to at least the 1980s, when then-Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., headed of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm.", "In that position, Coelho \"made a concerted, and highly successful, effort to attract far more business money to the Democrats,\" Loomis said. \"One of his major talking points was that since the Democrats were going to run the House for the foreseeable future, business would be smart to support and invest in the majority party.\"", "Loomis added that Coelho\u2019s strategy worked until the election of 1994 -- when the GOP won control of the House for the first time in four decades.", "We\u2019ll note that not all sectors have swung back and forth the way Wall Street has. For instance, for lawyers and labor unions, donations to Democrats have easily outpaced donations to Republicans in every campaign cycle going back to 1990. By contrast, donations from agribusiness and construction have been majority-Republican every cycle over the same period. For these industries, then, ideology or partisanship seems to play a bigger role in political giving than it does for Wall Street.", "Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, said the minority leader\u00a0\"was referring to her own experience in fundraising since becoming part of leadership in 2002.

However, it\u2019s important to note that in each of those cycles, the Republicans have held the majority in the House.
