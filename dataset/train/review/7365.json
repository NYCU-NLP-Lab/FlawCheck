Beckel worked in the U.S. Department of State during the Carter administration, served as the manager of Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign, and founded a \"grass roots\" lobbying firm in 1984; since then he has worked as a left-leaning political analyst and pundit writing columns for USA Today, co-hosting The Five for the Fox News Channel, and most recently offering commentary on the 2016 presidential election for CNN. But we found no evidence indicating that he has ever served as a Hillary Clinton campaign strategist.", "Wemple, Erik. \u00a0 \"CNN Hires Jolly Islamophobe Bob Beckel, Formerly of Fox News.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 21 October 2015.", "Title 18, U.S. Code. \u00a0 \"\u00a7 2381 - Treason.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 13 September 1994 \u00a0 (Updated.)", "The New York Times. \u00a0 \"Treason Against the United States.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 25 January 1861.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
