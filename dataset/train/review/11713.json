But a reverse image search revealed it was used in a video about Turkana, published on YouTube by the radio station Capital FM on September 2, 2011.", "The same image can also be seen in recent tweets that use the hashtag #TurkanaDrought or include the phrase \u201cTurkana hunger\u201d.", "In the Capital FM video, the man is identified as Kaler Uyereng, one of the millions of people affected by the 2011 drought which severely hit Kenya, forcing the then president Mwai Kibaki to declare a national emergency.", "The second image shows a boy surrounded by the carcasses of dead animals. Similarly, some posts have suggested that it shows the current situation in northern Kenya.", "However, a reverse image search showed that the picture had been posted on the website of the charity World Vision in 2017. It was accompanied by the caption: \u201c9-year-old Ejiem sits with the carcass of his favorite sheep, Merireng, in Turkana, Kenya. The East Africa drought has caused the death of many animals like Merireng. (\u00a92017 World Vision/photo by Jon Warren)\u201d.", "Similarly, a photo of a woman and two children feeding on dry bones, which is being used in social media posts to illustrate the current drought, is also a photograph from the\u00a0World Vision website. It does show a drought in Turkana county, but it was again taken in 2017.", "The fourth image shows a little boy lying on his stomach and drinking from a pool of muddy water.", "But a reverse image search on Google revealed the image was in fact taken in 2009 by a photographer for Reuters news agency in Ethiopia, during a severe drought which also hit Uganda, Somalia, and Kenya.", "A caption on it read: \u201cA boy drinks water from a pond in Bule Duba village in the outskirts of Moyale, near the edge of Oroma and Somali regions of Ethiopia, June 12, 2009.\u201d", "Finally, a fifth image shows a distraught mother carrying her starving child, whose ribs are protruding and can easily be counted. The\u00a0image was shared on this Facebook group, which has more than 350,000 members.", "This image was in fact taken by an AFP photographer in 1993 in Kongor, in what is today South Sudan.", "BBC reporter Roncliffe Odit has been in Turkana this week and has been documenting the effects of the drought in photos posted on Twitter. Speaking to AFP by telephone, Odit confirmed that he met many people suffering from desperate hunger.", "\u201cWe landed in Turkana on Friday, March 15, 2019, to do a totally different story but changed our course when we saw the drought conversation trending on social media. Our editor asked us to go into the villages to find out if it was indeed true what was being reported online. We headed to a village outside Lodwar town where we were met by faces that speak of severe starvation,\u201d Odit told us.", "\u201cI met a blind woman in her 80s living alone as her two sons have moved away with the livestock to look for pasture. She had not eaten for three days, and her neighbours told me that they strived to bring her at least some porridge when they could.\"", "On Sunday, I personally captured this photo of Mama Mariam Loolio, 85, and blind.
