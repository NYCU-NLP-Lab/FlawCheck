Now he says he's very pro-life.\"", "\"I am so glad Mr. Trump has seen the light,\" Palin responded, saying it was sad that anti-abortion groups were giving the candidate a hard time about his switch when other people who have had a change of heart on the issue have been celebrated.", "She cited, as an example, singer Justin Bieber.", "Tapper didn't quite understand and, in essence, asked her, what do you mean?", "Bieber \"has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him,\" Palin said. \"He\u2019s just one example.\"", "We wondered whether the pop star really had the same type of conversion as Trump or whether Palin had gone overboard.", "Trump's\u00a0change of position\u00a0on the abortion question is well-established. When Trump was first considering a third-party presidential run in 1999, he said on NBC's Meet the Press that although he hated the concept of abortion, \"I am pro-choice in every respect.\" By mid\u00a0February 2011, when there was talk again that he would run for president, he declared, \"I am pro-life.\"", "Whether the\u00a0Biebs transitioned from abortion support to abortion opposition is not as clear.", "We contacted Palin through her political action committee and sought comment from Bieber through the office of his manager, Scooter Braun.

No pressure.", "The only reference to the abortion issue we could find was Bieber's interview with Rolling Stone, published in February 2011. He was 16 at the time.", "\"I really don't believe in abortion. I think (an embryo) is a human,\" Bieber told the magazine. \"It's like killing a baby.\"", "When he was asked about abortion in cases of rape, his response was, \"Um. Well, I think that's really sad, but everything happens for a reason. I don't know how that would be a reason. I guess I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that.\"", "The rape comment in particular caused some controversy at the time, and since then Bieber has shied away from the issue.", "He got drawn back into it peripherally when his mother, Pattie Mallette, a born-again Christian, promoted a short anti-abortion film in 2013. Mallette had previously written of the pressure she experienced to have an abortion when she was 17 and carrying the now-pop superstar.", "The Chicago Sun-Times said in a Jan. 21, 2013, story that it had spoken with an unnamed \"longtime Bieber associate\" who claimed, \"I don't believe he agrees with his mom on this issue.\"", "Some might interpret that to mean that Bieber is now pro-abortion \u2014 which would signal a new position on abortion that, sorry, does not fit Palin\u2019s point.
