In response, several state legislatures introduced bills that would prohibit transgender students from being part of teams that don\u2019t match their sex assigned at birth.", "(Screenshot from TikTok)", "The viral TikTok posts contain a hint of truth about this legislation, but their primary claim is misleading.", "Congress and state legislatures \u2014 not schools \u2014 have introduced bills targeting transgender student-athletes.

She said the TikTok posts leave out some key details.", "\"None of them require a teacher to do a physical examination for a student,\" Oakley said. \"However, several of them would require that a student would undergo a physical examination by a doctor \u2014\u00a0and that doctor would have to attest that they've done a variety of different things. In some of the states, it\u2019s really invasive, gruesome testing.\"", "As an example, Oakley pointed to a passed Idaho law that banned transgender women and girls from participating in women\u2019s sports. (The law is currently not being enforced as it undergoes a legal challenge.)", "\"If disputed, a student may establish sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex based solely on: (a) The student's internal and external reproductive anatomy; (b) The student's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone; and (c) An analysis of the student's genetic makeup,\" the March 2020 law said.", "In an April 2020 lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union argued that the Idaho law \"discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status\" and the doctor\u2019s examinations would \"intrude upon the privacy and bodily autonomy of all women and girls engaged in student athletics.\" The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman who wanted to run cross-country at Boise State University.", "In August, a federal judge blocked the law, saying the ACLU was \"likely to succeed in establishing the Act is unconstitutional as currently written.\" The law now awaits legal review in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.", "Meanwhile, several other states \u2014 including neighboring Montana and Utah \u2014 are trying to pass their own versions of the Idaho law.", "RELATED:\u00a0Biden signs executive order banning discrimination against transgender service members", "And in Congress, Rep.
