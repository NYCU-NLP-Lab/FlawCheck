["About this rating", "After Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-California) delivered an eight-hour speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives pushing for a vote on DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) in February 2018, dubious web sites claimed that Pelosi's house had a wall around it. The idea \u2014 pushed by sites like\u00a0DC Whispers\u00a0Facebook page \"The Political Insider\" \u2014 is that the house minority leader is a hypocrite for advocating against a border wall and for protections for undocumented immigrants who arrived the U.S. as children:", "Nancy Pelosi really-really likes walls\u2026around her mansion. Her home sits atop a twelve-foot-high wall that keeps her well above the riff-raff that are her ultra-wealthy fellow millionaire neighbors.", "And yet she's against building walls to keep America safe?", "Gee, kinda sounds a little hypocritical don't you think?", "Setting aside the disparities between a border wall and a wall around a piece of personal property, there's a much bigger problem with this meme: this isn't Pelosi's house.", "\ufeff", "The pictured property is located at 2724 Pacific Avenue in Pacific Heights, a wealthy area of San Francisco. The house was designed by E.A. Hermann, constructed in 1894 and was the most expensive house on the San Francisco market in 2013 (it eventually sold for $24 million in 2015). However, Pelosi doesn't own it.", "The confusion likely stems from a virtual tour of the mansion published\u00a0in\u00a0Forbes\u00a0in 2013. The writer of the article mentioned Pelosi because her house was in the same neighborhood and could be seen from one of the mansion's wraparound porches:", "Next we climb the stairs and venture out onto the wraparound porches to take in palatial views of the city. Straight ahead, miles past the adjoining estate owned by the Dolby family (of Dolby Labs), lies the peak of the Transamerica Pyramid; to the left, past Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi's red brick manse, lies the Bay and in it the infamous island of Alcatraz.", "It's true that Pelosi lives (or lived) in Pacific Heights, but we couldn't find much information about the House Minority Leader's San Francisco home. We did, however, find a few photographs of Pelosi's \"red brick manse\" from a 2007 protest that was staged outside the property.", "The New York Times\u00a0reported at the time:", "Using a tactic usually trained on the home turf of President Bush, a group of protesters from Code Pink, a women's antiwar group, have camped in front of the home of Speaker Nancy Pelosi here, bringing their message - and mattresses - to the doorstep of the nation's highest-ranking Democrat.", "As far as we can tell, there was no wall separating Pelosi's home from the protesters.", "Pelosi wasn't the first politician to be called a hypocrite for simultaneously being anti-border wall but pro-home wall. After Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) delivered a rebuttal to Donald Trump's February 2018 state of the union address, a photograph purportedly showing a wall around his Palm Beach home appeared online. In that instance, the pictured house also did not belong to Joe Kennedy \u2014 although his family did own that home until the future congressman was 14. The wall in the photograph was not a security wall, but a seawall\u00a0built to protect the oceanfront property from water damage.", "In January 2019, a similar accusation was made against Pelosi\u00a0that was centered on her property along the\u00a0Napa River in California. The creator of that meme was at least able to use a photograph actually showing a Pelosi-owned property. However, the \"wall\" in question was no more than a few feet high, appeared decorative in nature, and only covered the main entrance (it does not surround the entire property).", "You can read more about the \"wall,\" or lack thereof, at Pelosi's\u00a0California estate here.", "Anderson, Lamar. \u00a0 \"2724 Pacific in Pacific Heights Sells for $23.889M, Is Biggest Sale of the Year.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Curbed SF. \u00a0 25 March 2015.", "Brennan, Morgan. \u00a0 \"Touring San Francisco's Most Expensive Home For Sale.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Forbes. \u00a0 30 July 2013.", "McKinley, Jesse. \u00a0 \"Home in San Francisco, Pelosi Gets the Crawford Treatment.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 13 March 2007.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
