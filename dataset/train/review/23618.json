["About this rating", "In March 2016, Vermont senator\u00a0Bernie Sanders swept the Democratic caucuses of Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington state in\u00a0Presidential primaries. \u00a0Not long after that, pundits wrote several articles claiming that Sanders did well because all some or all of the three\u00a0states are not particularly ethnically diverse (Sanders has not been doing well with black voters compared to\u00a0Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and his supporters have been portrayed as overwhelmingly white).", "According to CNN:", "These caucus states \u2014 largely white and rural \u2014 are the type of places Sanders traditionally does well. In order to win the nomination, he must replicate this success in other, more ethnically diverse states that hold primaries, as he did in Michigan last month.", "And in CNN's\u00a0international edition:", "The Atlantic made a similar claim:", "As voters gathered in Washington, caucuses also began in Alaska, which will\u00a0award 16 delegates based on today\u2019s results. There\u2019s been little polling in Alaska, but one in January showed that among both Democrats and no party voters, Bernie Sanders was ahead. The state\u2019s largely white electorate might also stand to benefit Sanders, who has struggled to gain traction with minority voters.", "Washington Post\u00a0appeared to continue the narrative\u00a0that Sanders does better in states with less diversity with a 27 March 2016 piece originally titled \"Why Did Bernie Sanders Dominate Saturday? Caucuses in Whiter States\" \u2014 thereby implying that outside their relatively small black populations, Alaska and Hawaii are overwhelmingly \"white\":", "As we've noted before, there's also a clear link between the number of black voters in a contest and the result. Hawaii is 3 percent black. Alaska is four percent black; Washington, about the same. When the composition of the black Democratic electorate has been below seven percent for states where Democratic primary exit polling in 2008 or 2016 was available, Clinton has lost by an average of 30 points this year. Over that percentage? She's won by 26.", "The latter part of the article's title was later amended to read \"Caucuses in States with Smaller Black Populations,\" and the following note was appended to the article:", "This post was updated with results and demographics from Hawaii, and the headline was changed to be more specific.", "Alaska and Hawaii in particular are among the top most ethnically and linguistically diverse states in the U.S., which media coverage seemed to overlook despite several\u00a0previous stories on the subject\u00a0(sometimes in the very same publications) about the \"surprising diversity\" of both states. \u00a0As I wrote in 2014:", "While the state has always been diverse, its heterogeneity has increased significantly in the past decade. The economic draw provided by\u00a0seasonal fishing work\u00a0and\u00a0oil industries\u00a0have contributed to the spike. The most recent recession may have tamped down social mobility and smothered hopes of finding a better life for many immigrants in the contiguous United States, but\u00a0Alaska\u2019s economy remained strong\u00a0throughout the 2000s by comparison. Another big employer is the military, which has a sizable presence: Alaska has\u00a0nine military bases throughout the state. These job opportunities mean the state has gone from having an overwhelmingly white population to having\u00a0the most diverse counties and neighborhoods in the nation.\u00a0And as in the rest of the country, studies indicate that Latino populations are driving\u00a0this dramatic change.", "Similar drivers contribute to Hawaii's growing\u00a0diversity, particularly\u00a0marriage and families:", "Sarah C.W. Yuan, a demographer at the University of Hawaii's Center on the Family, said the racial trends reflect growth and acceptance of multiracial marriages and an increased willingness of people to claim more than one racial identity. She said the decline in people identifying with one race only, from 78.6% in 2000 to 76.4% in the 2010 Census, was expected.", "\"Hawaii's population has been more diverse over the years,\" she said. \"There are many multiracial marriages, so we do see two-or-more-race groups increase over the years.\"", "The\u00a0perceived whitewashing was not\u00a0lost on Twitter. Before long, #BernieMadeMeWhite was trending:", ".@HillyesRose @MisaelFrancoO @TheBpDShow @cenkuygur Ever since I voted for Bernie, I've been bingewatching Friends. #BernieMadeMeWhite", "\u2014 L.

However, it's definitively untrue that any of the three states are rural and ethnically homogenous, as some outlets outright stated.
