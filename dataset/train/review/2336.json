Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, in the U.S. Senate contest. The ad is airing in the Tampa and Orlando media markets.", "We have previously fact-checked similar claims about Rubio\u2019s position on Social Security and Medicare cuts and found them Half True.

Republican leaders emphasized the broader aspects of the plan about reducing the size of government while Democrats emphasized the impact on education and disease research (the National Institutes of Health would also have been hit).", "In a statement after the vote, Rubio said that he supported the Republican plan but said more time should be spent to overhaul entitlements:", "\"I supported this first step towards getting our fiscal house in order, but the truth is that America has reached a point where saving $57 billion is a mere drop in the bucket when compared to our $14 trillion debt. While reducing discretionary spending is an important goal, Washington is devoting a disproportionate amount of time to a tiny slice of the budget while ignoring the fact that continued inaction on saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is bankrupting our country.\"", "Here are some examples of the education cuts:", "\u2022 Title I education spending.

Although he wants to get rid of the education department, he supports efforts to make higher education affordable. Rubio also supports less federal involvement and more state and local control.
