["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on April 2, 2020", "A false claim that students in Missouri will have to repeat the school year was pushed online through a viral letter with a state logo as part of an April Fool\u2019s hoax. State officials have publicly debunked the claim.", "A fictitious letter that circulated on Facebook as part of an apparent April Fool\u2019s joke stirred confusion about whether students in the state would need to repeat the school year.", "While many shared the phony letter in jest, the falsehood arrived amid the rapidly changing interruptions of everyday life in Missouri and across the U.S. as the country confronts the novel coronavirus outbreak. That combination worked to deceive some, apparently, and prompted state officials to publicly address the hoax.", "The fake letter, dated April 1, claimed that \u201cMissouri case law on education makes it very clear that if students can not take the necessary final exams in a class room setting & they can not complete the curriculum that was established at the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year no one enrolled in a public school in the state of Missouri can be allowed to be promoted to their next grade level.", "\u201cThis means that whatever grade each of your students started at in August of 2019 will need to be repeated,\u201d it read.", "The false claim was not unique \u2014 we wrote about a spate of similar April Fool\u2019s headlines from a prank-generating website \u2014 but it went further by employing the official logo of the Missouri Department of Elementary & Secondary Education. The letter\u2019s detail about final exams may have also been read as a reference to the department\u2019s recent (actual) announcement to cancel statewide required assessments this year.", "Mallory McGowin, a spokeswoman for the department, told us in an interview that the agency received multiple inquiries about the fake letter.", "\u201cWe were getting approached by several different of our stakeholder groups inquiring about this or letting us know this was an issue unfolding pretty quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause of the current times, I think in some people\u2019s minds, it seemed like it could be a logical conclusion from what\u2019s been happening.\u201d", "\u201cIt seems particularly insensitive given the circumstances and given the anxiety and uncertainty that our students, parents and educators are already facing,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s really no room for that kind of misinformation to spread right now.\u201d", "The education department \u2014 and Gov. Mike Parson \u2014 took to social media to publicly debunk the letter.", "\u201cWe could not be more disappointed that someone chose to use their free time to create this document, illegally using our department logo, and make a joke about something as serious as our students\u2019 education,\u201d the department wrote in part.", "One Missouri principal commented and thanked the department for \u201cclearing this up. I had parents very concerned. Not funny.\u201d Other commenters deemed it an obvious April Fool\u2019s prank and observed that the letter was signed by \u201cCandice B. Fureal\u201d (which sounds like \u201ccan this be for real\u201d).", "As of now, all of the state\u2019s 555 school districts and charter schools are closed. The earliest some are currently permitted to reopen is April 6, but that is likely to change as the state navigates the outbreak. The state has reported more than 1,800 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, which caused the COVID-19 disease, and 19 deaths.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
