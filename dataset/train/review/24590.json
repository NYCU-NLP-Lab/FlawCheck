["About this rating", "Studies suggest that eye contact between humans and their furry companions increases concentrations of oxytocin \u2014 the so-called happy hormone \u2014 in one another and offers protection to their packmate during what is perceived to be a vulnerable moment. Furthermore, all adult members of a wild wolf pack are known to practice scent-marking behavior by urinating along territory boundaries, making urination a socially bonding practice.", "Though it is believed that dogs often follow their owners into the bathroom as part of a biologically earned social trait, the exact mechanisms underlying this behavior remain poorly understood and broadly contested within the scientific community.", "For dog owners who have noticed their furry friends regularly following them into the bathroom or pawing beneath the door and wondered why, social media posts offer this answer: Your dog is trying to protect you.", "The claim has made the internet rounds for decades and again came to the forefront when TikTok user mavandmel posted a video in December 2020 that showed her golden retriever following her into the bathroom.", "\u201cYou know when you keep trying to go to the bathroom and [the dog] keeps trying to nose their way in or they\u2019re always standing at the door,\u201d said the golden retriever's owner, whose video had been shared more than 48,000 times as of this writing. \u201cWolves and wild dogs, they protect one another while one goes to the bathroom because when you\u2019re going to the bathroom, you\u2019re vulnerable. So, they stand guard!\u201d", "Snopes readers asked our team to verify whether this TikTok explanation accurately accounts for the affectionate toilet behavior of our furry companions. We found that though there is some level of truth to the claim, generally speaking, this type of behavior is one learned more from nurture than nature.", "For millennia, humans and dogs have grown alongside one another to form very special evolutionary bonds. In fact, research suggests that the domestication of dogs occurred at least 20,000 years ago, but likely closer to 40,000 years ago. It may come as no surprise, then, that the two species are capable of reading one another \u2014 from the dog\u2019s ability to understand both the words and tone of human speech to being able to communicate with its owner through facial expressions.", "But do dogs carefully watch their toilet-seated owners in order to protect them? That remains to be scientifically proven.", "In the wild, wolves have been shown to mark their territorial boundaries using the scent of their urine \u2014 a trait that pet dogs have brought with them into their neighborhood environments. This same behavior suggests that both wild and domesticated canines use olfactory cues to communicate with other members of their species. And when it comes to protection, canines are known to defend members of their pack from predators and perceived threats, contributing to the strong societal and familial bonds that both wolves and pet dogs share with their families.", "Members of the Yellowstone Druid wolf pack chase down an elk. NPS/Doug Smith", "That loving connection extends to the human-canine relationship as well. Research published in the journal Science found that shared eye contact between humans and their furry companions increases concentrations of oxytocin \u2014 the so-called happy hormone \u2014 in much the same way humans may bond emotionally when they gaze into another person\u2019s eyes.", "That loving connection extends to the human-canine relationship as well. Research published in the journal Science found that shared eye contact between humans and their furry companions increases concentrations of oxytocin \u2014 the so-called happy hormone \u2014 in much the same way humans may bond emotionally when they gaze into another person\u2019s eyes.", "\u201cHuman-like modes of communication, including mutual gaze, in dogs, may have been acquired during domestication with humans,\u201d wrote the study authors at the time, adding that wolves rarely engage in eye contact with their human handlers. \u201cWe show that gazing behavior from dogs, but not wolves, increased urinary oxytocin concentrations in owners, which consequently facilitated owners\u2019 affiliation and increased oxytocin concentration in dogs.\u201d", "While the scientific literature has shown strong evidence for communication and bonding through the act of urinating and other bonding behavior in both canine and human-canine relationships, it does not prove that dogs go into the bathroom with their owner to protect them. Rather, it more than likely simply reflects a desire to be closer to their humans.", "Snopes spoke with Paul Mundell, executive director of the American Service Dog Access Coalition, who said that although he has not systematically studied the question, he is skeptical of the claim that dogs who look intently at their owners while defecating are seeking assurance that either the owner will protect the dog or vice versa.", "\u201cI think it\u2019s more plausible to consider the habit established during puppyhood \u2014 if the puppy was picked up and moved while defecating in an \u2018inappropriate\u2019 area, or if it was scolded or punished for defecating in a particular area, it\u2019s reasonable that the puppy got in the habit of watching the owner to ensure all was okay while defecating,\u201d Mundell said.", "\u201cConversely, if the pup was rewarded for defecating in the right areas, it may have set up the expectation that defecating may be followed by a reward \u2014 even if the owner hasn\u2019t maintained the practice.\u201d", "Mundell remained equally as skeptical when it came to describing the behavior of a pup following a person into the bathroom for \u201cprotection,\u201d particularly as the bathroom is not likely to be considered an unsafe space. During thunderstorms or fireworks, for example, dogs will often turn to the confined, isolated space of a bathroom or bathtub for security.", "\u201cFor some dogs, following a person into the bathroom is the same behavior they display whenever their person goes anywhere \u2014 they follow them in order to remain near them. This is most pronounced in dogs displaying hyper-attachment to their owners,\u201d said Mundell, comparing the bond to that of children with their parents. Going to the bathroom provides an opportunity for our furry friends to interact with their uninterrupted owners, who may otherwise be occupied with chores, the computer, or other things that distract from petting and attention.", "Finally, dogs live in an olfactory world, and Mundell says that the urine and feces humans produce contain uniquely personal mixtures of volatile organic compounds due to each person\u2019s individual metabolisms, diets, and microbiomes \u2014 all of which may be interesting and even rewarding information to the dog.", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
