["By Robert Farley", "Posted on October 27, 2016", "A Democratic ad falsely accused Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey\u2019s bank of using a \u201ccontroversial\u201d loan tactic that forced 21 people out of their homes. In fact, only two of them lost houses, and there is no evidence that either home was a primary residence.", "The ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee was later revised after the Toomey campaign protested, but we find the revised ad, while tilting closer to the facts, is still misleading.", "As images of stressed people are shown in their homes, the revised ad claims a bank co-founded by Toomey \u201cforc[ed] small-business owners out of their homes.\u201d There is no evidence that any business owner was forced out of a primary residence.", "By way of background, Toomey co-founded Team Capital Bank along with a Lehigh Valley attorney in 2005, after Toomey had left Congress. The bank grew to a dozen branches in Pennsylvania and New Jersey before merging with another bank in 2013. Toomey\u2019s disclosure forms indicate\u00a0that at the time of the transactions, he owned bank stock worth between $500,001 and $1 million.", "The ad alleges that the bank engaged in \u201ca lending practice so outrageous most states banned it.\u201d", "The practice in question is what is called a \u201cconfession of judgment.\u201d It is designed to expedite the foreclosure process for lenders when a borrower fails to make loan payments. Without it, if a borrower defaulted on a loan, the bank would have to file a lawsuit demanding payment. It is a process that can get tied up in courts for years. By signing a confession of judgment, borrowers agree to waive due process and allow the bank to obtain a judgment against them without a hearing.", "It is, in fact, prohibited in many states. It is permitted in Pennsylvania, but only for commercial loans.", "We won\u2019t go too much further into the weeds on this, but suffice it to say that those who represent commercial borrowers find the practice heavy-handed in favor of lenders, while those who represent lenders argue that it is a reasonable tool to ensure lenders will get paid in a timely manner.", "\u201cIt certainly is a very quick process,\u201d David Schwager, an attorney who specializes in real estate, mortgage foreclosure and creditors\u2019 rights, business formation and governance, and business litigation, told us in a phone interview. But there are some legal options for someone to fight the execution of a foreclosure on a home.", "Erica Crohn Minchella, an attorney in Illinois \u2014 which similarly allows confessions of judgment for commercial loans \u2014 said that as a consumer attorney she finds the tactic \u201cheavy-handed.\u201d", "\u201cBut were I on the other side, there absolutely are instances where it would be appropriate to use, because you may not get paid otherwise,\u201d she said.", "Regardless of which side of that argument one falls on, it is a legal practice in Pennsylvania. We spoke to several Pennsylvania lawyers who represent borrowers and lenders in commercial mortgages, and they all told us that \u201cconfession of judgment\u201d clauses are included in almost all commercial loans in the state.", "\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not unusual in Pennsylvania,\u201d Schwager said. \u201cIt\u2019s standard.\u201d", "Let\u2019s compare the two versions of the ad. The original begins with the narrator saying, \u201cImagine: the bank forces you out. No warning, no hearing. It\u2019s a lending practice so outrageous most states banned it.\u201d", "The revised version states, \u201cImagine, the bank starts forcing you out. No warning, no hearing.\u201d", "The emphasis on the word \u201cstarts\u201d is ours, because it signals a subtle but important shift in the ad\u2019s claim. Lawyers told us that even after a confession of judgment is filed, the borrower could still contest it, as well as the foreclosure of a personal residence. And the borrower could very well end up with a hearing.", "Lauren Passalacqua, a spokeswoman for the DSCC, said the point of the ad isn\u2019t that there are no legal options in \u201cconfession of judgment\u201d cases, \u201cit\u2019s that you don\u2019t have as many.\u201d", "The original ad then went on to say, \u201cBut at the bank owned by Pat Toomey, it was business as usual. Forcing 21 small-business owners out of their homes.\u201d", "The revised version says, \u201cBut at the bank founded by Pat Toomey it was business as usual, forcing small-business owners out of their homes.\u201d Notice the number of small businesses \u2014 21 \u2014 has been dropped.", "The original claim was based on a Politico Pro story on Oct. 7 that stated, \u201cThe bank also used a controversial foreclosure method called a \u2018confession of judgment\u2019 to foreclose on at least 21 homes in the state that were used as collateral by small business owners.\u201d (Politico Pro is available only to paid subscribers.)", "But that turned out to be wrong. The Toomey campaign provided documentation showing there were 21 \u201cconfession of judgment\u201d actions filed by the bank in 12 cases (in other words, many were repeats), and that just three ultimately resulted in a foreclosure. One of the properties was a warehouse, and the other two were residential properties.", "The Politico Pro story now carries a clarification that states, \u201cThis story has been updated to better reflect the confessions of judgment\u2019s role in starting the foreclosure process, which in the instances cited did not result in anyone losing a primary residence.\u201d", "The DSCC points to the two cases of residential properties being foreclosed to back up the revised ad\u2019s claim that the bank was responsible for \u201cforcing small-business owners out of their homes.\u201d", "But the DSCC provided no evidence that the two foreclosed houses were the primary residences of the borrowers. The Toomey campaign provided us with loan documents that show that one property was listed as vacant when the loan was executed, and in the other, the address of the property used as collateral was not the same as the addresses of any of the co-signers of the loan. In other words, there isn\u2019t any evidence that anyone was kicked out of their primary home.", "Passalacqua, of the DSCC, said the Toomey campaign\u2019s documents essentially admit that \u201cTeam Capital bank foreclosed on properties using confessions of judgment \u2013 including residential properties.\u201d", "\u201cTheir letter references at least two examples of residential properties that were foreclosed on,\u201d Passalacqua told us via email. \u201cWe never stated these properties were primary residences, and it is clear that these people did lose their residential properties \u2013 or their homes \u2013 whether they lived in them or not.\u201d", "We think the wording of the ad \u2014 that Toomey\u2019s bank was responsible for \u201cforcing small-business owners out of their homes\u201d \u2014 leaves the clear impression that people were forced out of their primary residences, not that they may have lost secondary homes used as collateral for a commercial loan.", "The Toomey campaign sent station managers airing the ad a letter demanding that it be pulled because the ad was false. The attorneys argued the claim about the bank forcing \u201c21 small-business owners out of their home\u201d was \u201ccategorically false and defamatory.\u201d", "The DSCC then made the revised ad. Passalacqua told us it would not be fair to characterize the original ad as \u201cbeing pulled.\u201d", "\u201cWe produced a near-identical replacement at the request of one station and also made available to others,\u201d she said, noting that some stations continued to air the original ad.", "The Toomey campaign has sent another letter to stations about the revised ad, claiming it \u201ccontinues to make the same unsupported, defamatory representations.\u201d Specifically, the campaign argues that the foreclosed properties in question could not credibly be called someone\u2019s \u201chome.\u201d The DSCC says the revised ad will continue to air across the state.", "Toomey is facing a challenge to his senatorial seat from Democrat Katie McGinty in a race that has been rated as a \u201ctoss-up\u201d by The Cook Political Report.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ce71e252-8128-4c05-bec6-f0f7b7b59f73", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
