Dragons to be reintroduced to Wales after an absence of more than a 1000 years , local conservation groups say they are pleased by the move that will put a large preditor back in the food chain ....  There have been concern shown by the farming community due to the risk of predation to livestock but the Welsh assembly say they are willing to pay compesation to farmers who can prove loss, the other danger with the dragons eating habits of taking virgins is not thought to be a problem as they went extinct in Wales may years ago anyway......", "The above-displayed photo does not, of course, show a real baby dragon.

You may use photos of dinosaur models, but (as always) the standard copyright rules apply.", "In addition to the image's source (a site dedicated to digital art\u00a0contests) and the fact that dragons don't exist, the creator of the digital baby dragon provided the source images used:", "This is not the first time that rumors that\u00a0dragons actually are\u00a0real (complete with \"photo proof\")\u00a0have\u00a0swirled around the internet. In March 2015, images of a dragon sculpture were shared as authentic, and in June 2015, a digital artist added wings to a picture of a Satanic Leaf-Tailed Gecko\u00a0and then\u00a0passed it off as a photo of a real dragon.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
