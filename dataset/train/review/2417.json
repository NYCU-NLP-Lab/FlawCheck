["About this rating", "In the early 1800s, the United States mistakenly built a fortress on the wrong side of the U.S.-Canada border. This fort became colloquially known as \"Fort Blunder.\"", "The viral image actually shows the remnants of \"Fort Montgomery,\" a second military base that was built atop the ruins of Fort Blunder after the United States obtained the land from Canada in the 1840s.", "An interesting piece of U.S.-Canadian history is often circulated on social media in the form of a meme that reads: \"This is Fort Blunder. It was built by the USA in 1818 on Lake Champlain to protect the USA from British / Canadian attacks. After spending 2 years & $275,000, surveyors discovered a problem: The fort was built on the wrong side of the border.\"", "The story relayed in this meme is largely accurate.
