["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on January 25, 2018", "President Donald Trump and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway have been boasting lately about the increase in the number of women employees on the president\u2019s watch as a sign of economic progress. But this is a misleading talking point.", "It\u2019s true that 863,000 women joined the workforce during the president\u2019s first 11 months in office,\u00a0according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that\u2019s 34 percent less\u00a0than the number of women workers that were added over the same period, from January to December, in each of the last two years.", "In fact, it\u2019s the smallest increase since 2012 and below the historical norm for the past 54 years, dating to 1964.", "During a women\u2019s event at the White House earlier this month, Trump said his administration is making \u201cincredible progress.\u201d The president said he is \u201cvery proud\u201d that \u201con my watch\u201d there are \u201cmore women in the workforce today than ever before.\u201d", "Trump, Jan. 16:\u00a0We\u2019re making incredible progress. The women\u2019s unemployment rate hit the lowest level that it\u2019s been in 17 years. Well, that\u2019s something. And women in the workforce reached a record high. More women in the workforce today than ever before. That\u2019s really terrific, and especially since it\u2019s on my watch. I feel very proud of that.", "Conway repeated those talking points during an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on Jan. 22, a day after the\u00a0Women\u2019s March.", "Cuomo asked if the president had insulted the marchers and made \u201ca joke out of their march\u201d when\u00a0he\u00a0tweeted\u00a0that women should march to \u201ccelebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months.\u201d Conway disagreed.", "\u201cIt\u2019s no joke that the women\u2019s unemployment rate is the lowest in 17 years,\u201d Conway replied. \u201cIt is no joke that over a half a million new women entered the workforce on his watch.\u201d", "Let\u2019s put these claims into context, because there\u2019s less here than meets the eye.", "First, the women\u2019s unemployment rate \u2014 and the unemployment rate in general \u2014 has been trending down for several years. The women\u2019s rate had reached a 10-year low of 4.5 percent under President Barack Obama in December 2016. That rate dropped under Trump to 4.0 percent in December, the lowest since November 2000. That\u2019s a 17-year low, as Trump and Conway said.", "As for the number of women employees, there were nearly 73 million women workers as of December \u2014 which is indeed\u00a0\u201cmore women in the workforce than ever before,\u201d as Trump said. But, as the U.S. population grows, that statement can be made\u00a0almost every year.", "In only five of the last 54 years has the number of women in the workforce declined from the previous year, and those were all during or following recessions (1982, 2001-2002, and 2008-2009). The chart below shows the nearly relentless climb in the number of women in the workforce at the end of each year since 1964.", "And, while the number of women workers increased under Trump, the labor participation rate for women remained unchanged after 11 months at 56.9 percent in December. (That\u2019s the percentage of all women 16 years and older working or actively seeking work.)", "How many women joined the workforce under Trump?", "Conway said that \u201cover a half a million new women entered the workforce on his watch.\u201d That\u2019s right, too, but entirely without context.", "Under Trump, the number of women employees grew by 863,000 \u2014 a 1.2 percent increase since January. (For Trump, we measure the change between January\u2019s number and December\u2019s number, because BLS conducts its monthly employment survey during\u00a0the week that includes the 12th day.\u00a0Trump took office Jan. 20, 2017, so Obama was president when the January survey was taken.)", "But that increase was\u00a0the smallest 11-month gain since 2012, when the number of women workers increased by 816,000, or 1.2 percent. It was also 34 percent lower than the 1.3 million women workers that were added in each of the last 11 months in 2015 and 2016.", "The 863,000 increase in women workers in Trump\u2019s first 11 months is also below the historical norm.\u00a0The average increase over the last 54 years, from 1964 to 2017, was 936,000, when measured for the 11-month period of January to December. The median (midpoint) was an increase of 1,045,000.", "The chart above shows the change in the number of women employees from January to December of each year since 1964, based on BLS monthly data.", "The 863,000 increase under Trump ranked 33rd highest in the last 54 years.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
