["By Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on February 15, 2019", "In declaring a national emergency at the Southwest border,\u00a0President Donald Trump strung together a long list of false, misleading and unsupported claims on illegal immigration, drug smuggling, human trafficking, trade deficits and other issues.", "We briefly cover some of the\u00a0statements\u00a0the president made in his Feb. 15 Rose Garden remarks \u2014 nearly all of which we have debunked numerous times before.", "Trump said: \u201cWe have a real problem. We have catch-and-release. You catch a criminal, and you have to release him.\u201d", "The facts: That\u2019s not accurate. The U.S. does not have to release criminals; in fact, it is required to detain certain criminals.", "Those attempting to enter the U.S. without \u201cvalid entry documents\u201d or \u201cby fraud or misrepresentation\u201d must be detained pending an expedited removal proceeding, as explained in a 2018 report by the Congressional Research Service. And they are subject to deportation whether they have a criminal record or not.", "Now, some people apprehended trying to cross the border illegally (or legally for that matter) may seek asylum in the U.S., a process that can stretch for years in some cases. The immigrant must first get a U.S. official to determine that he or she faces a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of persecution or torture if forced to return home, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If an asylum officer doesn\u2019t find there\u2019s a credible fear, the immigrant can request a review by an immigration judge. If the judge agrees with the officer, the immigrant can then be removed from the U.S.", "Even for those who have passed this initial \u201ccredible fear\u201d threshold, they still must have a formal asylum hearing, which can take years. But authorities are under no obligation to release those awaiting a long-term removal proceeding.", "In fact, ICE is required to hold certain criminals, including those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, those who have multiple criminal convictions, and those who have served more than a year in jail for a criminal offense. That\u2019s spelled out in the Immigration Nationality Act, Section 236 (c).", "Those apprehended near the border who have committed a less serious offense and who are deemed not to pose a risk to public safety, can be released pending the long-term proceeding. But authorities are not obligated to do so, especially if they are deemed a risk to public safety, Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told us.", "\u201cThere is no obligation to release anyone,\u201d Pierce said.", "Trump said: \u201cYou have chain migration. Where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members \u2014 because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sister, his cousin, his uncle \u2014 they\u2019re all in. You know what happened on the West Side Highway. That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured \u2014 nobody talks about that \u2014 horribly, like loss of legs and arms. \u2026 He had many people brought in because he was in the United States. It\u2019s called chain migration.\u201d", "The facts: Trump is referring to Sayfullo Saipov, a\u00a0Uzbekistan national who has been charged\u00a0in a 2017 terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people and injured 11 others. Trump has repeatedly claimed that Saipov used \u201cchain migration\u201d to bring\u00a022 people with him into the United States. There\u2019s no evidence\u00a0that Saipov brought even one relative to the country.", "Saipov came to the U.S. in 2010 through the\u00a0Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, according to the Department of Homeland Security. As a green card holder, Saipov could not have sponsored anyone other than a spouse and children, and he married in the United States in 2013 \u2014 so he could not have been responsible for bringing in the relatives cited by Trump.\u00a0Saipov\u2019s father and mother \u2014 Habibullo Saipov and Muqaddas Saipova \u2014 were living in Uzbekistan at the time of the attack, as reported by the\u00a0Daily Mail\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0Wall Street Journal.", "Trump said: \u201cAnd then you have the lottery. It\u2019s a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they\u2019re not putting you in; they\u2019re putting some very bad people in the lottery. It\u2019s common sense. If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to the United States, I\u2019m not going to put in my stars; I\u2019m going to put in people I don\u2019t want. The lottery system\u2019s a disaster. I\u2019m stuck with it.\u201d", "The facts: The president has repeatedly misrepresented\u00a0how the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program works. Under the program, the Department of State randomly selects up to 50,000\u00a0qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Contrary to Trump\u2019s claim,\u00a0countries do not \u201cput in people\u201d for visas; the individuals themselves apply. And those\u00a0selected in the \u201clottery,\u201d as Trump calls it, must pass an extensive background check before they are given\u00a0green cards, or legal permanent resident status.", "There are more than a dozen grounds of inadmissibility, including health issues, criminal activity, national security concerns and the \u201clikelihood of becoming a public charge,\u201d meaning \u201ca person who is primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.\u201d That\u2019s all done in an attempt to prevent\u00a0\u201cvery bad people,\u201d as Trump called them, from getting into the country.", "Trump said: \u201cSo we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we\u2019ve ever had before.\u201d", "The facts: The number of people who try to enter the U.S. illegally each year is unknown, but federal authorities use the number of apprehensions to gauge changes in illegal immigration. Southwest border apprehensions totaled 396,579 in fiscal year 2018, which was up from\u00a0303,916 in fiscal 2017. Still, the 2018 figure is down 76 percent from the peak of 1.64 million apprehensions in fiscal 2000, according to Border Patrol data. (For more, see our updated story, \u201cIllegal Immigration Statistics.\u201d)", "Trump said: \u201cBut one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border.\u00a0When you look and when you listen to politicians \u2014 in particular certain Democrats \u2014 they say it all comes through the port of entry. It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just a lie. It\u2019s all a lie.\u201d", "The facts: The Drug Enforcement Administration \u2014 not just \u201ccertain Democrats\u201d \u2014 say that\u00a0Mexican cartels \u201ctransport the bulk of their drugs over the Southwest Border through ports of entry (POEs) using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers.\u201d This is particularly true for heroin and fentanyl \u2014 two\u00a0opioids that Trump mentioned in his remarks. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection drug seizure statistics for fiscal year 2018, which ended Sept. 30, 2018, 90 percent of heroin seizures occurred at legal ports of entry in the first 11 months and 80 percent of fentanyl in the first 10 months.\u00a0\u201cA small percentage of all heroin seized by CBP along the land border was between Ports of Entry,\u201d the DEA said in its\u00a02018 National Drug Threat Assessment.", "Last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection made the\u00a0largest fentanyl bust\u00a0in its history when a Mexican national \u201cattempted to enter the United States through the Port of Nogales.\u201d Border agents discovered nearly 254 pounds of fentanyl worth about $3.5 million \u201cconcealed within a special floor compartment of a trailer that was laden with cucumbers.\u201d Trump has been making this claim since 2017 and, most recently, in this month\u2019s\u00a0State of the Union address.", "Trump said: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you\u2019re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don\u2019t have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again.\u201d", "The facts:\u00a0There\u2019s no data on how many are smuggled illegally across the border with Mexico for human trafficking, as we said in our story when Trump made a similar claim in his State of the Union address. But\u00a0experts told us legal ports are the typical mode of entry in the bulk of the cases they deal with concerning foreign nationals. A spokesperson for\u00a0Polaris, which operates the National Human Trafficking Hotline, told us \u201cthe vast majority of people are coming through legal ports of entry.\u201d That\u2019s based on statistics the group has compiled from the calls it receives through the hotline.", "In addition, the United Nations\u2019 International Organization on Migration\u00a0has found\u00a0that \u201cnearly 80% of international human trafficking journeys cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points,\u201d based on 10 years\u2019 worth of cases on which the IOM has assisted.", "Trump said: \u201cAnd, by the way, the USMCA, from Mexico \u2014 that\u2019s United States, Mexico, Canada \u2014 that\u2019s where the money\u2019s coming from, not directly, but indirectly, for the wall. And nobody wants to talk about that.\u201d", "The facts: The White House has sought\u00a0as much as $25 billion\u00a0for the wall, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection has estimated\u00a0that it will cost\u00a0$18 billion in the first 10 years of construction. The president has made the claim \u2014 which we have debunked\u00a0on many occasions \u2014 that the revenue generated from the\u00a0United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement,\u00a0or USMCA, will indirectly pay for the wall. But the White House has provided no\u00a0analysis to support the president\u2019s claim, and trade experts we interviewed said it\u2019s not possible.", "The agreement \u2014 which was\u00a0signed\u00a0by the leaders of all three countries in November, but has yet to be approved by Congress \u2014\u00a0represents an arguably slightly better deal for the U.S. than the current\u00a0North American Free Trade Agreement, experts told us, but not enough to generate enough federal revenues to pay for the wall.\u00a0\u00a0Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, told us the additional revenue could not \u201ccover annual maintenance and improvements of the wall much less the original build.\u201d", "Trump said: \u201cI could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn\u2019t need to do this. But I\u2019d rather do it much faster. And I don\u2019t have to do it for the election. I\u2019ve already done a lot of wall for the election \u2014 2020.\u201d", "The facts: Despite the president\u2019s claim that he has \u201calready done a lot of the wall,\u201d very little new fencing has been constructed, and none of it is the type Trump promised during the campaign. As we have written, Congress last year approved $1.6 billion to replace existing barriers and add some fencing in new areas. But Congress stated that\u00a0the money can only be used to build \u201coperationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, [May 5, 2017] such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.\u201d That language prohibits the administration from building any of the wall prototypes that the administration had designed and that the president toured last year in California.", "Although the administration says the $1.6 billion appropriated last year will fund 100 miles of \u201cwall,\u201d we calculated that there would be about 40 miles of new barriers, which have yet to be completed, while the rest is for upgrades to existing barriers. And the 100 miles of barriers is far short of the 722 miles\u00a0of new and replacement barriers that the administration has said it plans to build.", "Trump said: \u201cThe other night I was in El Paso. We had a tremendous crowd and \u2014 tremendous crowd. And I asked the people, many of whom were from El Paso \u2026 I said, \u2018Let me ask you the \u2014 as a crowd, when the wall went up, was it better?\u2019 You were there, some of you. It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.\u201d", "The facts: Trump continues to peddle the false claim that construction of a fence in El Paso transformed the border city from one of the most dangerous in the country to one of the safest. Those from El Paso in the crowd may have agreed with the president, but as we have written, crime statistics from the FBI contradict the president\u2019s narrative.", "El Paso has never been one of the most dangerous cities in the country. The city had the third lowest violent crime rate among 35 U.S. cities with a population over 500,000 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 \u2013 before construction of 57 miles of fencing started in the El Paso sector in mid-2008. Nor was there an \u201cimmediate\u201d or \u201covernight\u201d drop in violent crime in El Paso after the fence was constructed, as the president has said.\u00a0 In fact, the city\u2019s violent crime rate increased 5.5 percent from 2007 to 2010 \u2014 the years before and after construction of the fence, which began in mid-2008 and was completed in mid-2009. Looking from 2006 to 2011 \u2014 two years before the fence construction began and two years after it was finished \u2014 the violent crime rate increased about 9.6 percent.", "Trump said: \u201cIn El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall. And they had 23 murders. It\u2019s a lot of murders. But it\u2019s not close to 2,000 murders, right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico. So everyone knows that walls work.\u201d", "The facts: There were 1,247 murders in Juarez, Mexico, in 2018, according to El Diario, while just across the border, El Paso police reported 23 murders. But that\u2019s not evidence that \u201cwalls work.\u201d While there has long been a high number of murders in Juarez, the number of murders in El Paso has remained relatively low among U.S. cities, both before and after the fence.", "In 2007, the year before construction of the fence began, there were 336 homicides in Juarez compared with\u00a017 in the city of El Paso. In 2008, a war between drug cartels in Juarez sent the number of homicides in the Mexican city soaring to 2,570. Yet across the border in the city of El Paso, the number of homicides remained at\u00a017, according to the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting Program.", "In 2010, the year after the fence was completed, the number of homicides dropped to 5 in El Paso, before climbing back up to 16 in 2011 and 23 in 2012. Most recently, the city of El Paso recorded 17 homicides in 2016 and 19 in 2017. Those figures are in line with those before the fence went up. The city averaged 15.2 homicides a year in the five years between 2003 and 2007.", "Trump said: \u201cYou saw last month, the trade deficit went way down.\u201d", "The facts: Trump made this same\u00a0misleading claim at a rally in El Paso, Texas, this week. It\u2019s true that the monthly goods and services trade deficit was $49.3 billion in November, down $6.4 billion from $55.7 billion in October, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis figures. But the October trade deficit was the highest monthly deficit in 10 years. Also, the November monthly figure was still higher than it was at the same point in 2017 and 2016.", "Overall, the trade deficit is up 20.3 percent for the 12 months ending in November, compared with 2016, the year before Trump took office.", "Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been losing on average $375 billion a year with China. Lot of people think it\u2019s $506 billion. Some people think it\u2019s much more than that.\u201d", "The facts: Trump has been exaggerating the U.S. trade deficit with China since the 2016 election. The goods-and-services trade deficit with China averaged almost $222 billion between 1999 and 2017, according to BEA data. The deficit with China was $275 billion through the first three quarters of 2018, which is the most recent BEA data available.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
