The yellow logo, seen partially in the bottom right-hand corner of the photo, has appeared in other IS propaganda. \u201cNineveh State\u201d is also a term used by the IS group -- the Iraqi government does not refer to it as a state.

IS held this part of Iraq in 2015. When the photo first appeared online four years ago, IS was in control of a vast swathe of Iraqi land, including Nineveh.\u00a0Iraqi forces took back control of the entire province in August 2017, but they periodically launch operations in the country's west and northwest border areas -- including Nineveh -- targeting IS \u201csleeper cells\u201d.", "4. The clothing matches that worn by other IS executioners. Other IS propaganda material has also featured executioners wearing a long, loose black shirt, black trousers and a head covering. They have also, like in the video screenshot seen above, used a sword for the execution.", "All of these signs indicate that the photo shows an IS execution in Iraq, and not the killing of a Christian missionary in Afghanistan.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
