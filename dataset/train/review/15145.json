["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Several automakers have unveiled hefty plans to expand in the United States in recent weeks. Toyota and Mazda teamed up to open a $1.6 billion factory in Alabama by 2021. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced it would put $1 billion into its Warren, Mich., factory to make heavy duty versions of its profitable Ram pickup trucks.", "Speaking at women\u2019s event in Washington, President Donald Trump pointed to this good news as proof of his policies.", "\"We\u2019re making incredible progress,\" he said Jan. 16. \"Toyota is now moving back. Mexico \u2014 it\u2019s very interesting \u2014 Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan. You haven\u2019t heard that one in a while.\"", "In this fact-check, we looked at whether Chrysler is leaving Mexico and returning to Michigan.", "To cut to the chase, Chrysler is shifting truck production to the United States, but not at the expense of jobs or plants in Mexico.", "From Saltillo to Warren", "Saltillo, Mexico, is a nexus of Fiat Chrysler production. It has five plants in the area, doing everything from building engines to assembling finished vehicles. Over 4,000 workers at its truck assembly plant turn out several variations of the Ram truck line.", "On Jan. 11, the company said that truck production was headed to Warren, Mich., in 2020.", "\"To support the increased volume at the Warren facility, 2,500 new jobs will be created,\" the company said in a news release.", "And what would happen at the Saltillo truck plant? It would be \"repurposed to produce future commercial vehicles for global distribution,\" the release said.", "The company\u2019s spokesman in Mexico, Miguel Ceballos, told reporters \u2013 and the company\u2019s American press office confirmed \u2013 that the automaker expected no change in the number of Mexican workers.", "So under the plan, the United States gains workers and Mexico holds steady.", "Kristen Dziczek, an economist at the Center for Automotive Research, a government-and-industry-financed research group in Ann Arbor, Mich., told us the move doesn\u2019t mean Fiat Chrysler is leaving Mexico.", "\"The plant in Mexico stays open,\" Dziczek said. \"Chrysler has a very profitable truck product and only two plants in the United States where it makes them. This allows them to retool while keeping production rolling so they can avoid down time.\"", "The move is part of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s longer term shift away from making cars to making trucks and SUVs in the United States. In 2016, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told investors, \"By the time we finish with this, hopefully, all of our production assets in the United States will be producing either Jeeps or Ram.\"", "The company\u2019s press office said over 90 percent of Ram trucks are sold in America. Industry experts note that trucks are more profitable to Fiat Chrysler than cars.", "The last 200 model, a passenger car, rolled off the assembly line at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Sterling Heights, Mich., plant in 2016. Soon after, the company announced that facility, not far from the Warren plant, would start making Ram trucks.", "Marchionne credited the recent tax bill for spurring the latest move. He also argued it was the \"right thing to do\" given that Ram trucks had always been made in the United States.", "But concerns over the fate of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, might well have played a role too. Under NAFTA, pickup trucks made in Mexico face no tariff when they cross the border. If NAFTA is scuttled, the\u00a0tariff would shoot up to 25 percent.", "Dziczek noted that moving truck assembly to the United States is a hedge against that risk.", "\"If you\u2019re going to put a billion dollars down, why would you put it into a plant that\u2019s on the wrong side of the border?\" she said.", "Our ruling", "Trump said that Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan. The company does plan to spend $1 billion to shift production of Ram trucks from Saltillo, Mexico, to Warren, Mich. However, this is no zero-sum game where a U.S. gain is Mexico\u2019s loss.", "The Mexican plant will start making another kind of vehicle, and the company expects no change in the number of workers.", "There is no question though that the company\u2019s billion dollar investment will add many new jobs in Michigan where Chrysler has long had a presence.", "We rate this claim Half True.", "White House, Remarks by President Trump at White House \"Women of America\" Panel, Jan. 16, 2018", "Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, FCA Announces Plan to Invest More Than $1 Billion in Michigan Plant, Jan. 11, 2018", "Reuters, Fiat Chrysler to invest $1 billion in Michigan plant, add 2,500 jobs, Jan. 11, 2018", "Wall Street Journal, Fiat Chrysler to Move Some Truck Production to Michigan From Mexico, Jan. 11, 2018", "Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, 2018 FCA manufacturing operations, accessed Jan. 17, 2018", "Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Sterling Heights Assembly Plant, July 26, 2016", "USA Today, Fiat Chrysler ending car production in U.S., July 28, 2016", "Interview Kristen Dziczek, economist, Center for Automotive Research, Jan. 17, 2018", "Interview, Jodi Tinson, communications, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Jan. 17, 2018", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
