["By Sydney Nixon and Alan Jaffe", "Posted on September 3, 2020", "Facebook posts falsely suggest that envelopes used for mail-in ballots in general elections reveal party affiliation, saying\u00a0postal workers may \u201ctoss\u201d votes.\u00a0Voting experts say they don\u2019t know of any such labels in general elections\u00a0\u2014 only on envelopes during primary elections.", "Some states have made it easier to vote by mail, particularly in recent months because of health risks from the COVID-19 pandemic, as we\u2019ve written.", "But,\u00a0as we\u2019ve reported, President Donald Trump has attacked mail-in voting as \u201cfraudulent\u201d and \u201ccorrupt,\u201d though voting experts have said his claims are exaggerated or false.", "A video post shared on Facebook amplifies false claims about the security of mail-in voting by showing ballot envelopes with bar codes that include the letters \u201cD\u201d and \u201cR\u201d \u2014 designating Democrat or Republican. The narrator on the video says that a postal worker can \u201ctoss\u201d the ballot after seeing the party affiliation, and she warns: \u201cDo not vote by mail.\u201d", "Another post shows a screengrab from the video, with a finger pointing to the bar code, and the headline: \u201cTHE POST OFFICE KNOWS WHICH BALLOTS ARE DEM VS REP.\u201d", "But the Facebook posts don\u2019t explain that the envelopes shown in the video are from Florida\u2019s Aug. 18 closed primary, during which voters could vote only for members of their own party.", "In a general election, ballot envelopes in Florida do not reveal party affiliation, an election official told us. Voting experts told us they aren\u2019t aware of any jurisdiction using such labels in general elections, nor would there be a reason to do so.", "The office of the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, Florida \u2014 where the envelopes in the Facebook posts were sent \u2014 confirmed that in a statement to FactCheck.org. In a closed primary, \u201cvoters are sent ballots according to their precinct and their party affiliation. The ballots in that video are primary ballots.\u201d The alphanumeric codes on the envelopes shown in the video are used to direct the ballots for counting.", "\u201cThe alternative would be to open the envelope and look at the ballot itself to ensure that the voter voted the proper party and precinct style. We want to maintain ballot confidentiality, so those numbers are on the outside,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt would be a federal crime for any post office employee to tamper with this process and we have received no such reports of anything like this happening.\u201d", "The statement from the supervisor\u2019s office, portions of which were shared on Twitter, noted, \u201cAll ballots for the general election in November will look exactly the same, as voters can vote for whoever they would like. There would be no way to tell the party affiliation of a voter based on their vote-by-mail envelope for the general election.\u201d", "We contacted county election officials in other states to see if the same was true elsewhere. Officials in Los Angeles and Philadelphia told us that party designations do not appear on mail-in ballot envelopes for general elections in those counties.", "Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said that state laws determine what appears on ballot envelopes, though counties have some control over the design of the ballot materials. But party affiliation should not appear on envelopes in any general elections, he told us in a phone interview.", "Justin Levitt, an election law professor at Loyola Marymount University, told us in an email that the Facebook video is \u201cmisleading to the extent it implies anything about the general election.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know of any election official in the country who indicates the voter\u2019s party affiliation in the bar code (or on the envelope) for the general election. For a primary, it serves an administrative double-checking purpose (you can confirm with a quick scan that Democratic primary ballots are going to Democratic primary voters, etc.). But it doesn\u2019t serve any similar purpose in the general election,\u201d Levitt said.", "\u201cIn a general election, there\u2019s no reason at all to have party affiliation listed on the exterior of a mail ballot, and I don\u2019t know of anywhere where that happens,\u201d he said.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
