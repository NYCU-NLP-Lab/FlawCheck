It was designed \"to assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the home reduces wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where masks were uncommon,\" according to the study\u2019s abstract.", "Researchers assigned roughly 6,000 people who left their homes at least three hours a day to two groups. Members of one group were given a box of 50 surgical masks and told to wear a mask whenever they went outside of their homes. Members of the other group were not told to wear masks \u2014 but, like the mask group, they were encouraged to follow safety recommendations made by Danish officials at the time, which included things like social distancing.", "After a month, the researchers used antibody tests, PCR tests or hospital diagnoses of COVID-19 to determine if participants had been infected with the virus.", "The study concluded that recommending people wear surgical masks \"did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use.\"", "It is important to note the phrase, \"by more than 50%\" in the researchers\u2019 findings. The study was designed to examine whether the masks provided high levels of personal protection. That would have been evidenced by significantly reducing the infection rate for those wearing masks.
