But the next portion of her statement, saying a felon convicted of those crimes gets \"out of jail free,\" is flat wrong and misleading. The measure does not apply to jail inmates and does not directly set anyone free. It would make some eligible for a parole board hearing, which in turn could lead to an early release, or not.", "\"To suggest any presumption that they will be paroled is, I think, a far step,\" state Sen.
