Motorcyclists have protested the community, calling it a breeding ground of jihad. A former congressional candidate from Tennessee also was convicted of planning an attack on the community\u2019s mosque.", "Despite statements by law enforcement officials that the community is not home to any\u00a0\u201cnefarious\u201d\u00a0activity, suspicions espoused online have lingered \u2014 and so too has a fabricated story.", "A tale about a supposed raid of Islamberg ordered by President Donald Trump that unearthed \u201cAmerica\u2019s WORST Nightmare\u201d resurfaced again this month, appearing on two websites\u00a0with the promise of \u201cmore details.\u201d Instead, the articles offered the same,\u00a0repeatedly debunked\u00a0claims.\u00a0Facebook users rightly reported the stories as potentially false.", "At the heart of the false story is a distortion of the\u00a02017 arrest of Ramadan Abdullah in Johnson City, New York. Police found the Johnson City resident to have a trove of weapons and ammunition in a storage unit in the town of Union \u2014 about an hour from Islamberg.

That article claimed without proof that the weapons were \u201cintended for\u201d Islamberg, the \u201cheadquarters\u201d of the Muslims of America organization.", "But Beau Duffy, the New York State Police spokesman, confirmed in an email to FactCheck.org that there remains no evidence that Abdullah\u2019s weapons were destined for Islamberg.

Members, including Gilani, have claimed they have no affiliation with al-Fuqra.", "Officials at the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s\u00a0Center on Extremism\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0have\u00a0said that there\u2019s little evidence that the Muslims of America, or Islamberg, are sources of extremism. Last year, the Associated Press reported that the center\u2019s director, Oren Segal, \u201cnotes\u00a0that none of the more than 500 people arrested on terror charges since the attacks [on Sept. 11, 2001] have a known affiliation with The Muslims of America.\u201d", "In addition, police say an array of allegations about Islamberg included in the story \u2014 including that it\u2019s a\u00a0\u201ctraining ground for Muslims terrorists\u201d and was \u201conce used to hide Osama bin Laden from authorities\u201d \u2014 are unfounded.", "\u201cThey are completely false,\u201d Duffy, the New York State Police spokesman, told us. \u201cWe maintain a strong liaison with the Muslim community on Roods Creek Rd. and routinely respond to [it] for calls to service, (medical, fire and suspicious activity), and are invited as guests to their events and have never been denied access to the property.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "\u201c\u2018American Taliban\u2019s\u2019 Return to Islamberg Will Not Be Met With Counter Protest.\u201d Press Release.
