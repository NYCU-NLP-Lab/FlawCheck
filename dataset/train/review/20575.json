But we were especially interested in one claim she made: \"President Obama would eventually declassify many of the details of the program and explain his policies to the world, but in 2009 all I could say was \u2018no comment\u2019 whenever the subject came up. Yet it was widely known that dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield by drones, and we later learned that bin Laden himself worried about the heavy losses that drones were inflicting.\"", "Is that correct?", "First, some background. Using armed unmanned aerial vehicles in combat is controversial because it pushes legal boundaries. (Here\u2019s a previous fact-check in which we looked at this issue.) Of special concern is that drones have killed at least four American citizens on foreign soil.", "In defense of the program, officials often praise its effectiveness in hampering terrorist organizations.", "Tallying up the number of drone strikes is challenging, for obvious reasons -- they are done with tight secrecy.

In just those two countries, drones have killed between 2,861 and 4,452 people in all -- civilians and unknowns, in addition to militants, according to the foundation\u2019s study. (Pakistan and Yemen are the locations of the majority of United States drone strikes, though attacks have also occurred in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Philippines.)", "Clinton, though, uses the \"dozens\" number to refer to senior terrorists killed through 2009.

The brothers who can keep a low profile and take the necessary precautions should stay, but move to new houses on a cloudy day.\"", "Our ruling", "Clinton said that \"dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield\" by drones.
