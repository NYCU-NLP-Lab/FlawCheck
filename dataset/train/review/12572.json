We\u2019ll take that to refer to the \"murder and non-negligent manslaughter\" data the FBI compiles annually for every city in the US.", "There are a few issues here.", "First, the varied demographic and cultural factors at play in each city make comparing raw data like this a questionable exercise. The FBI explicitly warns against this type of ranking:", "These rough rankings provide no insight into the numerous variables that mold crime in a particular town, city, county, state, tribal area, or region. Consequently, they lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents. Valid assessments are possible only with careful study and analysis of the range of unique conditions affecting each local law enforcement jurisdiction", "In addition, the ranking compiled here is out of date.", "Eight of the cities listed in the graphic \u2014 including Atlanta, Cincinnati and Oakland \u2014 are no longer among the 25 with the highest per-capita rate of murder and manslaughter, based on the 2018 FBI crime data, which is the latest available.", "The second element of the claim, the party affiliation, is trickier to pin down.", "We\u2019re taking this claim to refer to the politics of the city as a whole, rather than the leadership, since the \"majority\" reference and the adaptation of the gun control phrase both seem to refer to a general group more than those in authority.", "We would typically use a recent national election such as the 2016 presidential race to compare communities around the country. But election results are traditionally reported at state and county levels, not the city level.", "We did find an analysis that looked at Metropolitan Statistical Areas around cities.

Among the 25 cities with the highest murder/manslaughter rate in 2018, three had Republican mayors, according to Ballotpedia and our research.

Another study that year found crime across a number of cities was concentrated in \"microgeographic hot spots.\"", "Weisburd said his research revealed a \"law of crime concentration\": Across an array of large cities, 1% of city streets account for about 25% of the crime, and 5% of streets account for about 50% of the crime.", "An array of local socioeconomic and cultural factors play a role in which areas yield that concentrated crime. But it\u2019s a lot more than politics.", "A 2018 study from Boston University found racial segregation is a key risk factor for firearm homicide. An array of other local factors skew homicide rates and make a raw ranking a poor tool for understanding what\u2019s happening, said David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College of Criminal Justice told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel for a 2019 series on homicides.", "\"You get a number. It\u2019s completely accurate.

Violent crime in particular stems from a limited group of people in a limited area, so assuming that segment has a particular political bent based on the city at large \u2014 and that their violence stems from those politics \u2014 is a stretch at best.", "Large cities do have more crime.
