["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on September 11, 2020 | Corrected on September 14, 2020", "A Biden campaign TV ad falsely claims that a government analysis of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cplanned cuts to Social Security\u201d shows that \u201cif Trump gets his way, Social Security benefits will run out in just three years from now.\u201d", "The Social Security Administration\u2019s chief actuary analyzed \u201chypothetical legislation\u201d that would eliminate the payroll tax that funds Social Security \u2014 not a proposal from Trump. The president has said he won\u2019t cut benefits.", "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and others who oppose Trump\u2019s reelection have capitalized on confusing statements Trump made in August. He has said on multiple occasions that, if reelected, he would look at \u201cending\u201d or \u201cterminating the payroll tax.\u201d", "But White House and Trump campaign officials have said the president actually wants to forgive a four-month payroll tax holiday he authorized via executive action last month. Trump himself has said: \u201c[W]hen I win the election, I\u2019m going to completely and totally forgive all deferred payroll taxes without in any way, shape or form hurting Social Security. That money is going to come from the general fund.\u201d", "Biden, though, has repeatedly claimed that Trump has a \u201cplan\u201d that would \u201cbankrupt,\u201d \u201cdefund,\u201d or \u201cwipe out\u201d the Social Security program.", "In remarks during an AFL-CIO virtual event on Sept. 7, Biden said: \u201cAnd Trump has a plan to gut Social Security. If his Social Security plan \u2026 actually became law, the Social Security actuary has said the entire Social Security system will be bankrupt by mid-2023.\u201d", "At the same time, the Biden campaign has been running an ad that says: \u201cThe chief actuary of the Social Security Administration just released an analysis of Trump\u2019s planned cuts to Social Security. Under Trump\u2019s plan, Social Security would become permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023. If Trump gets his way, Social Security benefits will run out in just three years from now.\u201d", "Advertising Analytics says the Biden campaign has spent over $1.3 million on the 30-second commercial, which has aired more than 5,500 times in swing states like Michigan and Arizona since Sept. 3.", "The Biden campaign started running a second ad on Social Security in key electoral states on Sept. 8. It features the former vice president saying: \u201cFor our seniors, Social Security is a sacred obligation, a sacred promise made. The current president\u2019s threatening to break that promise. He\u2019s proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half the Social Security without any way of making up for that lost revenue.\u201d", "Biden said that in his acceptance speech at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. As we wrote then, it\u2019s not clear what Trump would do in a second term.", "But any permanent changes to Social Security would have to go through Congress, and the temporary payroll tax forgiveness \u2014 which Trump\u2019s administration and campaign staff claim he really wants \u2014 would not \u201cgut\u201d or \u201cwipe out\u201d the program that pays retirement and disability benefits.", "In 2019, nearly 90% of the funding for Social Security ($944.5 billion) came from a 12.4% payroll tax on income up to a certain threshold ($137,700 in 2020). That tax is split equally between employers and employees, while self-employed individuals pay the full tax.", "In early August, Trump issued a memo allowing the deferral of the employee portion of the payroll tax for workers who earn less than $4,000 in taxable wages biweekly. The break from the tax goes from Sept. 1 to Dec. 31, and so individuals don\u2019t have to pay back that deferred amount next year, the memo instructed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to \u201cexplore avenues, including legislation, to eliminate the obligation to pay the taxes deferred pursuant to the implementation of this memorandum.\u201d", "That\u2019s the only clearly articulated plan related to Social Security retirement benefits put forward by the Trump administration.", "But on the same day he signed the memo, and in the days that followed, Trump suggested he wanted to go even further \u2014 and either cut or end the payroll tax.", "In a press briefing on Aug. 8, Trump said: \u201cIf I\u2019m victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax. So I\u2019m going to make them all permanent.\u201d", "In another news conference on Aug. 10, he stated: \u201cI signed directives to give a payroll tax holiday, with the understanding that after the election \u2014 on the assumption that it would be victorious for an administration that\u2019s done a great job \u2014 we will be ending that tax. We\u2019ll be terminating that tax.\u201d", "And on Aug. 12 he declared: \u201cAfter I hopefully get elected, we\u2019ll be terminating the payroll tax. So that will mean anywhere from 5,000 [dollars] to even more per family and also great for businesses and great for jobs.\u201d He later added: \u201cWe\u2019ll be paying into Social Security through the general fund. And it works out very nicely.\u201d", "Then, in a Sept. 8 interview with CBS12 News in Florida, Trump said there might be a payroll tax cut if he wins a second term. He did not mention eliminating the tax entirely.", "\u201cThere\u2019s not a payroll tax cut on your second term agenda?\u201d reporter Jay O\u2019Brien asked. Trump responded: \u201cWell, we\u2019re looking to do that. We will do it second term. We\u2019re looking to do something now if we can.\u201d", "White House and Trump campaign officials have said that Trump doesn\u2019t really mean he would permanently eliminate the tax.", "On Aug. 9, one day after the president said he planned to \u201cmake permanent cuts to the payroll tax,\u201d White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash: \u201cWhen he referred to permanent, I think what he was saying is that the deferral of the payroll tax to the end of the year will be made permanent. It will be forgiven. The tax is not going away.\u201d", "Then, on Aug. 13, the day after Trump said \u201cwe\u2019ll be terminating the payroll tax\u201d if he is reelected, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters: \u201cWhat he was meaning yesterday is that he wants permanent forgiveness of the deferral.\u201d", "In the Aug. 12 press conference McEnany referenced, Trump even said at one point: \u201cWhen I win the election, I\u2019m going to go completely and totally forgive all deferred payroll taxes without in any way, shape or form hurting Social Security. That money is going to come from the general fund. We\u2019re not going to touch Social Security. I said from day one that we\u2019re going to protect Social Security and we\u2019re going to protect our people.\u201d", "And when contacted about Biden\u2019s claims about Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cplan\u201d for Social Security, both the White House and Trump campaign again told FactCheck.org Trump was only referring to forgiving the payroll taxes he deferred for the remainder of 2020.", "\u201cThe President has called on Congress to make this deferral permanent,\u201d a White House spokesperson said in an email. \u201cIf they do not, this action still effectively allows working Americans to get a sizable advance on their pay starting in a month, which is just when working Americans need it most as we are fighting to end the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d", "Trump campaign spokesman Zach Parkinson said in a statement: \u201cJoe Biden and his campaign\u2019s scare tactics are a sad attempt to distract from his own record. President Trump and Administration officials have repeatedly said he wants to make the payroll tax cut deferral permanent to help America\u2019s workers. The President has been clear: his payroll tax cut will have \u2018zero impact\u2019 on Social Security or the seniors that rely on the program. He supports transferring money from the government\u2019s general coffers, protecting the program\u2019s Trust Fund.\u201d", "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that, depending on how many employers opt to withhold payroll taxes for their eligible employees, up to $100 billion in tax payments could be delayed. (The deferral is reportedly mandatory for federal workers and members of the military who qualify.)", "Whether the executive action will have an impact on Social Security depends on what happens later on Capitol Hill.", "If Congress doesn\u2019t agree to forgive the withheld taxes, as Trump wants, employees will be required to pay the money back in early 2021, between January and April. \u201cBecause most of these taxes would be repaid later, we estimate a deficit impact of roughly $5 billion,\u201d CRFB said in its analysis of Trump\u2019s executive actions.", "If lawmakers do forgive the deferred payments, the money needed to make up for the lost tax revenue could either come from Social Security\u2019s trust funds or from general revenues. The first option would speed up the insolvency of Social Security\u2019s trust funds a bit.", "The Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s William Hoagland told PolitiFact that if the payroll tax deferral costs $80 billion and came from the trust funds, it \u201cwould not gut the program,\u201d but would \u201conly impact the date of depletion, possibly a year or two earlier than expected.\u201d The trust funds are currently projected to be exhausted by 2035. At that point, the annual tax revenue for Social Security \u201cwould be sufficient to pay 79\u00a0percent of program cost, declining to 73\u00a0percent for\u00a02094,\u201d the\u00a0Social Security Board of Trustees said this year.\u00a0That assumes Congress takes no action to address the shortfall.", "As for claims that Trump\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d would \u201cbankrupt\u201d or \u201cdeplete\u201d the program by 2023, that\u2019s based on an Aug. 24 letter from Stephen Goss, the chief actuary for the Social Security Administration.", "Goss responded to an Aug. 19 request from four U.S. senators (three Democrats and one independent) to analyze \u201chypothetical legislation\u201d that reduces the payroll tax rate to 0% and makes no other changes to current law. He wrote:", "Goss, Aug. 24: If this hypothetical legislation were enacted, with no alternative source of revenue to replace the elimination of payroll taxes on earned income paid on January 1, 2021 and thereafter, we estimate that DI [Disability Insurance] Trust Fund asset reserves would become permanently depleted in about the middle of calendar year 2021, with no ability to pay DI benefits thereafter. We estimate that OASI [Old Age and Survivors Insurance] Trust Fund reserves would become permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023, with no ability to pay OASI benefits thereafter.", "But Goss said he was \u201cnot aware that anyone has proposed the hypothetical legislation.\u201d", "In addition, the times Trump has mentioned eliminating the payroll tax, he has also said the money to pay benefits would instead come from the government\u2019s general fund. Goss\u2019 letter said legislation with such a stipulation would leave Social Security \u201cessentially unaffected\u201d \u2014 a point ignored by the Biden campaign ad.", "Goss, Aug. 24: If the hypothetical legislation specified that the OASI and DI Trust Funds would be held harmless from the reduction in the tax rate paid by employees, employers, and self-employed individuals (as was the case for the temporary payroll tax rate reductions of 2010, 2011, and 2012, where automatic transfers were specified from the General Fund of the Treasury to the trust funds in the amounts that would have been made in the absence of the tax rate reductions), then OASI and DI Trust Fund income, benefits paid, and the projected depletion date of the trust fund reserves would be essentially unaffected by the legislation.", "Of course, transferring roughly $1 trillion from the general fund each year to cover the projected cost of paying Social Security benefits would increase federal deficits. The Congressional Budget Office projects federal deficits of more than $1 trillion each year from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2030.", "And when asked how that would work with the already nearly $3 trillion deficit for fiscal 2020, Trump misleadingly claimed \u201ctremendous growth\u201d like \u201cyou haven\u2019t seen in a long time\u201d could cover Social Security\u2019s costs. However, the CBO projects that real gross domestic product will increase by less than 3% each year from 2022 to 2030, and real GDP already hasn\u2019t grown by more than 3% annually since Trump took office.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean Trump has \u201cplanned cuts\u201d that will \u201cbankrupt\u201d Social Security, as Biden and others have claimed.", "Despite his confusing remarks, the White House and Trump campaign say the president wants Congress to make it so that employees don\u2019t have to repay any deferred taxes next year. If Trump actually \u201cgets his way,\u201d as one of the Biden campaign ads says, that lost revenue will be made up with other money from the general fund.", "Correction, Sept. 14: Our story originally included a reference to \u201cexecution action\u201d instead of \u201cexecutive action.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
