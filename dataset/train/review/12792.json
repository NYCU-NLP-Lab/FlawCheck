["About this rating", "Since early 2017, the Internet has been littered with \u201cwarnings\u201d about the dangers of eating bananas and eggs together (or serially):", "It is unclear what \u201cnet\u201d is in danger of being killed by this combination of food, but the claim presented here appears to have its origins in a dubious chain message spread via the mobile chat app WhatsApp. The earliest reference to the claim we could find was an 18 January 2017 Facebook post by a Nigerian based internet comedy channel. The claim appears to have first gone viral in India a month later, with the first round of debunkings occurring from Indian sources around 20 February 2017.", "The use of \u201csweet banana\u201d could imply a specific cultivar of banana known as a sugar banana or a \u201clady finger\u201d banana, but this would not change the nature of the claim appreciably.

Similarly, the risks of Starbucks' banana bread, which is made with eggs and bananas, would likely discourage the coffee chain from prominently featuring the product in their pastry section if it were going to kill the company's customers.", "We have uncovered no evidence the story referenced in the warning of a young man's dropping dead on the spot after consuming a banana and an egg is real, and we understand no mechanism by which a person\u2019s death could be triggered by the consumption of a benign egg and banana combination, absent a severe allergy to either food.", "Ayupp. \u00a0 \u201cMan Dies after Consuming Egg and Sweet Banana \u2013 Fake.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 20 February 2017.", "Bangalore Mirror. \u00a0 \u201cFake News Buster: Man Dies After Eating Egg and Sweet Banana.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 25 February 2017.", "Pareek, Sunil. \u00a0 Nutritional and Biochemical Composition of Banana (Musa spp.) Cultivars.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Nutritional Composition of Fruit Cultivars. \u00a0 2016.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
