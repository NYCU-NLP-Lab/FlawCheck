Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah, who expressed his support on Twitter.", "\"In #WI, over 44,000 jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada,\" Grothman said in a Jan. 16, 2020 tweet.", "The tweet also featured a graphic, attributed to the National Association of Manufacturers, which read: \"In Wisconsin 44,361 jobs depend on manufacturing exports to Canada and Mexico.\"", "Is Grothman\u2019s jobs claim correct?", "Well, yes and no.

Those far outpace China, which held down the No. 3 spot at $1.4 billion.", "The top Wisconsin export products in 2019 were industrial machinery ($5.6 billion), electric machinery ($2.4 billion) and medical and scientific instruments ($2.0 billion).", "When asked for backup for the claim, Grothman staff member Timothy Svoboda pointed to the National Association of Manufacturers graphic as well as the group\u2019s website, which includes the 44,361 number.", "The wrinkle: Grothman\u2019s claim spoke of jobs in general that depend on trade with Canada and Mexico, not just manufacturing jobs which -- obviously -- is a smaller segment.", "As such, he vastly undershoots his target. Grothman\u2019s omission of the word \"manufacturing\" is an example of how a word omission can significantly change the veracity of a statement.", "In a phone call with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Grothman acknowledged the mixup.", "In a Jan. 29, 2020 news release after Trump signed the trade deal, he offered a more accurate total, saying under the deal \"the 231,000 Wisconsin jobs and nearly $11 billion worth of Wisconsin exports supported by trade with Canada and Mexico will be provided a better playing field.\"", "In a tweet, Grothman said that in Wisconsin \"over 44,000 jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada.\"", "He actually undershoots the mark, since the 44,000 applies only to manufacturing jobs. The real total of jobs tied to Canada and Mexico trade is 231,000.", "To be sure, 231,000 jobs is more than the 44,000 jobs claimed in the tweet. But it could also give the impression that only 44,000 jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico -- a figure that is off the mark by an estimated 187,000 jobs, or 80.9%", "PolitiFact\u2019s definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate or leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
