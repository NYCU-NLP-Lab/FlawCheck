["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Former Gov. Tom Kean recently claimed he \"built the last nuclear plant -- not only in the state, but in the country.\"\n\nThe remark, published in an Aug. 1 question-and-answer column in The Star-Ledger, was in response to the question: \"Hearings began this week on Gov. Christie\u2019s new energy plan, which includes a nuclear component. Realistically, do you think New Jersey would accept a new nuclear plant?\"\n\nKean, a Republican, replied: \"I built the last nuclear plant -- not only in the state, but in the country. It wasn\u2019t easy politically, but Republicans and Democrats got together and acted for the future of the state. It\u2019s almost impossible to rely totally on fossil fuels, as of now, there are not enough alternatives. If we want efficient, cheap, nonpolluting energy, we may have to accept a new plant.\"\n\nBut did Kean really build the last nuclear power plant in the state and the nation?\n\nHe\u2019s right about New Jersey, but wrong about the country -- though it\u2019s worth noting that during his tenure as governor, one of the last nuclear power plants of its kind to be built in the United States started commercial operations.\n\nNew Jersey is home to four nuclear power plants.\n\nThe Oyster Creek plant in Lacey Township in Ocean County is operated by Illinois-based Exelon Generation. PSEG Nuclear, a subsidiary of PSEG Power, operates the other three plants -- Salem 1, Salem 2 and the Hope Creek Generating Station, all of which are in the same complex in Lower Alloways Creek Township in Salem County.\n\nHope Creek and Oyster Creek are two of 23 boiling water reactors in the United States with General Electric Mark I containment systems -- \u00a0similar to the ones at Japan\u2019s ill-fated Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which sparked a nuclear crisis after it sustained damage from a massive earthquake in March. \u00a0\n\nKean told PolitiFact New Jersey he was referring to Hope Creek and said he was basing his statement on a conversation he had with an expert at a nuclear conference he recently attended. But data from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission shows -- and a spokesman for the agency confirmed -- that Hope Creek wasn\u2019t the last nuclear plant built in the nation.\n\nAccording to data from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a construction permit for Hope Creek was issued on Nov. 4, 1974.\n\nJoe Delmar, spokesman for PSEG Nuclear, said actual \"shovel in the ground\" construction began in 1976. In July 1986 -- \u00a0during the beginning of Kean\u2019s second gubernatorial term -- an operating license was issued for the plant and commercial operations began there that December, according to the federal nuclear agency\u2019s data.\n\nConstruction hasn\u2019t started on any new nuclear power plants in New Jersey since -- though PSEG Power and PSEG Nuclear have submitted an application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review whether its Salem County site could support another nuclear power plant.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at nuclear power plants throughout the country.\n\nBecause Kean took office in 1982, after construction had begun on Hope Creek, we\u2019re only going to focus on nuclear power plants that started commercial operations after Hope Creek.\n\nOf 104 nuclear power plants in operation in the U.S., 19 started operating commercially after Hope Creek, according to federal data.\n\nThe last reactor to start commercial operations in the United States is the Watts Bar nuclear plant in Tennessee in 1996.\n\nScott Burnell, spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the Tennessee Valley Authority, which operates Watts Bar, has had a valid construction permit for a second reactor at the same location, and has applied for an operating license. The federal agency expects to have a final decision on that application next year, Burnell said.\n\nBack to Kean\u2019s statement.\n\nThe former governor said he \"built the last nuclear plant -- not only in the state, but in the country.\"\n\nHope Creek was completed during Kean\u2019s tenure and it is the last nuclear plant built in New Jersey. So he\u2019s right there.\n\nBut, a spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Hope Creek isn\u2019t the last nuclear power plant to be built in the United States.\n\nKean would be correct if he had said he built one of the last nuclear power plants of its kind in the United States. But he didn\u2019t specify, so we rate the statement Half True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "The Star-Ledger, Nuclear plant likely in N.J.\u2019s future, Aug. 1, 2011\n\nInterview with Tom Kean, former governor of New Jersey, Aug. 3, 2011\n\nUnited States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Hope Creek Generating Station, Unit 1, accessed Aug. 2, 2011\n\nUnited States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, U.S. Commercial Nuclear Power Reactors, accessed Aug. 3, 2011\n\nUnited States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Boiling Water Reactor Systems, accessed Aug. 4, 2011\n\nUnited States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Fermi Unit 2, accessed Aug. 4, 2011\n\nUnited States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, List of Power Reactor Units, accessed Aug. 3, 2011\n\nNuclear Energy Institute, General Statistical Information on U.S. Nuclear Power Plants, accessed Aug. 2, 2011\n\nNuclear Energy Institute, Report on BWR Mark I Containment, accessed Aug. 4, 2011\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration, Nuclear Reactor Characteristics and Operational History, accessed Aug. 2, 2011\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration, New Jersey Nuclear Profile, accessed Aug. 2, 2011\n\nExelon Generation, Oyster Creek Generating Station, access Aug. 2, 2011\n\nInterviews with Scott Burnell, spokesman for the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Aug. 3 & 4, 2011\n\nInterview with Joe Delmar, spokesman for PSEG Nuclear, Aug. 3, 2011\n\nThe Star-Ledger, New Salem County nuclear plant eyed in Christie's energy plans, June 8, 2011\n\nThe Star-Ledger, Nuclear regulators approve license renewals for two PSEG reactors in Salem County, June 30, 2011\n\nThe Star-Ledger, Japanese Fukushima Daiichi, N.J.
