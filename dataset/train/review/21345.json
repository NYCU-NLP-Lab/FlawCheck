["\u201cCorona virus developed in Canada and stolen by China?\u201d reads the headline of this article from January 22, 2020. It appears to be the first of a series of such claims about the coronavirus, which caused an outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan before spreading elsewhere in the country and around the world.", "Other social media users soon shared similar versions of the claim, referring to the investigation of two Chinese virologists in Canada in 2019. Kyle Bass, an American hedge fund manager who was shorting Hong Kong\u2019s currency, falsely claimed on Twitter that a \u201cChinese spy team\u201d sent pathogens \u201cto the Wuhan facility.\u201d He was retweeted 12,500 times, and screenshots of the tweet were shared on Facebook.", "The claims appear to be based on a mischaracterization of August 2019 reports about a transfer of Ebola and Henipah viruses from a Canadian lab to China, and an investigation involving two researchers at Canada\u2019s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, in the central province of Manitoba.", "The NML is part of the federal Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), whose senior media officer Tammy Jarbeau told AFP in January 2020 that \u201cthis is disinformation. (These) statements made on social networks have no factual basis.\u201d", "In July 2019, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that two researchers with ties to China were removed from the NML in Winnipeg by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for a possible \u201cpolicy breach.\u201d The article did not mention the coronavirus.", "Robert Cyrenne, spokesman for the RCMP in Manitoba, told AFP in January 2020 that \u201cthere is no connection between the outbreak in China and any RCMP investigation. Any reporting of such is misinformation.\u201d", "Dr Xiangguo Qiu, who helped develop a treatment for the Ebola virus, her husband Keding Cheng, a biologist who has published papers on coronavirus strains such as SARS-CoV, and Chinese students working under them had their security access revoked for Canada\u2019s only Level-4 lab, a facility equipped for research on the deadliest diseases.", "CBC later found through an access to information request that Qiu was responsible for a shipment of Ebola and Henipah viruses to the Wuhan Institute of Virology four months before she and her husband were escorted from the NML. These pathogens are not coronaviruses.", "The University of Manitoba, with which Qiu and Cheng were affiliated,\u00a0ended their non-salaried appointments and re-assigned the students working with them, a spokesperson told the Canadian Press.", "In February 2021, CBC reported that the couple were let go from the lab.", "The RCMP did not comment on the current whereabouts of Qiu and Cheng for privacy reasons.", "In a letter published on February 19, 2020 in The Lancet medical journal, a group of public health scientists made a statement about the origins of the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 disease.", "\u201cScientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens,\u201d they said.", "A team of scientists led by Shan-Lu Liu of The Ohio State University also concluded that there is no \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that the virus -- officially known as SARS-CoV-2 -- was engineered in a laboratory, in research published on February 26, 2020.", "Suggestions that the virus emanated from a laboratory gained renewed attention in 2021. Such claims remain unproven, but US President Joe Biden on May 26 ordered intelligence agencies to report to him within 90 days on the origin of Covid-19.", "AFP Fact Check\u2019s articles about Covid-19\u00a0can be found here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
