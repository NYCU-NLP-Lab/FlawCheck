["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on May 7, 2019", "As U.S. trade talks with China drag on, President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the U.S. has \u201cnever taken in 10 cents from China\u201d in tariffs, but \u201cnow we\u2019re taking in billions and billions of dollars.\u201d The U.S. has collected billions in customs duties on Chinese imports for years, although the amount has increased greatly since the trade war with China began.", "Trump also exaggerated the total trade deficit with China, as he has been doing for years.", "The U.S. and China have been trying to negotiate a trade agreement since last year, when\u00a0Trump initiated a\u00a0trade conflict\u00a0with China by imposing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. China responded with tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods.", "U.S. Trade Representative\u00a0Robert Lighthizer\u00a0and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin traveled to Beijing last week for the latest round of trade talks, and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is expected in Washington this week.", "\u201cAmbassador Lighthizer and I just concluded productive meetings with China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He. We will continue our talks in Washington, D.C. next week,\u201d Mnuchin tweeted on May 1.", "Two days later, at\u00a0a bilateral meeting with the prime minister of the Slovak Republic, Trump spoke about the status of the ongoing trade talks with China.", "Trump, May 3:\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019re taking in billions of dollars from China in the form of tariffs, as you know. We\u2019re charging China tariffs. We\u2019ve never taken in 10 cents from China, and now we\u2019re taking in billions and billions of dollars. That\u2019s had a very positive effect on things.", "The president distorts the facts about tariffs \u2014 again.\u00a0As we have written before,\u00a0tariffs are paid by U.S. importers in the form of customs duties, and to some extent by U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices.\u00a0They are not paid by China.\u00a0In an\u00a0interview\u00a0that aired May 7 on NPR, former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said: \u201cFor every dollar of tariff that\u2019s collected, it\u2019s coming out of disposable income of the United States consumer today.\u201d", "This time, the president compounded his false claim by stating that the U.S. has \u201cnever taken in 10 cents from China, and now we\u2019re taking in billions and billions of dollars.\u201d", "In fact, the U.S. has collected billions in tariffs on Chinese imports for years. Below is a chart we created from the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb, which uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau.", "As the chart shows, tariff revenue has increased substantially as a result of the increased tariffs on Chinese imports \u2014 up 70 percent in 2018 over the previous calendar year. But revenue was already in the billions before Trump took office \u2014 contrary to the president\u2019s claim.", "Trump also claimed that the increased tariffs he has imposed on China have \u201chad a very positive effect on things.\u201d It is true that the increase has raised more in revenue, as we\u2019ve shown.\u00a0However, China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural and food products threaten to reduce the U.S. agricultural trade surplus in fiscal year 2019 to the lowest level since 2007, partly because of \u201csignificant declines in projected exports to China,\u201d\u00a0according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service.", "China has placed tariffs on more than 800 U.S. products, \u201cincluding soybeans, pork, dairy products, fruits and nuts, seafood, and processed products,\u201d according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.", "\u201cChina has fallen from the leading export market for U.S. agricultural products in FY2017 to the third-leading export market in FY2018 due to the retaliatory tariffs, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA forecasts that China will fall to the fifth-leading market for those products in FY2019,\u201d CRS said in a Dec. 31, 2018, report.", "The report goes on to say:\u00a0\u201cIn November 2018, USDA forecast that U.S. agricultural and food exports to China would decline to $9 billion in FY2019 from $16.3 billion in FY2018 and $21.8 billion in FY2017, citing reduced exports due to the \u2018trade tensions\u2019 between the United States and China.\u201d", "Trump has expressed concern in recent days about the pace of negotiations with China. On May 5, Trump threatened to impose more tariffs on China, complaining that the trade talks have moved \u201ctoo slowly.\u201d", "A day later, Trump falsely\u00a0tweeted: \u201cWith China we lose 500 Billion Dollars.\u201d\u00a0Trump commonly distorts the facts about trade deficits. In fact, the U.S. had a total trade deficit with China in goods and services of nearly $379 billion\u00a0in 2018. The U.S. had a deficit in goods of about $419 billion with China, but that was offset by a $40.5 billion trade surplus in services.", "In his remarks on May 3, the president also said this about the European Union: \u201cWe\u2019re losing $181 billion a year. We have been for many years.\u201d The U.S. had a $110 billion total deficit in goods and services with the EU in 2018, up 20 percent since Trump took office. The U.S. deficit in goods was $170 billion, but the U.S. had a $60 billion surplus in services.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
