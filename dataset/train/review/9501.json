["People look from a pedestrian bridge, Monday, Dec. 28, 2020, to view the area several blocks away where an explosion took place Christmas Day in Nashville, Tenn. (AP)", "There is no evidence to suggest that the Dec. 25 explosion was election-related. Both companies have denied the posts\u2019 claims, saying that there was no such audit and that Dominion\u2019s machines were not recently transported to Nashville, Tenn.", "In the wake of the Christmas morning explosion in Nashville, Tenn., a baseless conspiracy theory started circulating online that claims Nashville\u2019s downtown AT&T complex, which was damaged in the blast, had gotten a contract to conduct a \"forensic audit\" on Dominion Voting Systems machines. The post implies that the bombing was an attempt to stop the audit and cover up voter fraud.", "\"AT&T got a contract to do forensic audit on Dominion voting machines and those machines were being moved to Nashville this past week,\" one Dec. 27 post says. \"So, the explosion \u2018just happened\u2019 to be at the AT&T location where they \u2018just so happen\u2019 to control the cooling system for the super computer and house the dominion voting machines and drives for forensic audit\u2026\"", "\"Wait, the bombing in Nashville was at the AT&T data center right after they got the contract to audit the Dominion voting machines?,\" one from Dec. 26 reads. \"That\u2019s an interesting coincidence.\"", "But none of this is true.
