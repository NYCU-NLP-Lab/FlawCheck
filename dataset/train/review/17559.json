["By Saranac Hale Spencer and Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 5, 2021", "A\u00a0two-hour video, claiming to prove that the 2020 presidential election was \u201cstolen\u201d from former President Donald Trump,\u00a0has been viewed tens of thousands of times online and\u00a0aired\u00a0on the cable channel One America News Network. But the video\u00a0rehashes baseless conspiracy theories and debunked claims.", "Three months after Election Day and two weeks after President Joe Biden took office, a video rehashing debunked claims of fraud played repeatedly on the conservative cable station One America News Network.", "Mike Lindell \u2014 an avid supporter of former President Donald Trump and CEO of MyPillow, Inc. \u2014 created and presented the video, which reportedly aired with a disclaimer saying that it expressed his \u201copinion\u201d and that he had purchased the airtime starting Feb. 5 and extending through the weekend.", "It was viewed tens of thousands of times on social media, including YouTube and Facebook.", "The video is titled: \u201cAbsolute Proof.\u201d But Lindell\u2019s assertion that the election was \u201cstolen\u201d from Trump has no factual basis and many of the claims he relies on in the roughly two-hour video have already been debunked.", "Biden won both the Electoral College and the popular vote in an election federal, state and local election officials\u00a0called \u201cthe most secure in American history.\u201d Then-Attorney General William Barr said there were no signs of fraud on a scale that would have changed the results. A group of 59 election-security experts and computer scientists signed a letter explaining that widespread claims of fraud \u201ceither have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent.\u201d Dozens of current and former Republican officials or party brass have publicly rejected the claims. And federal, state, and local courts that have been presented with allegations of fraud have dismissed the suits.", "Despite that, the falsehoods persist.", "Early in the video, Lindell rattles off a long list of instances of alleged fraud, many of which aren\u2019t new.", "For example, he claims that there were \u201c10,315\u201d cases of dead people voting in Georgia. But Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, told Congress in a Jan. 6 letter that that allegation \u201cis not supported by any evidence\u201d and that officials had identified only two potential cases, which were both under investigation at the time.", "Lindell also refers to \u201c100,000\u201d ballots in Wisconsin being backdated by the U.S. Postal Service. But even if that claim were true, and there is no evidence that it is, it wouldn\u2019t have affected election results since all ballots had to be received by Election Day in order to be counted, as USA Today\u00a0previously\u00a0explained.", "A central focus appears to be what he deems \u201cabsolute proof of the biggest cyberattack in history.\u201d But the claim is really just a warmed-over version of a conspiracy theory about a secret supercomputer that we\u2019ve already addressed.", "The theory appeared several days before the election on a dubious blog called the American Report, which claimed that Biden was using a supercomputer called \u201cHammer\u201d and a software program called \u201cScorecard\u201d to \u201cSteal Another Presidential Election.\u201d", "The premise of the theory is that \u201cHammer\u201d and \u201cScorecard\u201d can be used to access electronic voting systems and switch or change votes.", "It was elevated to national attention when Sidney Powell, a lawyer who joined Trump\u2019s legal team after the election, promoted it on Fox News.", "But the bogus theory was directly disputed by federal and state officials, as well as experts who study election security, as we explained at the time.", "The U.S.\u00a0Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency flatly rejected the claim.\u00a0The agency\u2019s director, Chris Krebs \u2014 who was appointed by Trump \u2014 called the theory \u201cnonsense\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d", "CISA has\u00a0said\u00a0that safeguards \u2014 including auditable logs and software checks \u2014 used by states ensure accuracy in the vote totals.", "Still, Lindell invited Mary Fanning, one of the authors of the original American Report post, to present an updated version of the theory on his video.", "\u201cThis is a documentation, the proof positive\u201d that foreign governments manipulated the results of the election, she said, while showing a map of the world with lines connecting China, Iran and other countries to the U.S.", "Fanning called it \u201can act of war to come in and steal the election from the American people.\u201d", "She had cited the same map in a Jan. 3 blog post claiming that the originator of the conspiracy theory had \u201crevealed that there is not just one HAMMER in the United States, but now, also a second HAMMER in the United Kingdom, and also, a third HAMMER in China.\u201d", "The theory isn\u2019t any more convincing with three supercomputers than it was with one.", "Much of the video also regurgitates claims about Antrim County, Michigan, that stem from an error in the initial, unofficial election results \u2014 which wrongly showed Biden leading Trump in the reliably Republican county. The results were corrected by Nov. 6 and state and local officials have repeatedly explained the mistake as a human error.", "Lindell highlights a report that disagreed with that explanation and claimed that Dominion Voting Systems software was designed with errors \u201cto create systemic fraud and influence election results.\u201d", "We wrote about that report in December, when an audit that involved a hand tally of the underlying paper ballots disproved the conspiracy theory. The audit\u00a0showed\u00a0a gain of 11 votes for Trump and a loss of one vote for Biden; small variances are expected in a machine versus hand count.", "The flawed report was prepared by Allied Security Operations Group, an outfit founded by Russell Ramsland Jr. \u2014 a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in Texas in 2016 and who has claimed that a \u201cdeep state\u201d was undermining Trump. Ramsland appears in the video.", "Experts told us that among the report\u2019s flaws was a calculation of a purported \u201cerror rate\u201d of 68.05%, which is referenced in the new video, that actually included entries on a log that weren\u2019t \u201cerrors\u201d but standard, expected responses as the tabulators process the paper ballots.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
