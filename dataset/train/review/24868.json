She said if black people didn\u2019t like the flag, get the hell out. It\u2019s really strange to have someone call your house, ask for you by name, and call you a nigger. I\u2019m used to stuff like that. When I was in the 10th grade, I had a police escort because my dad spoke out against the KKK. But I have to tell my parents what we\u2019re [SAAE] going to do beforehand. I told them we were going to a demonstration, and we were going to have a rally. I kind of left out the flag burning part.\"", "In a statement sent to PolitiFact from Abigail Collazo, director of strategic communications for Abrams\u2019s campaign, the spokesperson describes Georgia at a crossroads during the candidate\u2019s college years.

This conversation was sweeping across Georgia as numerous organizations, prominent leaders, and students engaged in the ultimately successful effort to change the flag.\"", "While it\u2019s true that Abrams was at a protest where Georgia\u2019s state flag was burned, context matters.
