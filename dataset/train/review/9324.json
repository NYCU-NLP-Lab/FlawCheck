["Time and again, Republican Glen Sturtevant is telling Chesterfield County voters whom to blame for doubling their car registration fees.", "Democrat Dan Gecker \"voted to double vehicle registration fees, costing county residents $6 million annually in additional fees,\" Sturtevant says in at least three campaign mailers in the state Senate\u2019s 10th District.", "Sturtevant, a Richmond School Board member, and Gecker, a Chesterfield supervisor, are squaring off in a key race that could determine which political party controls the state Senate, which now has a 21-19 GOP majority. They are seeking to replace longtime Republican incumbent John Watkins, who is not seeking re-election.", "A Sturtevant TV ad features a bike racer pedaling hard while the narrator says Gecker is in \"a race to raise your taxes.\" Among the ensuing charges is that Gecker \"voted\" to \"double vehicle registration fees, costing us $6 million in one year.\"", "We investigated whether Gecker really did vote to double the fee.", "Matt Brown, campaign manager for Sturtevant, told us the claim is based on Gecker\u2019s actions last year, when the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors was considering the county\u2019s 2014-15 capital improvement plan and its budget.", "Among the proposals was to increase the county\u2019s $20 car registration fee to $40, to raise $7.5 million for local transportation needs that the state would match.", "The proposal was controversial and, at Gecker\u2019s request during a supervisors meeting April 23, 2014, it was pulled from the capital improvement plan and voted on separately. The $20 increase passed, 3-2, with Gecker voting against it.", "A tape of the meeting shows Gecker offered no explanation at the time of his vote. But about 10 minutes later, he said it should be a higher priority for the county to dedicate long-term revenues for clean-water programs mandated by the federal government than to raise fees for transportation.", "Gecker did not push for the clean water funding, however, saying he realized his view was in the minority.", "Given Gecker\u2019s clear vote against the fee increase, what evidence does Sturtevant offer that his opponent actually voted for it?", "Brown, in an email, replied that Gecker later that same April day voted for the entire capital improvement plan \u2014 which funds long-term construction projects \u2014 and then for the county\u2019s operating budget. The two are connected, because revenues from the car registration fee flow into the county\u2019s operating budget and then are allocated to the capital improvement plan. Brown said this counts as two Gecker votes for the raised fee.", "We should point out that the 134-page capital improvement plan was filled with line items for projects totaling $848 million over five years. The 208-page operating budget funded $766 million of services, including education, public safety and health programs. Gecker told us that while he didn\u2019t agree with every line item, he supported the overall benefits of the spending plans.", "Brown cited a third vote, as well, that occurred Feb. 26, 2014 \u2014 almost two months before the budget was approved. Gecker concurred in the Chesterfield board\u2019s unanimous vote to advertise all fee and tax rate increases being considered in the budget \u2014 including the car registration increase \u2014 and to set a public hearing on them March 26.", "It should be noted that this is a required step in budget deliberations and that the mere advertisement of possible tax rate increases doesn\u2019t obligate local board or council members ultimately to support them.", "Our ruling", "Sturtevant says Gecker \"voted to double vehicle registration fees, costing county residents $6 million annually in additional fees.\"", "The simple truth is just the opposite. When the $20 increase came up for a vote before the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors in April 2014, Gecker opposed it. Despite his opposition, it passed on a 3-2 vote.", "Sturtevant, in trying to justify his claim, dismisses this obvious vote. His campaign instead argues that Gecker subsequently voted to pass massive spending plans that fund all of the county\u2019s public services and public improvement projects. The new registration fees were a tiny part of these plans.", "The Sturtevant camp also notes that Gecker, in 2014, voted to advertise that the board was considering the $20 increase. But that\u2019s not tantamount to voting in support of the increase. Local governing boards are required to give notice for a public hearing whenever a fee or tax increase is on the table.", "Keep your eye on the ball. Again, the only time the fee increase came up for a direct vote, Gecker opposed it.", "We rate Sturtevant\u2019s claim False.", "Sturtevant for Senate flier, \"On higher taxes, Dan Gecker says we need flexibility,\" Sept. 25, 2015.", "Sturtevant for Senate flier, \"Dan Gecker...the gecko of politics,\" Sept. 26, 2015.", "Sturtevant for Senate flier, \"The difference is clear,\" Oct. 2, 2015.", "Sturtevant for Senate TV ad, \"Dan Gecker\u2019s Record,\" Oct. 5, 2015.", "Email from Matt Brown, campaign manager for Sturtevant for Senate, Oct. 7, 2015.", "Democratic Party of Virginia, \"Fact check: Glen Sturtevant\u2019s new ad lies about Dan Gecker\u2019s record,\" Oct. 5, 2015.", "Chesterfield Board of Supervisors, Minutes, Feb. 26, 2014.", "Chesterfield Board of Supervisors, Videotape, ,Feb. 26, 2014, (Discussion of Item 4, 7:40 on tape).", "Chesterfield Board of Supervisors, Minutes, April 23, 2014.", "Chesterfield Board of Supervisors, Videotape, April 23, 2014.", "Richmond Times-Dispatch, \"Real estate tax to be raised a penny,\" April 24, 2014.", "Richmond Times-Dispatch, \"Higher fees may be in future,\" Feb. 22, 2014.", "Chesterfield Observer, \"Budget ax falls -- sort of,\" April 30, 2014.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
