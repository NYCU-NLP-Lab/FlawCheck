["About this rating", "Shortly after NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick made national headlines in August 2016 by refusing to stand for the playing of the U.S. national anthem, explaining that he would not honor the flag of a country that oppresses black people, several fringe web sites published articles claiming that the actual reason behind his protest was that the San Francisco 49ers QB had recently converted to Islam:", "The entire country has been shocked and outraged over San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s refusal to stand for the National Anthem. Kaepernick claimed that he remained seated because of \u201cracism\u201d that causes \u201coppression\u201d in the United States. But new details about Kaepernick\u2019s personal life may shed some light on this ridiculous new attitude of his.", "It turns out that Kaepernick has been dating a Muslim girl, and is apparently converting to Islam for her.", "Messages claiming that Kaepernick had converted to Islam were frequently attached to one of two photographs:", "Both of the above-displayed images are fake. The image on the right was created by adding Kaepernick's face over a photograph of Osama bin Laden, while the image on the left was created by adding an Islamic symbol to a photograph of Kaepernick. The original, unaltered images can be seen below:", "Dozens of fringe web sites maintained in August 2016 that Kaepernick had converted to Islam, but all of these reports stemmed back to an anonymous tip posted by the sports gossip site Terez Owens in July 2015:", "Now we\u2019re hearing he\u2019s transitioning to become a Muslim, according to people close to the player. We received this in our tipbox, Colin\u2019s girlfriend, Hot 97 DJ Nessa, introduced him to the teachings of Islam, and he\u2019s ready to embrace it fully.

People are terrified of them to the point where Trump wants to ban all Muslims from coming here, which is ridiculous.\u201d", "Kaepernick also addressed reports that he\u2019s been heavily influenced by girlfriend Nessa Diab, a radio host.", "\u201cThe impact is just conversations that we constantly have,\" he said. \u201cThis is an open discussion that I have with many people, not just my woman. She is Muslim, her family is Muslim, I have great respect for them. I have great respect for people\u2019s right to believe what they want to believe. And I don\u2019t think anybody should be prosecuted for judged based on what their beliefs all.\"", "Branch, Eric. \u00a0 \"49ers\u2019 Colin Kaepernick Transcript: \u2018I\u2019ll Continue to Sit.\u2019\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 San Francisco Chronicle. \u00a0 28 August 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
