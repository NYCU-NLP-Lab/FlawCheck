["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on November 19, 2020 | Updated on November 30, 2020", "About a week after Georgia\u2019s special election headed to a runoff, Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican, and Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, both launched questionable attacks that the other candidate has disputed:", "The race between Loeffler, Georgia\u2019s junior senator, and Warnock, a political newcomer, is one of two runoff elections in the state that will decide which political party has control of the U.S. Senate during the next session of Congress.", "Loeffler, a wealthy businesswoman, was appointed to the seat she currently occupies after Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson retired in December 2019 for health reasons. The winner of the upcoming Jan. 5 election will serve the last two years of Isakson\u2019s six-year term that started in early 2017.", "Loeffler\u2019s campaign released its ad attacking Warnock on Nov. 12. So far it has aired over 1,900 times at a cost of more than $900,000, according to Advertising Analytics.", "It claims he \u201ccalled police thugs and gangsters, hosted a rally for Communist dictator Fidel Castro, and praised Marxism in speeches and writings.\u201d", "\u201cRaphael Warnock will give the radicals total control,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says.", "In a 2015 sermon, Warnock, the senior pastor of Atlanta\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church, specifically said police in Ferguson, Missouri \u2014 where Michael Brown, an unarmed, 18-year-old Black man was shot and killed by a white officer in August 2014 \u2014 displayed \u201ca kind of gangster and thug mentality.\u201d He was not talking about all law enforcement, his campaign told us in an email.", "But Warnock did write in his 2013 book about theology that \u201cthe Marxist critique has much to teach the black church.\u201d That quote was highlighted in the Breitbart story cited in Loeffler\u2019s ad.", "As for the claim about Castro, the decades-long leader of Cuba who died in November 2016, the Loeffler campaign points to an October 1995 speech he gave at New York City\u2019s Abyssinian Baptist Church, where Warnock worked at the time.", "But Warnock \u2014 while avoiding saying whether he attended the event or not \u2014 has denied that he had any say in inviting Castro to speak.", "In a Nov. 15 interview, for example, Warnock told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper: \u201cI was a youth pastor. I had nothing to do with that program. I did not make any decisions regarding the program. I have never met the Cuban dictator, and so I\u2019m not connected to him.\u201d", "At the time, the Associated Press reported that the event with Castro was organized by the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organizing, which the wire service said had long advocated lifting the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba. Abyssinian\u2019s pastor, the Rev. Calvin Butts, spoke at the event.", "The Loeffler campaign didn\u2019t respond to our request for evidence that Warnock was involved in the church hosting Castro.", "Update, Nov. 30: On Nov. 26, Loeffler and the National Republican Senatorial Committee began airing a Spanish-language ad in which a narrator makes a similarly misleading claim about Warnock organizing an event for Castro.", "Warnock\u2019s anti-Loeffler ad began running statewide on Nov. 13. To date it has aired more than 1,300 times at a cost of more than $1 million, according to Advertising Analytics.", "The narrator of the ad says: \u201cJanuary 6, billionaire Kelly Loeffler is sworn into office and over the next 18 days doesn\u2019t make a single stock transaction. Then Loeffler receives a confidential briefing on the threat of coronavirus and immediately starts dumping stocks. As Kelly Loeffler downplays the threat publicly, she makes sale after sale, getting rid of $3.1 million before the market crashes.\u201d", "Federal financial disclosures Loeffler filed do show that between $1.3 million and $3 million in stocks she and her husband, New York Stock Exchange Chairman Jeff Sprecher, jointly owned were sold between Jan. 24 \u2014 when senators received a private briefing about the novel coronavirus \u2014 and mid-February.", "But Loeffler, who, combined with Sprecher, has an estimated net worth of as much as $800 million, said the decision to unload those stocks and purchase a few more was made independently by third-party advisers overseeing the couple\u2019s stock holdings \u2014 not her.", "After the Daily Beast news website broke the story about Loeffler\u2019s stocks on March 19, the senator first attempted to set the record straight in two early morning tweets on March 20. \u201cThis is a ridiculous and baseless attack,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband\u2019s knowledge or involvement.\u201d", "Loeffler gave similar explanations in subsequent television interviews and an April 8 Wall Street Journal op-ed, in which she provided more detail about the investors and announced that \u2014 in an attempt \u201cto move beyond the distraction\u201d \u2014 she and her husband would divest from their individual stocks.", "\u201cI have never used any confidential information I received while performing my Senate duties as a means of making a private profit. Nor has anyone in my family,\u201d she wrote in the Journal column. \u201cMy family\u2019s investments are managed by third-party advisers at Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Sepio Capital and Wells Fargo. These professionals buy and sell stocks on our behalf. We don\u2019t direct trading in these accounts. These trades are disclosed routinely and publicly in reports to the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, in full compliance with transparency laws.\u201d", "In fact, the Senate\u2019s ethics panel investigated allegations that Loeffler may have violated federal laws or Senate rules against insider trading and found no evidence that she had. The Justice Department also reportedly dropped its own investigation of Loeffler and two other senators \u2014 Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, and James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican \u2014 who reported selling large amounts of stock after the January briefing.", "We asked, but the Warnock campaign didn\u2019t provide evidence that Loeffler personally made the decision to sell the stocks in question.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
