That\u2019s a 77 percent increase.", "Given the well-known water woes in the Peach State, how is that possible?", "Conservation plays some role, which we will get into in a moment.", "But the biggest factor was the change in how thermoelectric plants across the state operated.", "Several of the facilities were decommissioned between 2000 and 2010 \u2013 during the worst of the drought years and the decade that saw usage plunge nearly 28 percent, said Steve Lawrence, a hydrologist with the USGS in Atlanta.", "Several other plants converted from coal-fired, which needs plenty of water to cool it as an energy source, to natural gas, Lawrence said.", "\"Thermoelectric withdrawals account typically for a third of withdrawals, so all water withdrawals decrease when such a large user drops its share,\" Lawrence said.", "Data is not available for 1980 for the per capita usage in Georgia. But 1985 and 2010 figures mirror the overall trend.", "Every Georgian used about 860 gallons of water daily in 1985 but only 470 gallons daily in 2010, Lawrence said.", "Those totals include a person\u2019s share of water that a utility, say Georgia Power, uses to provide electricity.", "It\u2019s unclear what the per person usage would be in 1985, if the water used by agriculture, industry and utilities are removed.", "But in 2010, it was an estimated 75 gallons a day per person to bathe, cook and clean, Lawrence said.", "\"That\u2019s a good number, one you see with the push for water-efficient fixtures and conservation efforts like tiered pricing,\" Lawrence said.", "Local water providers, however, don\u2019t always follow the statewide trend.", "The Cobb County Water System can provide daily usage dating back to 1986, when the then-small county used just 38.6 million gallons countywide.", "In 1990, when the county had about 451,000 people, average daily use was 42.5 million gallons countywide.", "In 2010, about 688,000 people lived in Cobb, and daily usage was 57.1 million gallons for the county.", "That\u2019s a 53 percent jump in population, and a 34 percent increase in daily usage. Although the daily usage did not keep pace with the population increase, the jump itself bucks the state trend.", "However, water system officials point out that Cobb saw usage drop 14 percent countywide between 2006 and 2014, during the worst of the recent droughts.", "The 2014 daily usage, of 104 gallons per person, also is down 15 percent from the 122 gallons per person in 2005, when the county began looking at per capita usage.", "\"You can see very clearly the impact of our water conservation efforts, which became much more aggressive in 2008,\" county spokeswoman AikWah Leow said.", "Our ruling", "News reports claimed that Georgia has seen its water usage drop over the past three decades, in the same period that the population mushroomed.", "Federal reports confirm that unlikely shift, largely due to a change from coal-fired electric plants to facilities powered by natural gas.", "Conservation efforts also have made an impact, even if local water systems don\u2019t show quite the same drop in usage.", "But the statewide trend is clear.
