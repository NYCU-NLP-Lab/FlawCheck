["About this rating", "In the midst of a September 2017 controversy over a protest movement among professional football players to \"take a knee\" or stay in their locker rooms during pre-game renditions of the U.S. national anthem, social media rumors and news content suggested that satellite television company DIRECTV was offering refunds of NFL Sunday Ticket subscriptions to disgruntled customers:", "Good news, @DIRECTV customers! They've just announced they're refunding money to ppl offended by TV programs.

One said refunds to those concerned about the anthem protests were only offered to subscribers with certain offers or plans. One representative said full refunds were available for those who complained about anthem protests. Another said such people could only get prorated refunds for the remainder of the season. Yet other representatives said the policy hadn\u2019t changed and that no refunds were allowed for any reason.", "However, DirecTV subscribers contacted by The Wall Street Journal showed the satellite broadcaster was offering at least some refunds.", "Other news reports on the subject frequently cited the WSJ (and not DIRECTV) as a source, and none of them referenced any official \"announcement\" from the satellite TV provider:", "DirecTV is offering unprecedented refunds for fans who want to cancel their NFL Sunday Ticket package, if they inform the company that they are doing so due to the recent protests during the national anthem, a source confirmed.", "Once the season starts, fans usually cannot cancel their subscriptions, but AT&T, which owns DirecTV, decided to change the policy due to the sensitivity of the issue. The price of the package, which allows fans to get out-of-market games, is about $280.", "An AT&T spokesperson declined to confirm the cancellation policy and said the company would have no numbers to share.", "Some versions of the rumor stated that DIRECTV had \"announced\" an NFL subscription refund policy specifically linked to the protests. But comments posted to DIRECTV's Facebook wall by customers appeared to fall into two camps \u2014 some subscribers merely repeated the rumor, while others reported they had been unable to obtain refunds:", "Some customer tweets suggested that subscribers had been able to negotiate NFL package cancellations with DIRECTV individually, not as part of a policy enacted by the TV provider:", "There are roughly 2 million @directv Sunday Ticket subscribers.
