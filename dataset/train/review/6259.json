Tucker gave the example of thousands of people at a Trump rally in Butler, Pa.", "They loved Trump, Carlson said, largely because \"because no one else loves them.\"", "\"The country they built, the country their ancestors fought for over hundreds of years, has left them to die in their unfashionable little towns,\" Carlson said. \"Mocked and despised by the sneering half wits with finance degrees, but no actual skills, who seem to run everything all of a sudden.\"", "Carlson found proof of this disdain from \"the professional class\" in the opioid epidemic that ravaged Butler.", "\"When large numbers of people in Butler started killing themselves with narcotics, no one in Washington or New York or Los Angeles said a word about it,\" Carlson said. \"Whatever Donald Trump's faults, he is better than the rest of the people in charge. At least he doesn't hate them for their weakness.\"", "We can\u2019t quantify whether leaders in Washington or large cities on the East and West coasts hate people in smaller cities and towns beset by opioid addiction, but we can assess whether these leaders ignored the epidemic.", "The pattern that emerges from the record of budgets and reports, and from interviews, is that the response at both the federal and state levels was slow in coming, but the epidemic was not ignored.", "Butler is just north of Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania. The city has only about 13,000 people, but nearly 188,000 people live in Butler County. The area has lost manufacturing jobs over the decades, but it is no post-industrial wasteland.

Compared with other Pennsylvania counties, it has an overdose death rate that is about average \u2014 24 deaths per 100,000 in 2018. That\u2019s essentially unchanged from four years ago, but the rate spiked to 50 per 100,000 in 2017, before dropping back down.", "Emergency room physician Jeanmarie Perrone in Philadelphia said that by about 2008 or so, it was clear that prescribing opioids wasn\u2019t making people better. But it took a few more years for doctors and the public health community to see that opioid addiction had spread widely.", "\"The awareness came that this wasn't an urban problem, the pills were ubiquitous,\" Perrone said. \"You didn't need to be in a city to find a doctor to prescribe them.\"", "Perrone said that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration was the first to sound the alarm, followed by the Justice Department and later still, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "Congress and the Obama administration were not silent about prescription opioids such as oxycontin, but it took awhile for them to back up their words with dollars.", "In 2011, the Obama administration unveiled the government\u2019s first plan to tackle prescription drug abuse.", "\"Prescription drug abuse is the nation\u2019s fastest-growing drug problem,\" a White House report said.", "It listed the statistics.

In February 2016, the president\u2019s budget called for $1 billion over two years to \"expand access to treatment for prescription drug abuse and heroin use.\"", "The sense that more needed to be done grew, but Johns Hopkins School of Public Health epidemiologist Caleb Alexander said Carlson\u2019s dichotomy of coastal elites and inland workers doesn\u2019t hold up.", "\"I don\u2019t think that this is a Washington vs. Main Street matter,\" Alexander said. \"It is a matter of a broad and multifaceted epidemic that has impacted urban and rural America alike.\"", "In Pennsylvania, Perrone said the sense among frontline workers was less that of abandonment by the government, and more that of uncertainty of how to respond.", "\"Nobody knew what to do,\" Perrone said. \"You couldn\u2019t just stop giving opioids. You couldn\u2019t take them all off the market. We were teaching doctors to prescribe them more safely, but that\u2019s not easy. The horse was out of the barn, and there wasn\u2019t an obvious answer as to what would work.\"", "Perrone added that the makers and distributors of prescription opioids formed a potent lobby that successfully argued against any moves that would reduce their sales.", "Carlson\u2019s point that Washington ignored places like Butler County is undercut by a working group of U.S. attorneys. They met in 2014 to tackle the epidemic and presented a plan to change their approach.

By 2011, the administration had put forth a strategy to reduce prescription opioid deaths. The U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania led a Justice Department task force focused on the epidemic.", "There is room to criticize Washington for failing to put more money into the problem sooner, but by 2015, the White House was calling for a major increase in spending of $1 billion over two years.", "A frontline clinician at a Philadelphia hospital said if the response was delayed, it was partly because the sense of what would work evolved along with the epidemic.", "We rate this claim Mostly False.", "Fox News, Tucker Carlson, Nov. 2, 2020", "U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Timeline of Selected FDA Activities and Significant Events Addressing Opioid Misuse and Abuse, accessed Nov. 4, 2020", "White House, National drug control strategy, 2011", "White House, Epidemic: Responding to America\u2019s Prescription Drug Abuse Crisis, 2011", "U.S. Justice Department, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Working Group on Drug Overdose and Addiction: Prevention, Intervention, Treatment and Recovery, Sept. 29, 2014", "U.S. Health and Human Services Department, Opioid Abuse in the U.S. and HHS Actions to Address Opioid-Drug Related Overdoses and Deaths, March 26, 2015", "White House, President Obama Proposes $1.1 Billion in New Funding to Address the Prescription Opioid Abuse and Heroin Use Epidemic, Feb. 2, 2016", "OverdosefreePA, Death Data Overview: 2015-2018, accessed Nov. 3, 2020", "Office of National Drug Control Policy, Budget and Performance, accessed Nov. 4, 2020", "House Majority Policy Committee, Combating Pennsylvania\u2019s Opioid Epidemic, October 2016", "Pennsylvania Department of Health, Prescription drug monitoring program Q and A, accessed Nov. 4, 2020", "ProPublica, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act: Butler County, Pa., accessed Nov. 4, 2020", "University of Pennsylvania Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, Pennsylvania Launches its Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, Aug. 25, 2016", "U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee , Field hearing: Examining the impact of the opioid epidemic in Ohio, April 22, 2016", "Washington Post, Deaths from opioid overdoses set a record in 2014, Dec. 18, 2015", "Interview, Andrew Kolodny, medical director, Opioid Policy Research, Brandeis University, Nov. 4, 2020", "Email exchange, Caleb Alexander, professor of epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Nov. 4, 2020", "Email exchange, E.
