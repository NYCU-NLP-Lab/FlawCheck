After all, would a major auto manufacturer really use this acronym for a new car? Or did some graphic designer pull a prank or make a mistake?", "To make things a little more confusing, one of the most widely shared articles about the Subaru F.U.C.K.S. came from Funny Or Die, an entertainment website that is better known for its comedic content than for its news reporting:", "The 2020 Singapore Motor Show took place this past week, which is an event I didn\u2019t even know existed until now because, well, auto companies showcasing their new models isn\u2019t something I care enough about to mark in my calendar. However this year\u2019s show has uhhhhh definitely piqued my interest.", "Subaru was one of the companies unveiling their upcoming vehicles and one model in particular caught everyone\u2019s eye.

The vehicle is also closer to the ground than usual, and that\u2019s because it sits on 20-inch Enkei wheels wrapped in low-profile rubber. The gray metal is nicely complemented by the blacked-out headlamps and taillamps.", "The interior features a dark theme, with contrast red stitching all around to match the STI badge on the gearshifter. The seats, meanwhile, are covered in suede and leather, which also give a nice premium feel. The same soft-touch materials have also been plastered on the dashboard and the side panels.
