["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on June 21, 2019", "In launching his reelection campaign, President Donald Trump repeated a claim about new auto plants that he made a year-and-a-half ago. It\u2019s still not true, and it fits a pattern of Trump falsely boasting of unexpected or unusual gains in the auto industry.", "Trump said of the U.S. auto industry in his June 18 rally in Orlando: \u201cMany, many plants are now under construction in Michigan and Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida. They hadn\u2019t built one in decades and now they\u2019re all over the place.\u201d It\u2019s not true that the auto industry hasn\u2019t built a new plant \u201cin decades.\u201d As for the \u201cmany, many plants \u2026 now under construction,\u201d Bernard Swiecki, director of the Automotive Communities Partnership at the\u00a0Center for Automotive Research,\u00a0told us he knew of only two new assembly plants under construction or newly announced \u2014\u00a0 a Toyota/Mazda joint venture plant in Alabama (announced in January 2018) and a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) plant in Michigan (announced in February).", "Swiecki sent us a list of the 12 assembly plants that have been announced in North America since 2009. Four of those were in the U.S., while eight went to Mexico and none to Canada.", "CAR,\u00a0a research group based in Michigan that receives some of its funding from the government, tracks auto industry investments in North America.", "On Jan. 30, 2018, in his State of the Union speech, Trump similarly claimed: \u201cMany car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States \u2014 something we haven\u2019t seen for decades.\u201d At the time, we wrote that two new auto assembly plants had been announced in the nine years before Trump took office, as\u00a0Kristin Dziczek,\u00a0vice president of CAR\u2019s industry, labor & economics group, told us.", "In 2015, Volvo announced its\u00a0first U.S. plant in Berkeley County, South Carolina \u2014 one of the states Trump mentioned in his June 18 rally. Volvo says on its website that it broke ground on the plant on Sept. 25, 2015.", "Also that year, Mercedes-Benz announced it, too, would open an assembly plant in South Carolina. It celebrated the groundbreaking in July 2016.", "In 2008 (therefore not included in Swiecki\u2019s 2009-present tally), Volkswagen\u00a0announced it had chosen Chattanooga, Tennessee,\u00a0for a new midsize sedan assembly plant. Production began in April 2011, the company said in a 2018 press release celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its decision to set up shop in Chattanooga. Since then, Volkswagen has continued to expand and invest in that facility. In 2014, it announced it would produce the midsize SUV Atlas there, beginning production in December 2016. In 2018 and 2019, it said it would make further investments in the facility to produce a five-passenger SUV and manufacture electric vehicles, respectively.", "Most investments in recent years, Dziczek told us in January 2018, have been for \u201cexpansion and retooling of existing facilities,\u201d such as BMW\u2019s expansion of its South Carolina facility\u00a0in 2016.\u00a0The company announced a further expansion of that plant in 2017.", "We asked the White House press office for a list of the auto plants \u201cnow under construction in Michigan and Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida,\u201d as Trump claimed this week. We have not received one. Our fact-checking colleagues at the Washington Post made a similar query this month of the Trump campaign, but also didn\u2019t get any information.", "It\u2019s worth noting that since Trump took office, GM has announced the closure of up to five plants in North America. In May, it announced it was in negotiations to sell one of those plants, in Lordstown, Ohio, to an electric vehicle company and would make investments in other facilities in the state.", "If the president instead means new automaker investments, which would include expansions and retooling of existing plants and other facilities, not only construction of new plants, he would still be wrong to say such investments haven\u2019t happened in \u201cdecades.\u201d In fact, the CAR 2018 \u201cBook of Deals,\u201d which tracks announced investments, includes the following chart, showing that automaker investments have occurred every year from 2009 to 2018. The yearly investment amounts for 2010, 2011 and 2015 in the United States outpace the money auto companies have invested in 2017 or 2018, during Trump\u2019s time in office.\u00a0Swiecki noted that 2011 and 2015 were United Automobile Workers negotiation years, as is 2019. So, CAR expects \u201ca spike\u201d of investment announcements beginning later this summer, he said.", "Chart source: Center for Automotive Research, \u201cBook of Deals Update 2018\u201d", "Swiecki also mentioned supplier plants, noting that they \u201ccome and go as suppliers lose sourcing contracts and are replaced by others,\u201d resulting in a constant \u201cchurn.\u201d The president\u2019s statements don\u2019t indicate he is speaking of suppliers, but if so, that also wouldn\u2019t support his claim. Because of the churn, Swiecki said, \u201cnew plants under construction don\u2019t necessarily represent growth.\u201d", "The investments the automakers have made over the years may be reflected in the near steady job growth since 2010 in motor vehicle and parts manufacturing, as this chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. After dropping during the 2007-2009 Great Recession, auto manufacturing jobs have been climbing.", "Trump, however, also has claimed that auto jobs were declining before he became president \u2014 a false assertion that fits the president\u2019s pattern of claiming an abrupt reversal in the industry under his tenure. For instance, in March 2017, he promised,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to put our auto industry back to work,\u201d suggesting that auto jobs had been trending down. And two years later, at a March rally in Michigan, Trump claimed a victory: \u201cBefore I took the oath of office the United States automobile industry was decimated and it was going down. \u2026\u00a0\u00a0And just in the last very short period of time we have added another 6,000 vehicle manufacturing and auto parts jobs in Michigan alone.\u201d In fact, auto industry jobs were not \u201cgoing down\u201d before he took office.", "Over Trump\u2019s 29 months as president, the number of vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs has gone up by 42,100, or 4.4 percent, according to the most recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over the previous 29 months, the job growth was 73,500, or 8.3 percent. So far, the trend of job growth in the industry has continued under Trump, at a slightly slower pace.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
