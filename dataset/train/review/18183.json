Other residents complained that the man\u2019s open carrying made them feel \"uncomfortable\" and \"unsafe.\"", "The story declared \"tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil\" and that \"a citizen\u2019s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government.\"", "Sounds alarming. But it\u2019s not accurate.", "Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found that the headline was wrong and that the story failed to explain that police obtained a warrant from a judge after the 31-year-old man failed to turn over his gun and appear at a hearing, as ordered by the court.", "In 2016, Washington state voters overwhelmingly approved Initiative 1491 to allow courts, upon petition by police or a family or household member, to issue an extreme risk protection order. The order prevents an individual from accessing firearms for a specified time period if the court determines the person poses a significant danger.", "A handful of other states, including California, have similar \"red flag\" laws, and many other states are considering passing them. Following the Parkland shooting, Florida passed such a law to allow law enforcement to seek a risk protection order.", "While the NRA argues the laws violate a person\u2019s rights by taking away a gun when no crime has been committed, law enforcement argues it is a tool they can use to take away a gun before a catastrophe occurs.", "PolitiFact interviewed Sgt.

He acknowledged he was experiencing \"stress\" and did not want the gun around, Michaud said.", "Months later, McKenzie, who lives above a restaurant, had several interactions with the restaurant staff. In one instance, he stood in front of the restaurant and yelled obscenities and accused people of talking to him through the floor.", "\"No crimes were committed at that time, but his behavior was erratic and unnerving to all; resulting in contact\" by police, Michaud said.", "McKenzie declined services, but shortly thereafter he called police again to report \"taunting and voices\" coming from the restaurant below through the floor.", "He also told police that he was armed with a gun and wanted a female employee \"arrested or shot\" by police, Michaud said.", "McKenzie was ultimately taken to a medical facility.", "On Feb. 13, police petitioned the court to get an extreme risk protection order to take away McKenzie\u2019s gun.

After he left the medical facility on Feb. 23, police attempted to contact McKenzie multiple times to obtain his firearm.", "After McKenzie didn\u2019t show up for his Feb. 27 court date about the order to turn over his gun, the judge granted a search warrant based on probable cause to arrest. McKenzie was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a person prohibited by extreme risk protection order, a gross misdemeanor.", "On March 1, police went to McKenzie\u2019s apartment and took his gun. He was placed into custody and booked at the King County jail. The case remains pending.", "Pisconski said that since the law went into effect in 2017, Seattle police have received 16 extreme risk protection orders that resulted in collecting about 26 guns. This was the only case in which the suspect didn\u2019t voluntarily surrender a gun.", "One of the websites that wrote that police took the gun without a \"warrant\" added an editor\u2019s note about errors in its original article.
