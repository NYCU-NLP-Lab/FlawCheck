Some immigrants coming to the United States illegally faced abuse, rape and even death in their journey, Labrador wrote.", "\"What makes these tragedies so unnecessary is there\u2019s already a process in place for those who are legitimately seeking asylum,\" Labrador wrote. \"They can show up at any embassy or consulate abroad or any U.S. port of entry to make their asylum claims.\"", "Individuals can make asylum claims at U.S. ports of entry, but can they also make those claims at \"any embassy or consulate abroad\"?", "No. Asylum claims must be made within the United States.", "Asylum may be granted to individuals who have been persecuted or fear they will be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, and/or membership in a particular social group or political opinion, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.", "U.S. law says that in general, \"any alien who is physically present in the United States, or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of such alien\u2019s status, may apply for asylum.\"", "Asylum seekers must generally apply for the protection within one year of their arrival to the United States.", "\"A U.S. consulate or embassy is clearly outside the U.S., so you can\u2019t apply for asylum at a U.S. consulate or embassy,\" said Stephen H.
