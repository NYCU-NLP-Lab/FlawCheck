We found the rumor to be based in truth but taken out of context and seasoned with a political spin.", "The reported advice was first published by Intellihub, a website that media background-checking tool Newsguard found to have \u201cpromoted false and unsubstantiated conspiracy theories\u201d and has \u201cinconsistent\u201d information about its content creators, for example, referring to its reporters as \"staff writers\" or omitting their names altogether. The Intellihub article in question read that \"the government must be expecting some sort of disaster,\" which placed the CDC's advice in a paranoid context. Many of Intellihub's other articles include similar tactics that appear to try to scare readers, such as those that claimed that \"tsunami waves will swamp Washington coast,\" or the suggestion that governments were \"igniting wildfire[s] in California from space.\" USSA News, a blog launched in opposition to the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act and that goes by a tagline of the \"Tea Party's Front Page,\" subsequently shared the Intellihub article in its entirety, which read:", "The Center for Disease Control issued a three-step preparedness card questionnaire that asks parents the unthinkable and insinuates what should be done when it comes to protecting \u201cyour child during emergencies in the school day.\u201d", "The CDC guidelines say it\u2019s as \u201ceasy as ABC.\u201d", "\u201cHow would you be reunited with your child in an emergency?\u201d the questionnaire asks parents.", "\u201cBring extra medicines, special foods, or supplies your child would need if separated overnight,\u201d it reads. \u201cComplete a backpack card and tuck one in your child\u2019s backpack and your wallet.\u201d", "Additionally, it reads: \u201cAn emergency might require a sudden sleepover. Tell school administrators about any extra supplies your child may need to safely make it through a night away from home.\u201d", "It is important to note that the Intellihub article did not mention COVID-19. That reference was added when the story was picked up on Sept. 5, 2020, by Ohio Statehouse News, a media source described on its Facebook page as a \u201cpolitical news outlet, minus the liberal-media slant.\u201d The publication noted that the CDC was \u201cadvising parents to prepare for a \u2018sudden sleepover\u2019 for their children in the case of a disaster, which could include COVID-19.\u201d", "The CDC did offer advice to schools for reopening amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including a printable \u201cbackpack emergency card\u201d available on the agency's website. In it, health care experts recommended three steps for parents to take in order to ensure that their child is safe in the event of an emergency or evacuation at school. This advice includes: Asking how a parent or guardian would be reunited with their child during an emergency; Bringing extra medicines, special food, or supplies that a child might need if they were separated overnight; and Completing a backpack card to be kept in both the child\u2019s backpack and in the caregiver\u2019s wallet.", "It is not known whether the backpack card was created specifically for the 2020-21 academic year or if it had previously existed as part of general emergency planning recommendations. Snopes contacted the CDC for further clarification but did not hear back at the time of publication.", "It is true that the backpack emergency card posits that an \u201cemergency might require a sudden sleepover\u201d and advises caregivers to tell their school administrators about any extra supplies that a child might need to \u201cmake it through a night away from home.\" However, there is no mention of COVID-19 or coronavirus listed anywhere in the infographic. Additionally, the CDC did not specify that children are expected to stay the night at school. Rather, parents and guardians should consider that an emergency might mean that a relative or emergency contact may need to pick up a child from school and, as such, the child should have the resources necessary to plan for possible overnight arrangements away from home.", "The card is part of the CDC\u2019s \u201cCaring for Children in a Disaster\u201d campaign aimed at helping parents and guardians prepare for an emergency at the launch of the 2020 academic year.", "\u201cFrom tornadoes to water main breaks, emergencies can occur with little or no warning\u2014 even during the school day. As children head back to school, take a few steps to help protect your child from an emergency and to reunite with your child quickly and safely,\u201d wrote the agency on its website, which also included a link to a separate web page that provided a more in-depth description outlining school and childcare responses to COVID-19.", "The Ohio Statehouse News article went on to report that the CDC had listed COVID-19 as a \u201cbiological threat\u201d that may require children to unexpectedly stay overnight at a school. Though it is true that the health agency included infectious diseases as a biological threat that may pose particular harm to children, the CDC specified that for an infectious disease to be considered a biological threat, it must be intentionally released. To date, there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 was a \u201cbioweapon\u201d either created by humans or intentionally released to cause harm to the global population.", "In the event that a student or staff member tests positive for COVID-19, the CDC noted in a July 24 update that individual schools should have a response plan that the agency said should be communicated to parents.
