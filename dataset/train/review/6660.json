The term \u201cX\u201d means a gender that is not exclusively male or female. Currently, individuals requesting to correct the gender on their birth certificates must submit affidavits from licensed physicians or medical professionals attesting that the changed sex designation more accurately reflects the applicant\u2019s gender identity.", "The official Twitter account for the New York City mayor's office reminded residents that the law would go into effect come the New Year:", "To all trans and non-binary New Yorkers: We see you, hear you and respect you.
