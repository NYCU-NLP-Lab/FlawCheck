["About this rating", "As fear of refugees reached fever pitch in mid-November 2015, an old photo showing a child with her arms raised began recirculating around the internet.", "Syrian child holding her arms up in surrender because she thought the camera was a gun? Any idea if this is true?", "The above-displayed photograph first went viral when it was shared on Twitter by journalist Nadia AbuShaban on 24 March 2015.\u00a0While AbuShaban correctly identified the child as Syrian, many people doubted the authenticity of the photo since key information (such as the name of the photographer and the date the photo was taken) was missing.", "The BBC (with the help of an Imgur user) were able to trace the photo back to the Turkiye Newspaper.\u00a0Turkish photojournalist, Osman Sa\u011f\u0131rl\u0131 explained that the above-displayed image\u00a0was taken at the\u00a0Atmeh refugee camp in Syria in December 2014 and shows a 4-year-old girl named Hudea who was afraid of the telephoto lens of his camera:\n\"I was using a telephoto lens, and she thought it was a weapon,\" says Sa\u011f\u0131rl\u0131. \"\u0130 realised she was terrified after I took it, and looked at the picture, because she bit her lips and raised her hands. Normally kids run away, hide their faces or smile when they see a camera.\" He says he finds pictures of children in the camps particularly revealing. \"You know there are displaced people in the camps. It makes more sense to see what they have suffered not through adults, but through children. It is the children who reflect the feelings with their innocence.\"", "When the photograph was published by\u00a0Turkiye\u00a0in January 2015 it was accompanied by\u00a0passage\u00a0which gave a little more insight into Hudea's life in a refugee camp:", "Her face tightens immediately. She bites her lower lip and slowly raises her hands. She stands still without a word. It isn\u2019t easy to console the child who thinks that the camera looking at her is a gun.", "Her name is Hudea\u2026 She is only 4 years old. She lost her dad in the bombing of Hama. She took refuge at the Atme camp at the Turkish border with her mom and [two] siblings.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
