["The attainment gap in schools is narrowing.", "This is correct according to the Social Mobility Commission, but it also says there is still a \u201cclear and strong\u201d link between income and attainment and that the gap widens as a pupil goes through school.", "The Social Mobility Commission has said that social mobility is getting worse in Great Britain.", "Correct.", "\u201cIn their State of the Nation report her government\u2019s Social Mobility Commission today issued a damning verdict on progress. Things are getting worse. They concluded that the key drivers of social mobility\u2014quality in early education, narrowing the educational attainment gap, and access to work and housing\u2014are all going backwards under her watch.\u201d", "Lucy Powell MP, 16 November 2016", "\u201cI note that the Social Mobility Commission has reported today that more working class youngsters are benefiting from higher education than at any point in our history. The government\u2019s invested record levels in childcare and early years, and the attainment gap as the report acknowledges has actually narrowed.\u201d", "Theresa May, 16 November 2016", "The Social Mobility Commission today issued a report which concluded that in Great Britain \u201cfor this generation of young people in particular, it [social mobility] is getting worse not better.\u201d It also said that it wasn\u2019t just the poorest in society who faced barriers to progress.", "While Mrs May and Ms Powell portrayed the report very differently across a whole range of areas, one issue the report raised seems particularly contested. Just what did the Social Mobility Commission say about the educational attainment gap? Can it be \u201cgoing backwards\u201d and narrowing at the same time?", "The simple answer is that the Prime Minister is correct when she says that the Commission found the attainment gap in schools in England has narrowed. The report says that the difference in exam performance between children eligible for free school meals and their relatively wealthier classmates has decreased in the last ten years.", "But it isn't quite that clear cut. The Commission also says that there is still a link between income and academic achievement which it describes as \u201cclear and strong\u201d. It also says the attainment gap increases the further through school a pupil goes.", "Although it welcomes the focus the government has placed on the poorest pupils, the Commission says that \u201carguably\u201d not enough has been done to wipe out the attainment gap \u00a0across all income groups.", "Full Fact fights for good, reliable information in the media, online, and in politics.", "Bad information ruins lives.
