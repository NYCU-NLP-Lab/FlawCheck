["Right-wing website OpIndia published an article on June 13, accusing Alt News of fabricating SSP Akash Kulhary\u2019s statements in a June 6 report on the Aligarh murder case.", "Alt News\u2019s article was based on statements posted by the Aligarh police on its official Twitter account and those given to Alt News by the SSP himself. The preliminary autopsy report ruled out rape of the 2.5-year-old child and the case is being further probed by forensic teams to ascertain the full nature of the crime.", "\u0909\u0915\u094d\u0924 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0930\u0923 \u092e\u0947 @sspaligarh @ips06akash \u092e\u0939\u094b\u0926\u092f \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0926\u0940 \u0917\u092f\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0908\u091f \u0964 pic.twitter.com/DgnmIHtIwe", "\u2014 ALIGARH POLICE (@aligarhpolice) June 6, 2019", "Alt News\u2019s article was published before the child\u2019s post mortem report was made public. The fact-check was based on the details that came out in the report, revealed to us by SSP Kulhary. The officer had declined our requests for a copy of the same which he stated was only meant for the victim\u2019s family.", "In his initial statements, the SSP informed that according to the PM report, the child\u2019s death was by caused by strangulation. When asked if social media claims suggesting that the child was raped are true, his immediate response was, \u201cNo, it\u2019s wrong.\u201d He further stated that online rumours propagating that her eyes were gouged out, her right arm was amputated and that acid was poured on her body were untrue. These details were voluntarily provided by the SSP without our probing for the same. OpIndia accused Alt News of fabricating the SSP\u2019s statements. An audio recording of our conversation with IPS officer Kulhary can be heard below.", "An audio clip of OpIndia\u2019s conversation with the SSP was used by the website to suggest that Alt News manufactured his statements. Here, the SSP can be heard claiming that he did not give the before-mentioned statements to Alt News. However, as evident from our conversation with him, the officer voluntarily provided most of the information.", "In a subsequent conversation with Alt News, the SSP made a slight alteration to his earlier statement, now informing that the minor\u2019s arm was indeed amputated. However, he did not share the cause of the amputation. Our article was updated accordingly.", "The child\u2019s murder has witnessed an outpour of national rage, and rightly so. However, amidst citizens\u2019 demands for a speedy trial, the case has been picked by malevolent elements on social media attempting to paint a communal picture despite the investigation still underway. Tensions gripped Aligarh after the brutal crime and any misinformation surrounding the issue only adds fuel to the fire. Alt News\u2019s fact-check was an attempt to curb the dissemination of misleading information that has the potential to exacerbate the animosity. The police had charged at least 13 persons over inflammatory social media posts about the murder. In a situation as delicate as this, any untrue rumour can prove to be fatal.", "Donate Now", "Follow @free_thinker", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
