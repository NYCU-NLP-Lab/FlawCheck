["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on December 14, 2018", "A viral meme mocks Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for a statement about capitalism versus socialism that she never actually made.", "Since her victory in the Democratic primary in New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District in the House, and in light of her November general election win, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has attracted no shortage of attention.", "Sometimes that spotlight has arrived in the form of news coverage; other times via viral deceptions.", "In the latest example of the latter, a meme made viral on Facebook with the help of singer Ted Nugent and others falsely attributes a quote about economics to Ocasio-Cortez.", "\u201cUnder capitalism, man oppresses man,\u201d the quote reads. \u201cUnder socialism, it\u2019s the other way around.\u201d", "Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez, told FactCheck.org that the representative-elect had not said that.", "Likewise, we could find no evidence Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist, ever did. Instead, we came across references to that quote dating back years, well before the 29-year-old political newcomer entered the public eye.", "At a 2013 Liberty Fund event, for example, the economist Russell Roberts of Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution cited it in jest.", "\u201cMy view of capitalism has always been that under capitalism, man oppresses man. But under socialism, it\u2019s the other way around,\u201d he said to laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s not my line. I\u2019m told it came from MAD Magazine. And to be honest, it\u2019s not my view\u2014but it does capture the reality that all political and economic systems are imperfect.\u201d", "Others have traced it, or some iteration of it, back to the late economist John Kenneth Galbraith.", "In 2006, the Atlantic reported:", "Another remark often attributed to Galbraith is, \u201cUnder capitalism, man exploits man. Under communism, it\u2019s just the opposite.\u201d If he didn\u2019t say it, he might as well have. It has an authentically Galbraithian ring: It seems profound, and it\u2019s funny. But it encapsulates perhaps the worst error that a student of economy and society could have made in the past century\u2014the idea that, under the surface, those two systems are pretty much alike, not least ethically. The common man has no standing, no real power, in either case. The main difference resides in which small group of people is actually in charge. That is something that Galbraith certainly appeared to believe. It is a main theme of his writings. And it is a travesty of the truth.", "Appearing on Twitter\u00a0in recent weeks, as well, the misattributed quote has been shared thousands of times across social media. Nugent\u2019s Facebook post of the meme alone garnered nearly 15,000 shares.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cCapitalism, Government and the Good Society.\u201d EconStories.
