["About this rating", "Rumors are surging in the wake of George Floyd's death and resulting protests against police violence and racial injustice in the United States. Stay informed. Read our special coverage, contribute to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see here.", "Viral videos showing what appeared to be protesters in Portland, Oregon, burning American flags and Bibles made waves over the first weekend of August 2020, following more than two straight months of protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in Minneapolis in May 2020 while in police custody.", "Snopes readers asked us to investigate whether these allegations were factual. After speaking to an eyewitness and police, we conclude that the claim about Portland protesters is true.", "Tweets shared by Danny Peterson, a reporter with CBS station KOIN 6, showed several videos and photos of protesters burning American flags and open books that resemble the Bible, as well as several other items, including newspapers and a pizza box. Although videos show items being tossed into a fire and burned, it was not obvious which protest group was affiliated with those actions and whether the books being burned were, in fact, Bibles. Snopes spoke with Peterson, who said that he had seen a truck handing out free Bibles earlier in the day and confirmed with protesters that the book he saw burning was a Bible.", "The videos were captured outside the Mark O. Hatfield U. S. Federal Courthouse, the epicenter of a months-long clash between federal agents and Black Lives Matter protesters. Peterson described the fires as having happened organically and began after most of the peaceful protesters had left the area.", "Conservative publications and social media users laid blame on \u201canarchists,\u201d the \u201cradical left,\u201d and Black Lives Matter protesters for allegedly burning the flags and Bibles, but officials did not confirm which group the culprits were affiliated with. The groups burning Bibles and American flags did not self-identify with any particular group, Peterson told us.", "\"Many of these protests have been a non-homogeneous mixture of people with greatly varying political ideologies, and this night was no exception, from what I could tell,\" he said.", "According to his accounts, there wasn't \"much violence in the area,\" but the burning of Bibles and American flags seemed intentional and appeared to be a political expression of some sort and were not just \"coincidental objects that people burned in order to make a fire.\"", "Weekend protests began the night of July 31 and were largely peaceful before escalating the following morning, according to a statement released by the Portland Police Bureau (PPB). The agency noted that protesters \"lit fires, climbed the fence outside the federal courthouse, threw objects and chanted.\u201d", "The statement read, \"On August 1, 2020, at about 1:30 a.m. people started a bonfire in the middle of Southwest 3rd Avenue in front of the federal courthouse. People brought plywood and other flammable material to keep it going. Over the next hour, the number of people dwindled to a few dozen.\u201d", "In an email to Snopes, PPB Sgt. Kevin Allen wrote that he was unable to confirm whether Bibles and flags were among the items burned, and that the fires were not considered an immediate threat. In the interest of de-escalation, police did not interact with the crowd.", "The fire was reportedly put out by members of Moms United for Black Lives Matter, and the crowd had largely dispersed by 2:30 a.m. on Aug. 2.", "A video clip of the Portland Bible burning circulated by the Kremlin-backed news agency Ruptly appeared to be among the first viral Russian disinformation campaigns in advance of the 2020 presidential election, according to an Aug. 10 report by The New York Times. The publication likened this form of \u201cinformation laundering\u201d to money laundering in which Russian news outlets elaborate upon a \u201ckernel of truth\u201d to spin the event into larger, more polarizing issues that exacerbate already tense issues to further separate American voters and political parties.", "Vincent, Isabel. \u00a0 \"Protesters Burn Bible, American Flag As Tensions Rise in Portland.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Post . \u00a0 1 Aug 2020", "Peterson, Danny and Jennifer Dowling. \u00a0 \"Bonfires End 64th Night of Portland Protests After Peaceful Gatherings.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 KOIN 5. \u00a0 31 July 2020.", "Davidson, Jordan. \u00a0 \"As They Turn To Burning Bibles, Portland Rioters Show Their True Colors.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Federalist. \u00a0 1 Aug 2020.", "\"Two Arrests Made After Unlawful Assembly, But Second March Peaceful.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Portland Police Bureau. \u00a0 2 Aug 2020", "\"Peaceful Event in Downtown Portland.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Portland Police Bureau. \u00a0 3 Aug 2020", "T., Fred. \u00a0 \"If You Still Aren\u2019t Sure What The Riots Are About, Here\u2019s Video of Rioters Burning Bibles.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Right Scoop. &nbsp: 1 Aug 2020.", "T., Fred. \u00a0 \"Mass Gathering on SW 3rd Avenue Disperses After Several Hours.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Portland Police Bureau. &nbsp: 1 Aug 2020.", "Cline, Sara and Gilian Flaccus. \u00a0 \"Portland Protest Peaceful After Federal Presence.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 AP. \u00a0 1 Aug 2020.", "\"USA: Portland Demonstrators Set bible and US Flag Alight on 65th Night of Protests.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Ruptly. \u00a0 1 Aug 2020.", "Rosenberg, Matthew, Barnes, Julian E. \u00a0 \"A Bible Burning, a Russian News Agency and a Story Too Good to Check Out.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 11 Aug 2020.", "Updated to include information from The New York Times' report: \"A Bible Burning, a Russian News Agency and a Story Too Good to Check Out.\"", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
