We\u2019ll use their analysis to rate McClintock.", "Trump most productive?", "In a related fact-check in April 2017, PolitiFact rated as False Trump\u2019s claim that no administration had accomplished as much as he did, period. It found Trump has had some achievements in office, but at the very least, they are much less numerous and far-reaching than those of President Roosevelt, the standard against whom all presidents are measured. In more recent years, other presidents, including Obama, have accomplished more in their first 100 days than Trump has, historians told PolitiFact.", "Looking at the number of bills, Trump had\u00a0signed 28 as of late April 2017, just before his 100 day mark in office. Spicer and McClintock are correct that this is more than every president going back about 70 years.", "Trump signed 31 executive orders during his first 100 days, also more than any president since Truman, according to calculations in a CNN.com article. Many of those rolled back orders signed by President Obama.", "\"Those mean something to certain groups, but they don't have the kind of broad impact that legislation has, that programs that are approved by Congress have, because the fact that they can be rescinded by a stroke of a president's pen means they can be reimplemented with the stroke of another president\u2019s pen,\" H.W. Brands, a professor of history at the University of Texas, who has written biographies of\u00a0Woodrow Wilson,\u00a0Andrew Jackson, and\u00a0Benjamin Franklin, told Vox.com in a recent interview.", "\"Furthermore, they don't have legitimacy, the credibility, of having the approval of more than just one person. If you get major legislation passed, it has the approval of Congress and the presidency, and that means a whole lot more than if it's just the preference of a president.\"", "Still, the bill signing measurement isn\u2019t perfect either. That's primarily because not all bills are created equal. None of the bills Trump has signed into law are particularly significant or include any of his major campaign promises.", "The numbers", "Truman signed 55 bills in his first 100 days after his 1948 election.

For earlier presidents, we used data confirmed by Frendreis, a political science professor at Loyola University Chicago. For Lyndon Johnson and Truman, who both came into office to replace a president midterm, we used the first 100 days after their re-election. We left out Gerald Ford because he did not serve a full term.", "Of the post-Truman presidents, Trump is \"fairly typical\" in terms of the number of bills signed so far, Frendreis said.", "The bills", "Spicer says that Trump has shepherded these bills through Congress. However, the 28 bills aren\u2019t very significant and don\u2019t appear to have required vote whipping from the White House.

While that was a goal for Republican lawmakers, it\u2019s important to note these bills made it to Trump\u2019s desk through a process made possible by the Congressional Review Act, which became law in 1996. The act gives Congress a narrow window to reverse regulations, so these 13 bills had to get through Congress within Trump\u2019s first 100 days.", "Notably missing from the list of 28 bills that have reached his desk: A bill repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, along with several other laws Trump said he would usher through Congress within his first 100 days.", "Compare this to President Barack Obama, who signed 14 laws, but those laws included the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the $800 billion stimulus package.", "Or Roosevelt, who within 100 days signed 15 major bills including the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression.
