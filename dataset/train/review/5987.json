["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on August 28, 2020", "Posts on social media falsely claim that the man shot by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, \u201cwouldn\u2019t have been shot if he was still in prison for raping the 14 year old.\u201d There\u2019s no evidence he was ever charged with such a crime \u2014 let alone convicted and imprisoned. Jacob Blake was charged in July with sexually assaulting an adult woman, but has not been convicted.", "The Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, set off protests against police brutality in the city \u2014 as well as distorted and unfounded claims on social media.", "One viral claim on Facebook targets Blake, who his family\u2019s attorney says was paralyzed by the shooting, by altering the known facts about criminal charges against him. Specifically, the claim falsely suggests that he served time in prison for \u201craping the 14 year old.\u201d", "\u201cJacob Blake is shot by police while resisting arrest,\u201d a meme repeatedly shared on Facebook \u2014 in one example by 11,000 users \u2014 claims. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have been shot if he was still in prison for raping the 14 year old.\u201d", "The posts offer no evidence for the claim, and the allegation doesn\u2019t comport with publicly available records.", "Blake, 29, was in fact charged in a domestic abuse case in July with third-degree sexual assault, Wisconsin court records show. The state statute cited does not specify that the charge relates to sexually assaulting a minor. He was also charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct; he has not been convicted, let alone imprisoned. There was an active arrest warrant for Blake on those charges, which police officers were reportedly alerted to prior to the shooting.", "A criminal complaint shows that the charges relate to an incident with an adult woman; FactCheck.org is not providing other details about the victim because of the nature of the alleged crime.", "The actual charges, while no doubt serious, are therefore not proof that Blake \u201cwouldn\u2019t have been shot if he was still in prison for raping the 14 year old.\u201d", "We could find no other evidence to support that claim. Wisconsin\u2019s Sex Offender Registry offers no matches for his name. Other cases in Wisconsin\u2019s court records include a traffic violation and the custody disputes.", "Ironically, the meme spreading the claim uses an image of John Krasinski, an actor from the TV show \u201cThe Office\u201d who has expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement.", "The falsehood is swirling as many of the details about the shooting are still unclear.", "Bystander video appears to show that police officers were involved in a scuffle with Blake before he walked away and around an SUV, as officers trailed him, guns drawn. The video shows that, after Blake opened the car door, an officer, grabbing Blake by his shirt, fired several rounds into Blake\u2019s back.", "The officer who shot Blake has been identified by state officials as Rusten Sheskey, an officer for seven years. He and two other involved officers at the scene have been placed on administrative leave, Chief Dan Miskins has said (43:50).", "Blake remains hospitalized and an attorney representing his family, Ben Crump, said in a press conference that the \u201cmedical diagnosis right now is that he is paralyzed\u201d and that it would \u201ctake a miracle for Jacob Blake Jr. to ever walk again.\u201d", "The Wisconsin Department of Justice\u2019s Division of Criminal Investigation is currently leading an investigation into the shooting, and the U.S. Department of Justice has said the FBI will conduct a federal civil rights investigation.", "The state DOJ said in an Aug. 26 press release that Kenosha police officers were responding to a call from a woman reporting that \u201cher boyfriend was present and was not supposed to be on the premises.\u201d The Washington Post quoted a neighbor as saying Blake was attending a birthday party for one of his children\u00a0when an argument between two women spurred the call to police.", "Police were attempting to arrest Blake and unsuccessfully attempted to taser him, the state DOJ said. \u201cMr. Blake walked around his vehicle, opened the driver\u2019s side door, and leaned forward. While holding onto Mr. Blake\u2019s shirt, Officer Rusten Sheskey fired his service weapon 7 times. Officer Sheskey fired the weapon into Mr. Blake\u2019s back,\u201d it said.", "The state DOJ further said Blake \u201cadmitted that he had a knife in his possession\u201d and that investigators \u201crecovered a knife from the driver\u2019s side floorboard of Mr. Blake\u2019s vehicle. A search of the vehicle located no additional weapons.\u201d", "It\u2019s unclear if Blake was carrying the knife prior to the shooting, though. The Kenosha police do not wear body cameras.", "In the days since the shooting, Kenosha has erupted in protests \u2014 including one on Aug. 25 that turned deadly after a 17-year-old gunman shot and killed two protesters, injuring a third.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
