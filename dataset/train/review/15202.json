["By Robert Farley", "Posted on June 27, 2017", "Sen. Rand Paul, who opposes the Republican Senate health care bill, says subsidies \u201care actually greater under the Republican bill than they are under the current Obamacare law.\u201d But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the average subsidy under the bill would be \u201csignificantly lower than the average subsidy under current law.\u201d", "In all, CBO estimates the government will save $424 billion over 10 years (compared with current law) due mainly to reductions in government subsidies.", "Paul\u2019s comment came on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on June 25, as he argued that the current version of the Senate health care bill, the\u00a0Better Care Reconciliation Act, \u201clooks just like Obamacare and still doesn\u2019t fix the fundamental flaw of Obamacare.\u201d", "Paul, June 25: But realize that this \u2014 just one second \u2014 realize that the Obamacare subsidies in this bill are actually greater under the Republican bill than they are under the current Obamacare law. That is not anywhere close to repeal.", "The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare,\u00a0subsidizes health insurance in two main ways: tax credits\u00a0to cover a portion of the premiums for individuals who buy their own insurance, and cost-sharing subsidies paid to insurance companies to reduce out-of-pocket payments required under insurance policies.", "Tax credits to help people buy insurance would remain at the same levels as under the ACA until 2020. But over the long-term, the Senate plan would be less generous with tax credits than the ACA.", "Under the Senate bill, \u201cthe premium tax credits would be smaller in most cases than under current law,\u201d the CBO says.", "The ACA provides tax credits to those earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the Senate plan, tax credits would go to those earning from 0 percent to 350 percent of the poverty level.", "Also, the\u00a0tax credit under the ACA is designed to cap what an individual would have to pay toward premiums, based on the cost of a benchmark plan. The Senate GOP bill would use a less expensive plan as the benchmark and adjust what individuals would pay out-of-pocket for premiums based on age for those earning above 150 percent of the federal poverty level.", "Someone earning between 300 percent and 350 percent of the federal poverty level, for example, would pay 6.4 percent of income for an insurance policy if he or she is 29 years old or younger. The required contributions then go up with age: 8.9 percent for 30- to 39-year-olds; 12.5 percent for 40- to 49-year-olds; 15.8 percent for 50- to 59-year-olds; and 16.2 percent for those over age 59. (Under the ACA, those at the poverty level contribute 2.4 percent of income in 2020, and those earning 400 percent of the poverty level would contribute 10.2 percent,\u00a0according to projections\u00a0from the Kaiser Family Foundation.)", "As for the\u00a0cost-sharing subsidies\u00a0available now under the ACA \u2014 which can lower out-of-pocket costs for copays and other expenses for those earning between 100 percent and 250 percent of the\u00a0federal poverty level\u00a0\u2014 those would be\u00a0eliminated under the Senate bill in 2020.", "According to CBO, while individual cases would vary, \u201cthe average subsidy per subsidized enrollee under this legislation would be significantly lower than the average subsidy under current law.\u201d", "CBO, June 26:\u00a0According to CBO and [the Joint Committee on Taxation\u2019s] estimates, the average subsidy per subsidized enrollee under this legislation would be significantly lower than the average subsidy under current law, starting in calendar year 2020. Nevertheless, some people would be eligible for larger subsidies than those under current law, whereas others would be eligible for smaller ones.", "In all, CBO estimates the government will save $424 billion over 10 years (compared with current law) due mainly to reductions in tax credits for premium assistance starting in 2020 and from eliminating cost-sharing subsidies. Those savings would be partially offset, CBO says, by \u201can increase in spending of $107 billion for short-term assistance to insurers to address disrupted coverage and access and to provide support for states through the Long-Term State Stability and Innovation Program.\u201d", "Indeed, the amount of subsidies provided in the Senate bill is less than what was proposed in the Republican health care bill that passed in the House.", "CBO, June 26:\u00a0The structure of subsidies for coverage in the nongroup market differs in the two versions of the legislation and would have substantially different effects by income and by age. The overall spending on such subsidies under this legislation would be $134 billion lower than under the House-passed legislation.", "So why does Paul say that subsidies \u201care actually greater under the Republican bill than they are under the current Obamacare law\u201d?", "Paul\u2019s reasoning hinges on a legal debate over the cost-sharing payments currently being paid to insurers to offset the costs for millions of low-income Americans. The subsidies are critical to the success of the Affordable Care Act, as insurers have threatened to pull out of the ACA marketplaces or dramatically increase rates if the subsidies are cut off.", "A\u00a0lawsuit filed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives in November 2014 contended that funding for cost-sharing subsidies was never appropriated by Congress, and that government payment of those subsidies violated the Constitution and amounted to \u201cunlawful transfer of funds,\u201d as the New York Times put it.", "A federal district court judge last year sided with the House. But the judge stayed her decision to allow the government to appeal. In May, the Trump administration asked for\u00a0a three-month delay in the appeal case, leaving the issue in limbo.", "In theory, President Trump could drop the appeal and stop making the subsidy payments. In fact, he has said he could end them \u201canytime I want.\u201d But so far, he hasn\u2019t. The payments have continued as the case is under appeal.", "So are those subsidy payments part of the Affordable Care Act? Paul argues they are not. And since the Republican bill would specifically sunset those payments at the end of 2019, Paul\u2019s argument is that the Republican plan amounts to additional funding beyond what is contained in the Affordable Care Act.", "\u201cThe proposed new bill funds a piece of Obamacare that is currently not funded, the cost sharing subsidies which got blocked by a court,\u201d Sergio Gor, a spokesman for Paul told us via email.", "Gor further points out that \u201caccording to CBO, the ACA tax credits will cost $156 billion in 2017, 2018, 2019. We do not make any changes to these credits in the first 3 years.\u201d", "On this point, Paul is taking a short-term (three-year) view and ignoring the long-term implications of the Senate bill, which would cut\u00a0tax credits after three years.", "Paul\u2019s comment suggests subsidies would be more generous under the Senate health care plan than those currently offered by the Affordable Care Act. That assumes that the cost-sharing subsidies, which have been regularly paid, are not a part of the ACA. On the tax credit side, it is a short-term comment that ignores that tax credits will be reduced significantly after the first three years.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
