In this version, it is inscribed with a Turkish text about 70,000 engineers and veterinarians waiting for assignments at government offices.", "@farukcelikcomtr @naci_agbal @Ahmet_Davutoglu\n\t\tTARIMBAKANLI\u011eINA OCAK'TA 6 B\u0130N ATAMA\n\t\tYEN\u0130YIL M\u00dcJDENIZOLSUN #GTHB20B\u0130N pic.twitter.com/kobe4bOK0F", "Further searches for the manipulated image on Yandex led us to the source of the picture.
