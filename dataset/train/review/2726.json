Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, questions Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Capitol Hill. Wasserman Schultz fired IT staffer Imran Awan on July 25, 2017, following his arrest on a federal bank fraud charge. (AP)", "U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been criticized for waiting to fire an information technology employee who did work for her office until his recent arrest.", "While many other Democratic members fired Imran Awan months ago when news reports stated he was under investigation, Wasserman Schultz waited until July 25, the day after his arrest for bank fraud. (Awan was a shared employee among multiple House members.)", "For all of the questions about how Wasserman Schultz handled the situation, there have been\u00a0unsubstantiated attacks on the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman from Broward County.", "The website US Daily News 24 compiled various news reports, blogs and tweets about the Awan investigation in a July 28 post. However, the clickbait headline of the story is totally unsupported.", "It states: \"Wasserman Schultz going to mental hospital after what she did overnight desperate to escape arrest.\"", "There is no evidence that Wasserman Schultz is headed to a mental health facility.", "In fact, other than the headline, the article itself makes no mention of her going to a mental hospital or facing arrest -- and it\u2019s unclear what the author is alluding to that she did \"overnight.\"", "Instead, the article contains some sweeping statements about her alleged state of mind with no evidence, such as there are reports that Wasserman Schultz \"has been an absolute wreck since Imran\u2019s arrest\" and an unsourced text posted on twitter alleging that she was spotted berating her daughter about buying a $2 purse.", "We found no contact information for US Daily News 24, although we left a comment in the comments section asking for evidence.

He was arrested on one count of bank fraud related to allegations that he provided inaccurate information when applying for a home loan. He pleaded not guilty.", "The criminal complaint makes no mention of allegations reported since February by Buzzfeed, Politico and The Daily Caller that Awan and other relatives were under investigation related to a procurement scam and theft of equipment and data.

The article contains no information to prove that she is going to a mental hospital, only allegations that she is an \"absolute wreck.\" There is also no evidence in the article that she has tried to escape arrest.
