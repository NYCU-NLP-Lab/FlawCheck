["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest speaks during a press conference in Raleigh in 2020. (WRAL screenshot)", "At a campaign event in western North Carolina on July 4, the state\u2019s Republican candidate for governor dismissed the need for face coverings during the coronavirus pandemic.", "Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, who\u2019s running for governor against incumbent Democrat Roy Cooper, said scientific evidence doesn\u2019t support mask mandates.", "\"There have been multiple comprehensive studies at the deepest level held to scientific standards in controlled environments that have all said for decades, masks do not work with viruses,\" he told a reporter for The Hendersonville Times-News.", "Is it true that studies \"all said\" that masks \"do not work on viruses?\"", "Forest\u2019s statement that they \"do not work\" ignores recent studies -- and federal healthcare guidance -- showing that mask-wearing does reduce the spread of coronavirus.", "While virologist and Trump advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and other experts have said masks alone don\u2019t guarantee protection from the virus, they do believe masks can help slow down the spread of COVID-19.", "But, by saying \"all\" studies show no use for masks, Forest left himself no margin for error. So we asked the Forest campaign to cite Forest\u2019s sources.", "Campaign spokesman Andrew Dunn noted an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on April 1 titled, \"Universal masking in hospitals in the Covid-19 era.\"", "Dunn quoted a line from the authors\u2019 opening statement, which reads:", "\"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection.\" Authors go on to say the purpose of their article is to examine \"whether a mask offers any further protection in health care settings in which the wearer has no direct interactions with symptomatic patients.\"", "Authors later noticed that people were quoting their article to discourage mask-wearing, so they released a follow-up letter to clarify their position.", "\"We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org) as support for discrediting widespread masking. In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less,\" researchers wrote in a June 1 letter.", "They acknowledged writing the sentence that Dunn cited, then said: \"but as the rest of the paragraph makes clear, we intended this statement to apply to passing encounters in public spaces, not sustained interactions within closed environments. A growing body of research shows that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is strongly correlated with the duration and intensity of contact.\"", "Dunn also cited a study, published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine in 2015, that examined the use of \"non-pharmaceutical interventions\" to reduce the spread of the flu.", "Non-pharmaceutical interventions are public health strategies used to reduce virus transmissions. These interventions include home quarantine for infected persons, social distancing, reduction in public gatherings, and masks.", "Dunn pointed out that researchers wrote that there are \"widely disparate findings on masks' effectiveness in combating viruses.\" The study examined existing reports on NPIs, but found that many of the reports were flawed.", "Researchers reviewed 100 studies on intervention strategies and found inconclusive results for most of them, including masks. Of those 100 studies, researchers wrote that \"only seven met all selection criteria and pooled analysis was not feasible\" because they had \"significant design flaws.\"", "Researchers wrote:", "\"Reduction of viral transmission by non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) has a significant appeal and is often recommended. However, the efficacy of such interventions is unclear \u2026 Despite the potential for NPI in preventing influenza transmission, there is very limited data available. \u2026 Properly designed studies evaluating large populations including \u2018at risk\u2019 patients and in a variety of communities are needed.\"", "That was 2015. Now fast forward to the emergence of COVID-19.", "Researchers have launched multiple studies on potential methods for stifling the outbreak, finding that masks could help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.", "Back in April, researchers wrote in the U.S. National Library of Medicine that \"to date, no study has been done to examine the effectiveness of masks against the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 causing COVID\u201019. However, a recent study in patients with seasonal coronaviruses has demonstrated that surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of viral RNA in aerosols and shows a trend in reducing viral RNA in droplets.\"", "A study published in The Royal Society on June 10 found \"the results of two mathematical models and show that facemask use by the public could make a major contribution to reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"", "Another study, published in The Lancet medical journal on June 1, found that \"face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection.\"", "Another study, coming out in the August edition of the International Journal of Nursing Studies, concluded that \"community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic.\"", "Rachel Graham, assistant professor of epidemiology at the UNG Gillings School of Global Public Health, noted that a study out of Germany found that a mask mandate decreased the COVID-19 growth rate by about 40%.", "When it comes to mask-wearing, Graham said: \"It\u2019s not that there\u2019s no transmission, it\u2019s that there\u2019s less.\"", "The CDC, which earlier this year said masks weren\u2019t necessary in public places, changed its guidance on April 3 after studies found that the virus can be spread by asymptomatic individuals. Now, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering saying they \"help protect people around you\" and are \"most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings.\"", "PolitiFact has reported on the effectiveness of masks on several occasions, quoting experts who say coverings, when worn properly, can effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19 when combined with other prevention methods such as frequent hand washing and social distancing.", "Forest said \"there have been multiple comprehensive studies at the deepest level held to scientific standards in controlled environments that have all said for decades, masks do not work with viruses.\"", "His statement overlooks recent data, news stories, CDC guidance and the advice of one of President Trump\u2019s top pandemic advisors. While face coverings alone can\u2019t guarantee protection from a virus, recent studies show they do reduce the risk of spreading the virus.", "And that\u2019s the goal in this pandemic: to stop the spread. So Forest\u2019s claim that masks \"do not work\" is inaccurate. We rate his claim False.", "Story by the Hendersonville Times-News, \"Forest, Cawthorn hold July 4th event at Grandad\u2019s Apples in Hendersonville,\" posted July 5, 2020.", "Email correspondence with Andrew Dunn, spokesman for the Dan Forest campaign.", "Telephone interview with Rachel Graham, assistant professor of epidemiology at the UNG Gillings School of Global Public Health.", "Article in the New England Journal of Medicine, \"Universal masking in hospitals in the Covid-19 era,\" published April 1, 2020; follow-up article in the New England Journal of Medicine, \"Universal masking in the Covid-19 era,\" published July 9, 2020.", "Study in the U.S. National Library of Medicine\u2019s National Institutes of Health, \"Use of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the transmission of influenza in adults: A systematic review,\" published April 14, 2015.", "Study in the U.S. National Library of Medicine\u2019s National Institutes of Health, \"Rationale for universal face masks in public against COVID-19,\" published April 30, 2020.", "Study in The Royal Society, \"A modelling framework to assess the likely effectiveness of facemasks in combination with \u2018lock-down\u2019 in managing the COVID-19 pandemic,\" published June 10, 2020.", "Study in The Lancet, \"Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,\" published June 1, 2020.", "Study in the International Journal of Nursing Studies, \"A rapid systematic review of the efficacy of face masks and respirators against coronaviruses and other respiratory transmissible viruses for the community, healthcare workers and sick patients.\"", "Study on VOxEU.org, a site for research-based policy analysis and commentary by leading economists, \"Unmasked!
