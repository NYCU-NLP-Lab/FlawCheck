["By Robert Farley", "Posted on July 2, 2020", "Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani misleadingly contrasted his mayoral record on crime with a recent spike in murders under Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio, citing the uptick as evidence that Democratic mayors are \u201ca danger to their people.\u201d", "Major crimes are down under de Blasio, and while there has been a surge in murders so far this year, the annual number of murders under de Blasio has been about half as high as it was in Giuliani\u2019s best year.", "\u201cPlease remember that all the lawlessness is happening in Democrat cities run by Democrats sometimes for 40, 50 and 100 years,\u201d Giuliani, a personal attorney for President Donald Trump, said in comments to reporters from the White House driveway on July 1. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a Republican mayor there in forever, except for New York, and it was me, and I brought crime down 65%, and Bloomberg got it up to 75%. And right now, murder is up 58% under the \u2018regressive\u2019 Democrat mayor, who\u2019s typical of Democrat mayors all over the country. They are a disaster. They\u2019re a danger to their people.\u201d", "Giuliani is mixing two different statistics \u2014 comparing his statistics on overall \u201ccrime\u201d with the number of murders under de Blasio\u2019s watch. And his claim is misleading by both measures.", "Giuliani\u2019s figures on the drop in crime during his time as mayor from 1994 through 2001 are close to accurate. According to data from the New York City Police Department, major felony offenses declined by 62.3% from 1993, the year before he took office, to 2001, Giuliani\u2019s last year in office (dropping from 430,460 to 162,064). Major crimes include the seven major felony offenses \u2014 murder/manslaughter, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny of a motor vehicle.", "Major crimes continued to decline under Giuliani\u2019s successor, Mike Bloomberg, who won the office as a Republican. (He switched his affiliation to independent in 2007, and then re-registered as a Democrat prior to announcing his bid for president last year.)", "Giuliani said \u201cBloomberg got it up to 75%.\u201d Indeed, measuring again from the year before Giuliani took office, 1993, there was a 74.1% decline in major crimes to 111,335 by 2013, Bloomberg\u2019s final year in office.", "Put another way, major crimes dropped 62.3% under Giuliani and then dropped 31.3% under Bloomberg.", "Not mentioned by Giuliani, however, is that major crimes continued to decline under de Blasio. The number of those seven major felonies declined to 95,593 by 2019, a 13.9% drop from the number the year before he took office. By Giuliani\u2019s logic \u2014 measuring from the year before Giuliani took office \u2014 de Blasio \u201cgot it up to\u201d 77.8%.", "Giuliani\u2019s claim that \u201cmurder is up 58%\u201d under de Blasio appears to cherry-pick and inflate a recent spike.", "Let\u2019s start by looking at the longer-term trend and annual totals.", "There were 335 murders (murders and non-negligent homicides) in New York City in 2013, the year before de Blasio took office, according to police data. During de Blasio\u2019s first six years in office, the number has fluctuated, but has only once edged higher than the number he inherited. In most years, it has been lower.", "In 2019, the city recorded 319 murders (up from 295 in 2018). But that\u2019s still 4.8% fewer than the number of murders before he took office. It\u2019s also half as many as the 649 in Giuliani\u2019s last year in office in 2001.", "\u201cMurder started falling very quickly in the years before Giuliani took office, continued to fall sharply while he was in office, and then continued falling after he left office. His time in office did not change the trend at all,\u201d said Patrick Sharkey, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton University who created a website that tracks data on murder for large cities.", "\u201cWhen de Blasio took office and ended the use of stop, question, and frisk, lots of people predicted crime would rise \u2014 including Bloomberg and former Commissioner Ray Kelly,\u201d Sharkey told us via email. \u201cInstead, violence in NYC has fallen to the lowest levels on record under de Blasio. Based on the previous year, New York City is the safest big city in the country, and is safer than it\u2019s been in decades.\u201d", "We wrote about some of those trends in May 2019 when Trump and his son Eric wrongly claimed that crime had risen in the city under de Blasio\u2019s leadership.", "There has been, however, an upswing in gun violence and murder in 2020.", "According to police department data, there have been 166 murders in New York City in 2020 through June 21. That\u2019s nearly 24% higher than the 134 murders over the same period last year. Over a 28-day period ending June 21, there were 34 murders, roughly 48% higher than the 23 over the same 28-day period last year.", "According to the New York Times, the number of shootings in the first three weeks of June surged to 125, more than double the number over the same three-week period last year. The spike comes amid rising tensions from protests and riots after George Floyd\u2019s death while in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25. It is a trend the Times said has been happening in other large cities around the country.", "\u201cI have been studying this for a long time. I have never seen that much of an increase ever,\u201d Christopher Herrmann, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice who once analyzed crime statistics for the New York City Police Department, told the New York Times.", "But it is still a small sample size.", "\u201cSo far this year, murders and shootings are up,\u201d Sharkey told us. \u201cIt\u2019s usually not wise to extrapolate based on short periods of time, because it often fluctuates. That said, the trends so far this year suggest that the level of violence will be higher this year than last year.\u201d", "Andrew Karmen, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, cautioned us via email that the spike may only be temporary.", "And, he said, it is going up this year during a pandemic, high unemployment \u201cand a new wave of political activism.\u201d", "\u201cWhat is Giuliani implying? That mayors and police chiefs should adopt the hard-line law and order policies that he claims worked so well in the 1990s?\u201d Karmen said. \u201cBut these policies were discontinued in NYC, and yet crime continued to fall for several years, until the end of 2019.\u201d", "In a press conference on June 22, de Blasio talked about the need to \u201caddress a troubling trend we\u2019ve seen in terms of shootings over the last weeks,\u201d which he attributed in part to a typical upswing in the summer as well as complications caused by the coronavirus. De Blasio said the police department would be flooding hundreds of police officers into areas experiencing violence, and that there would be an increase in car and foot patrols.", "\u201cThe bottom line here is we\u2019re not going to allow gun violence to continue to grow in this city,\u201d de Blasio said, adding that the city\u2019s response would include police strategies that emphasize a partnership between police and communities. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to the bad old days when there was so much violence in this city. Nor are we going back to the bad old days where policing was done the wrong way.\u201d", "It remains to be seen how the rest of the year shakes out. But it is misleading for Giuliani to say \u201cmurder is up 58%\u201d under de Blasio.", "The number of murders has declined 4.8% from the year before de Blasio took office to 2019, the last full year of data. The number of murders went up 8% in 2019 from 2018, and so far it is up 24% this year through June 21 compared with the same time period last year. But the number hasn\u2019t gone up 58%, as Giuliani claimed.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising. We rely on grants and individual donations from people like you.
