["\u201cThe president has no plan. He has not laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape acknowledging he knew it, he said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it, because he didn't want to panic the American people,\u201d the former vice president said.", "Trump countered that his administration had \u201cdone a great job\u201d in responding to the virus, saying: \u201cWe got the gowns, we got the masks, we made the ventilators\u2026 and now we\u2019re weeks away from a vaccine, we\u2019re doing therapeutics already.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s response to the virus -- which has killed more than 205,000 people in America and infected nearly 7.2 million -- is a key issue for voters who will decide whether the real estate mogul-turned-politician will win a second term.", "AFP Fact Check examines Trump\u2019s efforts to combat the virus below.", "Trump told Bob Woodward on February 7, 2020 that the virus is \u201cdeadly stuff\u201d and is \u201cmore deadly than... even your strenuous flus,\u201d according to a recording of a call between the investigative journalist and the US president.", "\u201cYou just breathe the air -- that\u2019s how it\u2019s passed,\u201d Trump said.", "Although Trump knew the virus was dangerous, he did not reflect that in his public remarks, instead repeatedly downplaying the risks it posed.", "On February 27, Trump had said the risk the virus posed to the American people was \u201cvery low\u201d and that the number of cases \u201cis going to be down to close to zero\u201d within days, during one of his daily briefings on the virus. He then compared it to the common flu on March 9.", "Trump told Woodward on March 19 that \u201cI wanted to always play it down,\u201d adding: \u201cI still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201d", "There have been major shortages of key personal protective equipment such as masks during the coronavirus crisis.", "The president has invoked the Defense Production Act to respond to the pandemic, but the non-partisan Congressional Research Service said in late July that, \u201cDespite continued congressional concerns over personal protective equipment (PPE) availability, the Administration has not consistently employed DPA authorities to expedite PPE contracts.\u201d", "Coronavirus vaccines are, as Trump said, in the works, but his timetable of \u201cweeks\u201d is questionable.", "Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and a member of the Coronavirus Task Force, said that: \u201cWe hope as we go along that by the end of this year, or the beginning of 2021, we will at least have an answer whether the vaccine, or vaccines plural, are safe and effective.\u201d", "Trump has also advocated treatments that were ineffective if not potentially harmful, and delayed advocating the use of face masks, despite evidence that they help curb the virus\u2019s spread.", "He\u00a0repeatedly pushed hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19. But according to health authorities and independent experts, the drug -- which Trump said he took himself -- does not treat or prevent the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and can in fact pose health risks.", "He also suggested countering the virus with \u201clight inside the body\u201d or injecting disinfectant.", "And although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on April 3 that Americans wear face masks to help curb the spread of the virus, Trump refused to do so in public until July, a stance that was embraced by his political supporters.", "The president did not take a firm stance in support of masks until later that month, as cases rose in southern states.", "Trump said in late March that keeping the virus death toll in the 100-200,000 range would mean that \u201cwe all, together, have done a very good job.\u201d Those figures have been exceeded.", "Biden\u2019s coronavirus plan calls for making free testing widely available -- something that has been done under Trump, though the president has blamed it for unfavorably high US infection numbers, and there have been major delays in obtaining test results in some areas.", "Biden\u2019s plan also calls for accelerating the development of treatments and vaccines, which is currently underway, ensuring that there are no out-of-pocket costs for Covid-19 treatment, and enacting a \u201cdecisive economic response\u201d to aid individuals and small businesses affected by the crisis, among other steps.", "\u201cPublic health emergencies require disciplined, trustworthy leadership grounded in science. In a moment of crisis, leadership requires listening to experts and communicating credible information to the American public,\u201d the plan says.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
