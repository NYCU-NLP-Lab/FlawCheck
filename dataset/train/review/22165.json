["About this rating", "In November 2020, Ticketmaster proposed new safety measures that would help facilitate the reopening of live events. Event organizers would be responsible for choosing which protocols to implement, among them requiring proof of a negative COVID-19 test.", "Under the proposal, Ticketmaster itself would not require event attendees to provide test results or proof of vaccination.", "Snopes is still fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Namely, requiring proof of vaccination or negative COVID-19 test is a suggestion being floated around to event organizers and not a mandate from Ticketmaster.", "Snopes contacted the entertainment company and was directed to an FAQ page that described current COVID screening requirements.", "\u201cWe have noticed there has been some misreporting around safety protocols. To clarify, there is absolutely no requirement from Ticketmaster mandating vaccines/testing,\u201d wrote Ticketmaster.", "\u201cIn short, we are not forcing anyone to do anything. Just exploring the ability to enhance our existing digital ticket capabilities to offer solutions for event organizers that could include testing and vaccine information with 3rd party health providers. Just a tool in the box for those that may want to use.\u201d", "In widely circulated news articles (see examples here, here, and here), some publications reported that the three-part phase would require that concert attendees receive a negative COVID-19 test within a 72-hour window, as well as require that attendees verify they had received a COVID-19 vaccination, once one is available.", "The plan, which was reportedly still in development, would use a combination of Ticketmaster's digital ticketing app and a third-party health information company to verify testing and vaccination data from qualified healthcare providers, such as Labcorp and the CVS Minute Clinic.", "But the ticketing service said in a Nov. 12 statement that there is \u201cabsolutely no requirement from Ticketmaster mandating vaccines/testing for future events.\u201d", "Ticketmaster does not have the power to set policies around safety or entry requirements \u2014 both of which would be up to the discretion of the event organizer based on preference and local health guidelines. Ticketmaster said that it is currently exploring a number of safety features for event organizers to use, including social distanced seating, contactless entry, and a variety of other measures introduced in its SmartEvent policy \u2014 but the decision of what features to employ will ultimately be held in the hands of the event organizers.", "SmartEvent technology is a proposed policy to help event organizers adapt to COVID-19 safety measures.

It has become more common for people to take a COVID test before activities like traveling and seeing loved ones. If this is something that event organizers or venues choose to ask fans to do in the future (either for their own preferences or due to local health requirements), we want to be prepared.", "One idea to keep the event entry process as simple and convenient as possible is to find a way for fans to link their digital ticket to their negative test results, vaccine status, health declaration or any other info that is determined to greenlight access. This would allow fans to enter an event with one scan of their ticket, rather than entering and then having to wait in another line to show their health verification.", "While we have no control whether or not these factors will come into play in the future, if there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s to prep for as many scenarios as possible.", "But at the time of writing, these measures are ideas and have not been implemented. If event organizers wish to at some point incorporate personal healthcare data into its event planning protocols, Ticketmaster said that all health information would have to be legally stored in a healthcare provider with HIPPA-compliance.", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
