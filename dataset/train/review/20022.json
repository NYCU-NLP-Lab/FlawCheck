He compared the current threat of more Russian cyberattacks to warning signs before the September 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000.", "\"It was in the months prior to September 2001 when, according to then-CIA Director George Tenet, the system is blinking red,\" Coats said. \"And here we are nearly two decades later, and I'm here to say, the warning lights are blinking red again.\"", "In light of Putin\u2019s blanket denial, we took a fresh look at Russia\u2019s election-meddling past.", "Historians said the 2016 election was the first known example of a Russian attempt to sway a U.S. election in favor of a specific candidate, though there could have been additional attempts that remain classified or undiscovered.", "\"If by \u2018Russia\u2019 one means post-1991 Russia, that statement (from Putin) appears to be correct based on publicly available information,\" said Lucan Way, a University of Toronto professor specializing in democratization and authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union.", "But that does not mean the 2016 meddling was unprecedented. Way noted that Russia has frequently interfered in the elections of post-Soviet countries since the fall of the Soviet Union.", "Further, the Soviet Union worked in secret to help or hurt U.S. candidates at least four times during the Cold War era.", "\"What we are seeing with Russia's active measures today are \u2018unprecedented\u2019 in that they use new tools and technologies \u2026 but the ends are very much older, and are straight from the KGB playbook,\" said Calder Walton, an expert in intelligence history and international relations at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \"One can't understand Russian active measures to interfere in the 2016 election without understanding the long KGB history.\"", "In 1960, for example, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev offered Adlai Stevenson assistance from a secret propaganda campaign.

Ahead of the 1984 election, the KGB also worked to discredit Reagan\u2019s policies and popularize the slogan \"Reagan Means War\" around the world.", "\"There is a long history of the Kremlin interfering in internal U.S. affairs, including elections,\" Walton said. \"This included gathering compromising material on U.S. politicians, supporting Kremlin-favored candidates in U.S. elections, spreading forgeries and disinformation campaigns to inculcate distrust among the U.S. population in their government and Western allies.\"", "Walton added that Putin\u2019s claim is \"nonsense.\" We've reached out to the Russian embassy and will update the fact-check if we hear back.", "Putin said, \"The Russian state has never interfered ... into internal American affairs including election process.\"", "A mountain of evidence testifies to the fact that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. intelligence community and a Republican-led Senate panel concluded independently of each other that Kremlin-directed operatives stole private data, used propaganda against particular candidates, and engaged in an overall effort to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process. A Republican-led House panel found in its own investigation that Russia conducted cyberattacks during the 2016 campaign.", "These findings are supported by indictments stemming from the special counsel\u2019s investigation.", "There is no public evidence to suggest that the post-Cold War Russian government had previously interfered in a U.S. election at levels near the 2016 meddling, but the Soviet Union made several attempts to do so prior to its collapse in 1991.", "We rate this Pants on Fire.", "PolitiFact, \"2017 Lie of the Year: Russian election interference is a 'made-up story,'\" December 12, 2017", "Prospect Magazine, \"Active measures\": a history of Russian interference in US elections,\" December 23, 2016", "The Washington Post, \"Russia has been meddling in foreign elections for decades.
