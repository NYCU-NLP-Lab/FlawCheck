["About this rating", "It seems that for every genuine piece of news announcing the revival of a classic show (Roseanne, Full House, Will & Grace) there's an erroneous rumor making a similar claim about an unplanned reboot, remake, or sequel. In June 2018, another revival hoax made its way around Facebook, this time claiming that Courage the Cowardly Dog was returning to Cartoon Network:", "Probably the biggest giveaway that this is a hoax is that the date of the show's purported premiere, 30 February 2019, simply doesn't exist. The month of February will have 28 days in 2019. The month will have an extra day, making 29, in 2020 due to a leap year, but current calendar restraints will never allow the month to have a 30th day.", "This rumor went viral after it was posted by the Facebook page \"The Old Cartoon Network\" on 2 June 2018. When some of their fans were fooled by the faux show poster, the Facebook page reminded viewers to double-check the date:", "Plait, Phil. \u00a0 \"Leap Days Explained!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Slate. \u00a0 29 February 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
