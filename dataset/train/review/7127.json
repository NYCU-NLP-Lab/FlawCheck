["The aftermath of the presidential election has prompted a cascade of claims of deliberate manipulation of vote counting.", "One Facebook user\u00a0on Nov. 16 claimed:\u00a0\"Nevada AG Admits to Changing Signature Verifications Manually for Over 200,000 Votes. Everyone Knows this, right?\"", "At first, the claim\u00a0seems\u00a0puzzling,\u00a0given the gravity of the charge and the\u00a0fact that Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford is a Democrat.", "James Dehaven, political reporter for the Reno Gazette-Journal, says he has\u00a0no knowledge of any such explosive quote by Ford.", "Jon Ralston, a political\u00a0reporter and\u00a0editor of The Nevada Independent, says the claim that the attorney general made the statement statement is \"crazy talk.\"", "\"I don\u2019t even know what to say about this because it\u2019s so insane,\" Ralston\u00a0tells USA TODAY in an\u00a0email. \"Ford would not have the ability to do this, nor has he ever said he did so.\"", "More:Fact check: What's true and what's false about the 2020 election", "As it turns out, the quote comes from a former Nevada attorney general, Adam Laxalt, a Republican and co-chairman of the Trump campaign in Nevada.", "Laxalt made the charge\u00a0in an interview with\u00a0Fox News\u00a0that was then carried\u00a0by the Fellow American Daily, with the erroneous headline:\u00a0\"Nevada AG Admits That They Changed Signature Verification Manually for Over 200,000 Votes\"", "In the interview, Laxalt restates allegations of manipulated voting systems but does not offer hard evidence that specific votes were changed.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand first and foremost, how insecure this system is. We have over 600,000 mail-in ballots that have been counted \u2014 those are votes that are official in our system. We also know that we have unclean rolls \u2014 ballots that have been mailed to dead people, to people who have moved out of state, and people that got a dozen ballots in their homes, etc,\u201d Laxalt said.", "\"We have over 200,000 of those\u00a0votes have been verified by machine only,\" and then quotes computer experts as saying that changes in the machine's calibrations for comparing signatures\u00a0 would \"cast grave doubt on the 200,000 signatures that were verified.\"", "More:Nevada Supreme Court certifies Biden's presidential win, praises state's top election official", "The\u00a0signature verification issue has come up in lawsuits involving the 2020 elections. One brought by the Trump campaign alleged the\u00a0manipulation of sorting systems in heavily Democratic Clark County to allow for potentially fraudulent mail-in\u00a0ballots to be rejected and then visually inspected. This purported recalibration of the sort machine, the suit claimed,\u00a0\"is making it harder for Clark County officials to catch improper or fraudulent mail in ballots as opposed to the rest of Nevada.\"", "Carson City District Court Judge James Wilson this month dismissed an earlier\u00a0Republican-led effort to block\u00a0Clark's use of the\u00a0machines. Wilson said the suit provided \"no evidence\" to support claims of an unlawful vote count.", "The issue was raised again in yet\u00a0another lawsuit, filed Nov. 17, raising questions about signature verification machines.\u00a0The suit charges\u00a0among other things that \"issues\" with machines\u00a0used to verify signatures \"constitute\u00a0a malfunction of the machine sufficient to raise reasonable doubt as to the outcome of the election.\"", "The lawsuit, which is still pending,\u00a0does not include any specific allegation that votes were changed.", "USA TODAY asked the Facebook user for more information on the claim but did not get an immediate response. Freedom American Daily did not respond immediately to an inquiry as to whether it stood by the headline that apparently prompted the Facebook post.", "Based on our research, we rate the claim that Nevada's attorney general admitted to\u00a0 changing signature verifications manually FALSE. The statement regarding allegations that votes were changed by a signature verification machine was made by the former attorney general of Nevada, a Republican and co-chairman of the Nevada Trump campaign, and not by current Attorney General\u00a0Aaron Ford, a Democrat.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
