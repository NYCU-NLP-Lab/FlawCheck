["By Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on December 11, 2019", "During his first campaign rally after Democrats announced two articles of impeachment and the Justice Department inspector general released a report on the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, President Donald Trump distorted the facts on both topics.", "Trump\u2019s campaign rally was held Dec. 10 in Hershey, Pennsylvania.", "The president continued to rattle off a string of false claims about his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the whistleblower complaint. We\u2019ve written about all of these before.", "Trump released the White House memo on the phone call on Sept. 25. The following day, the House intelligence committee\u00a0released a redacted copy of the whistleblower complaint, which includes an account of the phone call that largely mirrors the White House memo. Also, on Sept. 26, Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, gave an embellished version of the call memo before a committee hearing.", "But Trump scrambles the timeline of events to make the false claim that his release of the memo came after Schiff\u2019s comments and \u201cscrewed up the whole works\u201d for the Democrats. The memo corroborates the whistleblower complaint.", "Trump said: \u201cWhen a guy like shifty Schiff, here\u2019s a corrupt politician. He made up my statement, because see, I did one thing very good. As soon as I heard about this deal, I released my statement immediately, but he had already made horrible statements and, by the way, the whistleblower, the whistleblower defrauded our country, because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue and we broke up the game.\u201d", "Again, Schiff\u2019s version of the call \u2014 which he acknowledged later in the hearing \u201cwas meant to be at least part in parody\u201d \u2014 came the day after Trump released the memo. (We previously went through how Schiff\u2019s version and the memo compare.)", "The president went on to repeat his false claim that the whistleblower report was \u201csomething totally different from what I said.\u201d The whistleblower complaint included three main points about the call that were indeed in the White House memo: that Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cinitiate or continue an investigation\u201d into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden; assist the U.S. in investigating allegations that \u201cRussian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine\u201d; and \u201cmeet or speak\u201d about these matters with Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr.", "On Sept. 26, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire\u00a0testified\u00a0that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u201cis in alignment with what was released yesterday by the president.\u201d", "Trump also wrongly said, again, that the White House memo on the call was \u201cprofessionally transcribed word-for-word.\u201d The memo specifically includes a \u201ccaution\u201d note saying it \u201cis not a verbatim transcript.\u201d", "The president further claimed the whistleblower had \u201cdisappeared, he\u2019s gone.\u201d But the whistleblower filed an anonymous complaint, as allowed under the law. (See this Sept. 23 report\u00a0by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.) And the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers have said their client wishes to remain anonymous. \u201cBecause our client has no additional information about the president\u2019s call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow,\u201d they wrote in an Oct. 25\u00a0op-ed\u00a0for the\u00a0Washington Post.", "Finally, the president claimed releasing the transcript \u201cgummed it up. Now, all of a sudden, we never heard from the second whistleblower.\u201d But the second whistleblower, who works in the intelligence community, did not\u00a0come forward\u00a0until the first week of October \u2014 more than a week after Trump released the memo. One of the attorneys representing the original whistleblower said\u00a0a second whistleblower had not filed a complaint but had spoken to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general.", "Trump accused the FBI of framing his campaign, stretching the facts to fit his narrative.", "Trump: The inspector general found that FBI spying application contained 17 errors and omissions \u2013 commonly known as lies and deceit. \u2026 When the FBI uncovered evidence showing that we did absolutely nothing wrong, which was right at the beginning, they hid that exonerating. You know that, they hid it. They hid it so nobody could see it, so they could keep this hoax going on for two years. They knew right at the beginning that it was all a frame up, a setup, but they hid it so that nobody could see it.", "It\u2019s true the inspector general found at least 17 \u201csignificant inaccuracies and omissions\u201d in the FBI\u2019s applications for a surveillance warrant of campaign aide Carter Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.", "For example, when it filed its first FISA application in October 2016, the FBI omitted that Page had served as an \u201coperational contact\u201d for another federal agency from 2008 to 2013, and had provided information to that agency about his \u201cpast contacts with certain Russian intelligence officers.\u201d That information was also not included in FISA renewal applications.\u00a0In gathering information for the Department of Justice\u2019s renewal of the FISA application, a lower-level FBI attorney altered an email to make it appear that Page was not a confidential source.", "Also, the first FISA application alleged Page was an intermediary between Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s then-campaign manager, and the Russian government as part of a \u201cwell-developed conspiracy.\u201d But the application omitted Page\u2019s statements to the FBI two months earlier denying this alleged conspiracy.", "So, the president is right that the IG found \u201c17 errors and omissions,\u201d including some \u201cexculpatory information,\u201d in the FISA application process that resulted in court-approved surveillance of Page. But the IG report found no evidence that these errors were intentional or that the FBI \u201cknew right at the beginning that it was all a frame up, a setup,\u201d as Trump said.", "The report said that \u201cwe did not find documentary or testimonial evidence of intentional misconduct on the part of the case agents who assisted OI [the National Security Division\u2019s Office of Intelligence] in preparing the applications, or the agents and supervisors who performed the Woods Procedures,\u201d referring to the FBI process of verifying facts included in FISA applications.", "\u201cIn most instances, witnesses told us that they either did not know or recall why the information was not shared with OI, that the failure to do so may have been an oversight, that they did not recognize at the time the relevance of the information to the FISA application, or that they did not believe the missing information to be significant,\u201d the report said. \u201cOn this last point, we believe that case agents may have improperly substituted their own judgments in place of the judgment of OI to consider the potential materiality of the information, or in place of the court to weigh the probative value of the information.\u201d", "Trump, as he has in the past, described the intelligence surveillance as \u201cspying\u201d on his campaign. But inspector general investigators found no evidence of illegal \u201cspying\u201d \u2014 either before or after the FBI on July 31, 2016, opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.", "The report says the IG found \u201cno evidence\u201d that the FBI used confidential sources or undercover employees \u201cto interact with members of the Trump campaign\u201d before launching the investigation.", "After the FBI opened an investigation, the FBI used four confidential human sources and \u201ca few\u201d undercover employees that \u201cresulted in interactions with Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, and a high-level Trump campaign official who was not a subject of the investigation.\u201d", "However, the report said the interactions between the Trump campaign aides and the FBI\u2019s confidential sources \u201creceived the necessary FBI approvals\u201d and were \u201cconsensually monitored and recorded by the FBI.\u201d", "Trump\u00a0claimed\u00a0that with the articles of impeachment filed on Dec. 10, Democrats are \u201cnow admitting there was no collusion, there was no obstruction of justice and there were no crimes whatsoever\u201d related to the Russia investigation, and that there were \u201cno crimes\u201d in the impeachment articles either.", "But the articles of impeachment do not exonerate Trump of alleged criminal behavior related to the Russia investigation.", "Trump:\u00a0Today the House Democrats announced these two flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous articles of impeachment. The House Democrats are walking back from everything they claimed with today\u2019s announcement. They\u2019re now admitting there was no collusion, there was no obstruction of justice and there were no crimes whatsoever. There were no crimes. It says it. There were no crimes. They\u2019re impeaching me, and there are no crimes. This has to be a first in history.", "The\u00a0Mueller report\u00a0issued in March concluded that \u201cthe evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.\u201d But it did not clear the president of the potential charge of obstruction of justice. \u201c[I]f we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,\u201d special counsel Robert Mueller wrote. \u201cBased on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment.\u201d", "The report continued: \u201cOur investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations. The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels. These actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney General\u2019s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony.\u201d", "The\u00a0articles of impeachment\u00a0announced by House Democrats did not include an obstruction of justice charge related to the Russia investigation.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean the Democrats have \u201cadmitted\u201d there was no obstruction, as Trump put it.", "During the Democratic\u00a0press conference\u00a0announcing the two articles of impeachment against Trump, Rep. Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said that the actions underpinning the charge of \u201cabuse of power\u201d in the Ukraine investigation \u201care consistent with President Trump\u2019s previous invitations of foreign interference in our 2016 presidential election.\u201d When describing the second article, obstruction of Congress, Nadler said, \u201cHere too, we see a familiar pattern in President Trump\u2019s misconduct.\u201d", "In the articles themselves, it states, after the \u201cabuse of power\u201d charge: \u201cThese actions were consistent with President Trump\u2019s previous invitations of foreign interference in United States elections.\u201d And as part of the obstruction of Congress charge, it states: \u201cThese actions were consistent with President Trump\u2019s previous efforts to undermine United States Government investigations into foreign interference in United States elections.\u201d", "On\u00a0CNN, Jeffrey Toobin, a former federal prosecutor, said he \u201cwas struck by what Jerry Nadler said, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee about the 2016 election that what he said that there was pattern evidence. So, yes, it is true that there is not a separate article of impeachment for obstruction of justice in connection with the Mueller investigation. But he did say very clearly that the evidence of what went on in the Trump campaign in 2016 when he welcomed Russian assistance, and when he instructed his aides like Don McGahn to fire \u2014 to fire Robert Mueller. That is part of this story. And as this trial now almost certainly moves to the Senate you can be sure that the House managers, that is the members of the House who will be bringing the case will certainly mention what went on in 2016, even if it is \u2014 even if it is not a formal article of impeachment.\u201d", "As for whether Trump committed any crimes related to the Ukraine investigation, Roll Call wrote: \u201cThe strategy to focus on constitutional violations rather than the criminal violations they had discussed \u2014 such as bribery, extortion, campaign finance or obstruction of justice \u2014 highlights how Democrats contend that a president does not have to commit a crime to be impeached.\u201d", "\u201cWe didn\u2019t need to name specific crimes in the articles because what we did encompasses all of that,\u201d Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon told Roll Call.", "During a\u00a0House hearing\u00a0on the constitutional framework for impeachment, constitutional scholars brought by the\u00a0Democrats\u00a0and\u00a0Republicans\u00a0said a crime is not necessarily required for impeachment.", "Norman Eisen, House Judiciary Committee Democratic counsel: Now, Professor Gerhardt, does a high crime and misdemeanor require an actual statutory crime?", "Michael Gerhardt, a Democratic witness: No, there\u2013it\u2013it plainly does not. Everything we know about the history of impeachment reinforces the conclusion that impeachable offenses do not have to be crimes, and again, not all crimes are impeachable offenses. We look at, again, at the context and gravity of the misconduct.", "Eisen: And Professor Turley, you recently wrote in theWall Street Journal, and I quote, there is much that is worthy of investigation in the Ukraine scandal, and it is true that impeachment doesn\u2019t require a crime.", "Jonathan Turley, a Republican witness: That\u2019s true, but I also added an important caveat. First of all\u2013", "Eisen: Sir, it was a yes or a no question. Did you write in the Wall Street Journal there is much that is worthy of investigation in the Ukraine scandal and it is true that impeachment does not require a crime? Is that an accurate quote, sir?", "Turley: That\u2019s\u2013you\u2019ve read it well.", "Trump \u2014 admitting that he didn\u2019t know if it was true or not \u2014 said he \u201cheard\u201d that former FBI lawyer Lisa Page had requested a restraining order against former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok, with whom Page had an affair.", "Trump: This poor guy, did I hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing, to keep him away from Lisa? That\u2019s what I heard. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, the fake news will never report it, but it could be true.", "We don\u2019t know where Trump got his information, but Page has denied that Strzok was ordered to keep away from her.", "\u201cThis is a lie. Nothing like this ever happened,\u201d she wrote on Twitter the morning after the rally.", "Page\u2019s tweet was in response to one from a Vox reporter who posted a video clip of Trump and wrote, \u201cTrump spreads unsourced rumors about Lisa Page taking out a restraining order on Peter Strzok.\u201d", "Since learning that Strzok and Page exchanged anti-Trump text messages while assigned to investigate Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of personal email for government business while she was secretary of state, the president has accused both of bias in their handling of the Clinton and Russia investigations.", "Prior to repeating what he purportedly heard about a restraining order, Trump told the rally crowd: \u201cWe also know from a previous inspector general investigation that many of these same high-ranking officials were consumed with anti-Trump and anti-Trump people hatred and bias, texting about an insurance policy.\u201d", "In its June 2018 report, the inspector general\u2019s office said it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the text messages sent by Strzok and Page, but the report said the IG found no evidence that their personal views about Trump influenced decisions that were made in the Clinton email investigation. The inspector general\u2019s Dec. 9 report about the origins of the Russia probe similarly said that the messages between Strzok and Page \u201craised serious questions about the propriety of any investigative decisions in which Strzok and Lisa Page played a role.\u201d However, the IG found neither was in a position to drive the investigation.", "The IG found that while Page \u201cattended some of the discussions regarding the opening of the investigations, she did not play a role in the decision to open\u201d them. And while Strzok was directly involved in decisions to open the cases on four Trump campaign officials, the report stated \u201che was not the sole, or even the highest-level, decision maker as to any of those matters.\u201d", "Besides, Trump is ignoring the fact that the most recent IG report also said that there were anti-Clinton FBI investigators who traded messages, as well.", "According to a footnote in the report, one example included an agent who sent an instant message on Nov. 9, 2016, saying he was \u201cso elated with the election,\u201d comparing the election coverage to \u201cwatching a Superbowl comeback\u201d and commenting about Clinton that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want a criminal to be in the White House.\u201d", "Still, the report said the inspector general reviewed the text messages of all of the FBI officials who participated in the decision to open the investigations and \u201cdid not identify any statements in those communications that indicated or suggested the decision could have been affected by political bias or other improper considerations.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
