["\u201cZinc stops viral replication inside lung cells,\u201d reads a screenshot circulating on Facebook. \u201cVitamin D builds the immune system. All freely available over the counter.\u201d", "The text -- which also recommends taking vitamin C and tonic water -- surfaced after news on November 9 that a vaccine jointly developed by US drug giant Pfizer and German firm BioNTech was 90 percent effective at preventing Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.", "The companies have since confirmed they would seek approval for an early roll-out of the vaccine,\u00a0shown\u00a0in final trial results to be 95 percent effective.", "While the Facebook posts do not explicitly refer to the pandemic, they attracted comments criticising \u201cBig Pharma\u201d and asking for advice on taking easily available products.", "Anti-vaccine groups have spread misinformation throughout the coronavirus crisis, a factor that public health experts warn could culminate in large populations not taking up a vaccine when it becomes available.", "\u201cWhat are the proper levels of some of this stuff to take?? I\u2019m not sure how much and what frequency...just asking for a friend..!!\u201d one Facebook user commented.", "However, scientists said that none of the measures described in the posts had been found effective in treating Covid-19.", "Contacted by AFP, Ian Jones, professor of virology at Britain\u2019s Reading University said taking zinc could not prevent or treat Covid-19.", "\u201cZinc is a toxic metal and although it does indeed inhibit some virus enzymes, the level required would not be tolerated in the body,\u201d he said.", "A human\u2019s zinc levels are \u201ccarefully regulated\u201d and any excess is excreted, so there is \u201cno way an inhibitory level could reach virus infected cells\u201d.", "The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) warns against taking high doses of zinc to prevent Covid-19, pointing to a lack of evidence and potential side effects, including irreversible neurological conditions from long-term use of supplements.", "\u201cFor people on a good diet and in generally good health, excess zinc is a waste of time and money,\u201d Jones said.", "The text also recommends drinking \u201cquinine tonic water\u201d, which \u201ctransports zinc into the cell\u201d.", "Quinine is a malaria drug that is added in small doses to tonic water brands such as Schweppes for flavoring. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricts the amount of quinine in commercial beverages to 83 parts per million, roughly equivalent to 83 milligrams per liter, whereas a capsule of prescribed quinine contains 324 milligrams of the drug.", "Online rumours recommending tonic water to fight Covid-19 cure appear to originate from hydroxychloroquine, a synthetic relative of quinine touted by controversial French professor Didier Raoult as a treatment for the disease.", "No clinical trials have yet been found in favor of using hydroxychloroquine against Covid-19, and critics say that due to potential serious side effects, treating coronavirus patients with hydroxychloroquine is worse than no treatment at all.", "Brandon Brown, a professor at the University of California\u2019s Riverside School of Medicine Center for Health Communities told AFP in April that quinine in tonic water could not work as a cure for Covid-19.", "\u201cYou would have to drink over 10 times more tonic than humans drink water per day to approach a similar effect of the drug. It\u2019s just not possible,\u201d he told AFP in an email, noting that humans drink about two liters of water a day on average.", "While vitamin C is an essential nutrient that helps keep cells healthy, there isn\u2019t yet enough evidence to recommend using it to prevent or treat Covid-19.", "Research carried out before the pandemic (2017, 2019) looked at giving high doses of vitamin C to patients suffering from respiratory failure and sepsis -- conditions which can occur in severe Covid-19 cases. Various studies are now investigating if this treatment can help coronavirus patients.", "Regarding prevention, there is no evidence that taking vitamin C can ward off the novel coronavirus, according to Harvard Medical School\u2019s \u2018Treatments for Covid-19\u2019 information page. It warns against high doses of vitamin C, which can cause nausea, cramps and an increased risk of kidney stones.", "Scientists have recommended taking vitamin D -- which the body creates from exposure to sunlight -- to promote healthy bones and muscles as people spend more time indoors during the pandemic.", "However, like vitamin C, there isn\u2019t yet enough evidence to recommend using vitamin D to prevent or treat Covid-19, and clinical trials are ongoing.", "Vitamin D deficiency is more common in Black and Latino people, groups disproportionately hit by Covid-19 in the US. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said factors such as poverty and poor healthcare contributed to the increased risk in these groups.", "\u201cThe problem in all the augments for these vitamins is conflation. You take a bit of information, like \u2018these are essential nutrients\u2019 and (in vitamin D\u2019s case) some of the population are deficient, and you catapult that into a Covid treatment,\u201d Jones said.", "\u201cIt is true that if you are deficient in basic nutrition then your immune system may not be in tip-top form, but that is nothing to do with a specific Covid treatment and taking it is not going to stop infection.\u201d", "AFP has\u00a0debunked\u00a0multiple claims of purported cures for Covid-19, available here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
