This is a dangerous path to go down.\"", "Bush did not return a request seeking more information about the video, including whether he recorded the footage himself, whether the incident had been reported and when exactly the damage occurred.", "Here\u2019s what we know: The parking garage is under the jurisdiction of state law enforcement, not the city police.
