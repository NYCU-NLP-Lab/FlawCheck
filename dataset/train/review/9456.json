Arguing that \"Richard Nixon invented the cult of the 'POW/MIA' in order to justify the carnage in Vietnam,\" Perlstein aired his grievances about the POW/MIA banner:", "You know that racist flag?

He also demanded the release of American prisoners as a precondition to ending the war.", "This was bullshit four times over: first, because in every other conflict in human history, the release of prisoners had been something settled at the close of a war; second, because these prisoners only existed because of America's antecedent violations of the Geneva Conventions in bombing civilians in an undeclared war; third, because, as bad as their torture of prisoners was, rather than representing some species of Oriental despotism, the Vietnam Communists were only borrowing techniques practiced on them by their French colonists (and incidentally paid forward by us in places like Abu Ghraib). And finally, our South Vietnamese allies' treatment of their prisoners, who lived manacled to the floors in crippling underground bamboo \"tiger cages\" in prison camps built by us, was far worse than the torture our personnel suffered.", "Perlstein's article offended many readers, as exemplified by Newsweek's Facebook page, which featured no link to Perlstein's article but was nonetheless overwhelmed with angry comments.
