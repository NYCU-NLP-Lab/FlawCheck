["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on December 14, 2017", "The United States does not pay 80 percent of the cost of operating the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, as President Donald Trump claimed.", "The U.S. spends a lot more on its own defense compared with other nations in the international security alliance, but its share of the commonly funded NATO budget is less than one quarter.", "Trump, who has long complained that other members of NATO should be spending more, made his claim during a speech in Pensacola, Florida, where he took credit for getting NATO countries to spend more money on defense.", "Trump, Dec. 8: Now tomorrow morning you\u2019ll see from these fakers back there, Donald Trump again disrespects NATO. I don\u2019t disrespect NATO. I think NATO is wonderful. But you know what? We\u2019re paying for 80% of NATO \u2013 could be higher. They say 72%. So, we\u2019re paying for 80% of NATO. Now I can only tell you one thing \u2013 it helps them a hell of a lot more than it helps us, okay?", "Trump conflates two kinds of spending by NATO countries \u2014 direct and indirect \u2013 to wrongly claim that the U.S. is \u201cpaying 80% for NATO.\u201d", "As for direct costs, the U.S. currently pays about 22 percent of NATO\u2019s \u201cprincipal budgets\u201d that are funded by all alliance members based on a cost-sharing formula that factors in the gross national income of each country. The principal budget categories include the civil budget, the military budget and the NATO Security Investment Programme.", "\u201cDirect contributions are made to finance requirements of the Alliance that serve the interests of all 29 members \u2014 and are not the responsibility of any single member \u2014 such as NATO-wide air defence or command and control systems,\u201d NATO says. \u201cCosts are borne collectively, often using the principle of common funding.\u201d", "Direct spending may also include other \u201cjoint funding\u201d projects that are arranged by participating NATO countries, but that are still overseen politically and financially by NATO.", "\u201cJointly funded programmes vary in the number of participating countries, cost-share arrangements and management structures,\u201d NATO says.", "Trump, on the other hand, is referring to so-called indirect spending \u2014 that is, the amount that the U.S. willingly spends on its defense budget compared with what other NATO countries spend on theirs.", "In its June 2017 update on spending, NATO said: \u201cToday, the volume of the US defence expenditure effectively represents 72 per cent of the defence spending of the Alliance as a whole.\u201d That disparity \u201chas been a constant,\u201d NATO says, and has only grown since the U.S. began increasing its defense spending after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.", "The 29 alliance members together spent an estimated $946 billion on defense in 2017, and more than $683 billion of that amount was spent by the U.S.", "Trump, however, mischaracterized what that means.", "As NATO said in the June update: \u201cThis does not mean that the United States covers 72 per cent of the costs involved in the operational running of NATO as an organisation, including its headquarters in Brussels and its subordinate military commands, but it does mean that there is an over-reliance by the Alliance as a whole on the United States for the provision of essential capabilities, including for instance, in regard to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; air-to-air refuelling; ballistic missile defence; and airborne electronic warfare.\u201d", "In 2006, NATO members agreed to try to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense spending. In 2014, they agreed again to aim to meet that standard by 2024.", "As of now, though, only the U.S., Greece, Estonia, Britain, Romania and Poland meet the 2 percent target, which led Trump to argue that our allies are not paying their \u201cfair share.\u201d", "But other countries have been spending more in recent years. The estimated 4.3 percent bump in 2017 was the third straight year that defense spending by Canada and European allies increased, according to NATO.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
