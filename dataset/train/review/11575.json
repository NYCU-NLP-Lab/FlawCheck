["By Eugene Kiely, Brooks Jackson, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley, D'Angelo Gore and Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on September 7, 2016", "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made some inaccurate claims during an NBC \u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d forum on military and veterans issues:", "The forum, sponsored by\u00a0NBC News and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, was held Sept. 7 at\u00a0the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. \u201cToday\u201d show host Matt Lauer, and members of the military and veterans in the audience, questioned the candidates separately.", "Trump said he \u201cwas totally against the war in Iraq,\u201d while Clinton\u00a0claimed that he supported the Iraq War before and after it started. The facts don\u2019t support either candidate\u2019s strong assertions.", "Our review of Trump\u2019s statements before and after the Iraq War started found no evidence that Trump opposed the war before it started. In fact, he expressed mild support for invading Iraq when asked about it on the Howard Stern radio show\u00a0on\u00a0Sept. 11, 2002 \u2014 about six months before the war started.", "Stern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq, and Trump responded, \u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d", "In the NBC commander in chief forum, Trump cited an Esquire article that appeared in August 2004 to show his opposition to the war. But that article appeared 17 months after the war started.", "As for Clinton, who as a senator voted in October 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq, the Democratic nominee claimed that Trump \u201csupported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.\u201d", "But just as there is no evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started, the Clinton campaign offered no evidence that\u00a0Trump supported the war \u201cafter it happened.\u201d", "The Clinton campaign cited Trump\u2019s interview on March 21, 2003, with Neil Cavuto of Fox Business just two days after the war started.", "Cavuto asked Trump about the impact of the war on the stock market. Trump said the war \u201clooks like a\u00a0tremendous success from a military standpoint,\u201d and he predicted the market will \u201cgo up like a rocket\u201d after the war. But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the U.S. should have gone to war with Iraq or whether he supports the war, and Trump doesn\u2019t offer an opinion.", "As early as July 2003, Trump expressed\u00a0concern on \u201cHardball with Chris Matthews\u201d about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the U.S. Two months later, Trump told MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, \u201cI guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.\u201d", "Clinton invited her audience to read Trump\u2019s comments on the Iraq War. They can read our timeline, \u201cDonald Trump and the Iraq War.\u201d", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5f108ced-4738-4cfa-8014-1a08792c3d6f", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c24c806a-ad01-401e-a81b-8369cb105731", "Trump said\u00a0President Barack Obama set a \u201ccertain date\u201d for withdrawing troops from Iraq, but that date was actually set by President George W. Bush.", "NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer asked Trump about his tendency to respond, when pushed for details on his military proposals, that he\u2019s not going to give details because he wants to be \u201cunpredictable.\u201d Trump responded, \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d and went on to criticize Obama for revealing the withdrawal date.", "Trump:\u00a0If I win, I don\u2019t want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is. \u2026\u00a0This is what Obama does \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re going to leave Iraq on a certain date.\u201d", "Trump made a similar claim in August.", "As we said then, Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether Obama or Bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011. But that date was set when Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement on Dec.\u00a014, 2008. It\u00a0said: \u201cAll the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.\u201d", "In the NBC forum, Trump also called the withdrawal of troops \u201ca terrible decision.\u201d\u00a0As we\u2019ve explained before, Condoleezza Rice, Bush\u2019s secretary of state, later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain, but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki objected.", "Once Obama took office in January 2009, he had three years to renegotiate the deal, which his administration tried to do, to leave a residual\u00a0American troop force. But Maliki still didn\u2019t agree. Negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether U.S. troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Whether Obama did enough is a matter of opinion: His then defense secretary, Leon Panetta, later wrote that the president didn\u2019t press hard enough for a deal. But some experts say Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran and there wasn\u2019t a deal to be made with Maliki.", "So, both presidents\u00a0had a role in the withdrawal of troops. But Trump wrongly said\u00a0that Obama was the one who set a \u201ccertain date\u201d for withdrawal and let U.S. enemies know about it, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.", "It\u2019s worth noting that Trump\u00a0said in a\u00a0March 16, 2007, interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from Iraq.", "Trump, March 16, 2007, on CNN:\u00a0You know how they get out? They get out. That\u2019s how they get out. Declare victory and leave, because I\u2019ll tell you, this country is just going to get further bogged down. \u2026\u00a0 And there\u2019s nothing \u2014 by the way, we\u2019re keeping the lid on a little bit but date we leave anyway it\u2019s all going to blow up. \u2026\u00a0So, I mean, this is a total catastrophe and you might as well get out now, because you just are wasting time.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/11180934-e4b2-44ab-93dd-99ce67d92200", "Trump said that Obama\u2019s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were \u201cthe first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One\u201d when \u201chigh officials\u201d of a host country did not appear to greet the president.", "That\u2019s not true. Other presidents have encountered similar low-key greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft.", "Trump referred to the fact that Cuba\u2019s president, Raul Castro, did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March, that Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obama\u2019s trip to Riyadh in April, and he referred to China\u2019s handling of the president\u2019s arrival\u00a0in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meeting.", "Whether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a U.S. president as Trump claims is a matter of debate. But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before. It has.", "In 1984, for example, Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by China\u2019s foreign minister rather than the president, whom he met only later. Similarly, on a 1985 trip to West Germany, Reagan\u00a0was met by the foreign minister\u00a0and not Chancellor Helmut Kohl.", "These and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post\u2018s \u201cFact Checker,\u201d who researched a Trump claim in April that Cuba\u2019s and Saudi Arabia\u2019s handling of Obama\u2019s visits were \u201cwithout precedent.\u201d Kessler said of Trump, \u201conce again he\u2019s wrong, wrong, wrong.\u201d", "Kessler also noted that during Richard Nixon\u2019s historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the country\u2019s number two man, Premier\u00a0Zhou Enlai. His boss, Chairman Mao, didn\u2019t even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/320daf39-adcb-4fb1-a5fc-14d2e623a98d", "Clinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization, which she said Trump supports.", "Clinton: I will not let the VA be privatized. And I do think that there is an agenda out there \u2014 supported by my opponent \u2014 to do just that. I think that would be very disastrous for our military veterans.", "But Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans. \u201cI would not do that,\u201d Trump said, referring to Clinton\u2019s claim that he supports privatization.", "Trump: And by the way, I never said take the VA, the Veterans Administration, private. I wouldn\u2019t do that. Too much respect for our people. I heard it was said that I said that. I would not do that. But I do believe, I do believe, when you\u2019re waiting in line for six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that. You go out, you see the doctor, you get yourself taken care of.", "Trump\u2019s campaign published \u201cThe Goals Of Donald J. Trump\u2019s Veterans Plan\u201d on its website last October. It doesn\u2019t call for the VA to be completely privatized.", "One of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-VA medical center that accepts Medicare.", "\u201cUnder a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran\u2019s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately,\u201d the plan states.", "\u201cThe power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans\u2019 healthcare dollars,\u201d the plan says.", "Trump\u2019s proposal would seemingly go further than the Non-VA Medical Care Program, which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances, such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services. The program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-VA facility in non-emergency situations.", "Trump\u2019s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law, creating a temporary program, separate from the Non-VA Medical Care Program, that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-VA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center, or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital.", "Trump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent \u201cTen Point Plan To Reform The VA\u201d in July.", "Point 10 of the plan says: \u201cMr. Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice. Under a Trump Administration, no veteran will die waiting for service.\u201d", "Trump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as well.", "Trump: Under a part of my plan, if they have that long wait, they walk outside, they go to the local doctor, they choose the doctor, they choose the hospital, whether it\u2019s public or private, they get themselves better.", "To be clear, Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones. That\u2019s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e0c57d7a-514a-49dc-bf85-550faedeb149", "Trump criticized\u00a0Clinton for making \u201ca terrible mistake on Libya\u201d when she was secretary of state. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action\u00a0that led to\u00a0the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.", "Trump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on\u00a0whether\u00a0Trump\u00a0will be \u201cprepared on Day One,\u201d if elected president, to tackle \u201ccomplex national security issues.\u201d", "Trump, Sept. 7:\u00a0One hundred percent. Hey, Matt, again, she made a mistake on Libya. She made a terrible mistake on Libya. And the next thing, I mean, not only did she make the mistake, but then they complicated the mistake by having no management once they bombed you know what out of Gadhafi. I mean, she made a terrible mistake on Libya.", "This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the U.S. intervention\u00a0in Libya.", "During the 10th\u00a0GOP debate, Trump said he had \u201cnever discussed that subject\u201d when Sen. Ted Cruz called him out on supporting U.S. action in the country.

Gadhafi, in Libya, is killing thousands of people. Nobody knows how bad it is and we\u2019re sitting around. We have soldiers all over the Middle East and we\u2019re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage. And that\u2019s what it is, a carnage. \u2026 Now we should go in. We should stop this guy which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it and save these lives. This is absolute nuts. We don\u2019t want to get involved and you\u2019re going to end up with something like you\u2019ve never seen before. Now, ultimately the people will appreciate it and they\u2019re going to end up taking over the country eventually. But the people will appreciate it and they should pay us back. But we have to go in to save these lives. These people are being slaughtered like animals. \u2026 We should do it on a humanitarian basis. Immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively and save the lives.", "Even though Trump now says Clinton\u2019s support for intervention in Libya was\u00a0a \u201cterrible mistake,\u201d\u00a0it\u00a0doesn\u2019t change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafi\u2019s removal.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bac81ae8-b645-48ac-85e4-eb5513945f67", "Trump twisted Clinton\u2019s words when he claimed Clinton said \u201cvets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\u201d Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as \u201cwidespread\u201d as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim, but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system \u2014 including the issue of wait times for doctors \u2014 \u00a0and what she would do to address them.", "Trump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as \u201cone of the big problems\u201d in the VA, and then suggested Clinton doesn\u2019t think the VA has problems.", "Trump:\u00a0And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated, essentially, just fine, there\u2019s no real problem, it\u2019s over-exaggerated.", "Lauer interrupted, noting that Clinton \u201cwent on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.\u201d", "Trump insisted his version was accurate, adding, \u201cI\u2019m telling you \u2026 she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.\u201d", "That\u2019s not accurate. The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Oct. 23, 2015. Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it. \u201cThe reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable,\u201d Maddow said.", "Maddow asked if Clinton had any \u201cnew ideas for trying to fix\u201d the VA. Here was Clinton\u2019s response, with the part Trump is referring to in bold.", "Clinton: Yeah, and I don\u2019t understand that. You know, I don\u2019t understand why we have such a problem, because there have been a number of surveys of veterans, and overall, veterans who do get treated are satisfied with their treatment. \u2026 Now, nobody would believe that from the coverage that you see, and the constant berating of the VA that comes from the Republicans, in part in pursuit of this ideological agenda that they have.", "Maddow:\u00a0But in part because there has been real scandal.", "Clinton:\u00a0There has been.

If there is a waiting period that is just unacceptable, you should be able to, in a sense, get the opportunity to go out, have a private physician take care of you, but at the cost of the VA.", "But I think it goes deeper than that, because if you look at not only VA health care, but the backlog on disability determinations, there\u2019s something not working within the bureaucracy. And I have said I would like to literally appoint a SWAT team to bring in people and just tackle the disability, have an ongoing review of the care that is being given, do more to make sure that every VA hospital is delivering care to the highest standard of the community, because, unfortunately, some are doing a lot better job than others are.", "Clinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they \u201cwant it to fail\u201d so they can privatize it.", "Clinton added, \u201cBut we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern, so that we can try to stymie the Republican assault.\u201d", "Indeed, the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to \u201cfundamentally reform veterans\u2019 health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care.\u201d The campaign says Clinton \u201cwas outraged by the recent scandals at the VA, and as president, she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership.\u201d The site specifically mentions Clinton\u2019s dissatisfaction that \u201c[m]any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals\u201d and promises she will \u201c[b]uild a 21st-century Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver world-class care.\u201d", "Trump cherry-picked the part of Clinton\u2019s response that said problems in the VA have \u201cnot been as widespread as it has been made out to be,\u201d to make the blanket claim that Clinton is \u201csatisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration\u201d and that \u201cvets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\u201d But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clinton\u2019s answer that acknowledged problems in the VA \u2014 including the wait time issue Trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6f3c2fcb-de89-41cd-bfea-45be73ffb819", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
