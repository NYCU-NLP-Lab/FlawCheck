The image won first place in a Photoshop contest called \u201cThe Eighth Wonder of the World\u201d hosted by the web site pxleyes.com. The artist, whose user name is loopyluv, explained the steps used to create the image:", "The notion that such a large, well-preserved seahorse fossil would be found anywhere on Earth is unlikely. In fact, seahorse fossils are remarkably rare, and have so far been found only in two locations: the Tunjice Hills in Slovenia, and in a single fossil bed in Northeastern Italy. Both of these fossil beds preserve seahorses that are similar in size and shape to the seahorses alive today, which range from .6 to 14 inches long.", "Scientists estimate that the largest seahorse fossil from Slovenia, if it had preserved the complete body, would have about 9 centimeters long \u2014 far smaller than human-sized seahorse allegedly preserved in the boulder. As such, we rank this claim as false.", "pxleyes.com. \u00a0 \"A Work in Progress: The 8th wonder\"", "Teske, Peter, R,, and Beheregary, Luciano B. \u00a0 \"Evolution of Seahorses' Upright Posture Was Linked to Oligocene Expansion of Seagrass Habitats.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Biology Letters. \u00a0 18 May 2009.", "Zalohar, Jure, et al. \u00a0 \"Two New Species of Seahorses (Syngnathidae, Hippocampus) from the Middle Miocene (Sarmatian) Coprolitic Horizon in Tunjice Hills, Slovenia: The Oldest Fossil Record of Seahorses.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Annales de Pal\u00e9ontologie. \u00a0 June 2009.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
