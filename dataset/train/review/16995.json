What Trump left out, however, is that his efforts to end the program started during his first year in office.", "A town hall attendee asked Trump if he would pursue his efforts to cut Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, if elected to a second term.", "\"We are going to take care of DACA. We are going to take care of Dreamer(s).

She said that no new applications were allowed and recipients have to renew every year as opposed to every two years.", "\"What happened is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front,\" Trump said Oct. 15. \"Mexico is heavily infected, as you know, and we've made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic and other reasons, and crime.\"", "Trump\u2019s comment left the wrong impression: Trump\u2019s efforts to undo or restrict DACA were not tied to the pandemic.", "Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in September 2017 announced that the Trump administration was rescinding the program, arguing that Obama\u2019s administration circumvented immigration laws when it created it.", "The administration at the time said it would adjudicate applications filed by Sept. 5, 2017, on a case-by-case basis, but it would reject any new requests filed after that date.", "Legal challenges to the administration\u2019s efforts have left that program in place, with some caveats. The administration is required to process renewal applications for immigrants who have been granted DACA and want to renew it. However, immigrants who have never had DACA are not allowed to file an application seeking the protection for the first time.", "As Guthrie said, the Trump administration also has reduced the length of the renewable DACA protection, from two years to one. Immigration officials announced that specific change in July 2020, in response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision related to the administration\u2019s efforts to end the program.", "DACA does not benefit people who are newly arriving in the country.
