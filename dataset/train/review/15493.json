In the late 1860s, Bartholdi sketched a statue of an Egyptian woman that he was hoping to build at the southern end of the Suez Canal. When funding for the project fell through, Bartholdi abandoned his plans, but he later used the drawings as a jumping-off point for the Statue of Liberty, reworking the Egyptian woman into a classical Greco-Roman goddess of liberty.", "Nothing in the historical record indicates that Bartholdi built a Black Statue of Liberty, only to have the U.S. reject it. But versions of the rumor date back at least as far as the late 1990s, before Lady Liberty was erected on St. Martin.", "In 1998, after receiving several inquiries about the claim, the National Park Service launched an exhaustive, two-year investigation into the Statue of Liberty\u2019s history.
