Rick Scott as he jumped into the 2018 governor\u2019s race.", "In a Nov. 1, 2017, speech announcing his run, Levine, a Democrat, criticized the governor for being so proud of the state\u2019s minimum wage that he\u2019s advertising it.", "\"When workers are paid $8.10 an hour, and our current governor runs ads bragging about it \u2014 it\u2019s callous and it\u2019s wrong,\" Levine said.", "Florida\u2019s minimum wage is $8.10 and will rise 15 cents in January 2018.", "Has Scott run ads bragging about it? Not directly.", "The radio ad in question comes from Enterprise Florida, the state\u2019s public-private economic development arm chaired by Scott. The ad did boast about Florida\u2019s lack of income tax and Scott\u2019s efforts to cut regulations. But Levine went too far in saying Scott bragged about the state\u2019s minimum wage.", "Levine\u2019s spokesman Christian Ulvert sent two columns by opinion writers and one article that discussed radio ads in California that coincided with a business recruitment trip by Scott in May 2016.", "The Enterprise Florida ad talked about lost jobs that would come if California approved a $15 minimum wage. When the ad brought up Florida, the focus was on lower taxes and less regulation, not Florida\u2019s minimum wage explicitly.", "\"Seven hundred thousand. That\u2019s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage. Ready to leave California? Go to Florida instead \u2014 no state income tax, and Gov. Scott has cut regulations. Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them.\"", "We didn\u2019t hear back from Scott by our deadline. When we last looked at the ad in 2016, a Scott spokeswoman\u00a0said the ad wasn\u2019t Scott bragging about low wages, but rather him pointing out differences between the states\u2019 economies.", "\"He has never said he is proud of how low our wages are,\" said Jackie Schutz Zeckman, now Scott\u2019s chief of staff.", "Levine\u2019s spokesman disagreed, arguing the the \"intent and purpose\" of the ad, as interpreted by newspaper editorial writers and columnists, was centered around wages.", "\"The governor has bragged about Florida's low wages a number of times and allowed tax dollars to be used to highlight that fact in California,\" Ulvert said. \"All facts.\"", "Ulvert also pointed to the state\u2019s decision to join the lawsuit against Miami Beach\u2019s minimum wage ordinance that aimed to increase\u00a0the city starting wage to $13.31 by 2021. (The ordinance was struck down\u00a0in Miami-Dade circuit court in March.)", "Ulvert has a point that multiple news outlets \u2014 mostly columnists \u2014 have accused Scott of plugging low wages in the context of the radio ad and trips to California, even though he\u2019s never explicitly said it. Here\u2019s an example editorial from the Palm Beach Post.", "\"Gov. Rick Scott has spent the week on another job poaching expedition, this time in California. The prowling governor aimed to entice employers to move their companies to the Sunshine State. His pitch: Wages are low in Florida.\"", "This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve looked at this argument. Scott has openly tried to steal jobs from other states for years.", "In 2016, then-U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham accused Scott of going \"around the country\" and bragging about Florida\u2019s low wages to other states. Florida\u2019s wages in 2016 were low by national standards, but it didn\u2019t appear Scott boasted (at least publicly) about this fact while recruiting businesses from other states.", "When we reviewed Scott\u2019s statements from these recruiting missions, we found he did focus quite a bit on the state\u2019s low taxes for businesses. He never explicitly advertised it like Graham, and now Levine, said.", "\"By raising the minimum wage in California, 700,000 people are going to lose their jobs, there are a lot of opportunities for companies to prosper in Florida and compete here, and that's what I'm going after,\" Scott said on his three-day tour.", "By the way, PolitiFact Florida previously researched whether California stood to lose 700,000 jobs because of the wage increase and rated the statement Mostly False. We learned the figure was a projection of how many jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didn\u2019t increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment.", "Levine said Scott has run ads bragging about Florida\u2019s minimum wage, which is currently $8.10 an hour.", "The closest example is Enterprise Florida\u2019s California radio ad, which is critical of California\u2019s $15 minimum wage but never explicitly brags or talks about Florida\u2019s minimum wage.", "Levine put words in Scott's mouth, when at most there is an implication.
