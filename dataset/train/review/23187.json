The warm waters of Lake Michigan, the delicious pasties, and the friendliness of the Yuppers, it all makes sense.\u201d", "The story is a fabrication. There is no Disney spokesperson named \"Jun Disney,\" and the incident described as a motivating factor for the company's purported decision \u2014 an apparition of Mickey Mouse in a bowl of cereal in Escanaba \u2014 was in fact another fabrication from the same web site.", "Uncle Walt's Insider is replete with tongue-in-cheek allusions to its satirical nature (staff biographies mention a founder named \"Uncle Walt,\" born in 1901, like Walt Disney himself; and the home page features a fake quote from Uncle Walt which reads \"There's so much misinformation out there.
