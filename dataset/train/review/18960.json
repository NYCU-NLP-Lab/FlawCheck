(AP)", "\u2022 Trump is wrong about the job gains on his watch; the actual increase is about 450,000 prior to the pandemic.", "\u2022 As for Obama and Biden, they saw gains of 916,000 if you start counting with the recovery from the Great Recession, which is the fairest comparison if you also ignore the losses under Trump during the pandemic.", "Reaching back to one of his core agenda issues from the 2016 presidential campaign, President Donald Trump touted his record on manufacturing jobs during the first presidential debate in Cleveland.", "Referring to the manufacturing sector, Trump said, \"I brought back 700,000 jobs.\" By contrast, Trump said, under President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s 2020 opponent, \"They brought back nothing.\"", "Trump is exaggerating gains on his own watch, even before the coronavirus pandemic, and he\u2019s offering a misleading assessment of what happened during the Obama administration.", "We looked at manufacturing employment data from January 2009, when Obama took office, through August 2020, the most recent month available. Here\u2019s what the data looks like, with Obama\u2019s tenure in blue and Trump\u2019s in red.", "This shows that Trump is wrong to say that 700,000 manufacturing jobs were created on his watch. The actual rise prior to the coronavirus pandemic was about 450,000 manufacturing jobs. (If you do account for the recession prompted by the pandemic, which is not advisable since the economy is so volatile at the moment, manufacturing employment has declined by 237,000.)", "The situation under Obama is trickier to parse.", "During Obama\u2019s entire tenure in the White House, manufacturing employment fell by 192,000. Keep in mind, though, that Obama inherited the Great Recession. A fair comparison between Trump and Biden excludes both recessions.", "From the low point of the recession in 2010, the manufacturing sector added 916,000 jobs on Obama\u2019s watch. That was roughly seven years, about twice the amount Trump\u2019s been in office, so on an annual basis, the manufacturing employment gains per year were roughly similar between the two presidents. In fact, you can see in the chart that the pace of increase was fairly constant for Obama\u2019s final seven years and Trump\u2019s first three years.", "In awarding Trump a Promise Broken for his pledge to bring back manufacturing, we also noted that another metric, gross manufacturing output by quarter, found nothing special on Trump\u2019s watch. Manufacturing output rose during the first year and a half of Trump's presidency, but at a rate not much faster than during most of Obama's presidency. And after that, output stagnated or even declined slightly.", "\"There was nothing special or extraordinary about Trump's two years of manufacturing job growth, other than to say he benefited from synchronized global growth, which is very rare, and juice from the corporate tax cut, which probably shifted investment and hiring forward a bit,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, told us in June.", "Finally, presidents can have an impact on economic conditions, but they are not the only factor. Among the things out of their control are external economic shocks such as oil price fluctuations, changes in technology, and the state of the global economy.", "Trump said that in the manufacturing sector, \"I brought back 700,000 jobs.
