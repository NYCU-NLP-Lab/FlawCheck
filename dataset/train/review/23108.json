["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on November 10, 2020 | Updated on April 9, 2021", "A misleading claim that more than 21,000 registered voters in Pennsylvania are dead is circulating online. The figure comes from a conservative group that failed to convince a federal judge in October that its list was accurate.", "Headlines claiming that \u201c21,000 DEAD PEOPLE\u201d are registered to vote in Pennsylvania have been racking up shares on social media amid an\u00a0effort to spread the unfounded claim that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.", "High-profile conservative figures \u2014 including Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida and President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani \u2014 have promoted a story with a similarly suggestive headline.", "But the claim is misleading. It\u2019s based on a lawsuit filed by a conservative organization called the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which regularly brings voting-related lawsuits against states.", "The case was filed on Oct. 15, about two weeks before Election Day. It alleged that more than 21,000 voters registered in Pennsylvania were dead and asked that the court order the state to remove them from the rolls before the election.", "The federal judge hearing the case declined to do so.", "Instead, Judge John Jones III cited PILF\u2019s questionable methodology in developing its purported list of ineligible voters, its decision to file the suit at the \u201celeventh hour,\u201d and the fact that Pennsylvania\u2019s system for stripping deceased voters from the rolls appears to work.", "State law requires the health department to notify local election officials when someone over 18 dies, and those officials are required to cancel any corresponding voter registration. The secretary of the commonwealth, against whom the suit was brought, maintains a database where those voter records are updated.", "In 2019, officials removed 95,670 deceased voters from the database, according to the secretary of the commonwealth\u2019s annual report on voter registration. In 2018, they removed 91,424. In 2017, they removed 103,913.", "Jones noted that more than half of the purportedly deceased voters on a list of 9,300 names PILF sent to the secretary of the commonwealth in May didn\u2019t appear on the list the organization submitted in October.", "\u201cTo be sure, this could be the result of a number of factors, including inadequacies in [PILF\u2019s] data-mining procedures,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cBut it is also possible that this change was the result of state and county efforts to remove ineligible voters.\u201d", "Whatever the reason for it, the discrepancy led the court to \u201cseriously question how many voters on [PILF\u2019s] list are, in fact, deceased,\u201d Jones wrote, and he wouldn\u2019t have voters removed from the rolls based on PILF\u2019s account alone.", "\u201cIn an election where the margins may be razor-thin, we will not deprive the electorate of its voice without notice or proper investigation on the basis of an ill-framed and speculative venture launched at this late date,\u201d Jones concluded.", "That decision was issued on Oct. 20, but PILF filed an amended complaint on Nov. 5. That\u2019s likely the reason for the interest in the lawsuit at this point.", "In addition to its original claim, the organization alleged in the amended complaint that between the 2016 and 2018 elections, a total of at least 216 votes were cast \u201cby (or at least in the name of)\u201d people who had died before the election. PILF didn\u2019t provide any evidence for the claim in the complaint, and the group didn\u2019t respond to our request for more information.", "It\u2019s certainly possible that some votes have been cast in the name of deceased individuals. But, as we\u2019ve written, in some cases, it is a matter of a relatively small number of people dying in the period between when they sent in a mail-in ballot and Election Day.", "Sometimes there are rare cases of fraud, experts told us. \u201cYes, every once in a while, it turns out that someone votes in the name of someone who\u2019s passed away,\u201d Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Law School and a voter fraud expert, told us for another story we wrote on such claims. \u201cA handful of votes in a sea of millions. It\u2019s not OK, but it doesn\u2019t swing results.\u201d", "Levitt and\u00a0Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at MIT who specializes in elections, both said that claims about large numbers of votes from deceased people often turn out to be due to list-matching or administrative errors, such as confusing two people with identical or similar names.", "So, there\u2019s no evidence for claims like the one Gaetz made on Twitter, where he wrote, \u201cThe dead vote appears to have swung overwhelmingly for Joe Biden,\u201d above a headline saying 21,000 \u201cDead People\u201d are on the voter rolls in Pennsylvania. We don\u2019t know whether the 21,000 people on PILF\u2019s list were dead, whether they are still on the voter rolls or whether they voted or for whom.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that President-elect Joe Biden was leading Trump by more than 45,000 votes in the unofficial results for Pennsylvania on Nov. 10.", "Update, April 9: Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of the commonwealth and PILF settled this lawsuit on April 1. Nothing in the settlement\u00a0confirms\u00a0the number of supposedly dead\u00a0registered\u00a0voters that PILF had claimed.\u00a0But the\u00a0secretary\u00a0of\u00a0the commonwealth did agree to\u00a0compare Pennsylvania\u2019s voter rolls to\u00a0death data published by the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC,\u00a0before statewide elections in November.\u00a0ERIC\u00a0is an organization of 30 states and the District of Columbia that share voter registration data.
