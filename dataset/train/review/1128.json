(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "It\u2019s not uncommon for some people receiving the two-dose Moderna regimen to report pain in the arm that received the shot, or feeling tired or sick for a day or so, particularly after the second dose.", "But Gates did not say that 80% of people receiving the Moderna vaccine experience significant side effects. And reports of \"severe adverse events\" associated with the Moderna vaccine are extremely rare.", "The Facebook post includes video from a Rogan podcast in which Rogan recalls that Alex Jones, who runs a website that has published fake news and conspiracy theories, told him on a previous podcast that \"80% of the people that took the Moderna vaccine had significant side effects, particularly after the second dose.\"", "Rogan says that after he received pushback about Jones\u2019 claim, \"I played the Bill Gates clip where Bill Gates is being interviewed by CBS and he says it himself.\"", "But Gates didn\u2019t say that in the excerpt that Rogan played. In fact, he didn\u2019t say it at any point in the CBS interview.", "Here\u2019s that portion of CBS anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell\u2019s interview with Gates, which was done in July.", "O\u2019Donnell: \"You mentioned side effects. The side effects for the Moderna vaccine sound concerning. We looked. After the second dose, at least 80% of participants experienced a systemic side effect, ranging from severe chills to fevers. So, are these vaccines safe?\"", "Gates: \"Well, the FDA, not being pressured, will look hard at that. The FDA is the gold standard of regulators and their current guidance on this, if they stick with that, is very, very appropriate. The side effects were not super-severe; that is, it didn\u2019t cause permanent health problems. Moderna did have to go with a fairly high dose to get the antibodies. Some of the other vaccines are able to go with lower doses to get responses that are pretty high, including the\" Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines. \u2026", "O\u2019Donnell: \"But everybody with a high dose had a side effect.\"", "Gates: \"Yeah, but some of that is not dramatic, where it\u2019s just super-painful.

She recovered and later said that she regularly feels dizzy after experiencing any kind of pain, even after stubbing a toe.", "The other clip is of an Indiana woman seated in a hospital bed shaking. She had claimed in viral videos in January that she suffered from uncontrollable shaking after taking the first round of the Moderna vaccine. Doctors at a neuroscience hospital told the woman her problem was likely stress-related, her fiance told an Indiana newspaper.", "So, where might the 80% figure claimed in the post have originated?", "In July, about a week before Gates\u2019 CBS interview, the New England Journal of Medicine published a preliminary report on a trial involving 45 healthy adults who were given two doses of the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart. They were divided into three groups of 15, with each group receiving a different dose level.", "In an article about that report, Wired magazine said: \"By the time they\u2019d had two doses, every single one was showing signs of headaches, chills, or fatigue, and for at least 80%, this could have been enough to interfere with their normal activities.\"", "Moderna later submitted data from a large trial to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A December FDA report said that out of 15,184 people who received the vaccine, 82 had a serious adverse event, such as death, heart attack or pneumonia \u2014 fewer than 0.5%.", "That was the same level for the placebo group. There was no indication the vaccine caused any of the serious events.", "The most commonly reported side effects of the Moderna vaccine, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, swollen lymph nodes in the same arm as the injection, nausea and vomiting, and fever, according to the FDA. More people experienced those side effects after the second dose.", "There is a remote chance that the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction, the FDA says.", "A Facebook post claimed: \"80% of people taking the Moderna vaccine had significant side effects, via Bill Gates.\"", "Gates was asked in July about 80% of the people in an early trial of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine reporting \"systemic\" side effects such as severe chills and fevers.
