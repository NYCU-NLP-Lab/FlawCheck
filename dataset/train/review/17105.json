["Even in a U.S. Senate contest of ideological near-opposites, the gap between Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold and Republican challenger Ron Johnson on trade issues is notable.\n\nFeingold, supported by labor unions, consistently has voted against foreign-trade agreements over his three terms, saying they unfairly punish Wisconsin workers -- especially on the manufacturing line.\n\nJohnson, the manufacturing plant executive, extols global trade as the gateway to job growth and higher profits, citing his own Oshkosh firm as an example. There are unfortunate casualties, he says, but they are necessary to boost employment overall.\n\nWith the unemployment rate stubbornly high, a new TV and radio ad blitz from Feingold is aimed at hitting home with disgruntled workers.\n\nHere is the central claim, stated on the radio, implied with graphics on TV:\n\n\"According to independent analysis, unfair trade deals have resulted in the loss of over 64,000 jobs in Wisconsin. That\u2019s why Russ Feingold has consistently voted against them. But Ron Johnson favors those deals.\"\n\nThere is a lot in that statement, but we\u2019ll take it apart piece by piece.\n\nFirst, the trade deals being cited are those such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).\n\nThe radio ad cites no source or time frame for the 64,000 number, but Feingold senior campaign strategist John Kraus says it came from a database generated by Global Trade Watch, a project of the liberal consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.\n\nIs that group independent, as the ad claims?\n\nPublic Citizen is a leading critical voice on trade deals, so it comes to the issue from that perspective. The group holds Feingold in high regard because his stance fits the group\u2019s agenda. It has publicly praised Feingold for campaign finance reform and his trade votes, and even filed a legal brief with the U.S. Supreme Court against a challenge to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reforms.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s look at the origin of the numbers.\n\nThe group\u2019s job-loss database is based on U.S. Department of Labor data from a program that helps workers who have lost their jobs as a result of foreign trade. It\u2019s called the Trade Adjustment Assistance program.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor does not use that data to measure job losses due to foreign trade, a spokesman said, because of undercounting (not every company or union applies to the voluntary program) and overcounting (some workers apply but aren\u2019t ultimately laid off).\n\nThe department doesn\u2019t specify the extent of either over- or under-counting.\n\nBut researchers, even pro-trade deal ones, say the Labor Department program serves only a fraction of those who lose their jobs in industries facing heavy \u00a0import competition. A 1999 study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics -- a group in favor of free trade -- found that only 10% of those workers showed up in the federal program.\n\nIndeed, Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a Peterson Institute expert, said the data is commonly used by researchers as the best available for showing how trade can close factories.\n\nThe 64,000 figure cited by Feingold goes back to 1994, when NAFTA kicked in.\n\nWhen PolitiFact Wisconsin downloaded company-by-company figures from the group\u2019s database, it came up with the same figure.\n\nBut there\u2019s a larger issue on claims of job loss.\n\nLooking at one side of the coin, as Feingold does, provides a one-sided view. It does not take into account job gains made elsewhere in part by trade agreements.\n\nSaid Hufbauer: \"It isn\u2019t the whole story.\"\n\nHufbauer said trade deals had helped fuel big increases in trade, though in his view the business climate, monetary policy and spending policy are much bigger drivers for job losses and gains than trade pacts.\n\nSo, in presenting only one side of the coin, Feingold leaves out important context.\n\nThis leaves us with Feingold\u2019s suggestion that the trade deals he opposed -- and Johnson supports -- were \"unfair.\"\n\nThe characterization depends on your point of view.\n\nIn short, Feingold believes they are \"unfair\" to workers who lose their jobs. Johnson says they are fair because long-term they are the engine behind the wheels of capitalism.\n\nJohnson says he would not support an \"unfair\"\u2019 deal.\n\nHe has not addressed every trade deal specifically, but at a July WisPolitics luncheon, Johnson did say he would have supported NAFTA, favored-nation status for China and the pending Korea-U.S. trade pact. Feingold uses quotes from that luncheon in his ad, including this one:.\n\n\"Yeah, I think history has proven if you really take a look at the economic statistics, free trade works, so I\u2019m definitely supportive.\"\n\nJohnson emphasized \"free and fair\" trade, something omitted from the ad.\n\nThe ad also quotes Johnson as saying:\n\n\"In a free market capitalist system, there are always winners and losers. It\u2019s creative destruction.\"\n\nThe ad leaves off the rest of the \"creative destruction\" quote: Johnson said the natural cycle of business births and deaths was unfortunate, \"but let\u2019s face it -- if it weren\u2019t for that we\u2019d still have buggy whip companies.\"\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nRuss Feingold uses Ron Johnson\u2019s own words to capture his rival\u2019s support for several trade deals that Feingold asserts cost the state some 64,000 jobs. The source of the analysis is not independent, as Feingold claims, but it uses numbers both sides agree are the best available -- and ones that may vastly understate the number of jobs lost. Nevertheless, those numbers leave out the other side of the equation -- jobs created through the deals. As for defining the deals as \"unfair,\" it is a characterization by Feingold that is disputed by Johnson.\n\nWe rate Feingold\u2019s claim Half True.", "Russ Feingold campaign TV ad, \"Creative Destruction,\" Sept. 30, 2010\n\nRuss Feingold campaign, radio ad, Creative Destruction, Sept. 30,2010\n\nU.S. Department of Labor website, Trade Adjustment Assistance defined\n\nWisPolitics.com luncheon, Ron Johnson remarks on trade, July 26, 2010\n\nPublic Citizen Global Trade Watch, Trade Adjustment Assistance database\n\nPublic Citizen, press release on campaign finance reform, July 31, 2010\n\nPublic Citizen, \"Lies, Damned Lies and Export Statistics,\"\n\nPublic Citizen, \"Department of Labor-Certified Trade-Related Job Loss\"\n\nE-mail interview, John Kraus, senior Feingold campaign strategist, Oct. 5, 2010\n\nE-mail interview, Evangelina Garcia, U.S. Labor Department spokesperson, Oct. 8, 2010\n\nE-mail interview, Todd Tucker, research director, Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch, Oct. 7-8\n\nE-mail and phone interviews, Travis McArthur, trade and finance researcher, Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch, Oct.5-6\n\nPeterson Institute for International Economics, paper on Trade Adjustment Assistance, Feb. 26, 2002\n\nEconomic Policy Institute, Revisiting NAFTA, Sept. 28, 2006\n\nU.S. Senate roll call vote, Uruguay round agreements, Dec. 1, 1994\n\nU.S. Senate roll call vote, NAFTA, Nov. 20, 1993\n\nU.S. Senate roll call vote, CAFTA, Nov. 20, 1993\n\nU.S. Senate roll call vote, GATT, June 30, 1993\n\nU.S. Senate roll call vote, China favored-nation status, Sept. 19, 2000", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
