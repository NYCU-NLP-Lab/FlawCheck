The timeline prompted some to ask whether Trump had really blamed Obama for leaving him faulty tests for a disease that did not yet exist.", "After COVID-19 was first detected in the U.S., something of a scandal broke out surrounding the failure to provide and coordinate widespread testing for the virus. This failure was the result of, as The New York Times reported, \"technical flaws, regulatory hurdles, business-as-usual bureaucracies and lack of leadership at multiple levels.\" Notably, diagnostic tests first sent out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were flawed.", "Fast forward to the end of April. During a White House meeting between Trump and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, CNN Reporter Jim Acosta asked Trump, \"Is it fair for the voters to take into consideration your handling of the pandemic when they assess whether to reelect you in the fall?\"", "Trump responded to this question with a mixture of praise for the response of his own administration and blame for the previous administration for failures, something he has done before.", "According to a White House transcript of the exchange, here is what Trump stated in regards to faulty tests:", "THE PRESIDENT: And you have to understand: When we took over, the cupboards were bare. And the thing that \u2014 frankly, it\u2019s not as tough as the ventilator situation. We\u2019re the king of ventilators. But what we have done is \u2014 on testing, we\u2019re doing numbers the likes of which nobody has ever seen before.", "And I told you, the President of South Korea, President Moon, called me to congratulate me on testing. And we did more tests than any other country anywhere in the world. And I think they told me yesterday a number \u2014 if you add up the rest of the world, we\u2019ve done more testing. And it\u2019s a higher quality test.", "So I think we\u2019ve done a \u2014 I think the whole team, federal government \u2014 we built hospitals for you and others.", "GOVERNOR MURPHY: You bet.", "THE PRESIDENT: We built medical centers. And I\u2019m talking about thousands and thousands of beds. Many, many medical centers. We had \u2014 as you know, we had the governor of Florida and the governor of Louisiana over the last two days. They could not have been \u2014 and one was a Democrat, and this gentleman happens to be a proud Democrat. They could not have been more supportive of the effort of the federal government.", "And I\u2019ll tell you, Jim \u2014", "Jim ACOSTA: But aren\u2019t you seeing massive lines for food?", "THE PRESIDENT: Let me just tell you, we have \u2014 we started off with empty cupboards.
