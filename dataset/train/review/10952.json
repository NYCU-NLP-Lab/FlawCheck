According to Woods' manager, the golf star suffered multiple leg injuries and was taken into surgery at an area hospital following the accident.", "According to an initial statement posted on social media by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, L.A. County firefighters used a tool called the \"Jaws of Life\" in the rescue, stating, \"Mr. Woods was extricated from the wreck with the 'jaws of life' by Los Angeles County firefighters and paramedics, then transported to a local hospital by ambulance for his injuries.\"", "But first responders later corrected the record to state firefighters used different tools, not the Jaws of Life, to pull Woods from the wreckage.", "In a joint news conference with L.A.
