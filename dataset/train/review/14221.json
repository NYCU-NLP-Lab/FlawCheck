This is because eating products made from soybeans, such as tofu, can increase the risk of memory loss, [resulting in Parkinson\u2019s disease].\u201d", "Parkinson\u2019s disease is a brain disorder that affects the nerve cells in the brain. Most of the early symptoms are physical, such as \"muscle rigidity, tremors, and changes in speech and gait\", as described by US-based health news website WebMD, but many also develop the common complication dementia, which can cause profound memory loss.", "A similar claim\u00a0was\u00a0also shared on Facebook here, here, and here.", "It was also published here on the website of the Thai Health Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth), a government agency that aims to \u201cenhance health promotive capability...to support health promotion movement in Thailand\u201d, in July 2008.", "The post\u2019s Thai headline reads: \u201cResearchers reveal!
