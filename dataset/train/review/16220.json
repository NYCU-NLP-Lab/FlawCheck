["About this rating", "On 28 November 2017, a woman named Tammy Day Cox shared a status update on Facebook that said her 15-year-old daughter Heaven Ray Cox had run away from her home in Orange County, Texas.", "Tammy Day Cox's post said:", "I have an update and it isn't good ... [An individual said] that Heaven had been talking to a grown man from California on Snapchat. Why he didn't feel it was important to tell me, I don't know, but it is what it is. The man she has been talking to is a predator, who has apparently been manipulating her for some time, and in her current state of mind, she believes that he is her friend. She left a goodbye note to me and her Dad, and said that she wouldn't have a phone, so I'm sure he has taken it from her, as it isn't here, and I have torn her room apart. She is off her meds and is in a manic phase of bipolar disorder. I am asking everyone to share this to their wall, and particularly those who live in California and every state between there and Texas. This man told her that he would be in San Antonio for Thanksgiving and that he would pick her up. Please share the following:", "NOVEMBER 28, 2017", "This is Heaven Ray Cox, a missing child.

Please share this with everyone you know on Facebook, but particularly those who live in California, or the states between Texas anf California.
