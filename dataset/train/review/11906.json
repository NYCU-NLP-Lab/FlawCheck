It evidently was deleted later that morning (screen grab).", "In a wee-hours tweet, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott presented a meme showing celebrated British statesman Winston Churchill saying: \"The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists.\"", "In his 1:10 a.m. Aug. 7, 2018 tweet, Abbott prefaced his citation of Churchill, who twice served as England\u2019s prime minister: \"Some insights are timeless.\" Why Abbott posted the quotation might be explained by the\u00a0headline on the meme above the purported Churchill quotation; it says: \"Churchill on the left wing.\"", "Later the same morning, multiple others--including Wes Wilson of Austin\u2019s KXAN TV news staff--responded on Twitter by asserting that Churchill didn\u2019t make the\u00a0statement shared by Abbott.", "Also, within 10 hours of the Abbott tweet's appearance, it was no longer posted. Abbott then told reporters, Patrick Svitek of the Texas Tribune reported, that it was irrelevant to him\u00a0\"who may or may not have said that in the past. I didn\u2019t want to be accused of plagiarism for saying it. If no one else said it, attribute the quote to me because it\u2019s what I believe in.\"", "Like other news organizations, meantime, we'd already started to\u00a0check the accuracy of\u00a0the quotation.", "Text down the left side of the Abbott-shared meme mentioned the\u00a09gag.com site, which TechCrunch, a technology news website, described in 2017 as \"a Hong Kong-based site that hosts and distributes funny pictures, videos and memes.\"", "We visited the site and\u00a0spotted the same Churchill meme under the headline: \"A reference to G20 Thought you might enjoy this quote.\" We didn\u2019t spot a posting date on the meme.

By email, Geiger also provided a copy of Churchill\u2019s July 27, 1943, speech about World War II and Italy to the House of Commons. In it, Churchill said: \"The keystone of the Fascist arch has crumbled, and, without attempting to prophesy, it does not seem unlikely that the entire Fascist edifice will fall to the ground in ruins, if it has not already so fallen. The totalitarian system of a single party, armed with secret police, engrossing to itself practically all the offices, even the humblest, under the Government, with magistrates and courts under the control of the executive, with its whole network of domestic spies and neighbourly informants \u2013 that system when applied over a long period of time, leaves the broad masses without any influence upon their country\u2019s destinies and without any independent figures apart from the official classes.\"", "Our ruling", "Abbott said that Churchill said, \"The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists.\"", "Abbott\u00a0drew the quotation from a gag website,it appears,\u00a0and neither he nor the site made available\u00a0factual backup.
