["By Sydney Schaedel", "Posted on June 30, 2017", "Q: Did the Supreme Court rule that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally can\u2019t sue anyone if they feel they\u2019ve been mistreated?", "A: No. That claim was made in a bogus story published on satirical and fake news websites.", "The Supreme Court has not ruled that \u201cillegal aliens \u2026 do not, in effect, possess the right to sue anyone in case they feel abused or mistreated.\u201d", "Versions of that bogus claim were made in posts on at least 12 websites in May and June.

President Trump wins this decision by a simple 5-4 majority voting [sic] along partisan lines.", "According to the The Politcal [sic] Tribune,\u00a0\u00a0the right-leaning Court one more time showed the United States that those illegal immigrants are first and foremost, illegal, hence should not have the same rights as natural born, or naturalized U.S. citizens.", "That implies if somebody\u2019s arrested, and appears to be illegal, he does not have the right to a federal nor a private attorney, nor to a speedy trial in America.", "Daily Insider News attributed the story to the Political Tribune, which picked it up from Conservative Nation, which sourced it to USA Politics Today.", "It\u2019s bogus. None of the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings this term\u00a0support the story\u2019s claims. Many of the websites that ran the story are repeat fake news offenders.", "We\u2019ve previously debunked posts on USAPoliticsToday.com, ConsNation.com and WashingtonFeed.com, to name a few.

Its \u201cabout us\u201d page says, \u201cFreedom Crossroads uses facts that don\u2019t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth. In fact, there is likely no truth at all in what you will read here.\u201d", "Some believed the made-up story, but others saw through it. One commenter on liberty-courier.com \u2014 which ran the story under the headline \u201cBREAKING: Supreme Court Reversal Gives Trump A HUGE Win Over Illegals! \u2014 wrote: \u201cNotice that there is no case cited, a dead giveaway that the story is fake. When have you ever seen a legitimate story on a SCOTUS ruling that doesn\u2019t name the case? Or at least touch on the points argued? The headline calls it a reversal. Reversal of what?

On June 26, the Supreme Court sent the case back to an appeals court, which made a mistake in its earlier decision, the high court ruled.", "Immigrants in the U.S. illegally do have the right to file lawsuits if they feel they\u2019ve been mistreated, legal experts told us.", "In an email to FactCheck.org, Sarah Paoletti, a practice professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Transnational Legal Clinic, wrote, \u201cAll immigrants, regardless of their legal status within the country, are entitled to equal access to the courts and the right to petition before the courts if their rights have been violated or are being threatened in any way.
