["About this rating", "On 3 March 2017, the web site USPOLN published an article which contained several quotes ostensibly uttered by Senator Paul Ryan, including one statement in which he supposedly asserted about birth control that \"If there was a legitimate way to have intercourse and not get pregnant, God would have included it in His holy books\":", "This article was framed as presenting portions of a discussion between Ryan and CNN host Jake Tapper, and the introductory paragraph replicated a legitimate exchange between Ryan and Tapper about health care reform and birth control that took place on 13 November 2016:", "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) refused to say if some women would lose access to birth control benefits after Republicans repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform law. The Wisconsin Republican promised during an interview on CNN that the repeal of Obamacare would lower the costs of health care by providing \u201cvouchers\u201d to poor Americans. CNN host Jake Tapper noted that many women were paying nothing for birth control thanks to an Affordable Care Act mandate. \u201cIs that going to end?\u201d he wondered. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to get into all the nitty-gritty details of these things,\u201d Ryan replied curly.", "The remainder of the article, however, was completely fabricated.", "For instance, Paul Ryan never said this:", "\u201cI\u2019m not a preacher, nor am I a holy man, but the fact to the matter is that Obamacare is bad for our economy, it\u2019s bad for Americans, both poor ones and ones who aren\u2019t, overall, it\u2019s a bad program and a bad piece of legislation and that\u2019s why it\u2019s gotta go,\u201d Ryan argued stubbornly, all the while ignoring the question. \u201cAnd if our biology allowed for a safe way to have intercourse, if we were meant to have intercourse completely naturally and not get pregnant because of it, then God would have included something about it in one of his Holy Books. Now, I haven\u2019t found anything on the subject \u2014 and not for lack of looking, Jake \u2014 have you, perhaps?\u201d", "Or this:", "\u201cNow, how would you feel, Jake, if someone were to take a huge chunk of your hard-earned money and use it to give something to someone you\u2019ve never met?\u201d Ryan asked the host. \u201cAnd the worst part is \u2014 nobody asked Americans whether or not they agree to their taxes being raised to help people they don\u2019t know, that very fact goes against the essence of capitalism. It\u2019s not effective and it\u2019s not efficient, which makes it the wrong solution from the start. That\u2019s why it needs to be repealed. The other part of the reason why women shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use birth control at all is the fact that, in doing so, they\u2019re committing murder and that goes against everything this country stands for.\u201d", "Ryan didn't say any of this during his CNN interview with Jake Tapper on 13 November 2016, or at any other time and place.", "USPOLN bills itself as a \"hybrid\" site that publishes a mixture of \"satire\" and real news, but unlike other hybrid sites such as Newslo, which allow users to click a button revealing which portions of articles are true and which are not, USPOLN provides readers with no mechanism for distinguishing between fact and fabrication.
