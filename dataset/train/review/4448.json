Peterson has said he grew up treated the same way by his parents.", "The Vikings pulled Peterson from the team\u2019s active roster while his case moves through the courts. During a Sept. 17 broadcast on ESPN\u2019s Mike and Mike, billionaire Donald Trump waded into the debate. While saying that he was never a \"spanker,\"\u00a0which is less severe than Peterson\u2019s offense, Trump said there\u2019s no simple response because many parents physically discipline their kids and they turn out \"good.\"", "\"It's a pretty tough thing because I saw something last night that much more than 50 percent of people out there and parents out there are spankers,\" Trump said.", "We thought it would be worthwhile to check if spanking is as common as Trump said.", "In large measure, the data says it is.", "A 2013 study by Columbia University researchers found that 57 percent of mothers and 40 percent of fathers engaged in spanking when children were age three, and 52 percent of mothers and 33 percent of fathers engaged in spanking at age five.", "Disadvantaged families represented a large share of the survey group but the results are consistent with other studies.", "A 1999 article in Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review reported that 72 percent of parents of children between the ages of two and four said they sometimes spanked their kids.

For the rest of the country, the fraction dropped to 41 percent.", "We should note that pediatricians as a group strongly discourage spanking. They cite evidence that ties it to behavioral problems and lower school performance. The spanking label covers a lot of ground. Some parents hit harder and more often than others.
