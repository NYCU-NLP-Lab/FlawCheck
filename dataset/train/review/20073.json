Anthony List, a political action committee that opposes abortion and supports anti-abortion candidates.", "The Susan B. Anthony List\u2019s numbers derive from Planned Parenthood\u2019s 2013-14 annual report.", "The first caveat to know\u00a0is that Planned Parenthood does not have a category for \"pregnancy services.\"\u00a0That\u2019s a category the Susan B. Anthony List created, and the background reasoning has been the same as similarly misleading\u00a0claims over the years.", "On the fact sheet, \"pregnancy services\" are broken down into three categories: abortions, prenatal care and adoption referrals. Susan B. Anthony List spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said these are the three ways a woman can respond to a pregnancy.", "With that in mind, here\u2019s the section from Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual report that contains those categories.", "To arrive at the Susan B. Anthony List figure, you have to tease out specific elements\u00a0from the chart:\u00a0prenatal services (18,684), adoption referrals (1,880) and abortions (327,653).\u00a0Abortions account for 94 percent of the sum of these subcategories.", "For several\u00a0reasons, that\u2019s a misleading way to analyze the data.", "Referrals for prenatal care not in equation", "Not all of Planned Parenthood approximately 700\u00a0clinics offer prenatal services because prenatal care is not Planned Parenthood's focus.\u00a0As a result,\u00a0many pregnant women are referred to outside obstetricians or other health providers for prenatal care.", "How many?

Planned Parenthood clinics saw 2.7 million individual patients that year.", "Of all services, abortions\u00a0account for 3 percent of services performed, said Erica Sackin, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, pointing to page 18 of the report.", "But looking at the share of abortions per patient (and\u00a0assuming one procedure per patient), the figure rises to\u00a012 percent.", "Some critics have taken issue with Planned Parenthood\u2019s measurement of \"services.\" Performing an abortion is more involved than administering pregnancy tests or giving someone a contraception kit, for example. The share of abortions might be different if cost or hours of services were used.
