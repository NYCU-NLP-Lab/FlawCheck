["In the battle of big numbers at the first presidential debate, Mitt Romney used one five times to attack President Barack Obama\u2019s energy policy: $90 billion.\n\nThat was the price tag of \"breaks to the green energy world\" Obama provided \"in one year,\" Romney said.\n\nLater, he elaborated the president had put that money \"into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1.\"\n\nSo, tens of billions funneled from the Obama administration to troubled companies for alternative energy \u2014\u00a0in one year. Really?\n\nWe asked the Romney campaign about that $90 billion.\n\nFive times\n\nThe number appears in a 2010 report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers on the American Recovery And Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus bill.\n\nAccording to the report, $90 billion is the amount of money in the Obama law for \"clean energy investments.\"\n\nHere\u2019s how Romney used the number in the debate.\n\nObama had attacked $4 billion a year in \"corporate welfare\" for the oil industry. \u00a0\n\n(His proposed 2013 budget called for removing a handful of \"tax provisions that preferentially benefit fossil fuel production.\" PolitiFact Ohio reported that the nonpartisan taxpayer watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense estimates the U.S. tax code currently contains about $5 billion in yearly tax breaks that are exclusive to the oil and gas industry.)\n\nRomney fired back:", "So, Romney contrasted a \"tax break\" of a few billion for oil companies with \"breaks\" worth tens of billions for \"green energy.\" Later in the debate, he got more specific:", "Finally, Romney drove home the number, repeating it three more times, and linking it to companies who have \"gone out of business.\"", "It\u2019s fair to say that listeners may have gotten the impression that Obama gave $90 billion in tax breaks in a single year to companies for alternative energy like solar and wind, many of which didn\u2019t fare well.\n\n \u2018One year\u2019 of \u2018breaks\u2019\n\nBack to that report about stimulus spending on clean energy.\n\nWere there $90 billion in \"breaks\"? Perhaps in a generic sense, as in \u2014 some folks caught a break by taking advantage of government spending. But not so much if Romney meant \"tax breaks\" like those for oil and gas.\n\nRather, the money was distributed in six different ways: private and public matching grants, tax credits, loan guarantees, direct loans and interest subsidies. Tax benefits were part of the package, but so were very different kinds of spending.\n\n\"The vast majority of the $90 billion for green energy weren't tax breaks,\" said Michael Grabell, a reporter for Pulitzer-winning site ProPublica who published a book this year on stimulus spending, Money Well Spent?\n\nMeanwhile, the money would have been distributed over longer than one year, depending on the program. Some money \u2014\u00a0such as for high-speed rail \u2014\u00a0states still have a few years to spend, Grabell said. Weatherization projects, among the quicker programs, took two or three years. The loan guarantee program through the Department of Energy, which benefitted troubled solar panel maker Solyndra, focused on projects through September 2011.\n\nSo, Romney is off in two respects. They are not just tax breaks and they are not just for one year.\n\n \u2018Solar and wind ... Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ll assume Romney meant \"solar and wind\" and \"Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1,\" as merely examples of Obama\u2019s $90 billion in green energy spending in the stimulus.\n\nBut even as examples, they\u2019re problematic. \"Solar and wind\" investments represented comparatively small parts of the $90 billion.\n\nSolar-panel manufacturer Solyndra and electric-battery maker Ener1, which got stimulus-backed help, qualified for less than $700 million in grants and loan guarantees, and didn\u2019t use it all.\n\nFisker and Tesla \u2014 troubled electric-car companies that got loan guarantees funded with money appropriated under President George W.Bush \u2014 had nothing at all to do with the $90 billion.\n\nSo, just what did make up the $90 billion?\n\nThe Council of Economic Advisers report cited by the Romney campaign breaks the spending into eight categories. Here\u2019s the majority of it:", "That\u2019s more than 60 percent of the $90 billion Romney\u2019s campaign said he was talking about. Much of it funneled through state and local governments to contractors for specific projects, rather than as breaks directly for companies.\n\nLess than 40 percent of the $90 billion included was for things such as the installation of wind turbines and solar panels, supporting American manufacturing of advanced batteries and other advanced vehicle technology, research and development of clean coal technology and a few billion in tax credits for alternative energy.\n\nThose investments are more in line with Romney\u2019s characterization. But they represent less than half the \"$90 billion\" he repeatedly mentioned.\n\nWhy does it matter if Romney mischaracterized how the money was used, as long as it went to clean energy? He draws a conclusion about winners and losers, and says, \"and these businesses, many of them have gone out of business.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a claim that our colleagues at FactCheck.org addressed this week, pointing out that might be true of companies that got loan guarantees in a single year \u2014\u00a0a sliver of a sliver of the money that Romney\u2019s talking about. But less than 12 percent of the 26 companies that ultimately benefited from the program filed for bankruptcy, FactCheck.org reported.\n\nAnd the entire loan guarantee program represented just a few billion of the $90 billion investment outlined by the Council of Economic Advisors.\n\n\"A very small percentage of all the companies that benefited from the $90 billion in green job spending have gone out of business,\" said Grabell, the author of Money Well Spent? \"Not half of them. Not even half of the loan guarantees. \"\n\n Our ruling\n\nRomney used the number \"$90 billion\" five times in the first presidential debate, claiming, \"In one year, (Obama) provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world \u2026 into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1.\"\n\nThat is incorrect in several ways. That $90 billion, as described in a report provided by the Romney campaign, wasn\u2019t provided in one year, wasn\u2019t distributed primarily via tax breaks, wasn\u2019t primarily provided directly to companies, wasn\u2019t primarily spent on solar and wind, and wasn\u2019t spent at all on Fisker or Tesla.\n\nIn reality, more than 60 percent of it was directed to state and local governments and utility companies for energy efficiency, transportation and electrical infrastructure .\n\nWe rate his claim False.", "CQ Newsmaker Transcripts, \"President Obama and Republican Presidential Nominee Mitt Romney Participate in the First Presidential Candidates Debate at the University of Denver,\" Oct. 3, 2012 (subscription only)\n\nEmail interview with Robert Terra, Romney campaign, Oct. 4, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Kara Carscaden, Obama campaign, Oct. 4, 2012\n\nInterview with Michael Grabell, reporter, ProPublica, author, \"Money Well Spent?\" Oct. 5, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Jonathan Rothwell, senior research associate & associate fellow, Metropolitan Policy Program, Brookings Institution, Oct. 4, 2012\n\nExecutive Office of the President, Council of Economic Advisers, \"The Economic Impact Of The American Recovery And Reinvestment Act Of 2009Fourth Quarterly Report,\" July 14, 2010\n\nDepartment of Energy Loan Programs Office, \"The Financing Force Behind America\u2019s Clean Energy Economy,\" accessed Oct. 5, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, \"Bill Johnson says subsidies for the oil companies that Barack Obama has attacked don't exist,\" May 4, 2012 (False)\n\nBloomberg, \"Ener1 Joins Solyndra as Troubled Recipients of U.S. Government Aid,\" Nov. 1, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, \"Did the program that funded the Solyndra loan start under George W.
