The tensions, reported by local media here and here, have resulted in some legislators being de-whipped over what has been described as \u201cindiscipline and party disloyalty\u201d.", "\u201cIn the Kenyan situation, politics is becoming divisive and intense and it is these political factions that are fighting and using the spaces to spread propaganda,\u201d Rapuro said.", "The Daily Nation\u2019s managing editor Pamela Sittoni also noted the fake front pages seemed part of a political campaign \u201cbecause of the individuals whose names and pictures are being used\u201d.", "Made to look genuine", "The doctored front pages used fonts, colours and layouts identical to the genuine ones. Only the splash story (the main headline) was altered while the other stories appearing on the front page that day remained unchanged.", "\u201cIf you look at the front pages that have been produced, they are fairly believable. So it is very easy for someone who does not have a good knowledge of fakes to believe that that is a fake edition of the paper,\u201d Paul Ilado, the head of content at Radio Africa Group which owns the Star newspaper, told AFP Fact Check.", "The doctored headlines allege that the accounts of Kenya\u2019s deputy leader had been frozen as part of a bribery probe and his wife had gone into hiding, while lawmaker Moses Kuria was accused of trying to hammer out secret political deals.", "AFP Fact Check has found no official evidence of Ruto currently being investigated.

They have existed in the social media grapevine but have never been verified and so for banter, rumour and gossip they make very good fodder. However, if you are looking for news, it is not news because it is not verifiable and you can see it is all made up as there is no proof behind it,\u201d Shiundu told AFP.", "Media battling the trend", "Manipulation of media content to score political points is a common trend in Kenya. During the 2017 general election, doctored front pages of the Daily Nation claimed a candidate vying for the gubernatorial seat had defected from his party. The claim, which was also circulated as a print edition in a county in western Kenya, aimed to hurt the candidate\u2019s popularity.", "The Daily Nation flatly disowned the altered frontpage.", "\u201cThat was a classic disinformation move to make sure that the candidate did not get a political win. The motive was to delegitimise the politician and sow confusion in the public space so that the voters wouldn\u2019t know what is true and what is false,\u201d Africa Check\u2019s Shiundu commented.", "Legal action", "Media organisations in Kenya are now stamping doctored publications with \u201cfake news\u201d labels and sharing them on their respective social media platforms in a bid to counter widely circulated claims which tend to be confusing to the audience.", "Readers are also encouraged to seek information only on the newspapers' official website and social media accounts,\u00a0where front pages are normally shared.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
