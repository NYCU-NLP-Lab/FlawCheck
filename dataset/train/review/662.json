["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Former Space Coast Rep. Dave Weldon wants to debate the front-runner in the GOP primary for Florida\u2019s U.S. Senate seat, Rep. Connie Mack IV.\n\nMack, riding high in the polls with enviable name recognition, isn\u2019t game.\u00a0So in an unusual yet entertaining move, Weldon created his own six-minute debate\u00a0with Mack and posted it on his website.\n\nThough Mack\u2019s responses were phony, Weldon used the \"debate\" to talk up his social conservative credentials.\n\nModerator: \"The government has been paying for stem cell research despite majority opposition. Mr. Mack?\"\n\nFake Mack: \"HUH?!?\"\n\nModerator: \"Okay, I see you voted for more spending. Dr. Weldon?\"\n\nWeldon: \"The truth is, research into embryonic stem cells is not only immoral but scientifically it has proven to be a dead end, with no one good example of a successful treatment.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Mack has differed from fellow Republicans on the issue. Mack voted in favor of bills that would have expanded federal research on embryonic stem cells beyond limitations set by an executive order from President George W. Bush.\n\nBush vetoed the bills Mack supported, but President Barack Obama kept his promise\u00a0to lift Bush\u2019s restrictions that federal money not be used for research on embryonic stem cell lines created before 2001. Obama in 2009 talked of \"broad agreement in the scientific community that the research should be supported by federal funds.\"\n\nWith that background in mind, we wanted to check Weldon\u2019s claim that embryonic stem cell research \"has proven to be a dead end, with no one good example of a successful treatment.\" We should note that Weldon is an internist and a practicing physician.\n\nEmbryonic stem cell research involves experiments on live embryos obtained through extra eggs of in vitro fertilization patients, who must sign consent forms allowing for experimentation. These eggs were not fertilized inside of the women\u2019s body, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nResearch on human, non-embryonic stem cells is older and less controversial. The key difference is embryonic stem cells can become all cells of the body, while adult stem cells are limited to the cells of their original tissue.\n\nWeldon obviously disagrees, arguing the research is an affront to the sanctity of life because embryos are destroyed in the process. Proponents of expanding embryonic stem cell research say these embryos would be discarded anyway, and it\u2019s worthwhile to explore more uses for embryonic stem cells.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health spent about $123 million on research involving human embryonic stem cells in the fiscal year ending in 2011, according to the NIH. The government spends more on other areas in this field, doling out $620 million in 2011 for non-human, non-embryonic stem cell research and $395 million on human non-embryonic work.\n\nThe National Academies of Science has also issued guidelines for stem cell research. In its 2008 revision\u00a0of stem cell research guidelines, it noted that \"it is far from clear at this point which cell types will prove to be the most useful for regenerative medicine, and it is likely that each will have some utility.\"\n\nOne group that doesn\u2019t think embryonic stem cell research is at a \"dead end\" is the Genetics Policy Institute, which will host the World Stem Cell Summit\u00a0in West Palm Beach, in December 2012.\n\nThe first isolation of embryonic stem cells happened just 14 years ago, said Bernard Siegel, the advocacy group\u2019s executive director. It\u2019s a huge discovery -- akin to \"nuclear fission in a petri dish\" -- that will take time for scientists to unravel, he said.\n\n\"I would say the United States could be much further along without opposition to stem cell research, and certainly Dave Weldon is a prime example of someone who has put the brakes on promising research,\" Siegel said.\n\nA website for which Siegel is a spokesman, StemCellAction.org, lists \"recent advances\" in embryonic stem cell research across the globe. Yes, he said, Weldon is right that no successful treatments have emerged from these cells, but that perspective dismisses multiple research efforts\u00a0across the world.\n\n\" \u2018Treatment\u2019 means something that has gone through an approved clinical trial,\" Siegel said. \"And in fact, one of our very first approved clinical trials is going on now.\"\n\nThat trial\u00a0involves macular degeneration, which leads to blindness. A preliminary report\u00a0released in January 2012 described improved vision for two legally blind patients through therapy using human embryonic stem cells. While the New York Times\u00a0noted a few problems with the report, it was welcome news to proponents who were discouraged after the Geron Corporation called off the world\u2019s first clinical trial around embryonic stem cells.\n\nIn announcing the end\u00a0of its trial, which aimed to treat spinal cord injury, Geron said the company wanted to focus on cancer therapy experiments that were further along, and that it had not lost hope for the embryonic stem cell field.\n\nMany scientists and politicians are hopeful about a recent development\u00a0that may quell questions of morality. The technique reprograms skin stem cells with embryonic qualities without destroying an embryo. However, the resulting cells are not free of complications, and some studies show they may increase the risk of cancer.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of potential for them,\" said Stephen Duncan, director of stem cell biology at the Medical College of Wisconsin. \"But human embryonic stem cells are the gold standard.\"\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin developmental biologist James Thomson -- whose research team was first to derive embryonic stem cell lines from human embryos in 1998 -- was among researchers who in 2007 discovered the reprogrammable cells. Even with the discovery, he said it was not time\u00a0to stop researching embryonic stem cells.\n\nThousands of stem cell researchers assembled in Yokohama, Japan, for the annual conference\u00a0of the International Society for Stem Cell Research in June 2012, including Lawrence Goldstein. Goldstein is one of the society\u2019s board members and director of the stem cell program at the University of California, San Diego.\n\n\"I wouldn\u2019t be doing this if I thought it was a dead end,\" he said, referring to his own research that aims to develop a therapy for ALS, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. \"The (academic) papers are not saying \u2018we\u2019re closing this area down because there are no interesting scientific leads.\u2019 In fact, the area fuels research on embryonic stem cells and reprogrammed stem cell research. The area (Weldon) would support would be going more slowly without the work on embryonic.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nWeldon\u2019s synopsis of embryonic stem cell research as at a scientific \"dead end\" does not appear to be widely shared by scientists. Research is ongoing, and scientists say it\u2019s too early to call it quits on a discovery made in 1998.\n\nWeldon\u2019s second point about there being \"no one good successful treatment\" from embryonic stem cell research is accurate, though scientists say it is premature and unrealistic given the field\u2019s bureaucratic constraints.\n\nOn the whole, we rate this statement Mostly False.", "YouTube.com, \"What would the debate look like?
