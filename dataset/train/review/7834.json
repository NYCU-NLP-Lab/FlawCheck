Since the time I was born, from the last 40 years, Thackeray and Pawar family had cordial relations. Hence for us, it\u2019s not just a loss of Maharastra\u2019s or a country\u2019s leader, it\u2019s a personal loss to the family. We surely might have had ideological differences but my father friendship with Balasaheb has been going-on from many years. Thus, it\u2019s a big personal loss for us. (-translated)\u201d", "We also found a 2013 interview of Sanjeevan Karandikar, the sister of Bal Thackeray. At 1:20 mins in the News 18 Lokmat interview, she can be heard saying that when their sister had passed away, Balasaheb had said to her that now only two of us are left. Mrs Karandikar later grieves that when Balasaheb died she said to herself that she is alone now. In the interview, she refers to four elder sisters, two elder brothers and one younger brother excluding herself. Hence, her elder sister Sudha Sule is no more.", "Furthermore, Alt News contacted journalist Dhaval Kulkarni, who penned the book: \u201cThe Cousins Thackeray: Uddhav, Raj and the Shadow of their Senas\u201d, regarding the claim viral on social media. Rubbishing the claim, He said, \u201cBalasaheb had six sisters, of which five were elder to him. However, of Prabhodhankar Thackeray\u2019s 10 children, only one survives. Namely, Sanjeevani Karandikar, who is 80+. His eldest sister\u2019s name was Sudha Sule, but she is not Supriya\u2019s mother in law. I have double-checked this with the family\u201d.", "In a conversation with Alt News, Shiv Sena\u2019s deputy leader Priyanka Chaturvedi also refuted the claim and took a jibe at the opposition by saying, \u201cThis is absolutely incorrect and not true. In the past few days, we have seen how Shiv Sena has been the target of fake propaganda, which clearly points to an agenda of our opponents. They are clearly rattled with the coming together of Maha Vikas Aghadi that thwarted them from an attempt to subvert the constitution and democracy as we know it\u201d.", "Thus, the claim that NCP leader Supriya Sule\u2019s mother-in-law is the sister of Bal Thackeray is false. The name of Supriya Sule\u2019s mother-in-law is Anne Sule and not Sudha Sule as claimed on social media.", "Donate Now", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
