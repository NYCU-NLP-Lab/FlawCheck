["By Robert Farley", "Posted on September 28, 2018", "President Donald Trump wrongly said that \u201cnobody from this country knew\u201d about Mexico\u2019s value-added tax until after NAFTA was signed. A deputy U.S. trade representative at the time NAFTA was put in place said: \u201cUS policymakers, embassy officials and tax authorities were fully aware of Mexico\u2019s VAT system.\u201d", "The president also claimed that the VAT tax put the U.S. \u201c16 points behind, before we even started.\u201d The former trade representative, as well as several economists and\u00a0tax experts, told us the VAT is not a trade barrier, as it is charged on goods imported into Mexico as well as on products made and sold within Mexico.", "Trump has repeatedly claimed as president, and as a candidate, that he views Mexico\u2019s VAT tax as a \u201chidden tax\u201d that puts U.S. exporters at a disadvantage.", "In his Sept. 26 press conference at the United Nations, Trump reiterated that claim, and added that NAFTA negotiators in the early 1990s were duped.", "\u201cNAFTA was a defective deal the day it was signed. You know why? Because they had a VAT tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd by the time they found out, which was about a week later, nobody went and changed it. So you went many years and they never changed it. There was a VAT tax that Mexico got. So we were 17 or 16 points behind, before we even started. NAFTA was a horrible thing.\u201d", "A value-added tax or VAT is \u201ca consumption tax\u00a0placed on a product whenever value is added at each stage of the supply chain, from production to the point of sale. The amount of VAT that the user pays is on the cost of the product, less any of the costs of materials used in the product that have already been taxed,\u201d according to Investopedia. And Mexico does indeed have a 16 percent VAT.", "It\u2019s \u201cfactually inaccurate\u201d for Trump to say \u201cnobody from this country\u201d knew about Mexico\u2019s VAT and that they didn\u2019t find out until \u201cabout a week later,\u201d said\u00a0Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a business organization.", "\u201cUS policymakers, embassy officials and tax authorities were fully aware of Mexico\u2019s VAT system and other aspects of its tax system,\u201d Yerxa told us via email.", "Yerxa was deputy U.S. trade representative in Geneva under President George H.W. Bush during the initial NAFTA negotiations. He took over as Washington deputy after Bill Clinton was elected president, and became the chief negotiator for the NAFTA side agreements. He also led the USTR effort to get the implementation legislation through Congress.", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that they weren\u2019t aware of it. They knew about it,\u201d Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told us. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t think of it as a trade disadvantage, therefore it was not subject to negotiations.\u201d", "An economic plan released by the Trump campaign in September 2016, and penned by Peter Navarro, now a White House trade adviser, and Wilbur Ross, now secretary of commerce, argued that it is a trade barrier. Because goods imported from the U.S. to Mexico are subject to the VAT, they argued, this \u201cturns the VAT into an implicit tariff on US exporters.\u201d", "Navarro and Ross, Sept. 29, 2016: Here is the key unequal tax treatment issue: While the US operates primarily on an income tax system, all of America\u2019s major trading partners depend heavily on a \u201cvalue-added tax\u201d or VAT system. Under current rules, the WTO allows America\u2019s trading partners to effectively create backdoor tariffs to block American exports and backdoor subsidies to penetrate US markets. \u2026", "Under WTO rules, any foreign company that manufactures domestically and exports goods to America (or elsewhere) receives a rebate on the VAT it has paid. This turns the VAT into an implicit export subsidy.", "At the same time, the VAT is imposed on all goods that are imported and consumed domestically so that a product exported by the US to a VAT country is subject to the VAT. This turns the VAT into an implicit tariff on US exporters over and above the US corporate income taxes they must pay.", "The two argued that Mexico \u201cshrewdly exploited the VAT backdoor tariff to further its competitive advantage,\u201d increasing its VAT from 10 percent to 15 percent \u201cshortly after the NAFTA agreement was signed in 1993.\u201d", "Several economists and tax experts, however, told us Mexico\u2019s VAT is not a trade barrier.", "\u201cIt is important to emphasize the Mexican VAT applies equally to domestic and imported products,\u201d Yerxa told us. \u201cIt is not a discriminatory tax on imported products. It is trade neutral. It is similar to the VAT taxes that the European countries, Japan and many others maintain. They are basically consistent with international trade rules. The US does not have a VAT at the national level, but we do have state sales taxes and federal excise taxes, that also apply to imported products from NAFTA countries (as well as domestic products).\u201d", "\u201cThis is one of those zombie ideas that never dies,\u201d Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, told us back in June. \u201cThe structure of value-added taxes (VATs) and the fact that they are \u2018adjusted at the border\u2019\u2014that is, the tax is imposed on imports and rebated on exports \u2014 does not distort trade flows. In fact, VATs are designed to be neutral to trade. They tax domestic consumption, not production. So the tax is imposed uniformly on goods consumed domestically regardless of where the goods are produced.\u201d", "In an article published during the presidential campaign, Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, wrote that Trump was \u201csimply wrong\u201d when he claimed that Mexico\u2019s VAT \u201cgives its producers an advantage over American competitors.\u201d", "\u201cA VAT is meant to be a tax on consumption,\u201d Toder said. \u201cMexicans pay the same Mexican VAT on taxable goods and services they buy in Mexico no matter where they are produced. At the same time, no Mexican VAT is imposed on goods or services consumed outside of Mexico, regardless of where they are produced.\u201d Therefore, it provides no \u201cleg up\u201d over U.S. importers, he said.", "Toder noted that while the U.S. has no national sales tax, it does impose \u201cfederal excise taxes on goods such as tobacco products, alcoholic beverages, and motor fuels.\u201d Those excise taxes are treated the same way other countries treat their VAT.\u00a0 \u201cThe cigarette excise tax, for example, applies to imported cigarettes, but not those exported by U.S. tobacco companies,\u201d Toder wrote. \u201cState retail sales taxes in the United States work the same way: They apply to domestic consumption of taxed products from all sources, but not to exports.\u201d", "\u201cNo, Mexico\u2019s VAT is not an unfair trade barrier,\u201d Alan Deardorff, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, told us via email in June. \u201cIt is a tax that they charge on value added (the value of the output minus the value of any purchased inputs), and they charge it on everything, whether it is produced in Mexico or abroad. But it\u2019s only charged if the product remains in Mexico. It is rebated on goods that are exported. So it is not a discriminatory tax, since it is charged both on imports and on domestic production.\u201d", "In fact, Hufbauer told us, if the U.S. were to negotiate an elimination of the VAT on goods imported into Mexico, that would put Mexican producers at a competitive disadvantage, because they\u2019d still have to pay the VAT on goods made and sold domestically.", "In an interview with CNBC in March 2017, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said the administration would use the renegotiation of NAFTA as \u201ca partial means of addressing\u201d what it believes is an unfair advantage for Mexico due to the VAT.", "Yerxa said the renegotiated trade agreement with Mexico doesn\u2019t change the rules with respect to the VAT. The Trump administration is expected to publish the text of the trade deal with Mexico on Sept. 28.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
