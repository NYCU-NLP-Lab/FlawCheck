Joni Ernst in November\u2019s general election, has made her refusal of corporate political action committee (PAC) money a major part of her campaign.

Those filings, covering donations through March 31, show that Greenfield had received $62,100 from Democratic Party committees and $418,512 from other PACs, including Democratic leadership PACs.", "Corporate PACs are committees made up of employees of a specific corporation and funded by contributions from those employees.

He says the PAC money ties Greenfield to special interests,even if it isn\u2019t directly from corporate committees. Mauro hasn\u2019t taken money from any PACs in the primary race according to FEC filings, and his funding comes from individual donations and self-funding.", "\"That leadership PAC money that she gets is full of pharmaceutical money, of fossil fuel money, of big ag money, and all kinds of money,\" Mauro said in the Democratic Primary candidates\u2019 debate on May 18.", "Greenfield has received donations from 34 leadership PACs totalling $252,300 according to FEC filings, and many of them have in turn received donations from corporate PACs.", "Blue Hen PAC, associated with Sen.

Elaine Luria, D-Va.", "Still, Greenfield is accurate when she says she hasn\u2019t taken corporate PAC money. She hasn\u2019t taken donations directly from corporations. Advocates for campaign finance reform and Greenfield\u2019s campaign argue that that\u2019s an important distinction.", "\"Corporate PACs are a specific designation under the FEC that in practice only exist for corporate special interests to gain influence.

FEC, a 2010 Supreme Court case that allowed corporations more freedom to influence elections.", "End Citizens United encourages candidates to pledge not to take corporate PAC money, which Greenfield was referencing in the debate. Patrick Burgwinkle, communications director for End Citizens United, said taking leadership PACs does not violate that pledge.", "Burgwinkle said the separation between corporations and leadership PAC money recipients means the corporations don\u2019t have the same influence over candidates that they would have had they donated directly.", "\"If AT&T gave money to a senator, and then that senator turns around and gives money to Theresa Greenfield, AT&T hasn't gotten any access or influence over Theresa Greenfield,\" he said.", "The candidate may feel indebted to that particular senator, but a leadership PAC donation doesn\u2019t grant the same access to a candidate that a direct corporate PAC donation does.", "Eleanor Powell, an associate professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, agreed, saying leadership PAC contributions don\u2019t grant the same access that corporate PACs do.\u00a0 Still, leadership PAC donations are a grey area in campaign finance, she said.", "\"It\u2019s hard to have hard and fast true-false evaluation, given the messiness of modern American campaign finance law,\" she said. \"Our system isn\u2019t really well set up to make these really clear distinctions ...
