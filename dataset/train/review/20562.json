["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on April 19, 2019", "A popular meme takes aim at prominent lawmakers by referencing the number of bills they\u2019ve had passed. But it uses an erroneous number \u2014 and omits context.", "A post shared by thousands of Facebook users criticizes three well-known members of Congress by citing an incorrect and out-of-context figure to question their legislative effectiveness.", "\u201c67 combined years \u2026 6 bills passed,\u201d the viral meme reads, above photos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Maxine Waters, who are both Democrats, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is running\u00a0for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.", "The meme leaves the impression that the lawmakers, combined, have only had \u201c6 bills passed.\u201d That\u2019s wrong.", "Pelosi, for example, was the primary sponsor of seven pieces of legislation that were enacted, according to GovTrack.us, a website that profiles members of Congress and tracks the status of legislation. That includes major legislation, such as the\u00a0Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, as well as commemorative resolutions, such as naming of a post office.", "Waters and Sanders sponsored five and seven bills, respectively, that became law.\u00a0All three were co-sponsors on many more bills that became law, GovTrack\u2019s data show. Pelosi co-sponsored 414 successful bills; Sanders, 216; Waters, 329.", "(We note that GovTrack totals include resolutions as well as measures that were incorporated in other bills that became law.)", "Voters are free to\u00a0make their own judgments about lawmakers. However, Alan Wiseman, co-director of the Center for Effective Lawmaking, said in an interview that\u00a0measuring lawmakers\u2019 effectiveness solely on bills being enacted isn\u2019t \u201can informative argument.\u201d", "That\u2019s in part because the majority of bills introduced do not get signed into law.", "Wiseman, who also\u00a0chairs the political science department at Vanderbilt University, told FactCheck.org that, between\u00a01973 and 2018, approximately 3.7 percent of all public bills that were introduced in the House became law. For that same time period in the Senate, 4.1 percent of public bills introduced were enacted. (Public bills include\u00a0only House bills (H.R.) and Senate bills (S.) \u2014 not resolutions.)", "The Center for Effective Lawmaking has developed an online tool that uses\u00a0Library of Congress data to gauge lawmakers\u2019 effectiveness. Each member is assigned an effectiveness \u201cscore\u201d in each Congress against a \u201cbenchmark\u201d of what is predicted for a member in the same party with similar experience (such as the same number of terms served and committee or subcommittee chair status). Committee leadership positions, and whether a member is in the majority or minority party, can affect a lawmaker\u2019s ultimate effectiveness, Wiseman said, and legislators typically become more effective over time.", "The center\u2019s scores are calculated considering only public bills\u00a0sponsored by the respective member. The calculation weighs each bill\u2019s significance and not only its introduction and passage, but other milestones in the legislative process, including \u201caction in\u201d and \u201caction beyond\u201d committee. Wiseman said those steps can be meaningful in providing an issue exposure and helping to shape the legislative agenda, even if a bill isn\u2019t passed.", "While the system does not assign aggregate scores to any member, a review of the ratings shows that Pelosi, Waters and Sanders have all fluctuated throughout their terms in Congress \u2014 at times below, on par with, or above expectations.", "Pelosi, for example, rated \u201cabove expectations\u201d during her service from 1989 through 1996 and then dropped \u201cbelow expectations\u201d until the mid-2000s. Her performance in 2007 and 2008, while she was House speaker, surpassed expectations and then dropped again in subsequent years, according to the center\u2019s analysis. But Wiseman noted that Pelosi\u2019s inclusion in Democratic leadership \u2014 serving as\u00a0minority whip, minority leader and House speaker \u2014 meant her focus was not necessarily on introducing her own bills.", "Pelosi served as House speaker from January 2007 to January 2011, and became speaker again in January.", "\u201cEarly in her career, she was extremely successful at moving her legislative agenda through the process,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIn the late \u201990s \u2026 she started shifting away from advancing her own agenda to more [party leadership] tasks.\u201d", "As for their years in office, Pelosi, Sanders and Waters have been in Congress longer than \u201c67 combined years,\u201d as the meme says. Pelosi has served since 1987, and Sanders and Waters first took office in the House in 1991. (Sanders was a representative before becoming a senator in 2007.) Collectively, the three have 88 years of service in Congress.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Enacted legislation sponsored by Sen.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
