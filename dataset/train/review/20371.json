She has heard stories from me and my life as an officer. I\u2019m her inspiration behind the book. I have guided her but she has written the book by adding her own imagination. It is a work of fiction.\u201d", "When asked if he has co-authored the book, Kohli said, \u201cThe story is inspired by me and my life experiences but the book is written by my daughter which is why the author note mentions her name. My involvement in the book has been duly acknowledged. Now whether someone wants to term it is as \u2018co-author\u2019 is up to them.\u201d", "Union Minister Jitendra Singh and news agencies ANI and PTI, therefore, falsely claimed that the book is about Article 370. Moreover, none of them mentioned that the book is a work of fiction.", "As mentioned earlier in the article, ANI wrote that Ayanna travelled for two months across the country and found that Article 370 has been celebrated by each Indian.
