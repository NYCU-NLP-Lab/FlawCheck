["U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill December 12, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Al Drago/Getty Images)", "Calling for restrictions under the state\u2019s stay-at-home order to be relaxed\u00a0in his west-central Illinois district, U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood claimed Chicago accounts for the vast majority of the state\u2019s COVID-19 cases.", "\"Peoria is not like Chicago,\" LaHood told a CBS affiliate in Peoria. \"93% of the cases in the state of Illinois have come from Chicago \u2026 There has to be a tiered system, a more measured and a balanced approach.\"", "LaHood, a Republican who represents Illinois\u2019 18th Congressional District, which includes Peoria, made those remarks May 1 after Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker acknowledged some regions may be ready to reopen sooner than others depending on when they pass their peak.", "While there\u2019s no doubt major urban centers with large, concentrated populations have seen a higher number of confirmed positive cases, LaHood\u2019s figure for Chicago \u2014 where about 20% of the state\u2019s 12.7 million residents reside \u2014 seemed improbably high.", "On the day he made his claim, the number of cases in Chicago had reached 22,700, about 40% of the state\u2019s 56,000 cases at the time, according to data from the Illinois Department of Public Health. Chicago\u2019s share of the total hasn\u2019t varied much in the days since, the same dataset shows. LaHood\u2019s own Peoria County has seen just 148 positive cases.", "Debates over how and when to resume different kinds of business and other activities have raged across states as the nation continues to confront both a rising death toll and historic surges in unemployment.", "Pritzker has since released a plan to gradually reopen Illinois that divides the state into four regions. None of the counties LaHood represents are included in the same region as Chicago. Some businesses, such as restaurants, would not open anywhere until the end of June at the earliest under the plan. LaHood said it\u2019s \"unrealistic\" for Downstate regions to wait that long.", "When we asked LaHood\u2019s office for evidence of his claim, a spokesperson indicated LaHood was referencing an area that included Chicago and the northern part of the state.", "\"Northern or upstate IL and Chicago, as of last week, accounted for approximately 93% of the cases, and \u2018Northern\u2019 was inadvertently left out during the interview,\" a spokesman wrote in an email.", "Asked if LaHood misspoke when he cited Chicago instead of \"upstate\" or \"northern\" Illinois, we got no response.", "Had LaHood referred to counties in northern Illinois that include the Chicago metropolitan region, he would have found himself on much firmer ground. The vast majority of the state\u2019s cases have occurred in Cook County and the five counties that surround it: DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will. Together, those six counties are home to about two-thirds of Illinois residents but accounted for 90% of the state\u2019s COVID-19 cases as of May 13.", "It\u2019s common for residents outside of the Chicagoland area to refer to the significantly larger and more populous northeastern region collectively as \"Chicago,\" according to state political experts. But they said the inaccuracy reinforces regional stereotypes.", "\"If you\u2019re already disposed to think of things as us versus them, then that\u2019s reinforcing that narrative,\" said Kent Redfield, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois Springfield. \"But it\u2019s not precise, it\u2019s not accurate \u2026 If you\u2019re referring to northeastern Illinois, then be specific about what you\u2019re referring to.\"", "Our ruling", "LaHood said 93% of COVID-19 cases in Illinois \"have come from Chicago.\"", "Confirmed cases in Illinois\u2019 largest city account for less than half of the state\u2019s total cases, public health data show. That\u2019s far from the figure LaHood cited during his TV appearance.", "LaHood\u2019s spokesperson said he was referring to the northern region of the state more broadly, but experts told us that\u2019s no excuse.", "We rate his claim False.", "FALSE \u2014 The statement is not accurate.", "Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "WMBD-TV clip tweeted by U.S. Rep.
