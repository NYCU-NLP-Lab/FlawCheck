["By Robert Farley, Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on November 20, 2019", "President Donald Trump said he \u201cturned off the television\u201d after Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified that the president told him in a phone call, \u201cI want nothing [from Ukraine]. I want no quid pro quo.\u201d But Sondland had a lot more to say than that.", "Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, described how Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, directed U.S. efforts to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to make a public announcement of investigations into a debunked theory about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election and Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company. Hunter Biden had served on Burisma\u2019s board when his father, Joe Biden, was the vice president.", "\u201c[A]s I testified previously, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky,\u201d Sondland told the House intelligence committee. \u201cMr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election/DNC server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the President.\u201d", "The House opened an impeachment inquiry in late September into whether Trump misused his office to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political enemies in exchange for congressionally appropriated military aid. It began holding public hearings on Nov. 13, and Sondland testified on Nov. 20, the fourth day of public hearings.", "Sondland testified that he \u201cnever heard from Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement\u201d from Ukraine, but the president did direct Sondland and other State Department officials to \u201ctalk with Rudy,\u201d meaning Guiliani. And, Sondland said in his prepared opening statement, Giuliani\u2019s agenda was clear. In an early August conversation, Sondland said Giuliani \u201cemphasized that the President wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into corruption issues. Mr. Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016 election (including the DNC server) and Burisma as two topics of importance to the President.\u201d", "Sondland testified that \u201cyes\u201d there was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d when it came to granting Zelensky a White House visit.", "Sondland said such a visit was \u201cvital to cementing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, demonstrating support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, and advancing broader U.S. foreign policy interests.\u201d Sondland said efforts to get Zelensky to make a public statement about the investigations to \u201csatisfy President Trump\u2019s concerns\u201d was openly communicated among numerous officials in the leadership of the State Department and National Security Council as a condition for a White House call and visit.", "Sondland, Nov. 20: I know that members of this Committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a \u201cquid pro quo?\u201d As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes. Mr. Giuliani conveyed to Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and others that President Trump wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing to investigations of Burisma and the 2016 election. Mr. Giuliani expressed those requests directly to the Ukrainians. Mr. Giuliani also expressed those requests directly to us. We all understood that these pre-requisites for the White House call and White House meeting reflected President Trump\u2019s desires and requirements.", "As evidence that the arrangement was common knowledge among State Department and NSC leadership, Sondland pointed to a July 19 email that he sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and others in which Sondland wrote, \u201c\u201cI Talked to Zelensky just now\u2026 He is prepared to receive Potus\u2019 call. Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will \u2018turn over every stone\u2019.\u201d Sondland testified that he was referring to the investigations of the 2016 elections and Burisma.", "\u201cEveryone was in the loop,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cIt was no secret.\u201d", "Sondland detailed how he and others, including\u00a0Kurt Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine, helped craft a statement for Zelensky to make.", "The ambassador said he later \u201ccame to the conclusion that the aid, like the White House visit, was jeopardized\u201d unless Zelensky made a public statement about the investigations.", "Sondland revealed an Aug. 22 email he sent to Pompeo about an upcoming Sept. 1 meeting between Trump and Zelensky in Warsaw (Vice President Mike Pence ended up attending instead of Trump). Sondland said in that message: \u201cShould we block time in Warsaw for a short pull-aside for Potus to meet Zelensky? I would ask Zelensky to look him in the eye and tell him that once Ukraine\u2019s new justice folks are in place ([in] mid-Sept[ember), that Ze should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to Potus and to the US. Hopefully, that will break the logjam.\u201d", "Pompeo replied, \u201cYes.\u201d", "Sondland testified that the \u201clogjam\u201d he referred to included the security aid. \u201cNothing was moving\u201d on Ukraine, he said.", "Under questioning by Republicans, Sondland acknowledged that Trump never directly told him about a scheme to withhold aid in exchange for the investigations. Rather, Sonderland said that was \u201cmy own presumption.\u201d", "\u201cWhich is nothing,\u201d said Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican. \u201cThat\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand. You know what hearsay evidence is, ambassador? Hearsay is when I testify what someone else told me. You know what made-up testimony is? Made-up testimony is when I just presume it.\u201d", "Sondland told the committee that he came to that conclusion \u201cin\u00a0the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid.\u201d", "Daniel Goldman, director of investigations for the Democratic majority on the House intelligence committee, described it as \u201ca two plus two equals four conclusion,\u201d and Sondland agreed with that assessment. \u201cIs the only logical conclusion to you that given all these factors that the aid was also a part of this quid pro quo?\u201d Goldman asked. \u201cYep,\u201d Sondland replied.", "Frustrated with the hold on the aid \u2014 which Sondland described as \u201ca very bad idea\u201d\u2013 and concerned that it was being held up until Ukraine made a public statement about the investigations, Sondland said he confronted the president about it in a brief Sept. 9 phone call.", "Sondland, Nov. 20: I believe I just asked him an open-ended question, Mr. Chairman, \u201cwhat do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these ideas and theories and this and that. What do you want?\u201d And it was a very short, abrupt conversation. He was not in a good mood. And he just said, \u201cI want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.\u201d Something to that effect.", "Sept. 9 is the same day that the inspector general of the intelligence community notified the House intelligence committee that he received a whistleblower\u2019s complaint relating to an \u201curgent concern,\u201d and the same day three House committees announced they would investigate whether Trump and Giuliani tried to pressure Ukraine into conducting \u201cpolitically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity.\u201d", "Trump seized on Sondland\u2019s description of the Sept. 9 phone call in remarks to reporters midway through Sondland\u2019s testimony.", "\u201cI just noticed one thing, and I would say that means it\u2019s all over,\u201d Trump said. The president then recounted Sondland\u2019s testimony about the call, and how Sondland said he asked the president, \u201cWhat do you want from Ukraine?\u201d", "Trump, Nov. 20: And now, here\u2019s my response, that he gave, just gave. Ready? You have the cameras rolling? \u201cI want nothing. That\u2019s what I want from Ukraine.\u201d That\u2019s what I said. \u201cI want nothing.\u201d\u2026 Now, if you weren\u2019t fake news you\u2019d cover it properly. I say to the ambassador in response, \u201cI want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky, President Zelensky, to do the right thing.\u201d Then he says, \u201cThis is the final word from the president of the United States. I want nothing.\u201d Thanks you folks, have a good time.", "Trump also said that he doesn\u2019t know Sondland very well.", "\u201cI have not spoken to him much,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is not a man I know well. Seems like a nice guy though. But I don\u2019t know him well. He was with other candidates [in the 2016 presidential primary]. He actually supported other candidates, not me, came in late.\u201d", "Rep. Eric Swalwell asked Sondland about those remarks. Sondland said he talked to Trump at least 20 times and bought a VIP ticket to his inauguration. He gave $1 million to the inaugural committee. Asked if Trump knows him well, Sondland said, \u201cIt really depends on what you mean by know well. We are not close friends, no. We have a professional, cordial working relationship.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
