["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Jon Ossoff, the Democratic candidate making a strong run in a historically Republican House district, recently aired an ad in which he sought to burnish his credentials as an opponent of unnecessary government spending.", "Speaking directly to the camera, Ossoff, a former congressional aide, said in part, \"Both parties in Washington waste too much of your money. When I worked there I helped \u00a0expose waste and abuse by government contractors. We need stricter oversight and tougher penalties. They need to be held accountable. And there\u2019s $16 billion in duplicate programs. That can be cut.\"", "We wondered where that $16 billion figure came from, so we did some due diligence.", "When we contacted the Ossoff campaign, they sent us to a report published every year since 2011 by the Government Accountability Office, the respected, nonpartisan, investigative arm of Congress. The report, which is mandated by law, is designed to point out programs, offices and practices in government that could be eliminated or changed because they duplicate other government functions or fail to provide value for the taxpayer.", "Ossoff\u2019s campaign said the $16 billion figure came from several line items in the GAO report that the candidate has reviewed and believes can be eliminated in short order and without significant harm. Here\u2019s a list. (For readers who want the full, in-the-weeds description of these programs, you can refer to the GAO report.)", "\u2022 Consolidate federal data centers: Save $5.4 billion.", "\u2022 Use \"strategic sourcing\" at the Defense Department: Save $4 billion.", "\u2022 Expand joint basing at the Defense Department: Save $2.3 billion.", "\u2022 Improve \"demonstrative spending\" at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services: Save at least $2 billion.", "\u2022 Improve management of oil and gas resources on federal lands: Save $1.7 billion.", "\u2022 Consolidate mobile communications: Save $388 million.", "\u2022 Improve\u00a0oversight of state spending under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services: Save at least $200 million.", "These seven items add up to almost exactly $16 billion.", "That said, it\u2019s worth noting that only some, not all, are duplicative in the strictest sense; with some of these recommendations, the GAO is calling for improved oversight or management. Also, the $16 billion figure doesn\u2019t include all recommendations in the GAO report -- or even all of those that stem specifically from programs or efforts that GAO deemed duplicative.", "We found at least two recommendations from the report that suggested savings from duplicative programs:", "\u2022 Prevent individuals from collecting both full disability insurance benefits and unemployment insurance benefits that cover the same period: Save $1.9 billion from 2016 to 2025.", "\u2022 Terminate the U.S. Family Health Plan and have other DOD health care contractors take over its duties: Save $189 million over fiscal years 2017 to 2022.", "Meanwhile, the report includes a wide range of other recommendations that Ossoff has not explicitly said he supports. (We excluded recommendations where GAO was unable to provide a specific dollar figure.) They include:", "\u2022 Conduct timely children\u2019s disability reviews to ensure that only eligible children receive Supplemental Security Income benefits: Save $3.1 billion over five years", "\u2022 Obtain better data to better enforce offsets and ensure benefit fairness in Social Security. Save $2.4 billion to $7.9 billion over 10 years.", "\u2022 Limit the subsidy for crop insurance premiums for individual farmers: Save $2 billion annually", "\u2022 Permanently rescind the U.S. Enrichment Corp. Fund: Save $1.6 billion", "\u2022 Market the Energy Department\u2019s excess uranium: Secure $1 billion in additional revenue.", "\u2022 Modify how Medicare pays certain cancer hospitals: Save $500 million annually.", "\u2022 Broaden the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s authority to correct simple tax return errors in order to avoid audits: Secure $274 million in additional revenue over fiscal years 2018 to 2026.", "\u2022 Achieve greater cost efficiencies with checked baggage inspection: Save $234 million in 2015 to 2027.", "\u2022 Adjust the air passenger immigration inspection user fee to fully recover the cost of inspection activities: Save almost $175 million.", "So when Ossoff says \"there\u2019s $16 billion in duplicate programs\" that can be cut, he\u2019s actually undercounting. GAO found at least $13 billion in additional specified savings that Ossoff did not allude to in the ad, plus even more when savings of unspecified amounts are included. (The campaign told PolitiFact that there \"a lot of additional areas for cutting wasteful government spending that he thinks are worth examining as well.\")", "A final note: $16 billion is real money, but it\u2019s still a fairly small fraction of overall federal spending. Total federal\u00a0spending is about $4 trillion for fiscal year 2017, and even if you exclude mandatory spending on such programs as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid\u00a0and interest on the accumulated debt, the government still spends more than $1 trillion a year on \"discretionary\" programs.", "Our ruling", "Ossoff said that in the federal government, \"there\u2019s $16 billion in duplicate programs\" that can be cut.", "There are indeed $16 billion in cuts recommended by a credible study published by a nonpartisan arm of Congress, though not all are examples of duplication. The actual universe of cuts offered by GAO is even higher -- somewhere north of an additional $13 billion.", "The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.", "Jon Ossoff, campaign ad, March 30, 2017", "Government Accountability Office, \"2016 Annual Report: Additional Opportunities to Reduce Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication and Achieve Other Financial Benefits,\" April 2017", "Congressional Budget Office, budget home page, accessed April 26, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
