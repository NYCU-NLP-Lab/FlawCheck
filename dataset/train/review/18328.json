["About this rating", "In mid-November 2015, a photograph purportedly showing what resemble common ladybugs and Japanese beetles embedded on the roof of a dog's mouth began circulating via Facebook:", "Most of the users who shared the above-displayed image on Facebook included a variation of the following message:", "SOMEBODY ASKED ME TO PASS THIS ALONG .... Japanese Beetles and Lady Bugs can attach to the roof of your dog's mouth, and make him/HER become ill. Symptoms include excessive drooling. Check your dog's mouth and remove any insects.", "While we haven't been able to identify who the \"Somebody\" is in the above-quoted Facebook post, a message posted by the Hands & Paws group did provide some information about the image's origin:", "This posted photograph is recent \u2014 posted by a vet tech and when I saw the photo started doing research - because I too thought there was no way the photo could be real.", "There is no photoshop \u2014 there is no hidden agenda. It's just me. The Founder of a tiny little dog rescue in Florida finding the photo and the facts behind the photo amazing, astonishing and wanted to share the information with my fellow dog lovers.", "We reached out to Hands & Paws for more information about the image without results, but multiple incidents are on record of beetles embedding in dogs' mouths, such as this one from November 2016:", "Frances Jiriks brought her pooch Bailey into Hoisington Veterinary Hospital after he refused to eat, she told KAKE.

A diagnosis of beetle-induced chemical burn was warranted and consistent with the nature of the chemical constituents of H. axyridis hemolymph.", "That article also included a photograph of the beetles in the dog's mouth, which closely resembled the image circulated in November 2015:", "KAKE-TV [Wichita]. \u00a0 \"Lady Beetles Causing Problems for Pet Owners.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 19 October 2016.", "Schladebeck, Jessica. \u00a0 \"Photo of Kansas Dog with Mouth Full of Asian Lady Beetles Illustrates Health Issue for Pups.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 [New York] Daily News. \u00a0 4 November 2016.", "Stocks, Ian C. and Derek E.Lindsey \u00a0 \"Acute Corrosion of the Oral Mucosa in a Dog Due to Ingestion of Multicolored Asian Lady Beetles.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Toxicon. \u00a0 10 May 2008.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
