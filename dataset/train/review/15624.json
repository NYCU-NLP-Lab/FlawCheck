["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on August 24, 2018", "Q:\u00a0Did the FBI wait until after the 2016 election to review the Hillary Clinton emails found on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop?", "A: No. A viral story misinterprets an FBI document and ignores widely reported facts.", "Citing a recently released FBI document, a viral story\u00a0misleads readers by claiming that the emails of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that were found on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop weren\u2019t \u201creviewed\u201d by an FBI investigator until after the 2016 election.", "The FB News Cycle story claims that the document proves that now-fired FBI agent Peter Strzok \u201cburied evidence of HRC\u2019s corruption.\u201d", "But the premise is false: The emails were reviewed days\u00a0before the election.", "Some background:", "The Aug. 4 story\u00a0on fbnewscycle.com ignores these facts and claims that the emails found on Weiner\u2019s laptop weren\u2019t eyed until after the election. The post gained popularity on the Facebook page \u201cDonald Trump is Our President,\u201d from which it was reshared by thousands.", "\u201cWhile the NYPD was conducting a forensic analysis of the Weiner/Abedin laptop, it was discovered that the hard drive contained 350,000 of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and 344,000 Blackberry communications,\u201d the story says. \u201cHere\u2019s what you were never told by the HRC-BHO protective media.\u00a0These were never reviewed by the FBI investigators assigned to help lead agent Peter Strzok. Nor, was any attempt made to analyze the newly discovered files until after the election was over.\u201d", "As evidence, the website includes an FBI document dated Nov. 9, 2016 \u2014 the day after the election \u2014 that indicates Strzok\u00a0had requested that a copy of a laptop\u2019s hard drive be reviewed for \u201cevidence of intrusion.\u201d The document was among a batch\u00a0released\u00a0earlier this month to the conservative group Judicial Watch.", "But that document isn\u2019t evidence that the emails weren\u2019t reviewed before the Nov. 8 election.", "A June 2018\u00a0report\u00a0by the Justice Department Office of the Inspector General, which conducted a review of the bureau\u2019s investigation, indicates that the FBI obtained a search warrant for the laptop on Oct. 30, 2016 \u2014 this time to look for information related to the Clinton email investigation \u2014 and that multiple investigators were involved in the review.", "\u201cThe Midyear team flagged all potentially work-related emails encountered during the review process and compared those to emails that they had previously reviewed in other datasets,\u201d the report states, referring to the investigation by its \u201cMidyear\u201d code name. \u201cAny work-related emails that were unique, meaning that they did not appear in any other dataset, were individually reviewed by the Lead Analyst, Strzok, and FBI Attorney 1 for evidentiary value.\u201d", "The report indicates the review of the emails was completed Nov. 6, 2016, before Comey sent his second letter to Congress. Still, it says, the lead analyst on the case told the inspector general\u2019s office that even after that review, the FBI needed to do more investigative work.", "\u201cThe Lead Analyst told us that the further investigative steps needed to complete the investigation included at least a \u2018malware analysis\u2019 to examine the laptop for intrusion and a re-interview of Abedin,\u201d the report states.", "The analyst said that such an analysis was needed to know if the laptop was \u201ccompromised by anyone\u201d or if a \u201cforeign power obtained\u201d classified material.", "So, while further examination took place after the election, it\u2019s false to claim, as fbnewscycle.com did, that Strzok\u2019s intrusion analysis request \u201cshows he sat on the laptop for more than 6 weeks \u2013 until the election was over!\u201d", "The FBI\u2019s handling of the emails on Weiner\u2019s laptop has indeed fueled\u00a0criticism\u00a0about why the agency chose to wait weeks before taking action on the late-September discovery. The inspector general\u2019s report said it found no \u201cconsistent or persuasive explanation\u201d for the delay, but said it gathered no evidence that the laptop was \u201cdeliberately placed on the back-burner by others in the FBI to protect Clinton.\u201d", "Clinton, for her part, has argued that the timing of the announcement to review the emails did quite the opposite.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.", "\u201cA Review of Various Actions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice in Advance of the 2016 Election.\u201d Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Justice.
