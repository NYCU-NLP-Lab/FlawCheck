["Mitt Romney likes to trumpet his experience in the private sector. He was the head of the 2002 Winter Olympics and founder of Bain Capital, a venture capital and investment firm.", "During a campaign rally in Pensacola on Jan. 25, 2008, the day after a Republican debate, Romney boasted, \"I was pretty proud of being the only guy on the stage that ever had a job in the private sector.\"", "He needs to check the resumes of his rivals.", "Three of the four other candidates on the stage with Romney at the Boca Raton debate have private sector experience.", "Rep.

But we find plenty of the private-sector experience of the other candidates to be in business \u2013 especially Giuliani's work for the consulting firm, Huckabee's work at the Christian TV station and Paul's work running a medical practice. And so we find Romney's statement to be False.", "(For a PolitiFact chart summarizing the candidates' experience, click\n\nhere.)", "Project Vote Smart,\n\nMike Huckabee bio", "Encylclopedia of Arkansas,\n\nMike Huckabee", "History of KLFI", "City of New York,\n\nMayor Rudy Giuliani", "Giuliani Campaign,\n\nAbout Rudy Giuliani", "Almanac of American Politics 2002, bio of Rep.
