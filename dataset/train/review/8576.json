And that little girl was me.\"", "\"I was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley, California, public schools almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education.\"", "Harris referred to the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.", "Given the attention on this topic, we wanted to know whether Harris\u2019 \"second class to integrate\" claim was biographical fact or fiction.", "Our research", "To examine Harris\u2019 statement, we spoke with officials from Berkeley Unified School District, a historian who studied the city\u2019s busing integration program, reviewed news articles and Harris\u2019 biography.", "Here\u2019s what we found:", "Harris was born in Oakland on Oct. 20, 1964.", "She grew up in a black middle-class neighborhood in west Berkeley.", "Harris was three years old when Berkeley Unified\u2019s school board voted in January 1968 to desegregate the district\u2019s elementary schools, starting that fall, through a unique two-way busing program.", "Children from the city\u2019s more diverse western neighborhoods were bused to elementary schools in Berkeley\u2019s eastern hills, a more affluent and whiter area.

She said Harris attended Thousand Oaks Elementary school, on the city\u2019s northeast side.", "\"She would be part of that second class that integrated our schools through our two-way busing program,\" Beery added. \"It began in 1968. And she joined a group that had started kindergarten the following year in 1969 and so her description is correct.\"", "A spokesman for the senator\u2019s campaign told us Harris joined the second class to integrate in first grade in 1970. She had attended a private school for kindergarten the year before. Altogether, that\u2019s about 16 years after the Brown v. Board decision, which loosely fits with Harris\u2019 statement of \"almost two decades after Brown v.

The conservative website alleged the senator fabricated her story, citing Berkeley High School yearbook photos that show diverse classes before Harris was born.", "But school district officials, and a city historian, say that allegation ignores a key fact: \"Berkeley has only one high school, so it was always integrated or at least desegregated,\" said Charles Wollenberg, author of \"Berkeley: A City in History.\"", "Integration at the city\u2019s junior high schools started in 1964, Wollenberg said. It took place without busing, \"as \u2018Busing\u2019 was still an unwelcome word in Berkeley,\" at the time, according to a report the school district published last year marking the 50th anniversary of the busing system.", "\"The bottom line,\" Wollenberg added, \"is that she was telling a simplified but basically accurate version of the truth.\"", "We asked for Harris\u2019 position on using busing to integrate schools today.

Instead, the high school was racially diverse because it was the only comprehensive public high school in the city, drawing students from all backgrounds.", "Even with these clarifications, Harris\u2019 statement is generally correct, given the context of her exchange with Biden on busing.
