["Screenshot of Majority Forward PAC ad against U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC)", "The novel coronavirus outbreak has prompted renewed attention on controversial comments Thom Tillis made in 2015.", "Tillis is the Republican incumbent running for U.S. Senate in North Carolina. He faces a challenge from Democrat Cal Cunningham in one of the most competitive Senate races in the country.", "A new TV ad from Majority Forward PAC takes the senator\u2019s old comments and presents them in the context of the pandemic. The ad highlights Tillis\u2019 comments on regulation and hand washing. But it doesn\u2019t play the audio.", "Instead, a narrator says: \"He doesn\u2019t think restaurant workers should have to wash their hands.\"", "An Asheville Citizen-Times headline appears on the screen: \"Tillis: Restaurant workers shouldn't have to wash hands.\" That\u2019s a reference to the paper\u2019s article about Tillis\u2019 comments.", "But did Tillis really say that?", "The attack ad is misleading.", "Tillis talked about handwashing on Feb. 3, 2015 at an event of the Bipartisan Policy Center. A clip from the event is available on C-SPAN\u2019s website.", "At the event, Tillis recalled a conversation he had with a friend. He said they were sitting in a Starbucks when an opportunity presented itself to make a point about business regulations in the U.S.", "Here\u2019s part of the transcript:", "\"And at that time we were sitting back at a table that was near the restrooms and one of the employees just came out. She said, \u2018For example, don\u2019t you believe that this regulation that requires this gentleman to wash his hands before he serves your food is important, should be on the books?\u2019 I said, as a matter of fact, I think it\u2019s one that I can illustrate the point.", "\"I don't have any problem with Starbucks if they choose to opt out of this policy, as long as they post a sign that says, 'We don't require our employees to wash their hands after leaving the restroom.\u2019 The market will take care of that.", "\"It's one example \u2014 but then let them decide. Now that's probably one where every business that did that would go out of business, but I think it's good to illustrate the point that that's the sort of mentality that we have to have to reduce the regulatory burden on this country.\"", "There\u2019s an important distinction that needs to be made here. Tillis never said restaurant employees shouldn\u2019t be required to wash their hands. Tillis said he would be fine if the government didn\u2019t require employees to wash their hands.", "Under the fictional scenario Tillis presented, businesses could choose to have a handwashing policy. And if businesses disclosed that they didn\u2019t require employee handwashing, Tillis said they would likely go out of business.", "In other words, Tillis argued that regulations aren\u2019t needed because market forces would prompt business owners to do the right thing. He offered an opinion on business regulations, not the health benefits of hand washing.", "Another misleading aspect of the ad is that it mentions Tillis\u2019 handwashing comments in the present tense. The beginning of the ad shows someone washing their hands.", "A narrator says: \"Everyone does it. Especially now. Well, maybe not everyone.\"", "Then it shows a photo of Tillis.", "But Tillis clarified his 2015 comments shortly after making them. In an interview with The Hill in 2015, Tillis said his comments weren\u2019t meant to be taken seriously.", "\"Of course (handwashing) needs to be regulated,\" Tillis said. \"If you noticed it was one of the instances at the very tail end, it was clearly meant as a joke. Even (the moderator) at the end said, 'Well, now I'm not sure I should shake your hand.' It was just fun.\"", "In an interview with HuffPost, he blamed any controversy on a blogger \"without a sense of humor.\"", "It\u2019s also inaccurate to suggest that Tillis hasn\u2019t encouraged handwashing during the pandemic.", "On April 6, he told Fox 8: \"If we want to get out of this sooner, then everybody in North Carolina needs to make sure they\u2019re staying at home, social distancing, washing their hands, all the things that they\u2019re being asked to do every single day.\"", "He made the same point in a tweet the next day.", "Asked about the ad, Majority Forward spokeswoman Rachel Irwin said the old Tillis comments are \"fair game.\"", "\"North Carolinians deserve to know that Tillis holds such extreme views, especially during a pandemic when their health and safety are further at risk,\" Irwin said. \"I think health and safety experts would agree that his view is problematic and he should have to answer for it.\"", "The ad says Tillis \"doesn\u2019t think restaurant workers should have to wash their hands.\"", "He never said restaurant workers shouldn\u2019t wash their hands. In context, he was saying he didn\u2019t think the government needed to regulate handwashing at restaurants, because customers would stop going if that happened. He later reversed that statement, saying \"of course\" it needs to be regulated.", "What\u2019s more, his 2015 comments had nothing to do with the pandemic. During the pandemic, Tillis has held up hand washing as an important public response.", "The ad is inaccurate, so we rate it False.", "A new TV ad from Majority Forward PAC.", "Email correspondence with Rachel Irwin, spokesperson for Majority Forward.", "Email correspondence with Andrew Romeo, spokesman for the Thom Tillis campaign.", "Story by the Asheville Citizen-Times, \"Tillis: Restaurant workers shouldn\u2019t have to wash hands,\" published Feb. 3, 2015.", "Video on C-Span, \"Clip of Senator Thom Tillis on Congressional goals and Agenda,\" posted February 2, 2015.", "Story by The Hill, \"Tillis: Hand-washing controversy \u2018hogwash,\u2019\" posted February 5, 2015.", "Story by HuffPost, \"This Republican senator is fighting for your freedom not to wash your hands in the bathroom,\" posted Feb. 3, 2015.", "Story by Fox 8, \"Senator Thom Tillis outlines NC response to COVID-19,\" posted April 6, 2020.", "Tweet by U.S. Senator Thom Tillis on April 7, 2020.", "Story by the Associated Press, \"Tillis: Restaurant workers shouldn\u2019t be forced to wash hands after bathroom breaks,\" posted Feb. 3, 2015.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
