["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on October 2, 2018", "The Department of Justice is siding with plaintiffs in a lawsuit that it said, if successful, would end Affordable Care Act protections for those with preexisting conditions. Yet, President Donald Trump claimed that \u201cpreexisting conditions are safe\u201d and that he \u201cwill always fight for \u2026 patients with preexisting conditions.\u201d", "The president made his comments during a rally in West Virginia to back the Republican Senate candidate,\u00a0Patrick Morrisey, who is running against Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Morrisey, the state\u2019s attorney general, is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit concerning the ACA.", "Trump, Sept. 29: I will always fight for, and always protect, patients with preexisting conditions. You have to do it. You have to do it. Some people think that\u2019s not a Republican thing to do. I don\u2019t care, and I\u2019ll tell you what. All of the Republicans are coming in to that position now. All of them. And we\u2019ll do it the right way too. Preexisting conditions are safe. OK? Just remember that. Preexisting \u2014 tell that to the fake news media when they write. Fakers.", "Trump\u2019s comments contradict the Justice Department\u2019s actions, which Trump approved, according to a June letter from the Justice Department to Congress on this lawsuit. We asked the White House press office for an explanation of the president\u2019s remarks, but we have not yet received a response.", "As we\u2019ve explained before, the suit was filed in District Court in Texas in February by 20 states (including West Virginia). It argues that because Congress eliminated the tax penalty associated with the ACA\u2019s individual mandate \u2014 which is the requirement to have insurance \u2014 the mandate itself is now unconstitutional. And without the mandate, the entire health care law \u201cmust also fall.\u201d", "The suit points to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 decision that found the mandate was lawful under Congress\u2019 power to tax. The elimination of the associated tax, the suit maintains,\u00a0\u201crenders legally impossible the Supreme Court\u2019s prior savings construction of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s core provision.\u201d And, therefore it says, \u201cthe Court should hold that the ACA is unlawful.\u201d", "In June, the Department of Justice said this was a \u201crare case\u201d where it would not defend the federal government in the lawsuit. Instead, the DOJ largely agreed with the plaintiffs.", "Attorney General Jeff Sessions wrote in a June 7 letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan that he had made this decision \u201c[a]fter careful consideration, and with the approval of the President of the United States.\u201d", "Sessions explained that the administration didn\u2019t agree that the entire ACA would have to be eliminated if the individual mandate provision is found to be unconstitutional. But it said two provisions would need to be eliminated: those guaranteeing that people can\u2019t be denied coverage by insurers or charged more based on certain factors.", "Those provisions protect those with preexisting conditions from being denied a policy or charged higher premiums. Before the ACA instituted these protections, insurers could deny coverage, or charge more, based on health status on the individual market, where those without employer-based plans or public coverage buy their own insurance. Employer plans, pre-ACA, couldn\u2019t deny plans to new employees, but they could exclude coverage for a particular preexisting condition for a limited period if the\u00a0new employee had a gap in coverage. (See our July story on this issue for more on the pre-ACA protections.)", "The court in the Northern District of Texas allowed Democratic attorneys general from 16 states and Washington, D.C., to intervene in the case and defend the ACA. In early September, the judge in the case heard oral arguments on a preliminary injunction against the ACA requested by the plaintiffs.", "In late August, 14 Republican senators signed on to a GOP bill that would preserve protections against denial of coverage or higher premiums on the individual market by amending HIPAA, the law that granted such protections in the employer-based insurance market pre-ACA.\u00a0Morrisey issued a statement to the Hill supporting the measure, saying: \u201cWe all agree pre-existing conditions need to be covered and I\u2019m glad to see Congress doing its job to protect those who need it most.\u201d", "No hearings have been held on the bill, and there is no indication if Trump supports it.", "We can\u2019t predict what future steps the administration might take if the plaintiffs are successful in the Texas case. But it\u2019s disingenuous for the president to say he \u201cwill always fight for, and always protect, patients with preexisting conditions,\u201d when his Justice Department, with his approval, has decided not to fight \u2014 and instead side with the plaintiffs \u2014 in a lawsuit that could end such patient protections.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
