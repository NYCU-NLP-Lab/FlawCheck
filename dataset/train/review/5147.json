This is false; an OSHA spokeswoman told AFP by email that \u201cOSHA generally recommends that employers encourage workers to wear face coverings at work\u2026 OSHA has made no determination about masks\u2019 impact, if any, on oxygen levels.\u201d", "OSHA defines an oxygen-deficient site as \u201can atmosphere with an oxygen content below 19.5% by volume\u201d and notes that a \u201cnormal atmosphere contains between 20.8 and 21 percent oxygen.\u201d", "The spokeswoman also said employers have discretion to determine whether workers should wear cloth face coverings in the workplace based on the specific circumstances.", "\u201cWhere cloth face coverings are not appropriate in the work environment or during certain job tasks (e.g., because they could become contaminated or exacerbate heat illness), employers can provide PPE, such as face shields and/or surgical masks, instead of encouraging workers to wear cloth face coverings.\u201d", "More information on OSHA\u2019s guidance about face coverings at work can be found here.", "Dr. Marissa Baker, director of the University of Washington\u2019s Industrial Hygiene program, confirmed that masks worn in the workplace to slow the spread of COVID-19 should not pose an oxygen deficiency risk.", "Cloth masks are \u201cplenty big to allow for the free flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide, while still small enough to capture some of the larger respiratory droplets that could contain COVID-19,\u201d Baker said in an email.", "Regarding the poster\u2019s purported \u201cOSHA 10&30\u201d certification, Baker explained that \u201csomeone who has an OSHA 10 or OSHA 30 is not affiliated with OSHA and doesn't necessarily have expertise to be making claims about respiratory protection. It means the person has taken a 10 hour and 30 hour training course.\u201d", "The post caption claims \u201cCloth masks trap this carbon dioxide \u2026 It actually risks health. !!!!!\u201d Experts say this is false.", "Baker explained: \u201cMasks are actually porous enough to allow for the continued flow of gas, it is larger droplets (droplets that could contain a virus) that would be kept inside the mask. Carbon dioxide and oxygen can still flow through a mask. Therefore, the oxygen % inside the mask should be the same as outside the mask. Only if someone is in an oxygen deficient environment will they be breathing below the 19.5% minimum oxygen level.\u201d", "Dr. Shelley Payne, director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas at Austin, confirmed that correctly worn masks allow airflow, and carbon dioxide does not accumulate. \u201cThese masks filter out particles; they do not prevent the exchange of air, oxygen and carbon dioxide,\u201d Payne said in an email.", "\u201cBy now hopefully you all know CLOTH masks do not filter anything,\u201d the post caption reads. Experts say this is false.", "Dr. Jonathan Karn, of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and director of the Cleveland COVID Task Force, pointed to a study that found cloth barriers to be beneficial in protecting mice from droplet spread.", "\u201cIt seems to be an extremely good bet that a cloth mask will limit transmission from asymptomatic people to people in their vicinity,\u201d he told AFP by email, noting that a controlled population study has yet to be done, but adding: \u201cThe predominance of evidence is that masks limit virus spread.\u201d", "And Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, one of the world's top coronavirus experts, told reporters last month: \u201cIt's very clear that the effect of masking the infected, especially when they are asymptomatic -- or symptomatic -- it's much more important than anything else.\u201d", "\"Surgical Mask: these masks were designed and approved for STERILE environments\u2026 IF you come in contact with Covid and your mask traps it, you become a walking virus dispenser. Everytime you put your mask on you are breathing the germs from EVERYWHERE you went. They should be changed or thrown out every 20-30 minutes in a non sterile environment,\u201d the post caption reads in part.", "Baker said this is misleading. While surgical masks are not intended to be worn more than once and are generally worn in a sterile operating environment, \u201conce an operation starts the environment is no longer sterile -- there could be blood, other bodily fluids, etc. And the physician wearing the mask is breathing/coughing/sneezing into the mask. That is what a surgical mask is meant to protect against-- large droplets (the size of droplets that may contain coronavirus),\u201d she said.", "She added: \u201cSurgical masks do not need to be changed out every 20-30 minutes. They need to be changed when they are noticeably dirty or damaged.\u201d", "\u201cN95 masks: are designed for CONTAMINATED environments. That means when you exhale through N95 the design is that you are exhaling into contamination. The exhale from N95 masks are vented to breath straight out without filtration. They don\u2019t filter the air on the way out\u2026Ultimate Answer: N95 blows the virus into the air from a contaminated person,\u201d the post caption reads.", "Karn said this is misleading. While it is true that some N95 masks have exhale valves and do not reduce virus spread very effectively, those recommended for frontline healthcare workers are unvented and are more effective at preventing spread.", "Baker agreed. \u201cMasks (N95 or other) that have a one way valve, do allow for unfiltered air to be exhaled. For this reason, wearing this mask doesn't protect the people around you. Therefore, this type of mask is not recommended for COVID-19.\u201d", "AFP Fact Check has debunked almost\u00a0550\u00a0examples of false and misleading information about the novel coronavirus, available here, as well as numerous\u00a0mask-related claims, examples of which are\u00a0here, here and here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
