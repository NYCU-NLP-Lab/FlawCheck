This is a microcosm of what our nation has became. I was once told that what was once was good, will become bad and what was bad will be looked upon as good. With gatherings such as this and 20 feet tall satanic statues popping up as the 10 commandment monuments are taken down, I believe it.", "Honestly I believe this is a prelude to even more sinister plans, it is not as innocent as their making it out to be, the masses are being tricked into acceptance. The very same freedoms guaranteed by our constitution are being used against us to silence those who dares speak against such things. I wanted to pass a short video along with you to show you exactly what I mean, I\u2019m still in disbelief.", "On December 19, the Satanic Temple of Detroit held a ceremony on the steps of the state Capitol in Lansing, MI.", "This was the nation\u2019s first state-sanctioned satanists ceremony in history.", "The article's headline suggested that the event in question had been undersigned by President Obama himself, and the unqualified use of \"State Capitol\"\u00a0misleadingly hinted that the content referenced a federal building in Washington, D.C.", "In early December 2015 the the Detroit Free Press published an article about the then-upcoming ceremony, noting that the Satanic Temple isn't a real satanic group but rather a secular organization that protests religious displays on public grounds:", "The Cruz Nativity is planned for the evenings of Dec. 12 and 13. Jex Blackmore, director of the Detroit Satanist group, said at a religious liberty rally Wednesday at the Capitol that they were waiting for approval from the Michigan State Capitol Commission to perform a live display of their own on Dec. 19. That would be the same day state Sen. Rick Jones, R-Grand Ledge, plans to sponsor a Nativity display.", "\u201cThe overriding message in our holiday display, and many of the Satanic Temple\u2019s public activities, is one of plurality and religious liberty,\" Blackmore said in a written statement. \"We have no interest in proselytizing Satanism to the public. However, we refuse to allow one religious perspective (to) dominate the discourse.\"", "The Satanic Temple, a loosely organized national group, doesn't actually worship the Christian devil. It is a secular organization closely aligned with atheist groups in protesting religious displays on public grounds.", "\"Freedom of speech may be inconvenient, messy, and at times offensive, but that is the cost of living in a free country,\" Wendy Day, Michigan state director for the Cruz campaign, said in an e-mailed statement. \"America was founded on the principles of free speech and freedom of religion ... We don't have to agree on religious principles to stand together for the right of free speech.\"", "This reporting contained a number of important pieces\u00a0of context absent from the\u00a0America's Freedom Fighters\u00a0article: that the group involved was secular (not actually \"Satanic\"), that the event was a protest of non-secular displays in government spaces, and that the only official agency whose permission was sought was the\u00a0Michigan State Capitol Commission.

Rather, it\u00a0is aligned with atheist groups in protesting religious displays on public grounds.", "The group's\u00a0overarching goal is to cause state officials to ban religious displays of any kind at the Capitol, Blackmore said.", "\"We think that it promotes an idea of exclusion to a diverse community,\" she said.\u00a0 \"It's best if none of these displays are placed on Capitol property, but, again, since there\u2019s one we want to be kind of in conversation with those displays.\"", "[State Sen.
