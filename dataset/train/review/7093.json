The product of that calculation is the animal death toll for which PETA blames the average American meat eater.", "Chris Hurt, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, told PolitiFact Georgia that, although misleading, he found the statement technically accurate.", "Our ruling", "Perhaps the most misleading thing about Moore\u2019s column is that from the opening sentences onward she writes about pigs and cows and the health risks of meat eating.
