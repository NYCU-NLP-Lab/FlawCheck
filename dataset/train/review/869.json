(AP)", "West Virginia Democrat Richard Ojeda -- who lost a U.S. House race in 2018 but is considering a run for president in 2020 -- shot a video clip at General Motors\u2019 Detroit headquarters to call out the company\u2019s announcement that it was closing five plants and laying off more than 14,000 employees in late November.", "He shared the video in a Nov. 27 tweet, adding this commentary in the body of the tweet: \"I'm in Detroit at General Motors HQ. We bailed you out. We gave you tax breaks. Your workers are the reason your CEO took home almost 22 MILLION DOLLARS last year alone (295x your company's average employee).

The amount Barra was paid represented a drop from her 2016 compensation of $22.58 million.", "While 295 times larger seems like a lot, it\u2019s far from the only such ratio among major U.S. companies -- or even among the highest.", "The 2017 CEO-to-worker compensation ratio was 312-to-1, according to research by the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-aligned think tank. (The metric the group used is not apples-to-apples with the number GM reported to the government, so a direct comparison is not possible.)", "This ratio, covering 350 large companies, \"was far greater than the 20-to-1 ratio in 1965 and more than five times greater than the 58-to-1 ratio in 1989, although it was lower than the peak ratio of 344-to-1, reached in 2000,\" the institute wrote.", "The following chart shows the ratio since the mid-1960s, measured two different ways.", "One minor quibble with Ojeda\u2019s language: He used the term \"average\" employee. Many readers might follow common usage and assume that \"average\" as the mean salary. In fact, the SEC data uses the median salary, which is technically a type of average but is not often referred to that way.", "Ojeda did not respond to an inquiry for this article.", "Ojeda said that Barra \"took home almost 22 MILLION DOLLARS last year alone (295x your company's average employee).\"", "The company confirmed both figures, which they are required by law to report to the government.
