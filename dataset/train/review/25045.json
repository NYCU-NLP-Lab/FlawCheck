(Mark Hoffman/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel).", "The opioid crisis has devastated communities, claimed lives and become a major campaign issue.", "In the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race, Republican challenger Leah Vukmir has slammed U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, over an overprescription scandal at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center.", "In response, Baldwin launched her own campaign ad featuring the parents of late Marine Jason Simcakoski that claims that -- in the wake of the death -- Baldwin \"brought both parties together to help pass a law\" to \"make the VA accountable and also to stop the overprescribing of\" opioids.", "That\u2019s what we want to look at here.", "The background", "To be sure, Baldwin\u2019s ad sidesteps what happened in Tomah and the role she and her office played in handling information from a whistleblower.", "As we have noted in earlier items:", "Problems at the Tomah VA first made news in January 2015, when the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting exposed the overprescription of opioid drugs by the facility. Doctors had been handing out so many narcotic painkillers that some veterans had taken to calling the place \"Candy Land.\"", "Prior to that, on Aug. 29, 2014, Baldwin\u2019s office received a report from the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Office of Inspector General following a 2\u00bd-year investigation of Tomah. Baldwin did not make the report public, though she shared it with a constituent who had complained to her about what was happening at Tomah. The report was not given to any other member of Congress at the time.", "A day later, Simcakoski died of a \"mixed use toxicity\" overdose at the Tomah VA while being treated by doctors there. Simcakoski had checked himself into the facility citing an addiction to painkillers and severe anxiety. He was prescribed 15 drugs, including anti-psychotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and the opioid painkiller tramadol.", "In fact, after months of criticism about inaction on a whistleblower\u2019s complaints about Tomah, Baldwin acknowledged her office had made mistakes, leading her to fire one staffer, demote another and dock the pay of her chief of staff.", "Vukmir has hammered Baldwin for months over the issue.", "During a September 2018 appearance on \u00a0\"Capital City Sunday\" on WKOW-TV, she said Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation \"to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids\" at the Tomah VA, \"later a veteran died\" and Baldwin \"covered it up.\"", "We rated Vukmir\u2019s overall claim Mostly False.", "We found that Baldwin was the only one with the report and that she didn\u2019t make the report public or go public with her concerns until the scandal made news.

On July 22, 2016, President Obama signed the package into law.", "Johnson himself referred to the measure as \"a bipartisan step.\"", "VA accountability/overprescribing: That portion of the claim is supported by a May 9, 2018 appearance by VA Deputy Under Secretary Carolyn Clancy on C-SPAN.", "In the interview, Clancy said \"we\u2019ve seen a 47 percent decrease in the number of veterans on chronic opioids in Tomah, which is a little ahead of the national average. We\u2019ve made great progress overall. For the proportion of patients on both a benzodiazepine and an opioid, which has a very high risk of adverse events, the decrease has been 76 percent at Tomah which is a little bit ahead of the national decrease.\"", "In April 2018, the Tomah VA became one of 18 veterans hospitals across the country involved in the \"Whole Health\" program.
