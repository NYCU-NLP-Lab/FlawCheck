["A viral social media post claims Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden isn\u2019t the public servant he\u2019s made out to be.", "The meme, shared on Facebook, depicts an encounter between Joe Biden and a person\u00a0wearing a helmet who is turned away from the camera. There\u2019s a speech bubble over Biden\u2019s head which reads \u201cI don\u2019t work for you!\u201d as Biden points at the person, insinuating he said that to the person.", "\u201cRemember this on Election Day 2020,\u201d the text on the image reads.", "The person who posted the meme, which has been shared 63,000 times, did not respond to USA TODAY\u2019s request for comment.", "Fact check:Satire article misrepresents Biden's abortion stance", "In March, Biden got into a heated exchange over gun rights with a factory worker at an auto plant in Detroit, USA TODAY previously reported.", "\u201cYou\u2019re working for me, man,\u201d the\u00a0worker told Biden.", "\u201cI\u2019m not working for you,\u201d Biden said. \u201cGive me a break, man. Don\u2019t be such a horse\u2019s a--.\u201d", "But the conversation between the two before those words were exchanged provides additional context to the quote in the meme.", "As Biden was making his way through a crowd of workers at the Fiat Chrysler plant, one person stopped him and accused him of \u201cactively trying to end our Second Amendment right\u201d and \u201ctake away our guns.\u201d", "The former vice president\u00a0told the worker that he wasn't accurately describing his stance on gun control, calling him\u00a0\"full of s---.\" An aide seemingly attempted to curb the conversation, at which point Biden appeared to shush him, as seen in a video of the encounter recorded by CBS News.", "Biden explained his stance on the Second Amendment, comparing its limits to those on the First Amendment right of free speech. He also said he owned shotguns and that his sons hunt.", "The exchange continued to grow more tense as the man repeated his accusation that Biden pledged to take away peoples\u2019 guns. The worker fired back that he'd seen a \"viral video\" of the former vice president saying he'd take away peoples' guns.", "More:Fact check: What Trump and Biden got wrong in the final presidential debate", "Biden said the videos the worker was referring to were \"simply a lie.\" A number of manipulated videos of Biden have circulated on social media. He denied again the\u00a0notion that he would confiscate guns, and argued back that there's no plausible need for semi-automatic rifles, mistakenly calling them \"AR-14s.\"", "More words were said\u00a0between the two, which cannot be heard clearly on the video. The next clear language was the exchange between Biden and the worker about who works for whom.", "The photo used in the meme was taken by photographer Mandel Ngan for AFP via Getty Images. Biden was not holding public office at the time the video was taken, though he was running for president.", "In response to USA TODAY's request for comment, Biden spokesperson Matt Hill pointed to a fact check by PolitiFact\u00a0of the same comment.", "Fact check:Trump debate quote about 'fault' for US COVID-19 outbreak taken out of context", "We rate the claim that Biden told a factory worker \u201cI don\u2019t work for you\u201d as MISSING CONTEXT because it may mislead some without additional information. The worker and Biden argued over gun control and Second Amendment rights before the statement was made. The encounter took place on March 10 at an auto plant in Detroit.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
