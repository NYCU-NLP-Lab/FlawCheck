["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 2, 2018", "Q: Did actress Allison Mack confess to selling children to the Clintons and Rothschilds?", "A: No. Mack has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges. She has not \u201cconfessed\u201d to selling children to anyone.", "The recent news about actress Allison Mack tells a bizarre and unsettling tale: The 35-year-old known for her role on \u201cSmallville\u201d is now accused by federal authorities of recruiting women into a cult where they were exploited for sex and labor.", "But there is no truth in a story that appeared on some websites that the actress confessed that \u201cshe sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons.\u201d", "That erroneous report, dated April 29 and published on yournewswire.com and thenewlypress.com, has racked up nearly 200,000 engagements on Facebook, where some users flagged the posts as potentially false. We\u2019ve repeatedly found yournewswire.com to spread false information, including a recent fabrication about a video involving Hillary Clinton.", "Topped with a fictitious headline, the story blends fabricated details about Mack selling children to \u201cHollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians\u201d and some accurate information about the allegations of her involvement in NXIVM \u2014 a company founded by Keith Raniere that bills itself as a self-help organization but that prosecutors say forced women to provide sex and labor.", "The Albany-based NXIVM, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of New York, contained a secret society that required participants to offer \u201ccollateral\u201d \u2014 such as nude photographs and damaging information about friends and family \u2014 in order to join. The women were branded with a symbol containing Raniere\u2019s initials, officials say.", "Raniere and Mack face charges\u00a0of sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy, according to an indictment.", "While prosecutors did note in a court letter\u00a0that there have been previous allegations Raniere had sex with girls as young as 12 and 15, officials have not entered charges against him or Mack that deal with children. Though the federal\u00a0statute cited in the indictment can be applied to child sex trafficking, it also outlines the crime of sex trafficking of people \u201cby force, fraud or coercion.\u201d", "And nowhere in court documents or publicly has Mack made any confession regarding selling children, including to the Clintons. She pleaded\u00a0not guilty at her April 20 arraignment but also signed a court document indicating she was negotiating with prosecutors.", "The story accurately mentions connections between NXIVM and prominent individuals such as the Seagram heiresses\u00a0Sara and Clare Bronfman\u00a0and Nancy Salzman.\u00a0Law enforcement officials say Clare Bronfman has \u201cfinancially backed\u201d Raniere.\u00a0Salzman\u00a0is president and co-founder of Raniere\u2019s other organization, Executive Success Programs.", "But the story then uses those associations to make false allegations about ties between\u00a0NXIVM and the Clintons.", "For instance, the story claims that the Bronfman sisters, as well as Salzman, are \u201cmembers of Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.\u201d", "But a spokesman for the Clinton Foundation, of which the Global Initiative is a part, said that wasn\u2019t the case. Brian Cookstra told us in an email that none of those individuals\u00a0made donations to the foundation \u2014 and none are \u201cmembers\u201d of the Global Initiative \u201ccommunity.\u201d He said members must make a\u00a0\u201ccommitment to action\u201d\u00a0and that none of those women have.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk\u00a0false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Application and Order of Excludable Delay, United States v.
