["The 26-second video, which features a TikTok logo,\u00a0was published on Facebook here on July 29, 2020. It has been viewed 3.3 million times and\u00a0shared 80,000 times.", "The Urdu-language text superimposed on the video translates to English as: \u201cOh Eagle, the world is jealous of your flight.\u201d", "Eagle is a popular reference to Pakistan Air Force pilots.", "The post\u2019s caption translates as: \u201cIndia cannot win no matter from where it buys the planes because they don\u2019t have sentiments of faith, jihad, martyrdom. When our men raise the slogan of Allah-u-Akbar [God is the greatest], then they shake the world.", "\u201cWars cannot be won by mere planes. The pilots should be like those in the Pakistan Air Force, then this is possible. Pakistanis know how to defend their land and they know how to give a befitting response to the enemy. This was the JF-17 that had startled the entire world by flying upside down for 133 kilometers.\u201d", "The same video was also shared alongside a similar claim\u00a0on Facebook, here and here.", "The claim is false.", "A reverse image search on Google followed by a keyword search\u00a0found the video is in fact computer-generated imagery from Grand Theft Auto Five (GTA5), a popular multiplayer video game released in 2013.", "TikTok user @abrar.rajput, whose handle can be seen under the superimposed logo in the video, originally published the clip on TikTok here.

In a real scenario, the jet's motion\u00a0would likely create a gust of wind, impacting nearby\u00a0objects.", "At the two-second mark, a\u00a0moving car can be seen on the same road, suggesting\u00a0the video does not show an organised military exercise.", "Below is a screenshot of the CGI car seen in the misleading video circled in red:", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
