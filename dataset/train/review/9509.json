John Faso of the Hudson Valley.", "Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat whose district neighbors Faso\u2019s, responded to that statement with a claim about the Republican replacement for Obamacare.", "\"I heard [Faso] say recently that too many people are on Medicaid,\" Maloney said. \"I'm just wondering which people he thinks we should throw off their insurance, because most people on Medicaid are kids, or seniors, or the disabled.\"", "The replacement would have reduced federal Medicaid spending increases, a measure Democrats oppose. The bill is now in limbo after failing in the Senate last month.", "Democrats in New York state want to preserve the Medicaid program, often citing the number of people who rely on it.
