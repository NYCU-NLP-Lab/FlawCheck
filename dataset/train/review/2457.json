["By D'Angelo Gore, Eugene Kiely and Brooks Jackson", "Posted on June 3, 2016", "In a recent speech, President Obama criticized Republicans for making claims about the economy and health care that are \u201cnot supported by the facts.\u201d But Obama resorted to some spin of his own.", "The president gave his economic address June 1 at Concord Community High School in Elkhart, Indiana. He criticized Republicans for opposing his economic agenda and for being \u201canti-government, anti-immigrant, anti-trade, and, let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s anti-change.\u201d", "Obama said one of his main points was this: \u201cAmerica\u2019s economy is not just better than it was eight years ago \u2014 it is the strongest, most durable economy in the world.\u201d", "But the U.S. economy isn\u2019t the \u201cstrongest\u201d based on annual growth of gross domestic product.", "U.S. GDP grew by an estimated 2.5 percent in 2015, according to a January 2016 report from the World Bank. That was better than Europe, as a whole, which grew only 1.5 percent, and better than Japan, which was almost flat at 0.8 percent. The U.S. economy also performed better than Latin America\u2019s developing one, which actually had negative growth last year.", "However, the U.S. economy didn\u2019t have the \u201cstrongest\u201d growth. The World Bank estimated that China\u2019s economy grew by 6.9 percent in 2015. That\u2019s more than two times better than the United States. China\u2019s GDP growth last year was a decline from its 7.7 percent growth in 2013 and its 7.3 percent growth in 2014.", "The developing economies of East Asia and the Pacific collectively grew 6.4 percent in 2015, according to World Bank estimates.", "Obama also claimed that \u201cwe\u2019ve seen the first sustained manufacturing growth since the 1990s.\u201d But that depends on the time period used to measure growth.", "It\u2019s true that U.S. manufacturing employment has rebounded by 7.3 percent since plunging to a post-World War II low in February 2010. But the fact is that manufacturing employment, at nearly 12.3 million in May, was still 2.2 percent below where it was when Obama took office. Plus, it remains 10.6 percent below where it was at the start of the Great Recession in December 2007.", "The manufacturing sector\u2019s growth hasn\u2019t been \u201csustained\u201d lately, either. Manufacturing employment was down by 35,000 through the first five months of 2016, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "On health care, Obama exaggerated when he suggested\u00a0that the Affordable Care Act is responsible for keeping employer-sponsored health insurance premiums low, and he wasn\u2019t telling the\u00a0full story when he said the average increase for subsidized health plans on the exchange is just $4 a month.", "Obama, June 1: Today, the average family\u2019s health insurance premium is $2,600 less than it would have been if premiums had kept on going up at the pace before Obamacare.", "That is accurate, but it leaves the false impression that the Affordable Care Act \u2014 aka, Obamacare \u2014 is the reason for slow growth in premiums. There are \u201ca variety of causes,\u201d including the Affordable Care Act, for the slow growth in health care costs,\u00a0according to Jason Furman, chairman of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.", "The $2,600 figure comes from Furman, who did an analysis\u00a0last year of premiums based on data\u00a0from the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s annual surveys of employer-sponsored health plans. Furman links to the Kaiser report, which notes that the slowdown in health insurance premiums dates to 2005 \u2014 five years before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. \u201cSince 2005, premiums have grown an average of 5 percent each year, compared to 11 percent annually between 1999 and 2005,\u201d the Kaiser report said.", "What are the reasons for the slow growth?", "In an Oct. 7, 2015, speech, Furman said \u201cthe recent slow growth in health care costs has a variety of causes.\u201d Furman listed some of them: the recession and its aftermath, private-sector efforts to control health care costs \u201ceven before the recession hit and the Affordable Care Act was enacted,\u201d and the Affordable Care Act. He said the law\u2019s reductions\u00a0in Medicare spending are having a \u201cspillover effect\u201d on overall health care spending, and he credited the law as \u201ca major reason\u201d for slow growth.", "But there is disagreement on how much credit, if any, the Affordable Care Act deserves for slower growth in health care costs and, in turn, premiums.", "Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said at a health care forum last year\u00a0that there is \u201cwidespread agreement\u201d that the slowdown in health care cost increases is \u201cdue to both the sluggish economy and changes in the health care system.\u201d But, he added, \u201cThere\u2019s far less agreement about the role of the ACA, about the role of the Affordable Care Act, or frankly whether it\u2019s played any role at all.\u201d (His remarks come\u00a0at the 6:40 mark.)", "Obama also rejected criticism that health insurance premiums are skyrocketing for those who buy plans on the health care exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act.", "Obama, June 1: For the millions of Americans who buy on HealthCare.gov, they get tax credits to help them pay for it. The average price increase this year has been four bucks a month. There hasn\u2019t been a double-digit percentage hike \u2014 four bucks a month.", "The $4 per month increase is the average for those who received tax credits to buy a health plan on the exchanges. As we have written before, the Department of Health and Human Services reported in April that 85 percent of those buying a plan on the HealthCare.gov marketplaces in 2016 qualified for tax credits and saw a jump in premiums of 4 percent or $4 per month on average.\u00a0The average premium increase for all HealthCare.gov consumers was 8 percent\u00a0in 2016.", "And those, of course, are averages.", "The Kaiser Family Foundation did an analysis in October of premium changes for the second-lowest cost silver marketplace plans in major cities in 50 states and the District of Columbia. It found that the percentage change before tax credits ranged from a\u00a010.6 percent decrease in Seattle to a 38.4 percent increase in Nashville, Tennessee, with\u00a0average double-digit increases in 22 of the major cities. The average increase was 10.1 percent before tax credits.", "After accounting for tax credits, there were only two cities that had average increases in the double digits \u2014 Phoenix and Minneapolis \u2014 and 45 had seen reductions in the average premiums.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/45b90715-62af-4a18-83ff-62b0e5bf5231", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0b30a9a3-7067-43e4-ae92-447a56d1e06a", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/736143ea-f6c0-414d-84bd-67514b59b2fa", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
