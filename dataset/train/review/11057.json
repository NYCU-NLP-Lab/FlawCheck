News reports and social media posts claimed that the blue-tinted canines had been exposed to chemicals after coming into contact with a now-defunct petrochemical company in Dzerhinsk, 230 miles east of Moscow.", "In dual Facebook and Instagram posts dated Feb. 16, Rosprirodnadzor, a branch of the federal service for the Supervision of Natural Resources in the region of Nizhny Nogorod, confirmed the incident and had launched an investigation to determine why the animals had been turned blue. Snopes also contacted the agency by email to determine the cause of the discoloration but did not receive a response by the time of publication.", "Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported that the seven dogs were examined at the veterinary hospital Zoozashitann, which translates roughly to Zoocare, in Nizhny Novgorod. Veterinarians reportedly said the canines did not show any serious health effects, and at least two of the dogs had found new owners. Snopes also contacted the vet center, but did not hear back at the time of publication.", "It is not immediately known whether the dogs had been turned blue due to exposure to any sort of chemical. Dzerhinskoye Orgsteklo is a petrochemical company that made hydrocyanic acid and plexiglass before going bankrupt in 2015.

Snopes contacted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, to determine whether direct exposure to copper sulfate might result in the discoloration of the animals\u2019 fur. We also sought to determine whether the inorganic chemical compound was commonly used in the production of plexiglass or as a byproduct of hydrocyanic acid \u2014 both products that the Russian facility was said to have produced before its bankruptcy.", "A spokesperson with the agency said that in its Interim Registration Review Decision on copper compounds, the EPA did not have evidence or findings of skin or fur turning blue from direct contact with copper sulfate.", "\"In the United States, copper sulfate is\u202fregistered for\u202fuse\u202fas a fungicide, algaecide, root killer, and herbicide in both agriculture and non-agricultural settings. It is also used as an antimicrobial and molluscicide,\" said the spokesperson. \"It is not\u202fapproved in the United States for any\u202fpesticide\u202fuse pertaining to the production of plexiglass.\u202fEPA cannot make any comment on its use as part of the manufacturing process of plexiglass when used for non-pesticidal purposes.\"", "The EPA is also not aware of any data regarding the potential for copper sulfate to cause dermal sensitization in any species. Symptoms of copper sulfate poisoning in animals are similar to those seen in humans, including a lack of appetite and vomiting. That being said, excess copper is excreted and not often stored in the body.", "\"EPA has no information or evidence that would indicate that the dogs were turned blue from copper sulfate exposure,\" the spokesperson told Snopes.", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
