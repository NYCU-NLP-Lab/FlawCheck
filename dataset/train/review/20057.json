["About this rating", "On Aug. 25, 2020, self-described \"Planned Parenthood director turned pro-life advocate\" Abby Johnson spoke at the Republican National Convention and repeated a controversial \u2014 and disputed anecdote about how she went from being the director of a Planned Parenthood clinic to becoming an anti-abortion activist:", "[Johnson] assisted a doctor who was performing an abortion for a woman who was thirteen weeks pregnant, she said. The doctor asked Johnson to hold an ultrasound transducer to the woman\u2019s stomach as he performed the operation. Johnson told Carney she had never seen this done before, since ultrasound machines are not commonly used for first-trimester abortions, which make up the vast majority of abortions done at most clinics. What she witnessed on the ultrasound monitor, she said, horrified her. The fetus seemed to be moving away from the doctor\u2019s probe, which was clearly visible on the screen as it entered the patient\u2019s uterus. Johnson thought of all the patients whom she had told that their fetuses wouldn\u2019t feel anything during the procedure. Then, as Johnson watched, the doctor turned on the suction.", "Shortly afterwards, social media users began circulating an image purporting to reproduce tweets issued by Johnson some three months earlier, in which she advocated for a return to \"household voting\" (i.e., a system under which a single vote is cast for an entire household, rather than each adult in the household voting individually), and declared that if a husband and wife differed politically, the husband's decision should hold sway (in \"Godly households,\" at least):", "Many Snopes readers inquired of us whether this image reproduced genuine tweets posted by Johnson. In fact it did, as is easily verified since the tweets are still visible in the timeline of Johnson's Twitter account:", "North, Anna. \u00a0 \"Unplanned, The Anti-Abortion Movie That\u2019s Getting Mainstream Attention, Explained.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Vox. \u00a0 17 April 2019.", "Dessem, Matthew. \u00a0 \"Anti-Abortion Activist Abby Johnson\u2019s Conversion Story Has Been in Dispute Since the First Time She Told It.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Slate. \u00a0 26 August 2020.", "Blakeslee, Nate. \u00a0 \"The Convert.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Texas Monthly. \u00a0 February 2010.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
