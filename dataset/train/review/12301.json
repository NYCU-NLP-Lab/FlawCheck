(Rick Wood/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)", "With the Florida school shooting still fresh on many minds, the National Rifle Association became the focus of an attack in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.", "The attack came from Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who is backed by liberals, against Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock, \u00a0who is supported by conservatives. It was made during their televised debate in Milwaukee on March 2, 2018, a month before the April 3, 2018 election for a 10-year term on the high court.", "Screnock chafed at criticism Dallet made about activities he engaged in before becoming a judge.
