So this has a big impact on the financial security of our women.\"\n\nA reader asked us on Facebook about the statistic -- that nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage earners are women. We thought it was an interesting fact to check, and it turns out Pelosi is right.\n\nThe best source for this information is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey.\n\nBLS figures show there were slightly more than 3.5 million men and women earning minimum wage or less in 2012, and nearly 2.3 million women at those wage levels. So dividing the total by the women workers gets you to 64.4 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note, however, that people earning the minimum wage account for a very small percentage of people working -- \u00a0in this case, 2.6 percent of working women.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPelosi said 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women.\n\nGovernment figures from 2012, which are based on census data, back up her assertion.
