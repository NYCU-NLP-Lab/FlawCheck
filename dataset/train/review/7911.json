(AP)", "Lawmakers don\u2019t want to be blamed for the partial federal government shutdown, which is now the longest in American history.", "So, after President Donald Trump\u2019s speech Jan. 8, some Republicans took aim at Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer for withholding support for Trump\u2019s plan. U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from Concord, was among those critics.", "\"Just last week, Democrats voted to give $54 billion in foreign aid. All\u00a0@POTUS@realDonaldTrump\u00a0is asking for is 10 cents of every dollar they want to give to foreign governments to go to secure our border and build a wall. Is that too much to ask?\" Hudson\u00a0tweeted\u00a0after Trump\u2019s speech.", "According to the\u00a0White House\u00a0website, Trump \"has requested $5.7 billion for construction of approximately 234 miles of new steel barrier on the Southern Border, a $4.1 billion increase over the Senate bill.\"", "To be clear: Experts, even right-leaning ones, agree that neither Trump\u2019s request nor a wall would be enough by itself to secure the border. (Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan watchdog organization, called the wall a \"waste\" and The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, last year said the wall \"won\u2019t work.\")", "But let\u2019s set that aside and look solely at Hudson\u2019s math and his characterization of the bill the Democrat-controlled U.S. House\u00a0passed on Jan. 3.

For instance, the council estimates aid at more than\u00a0$40 billion per year, and\u00a0The Economist\u00a0reports that foreign aid levels remained at $35 billion for 2017 and 2018.", "As it relates to the bill in question \u2013\u00a0HR 21, which has passed the House but hasn\u2019t come up for a vote in the Senate \u2013\u00a0FactCheck.org\u00a0and the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0noted that the $54 billion includes more than foreign aid. It also includes $16 billion for the\u00a0State Department, they reported.", "The State Department operations budget typically includes a range of items, from embassy security to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s salary, said Stephen Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. So it \"would be wrong\" to conflate department funding with foreign aid funding, Ellis told PolitiFact in an email.", "Hudson spokesman Tatum Gibson acknowledged that State Department funding was included in the number the congressman cited, but didn\u2019t explain why.", "\"The point is Democrats voted for tens of billions of dollars for that \u2013 roughly $12 billion more than what the president requested \u2013 but won\u2019t support President Trump\u2019s requested $5 billion to secure our own borders,\" Gibson said.", "If we subtract the $16 billion for the state department from Hudson\u2019s claim, that leaves us with $38 billion in foreign aid spending. Trump\u2019s $5.7 billion request is about 15 percent of that.", "Not exactly Democrats' idea", "Now to the origins of the $54 billion spending plan. It\u2019s misleading to cast the spending plan as a Democratic proposal.", "Spending at the same level was first proposed when Republicans controlled the House, as both FactCheck.org and the Washington Post included in their stories.", "In June, the\u00a0House Committee on Appropriations\u00a0approved a $54 billion State and Foreign Operations bill.

But he incorrectly included standard State Department funding in his claim about foreign aid funds. More importantly, his tweet misleads by giving the impression that the spending plan was Democrats\u2019 idea.
