But virality and retweets don\u2019t make a claim accurate, and this meme distorts the facts.", "Each claim is either misleading or outrageously wrong. We'll explain why.", "\u2018$6 billion lost at the State Department\u2019", "This echoes reports from many conservative pundits and outlets (and some nonpartisan news sites) about a State Department Inspector General alert in March 2014.", "The alert warned that files for over $6 billion worth of contracts from 2008 to 2014 \u2014 spanning the entirety of Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 \u2014 \u00a0\"were incomplete or could not be located at all.\"", "A spokesman for the Office of the Inspector General told PolitiFact the alert speaks for itself, but many seemed to misinterpret what it actually said. The confusion prompted Inspector General Steve Linick to pen a clarification in the Washington Post.", "\"Some have concluded based on this that $6 billion is missing. The alert, however, did not draw that conclusion,\" he wrote. \"Instead, it found that the failure to adequately maintain contract files \u2014 documents necessary to ensure the full accounting of U.S. tax dollars \u2014 \u2018creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department\u2019s contract actions.\u2019 \"", "In other words, the State Department was terrible at paperwork. The $6 billion figure refers to the total amount affected by file mismanagement. It\u2019s akin to spending $20 on lunch and losing or not asking for a receipt. Documentation over where that $20 went was lost, but not the $20 itself.", "So the State Department under Clinton, who wasn\u2019t mentioned in the alert, may have been financially disorganized, but it didn\u2019t \"lose\" $6 billion.", "\u2018Sold uranium to the Russia through my faux charity\u2019", "Trump offered\u00a0a more nuanced (but still Mostly False) version of this claim: \"Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department approved the transfer of 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.\"", "The State Department didn\u2019t unilaterally greenlight Russia\u2019s purchase of a company with U.S. uranium assets. It was one of nine government agencies, along with federal and state nuclear regulators, that approved the deal. Moreover, there is no evidence that Clinton personally advocated for approval.", "Nine people related to the company did give to the Clinton Foundation at some point in time, but most of their donations occurred before the Russian deal.", "Cohen\u2019s meme is a more outlandish. Given the available evidence, the most that can be said is the State Department had a hand in the approval process, and Clinton Foundation donors were linked to the company Russia purchased. That may look fishy, but there\u2019s no proof of quid pro quo.", "\u2018Illegally deleted public records\u2019", "This part of the meme refers to Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. While Clinton\u2019s actions in deleting some 31,000 emails certainly broached the rules of record keeping, the meme\u2019s use of the word \"illegally\" is premature.", "Before she turned over the server to the State Department, she and her staff deleted half of all the emails without government review, saying they were personal correspondence. Her decision is the subject of FBI scrutiny.", "But was this illegal? It depends, according to Douglas Cox, a law professor at City University of New York who studies records preservation.", "\"If Clinton destroyed work emails knowing they should have been kept and was intentionally trying to remove them from the public record, then yes, that is illegal and it is a crime,\" he said. \"In the end, I think there is not enough public information available to know whether Clinton did \u2018illegally\u2019 destroy public records.\"", "Clinton\u2019s overall defense that her email practices were \"allowed\" is False.", "\"The whole situation also again raises questions about the process by which Clinton decided what was, and was not, a federal record, a process she enshrouded in a black box of attorney-client privilege when she involved her personal attorneys, and a process she made final when she destroyed anything they determined was \u2018personal,\u2019\" Cox said.", "Ultimately, Clinton hasn\u2019t been charged with any crime at the time of Cohen\u2019s tweet.", "\u2018Murdered an ambassador\u2019", "Rhetoric about the Benghazi attacks seldom matches up with reality, and this part of Cohen\u2019s claim is no different.", "The day of Cohen\u2019s tweet, the Republican-led House Benghazi Committee released its findings after a two-year investigation. The partisan 800-page report concluded that a series of missed cues, intergovernmental miscommunication, inadequate security and general incompetence delayed attempts to rescue Americans in Benghazi. It also accused the Obama administration of misleading the public to save political face in the aftermath of the attacks.", "But neither the report, nor the seven other probes before it, held Clinton specifically responsible for the events that led up to the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others, let alone charge her with murder.

Trey Gowdy, and a reporter that demonstrates his thinking on the matter:", "Reporter: \"There are bumper stickers and T-shirts all over this country that say, \u2018Hillary Clinton lied, people died.\u2019 ...Is that true?\"", "Gowdy: \"You don\u2019t see that T-shirt on me, and you\u2019ve never seen that bumper sticker on any of my vehicles, and you\u2019ve never heard me comment on that.\"", "To review, the ambassador died during attacks at the U.S. compound in Benghazi, which began suddenly on the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2012. Sean Smith, a State Department foreign service officer, was found dead within an hour and Stevens was missing and pronounced dead from smoke inhalation later that night.", "Clinton, as we have previously reported, learned of the attacks in real time and said she worked late into the night. According to her memoir Hard Choices, she called White House National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, CIA Director David Petraeus and the president of Libya; directed State Department officials to secure other American facilities in Libya; convened a meeting of department leaders, among other actions.", "But was there something she could have done that day to prevent Stevens\u2019 death? Barring conspiracy theorists, no one seems to think so, including the Benghazi committee.", "\"We now know neither one of these brave men could have been saved,\" Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., said in a video explaining the committee\u2019s findings.", "\"I do not blame Hillary Clinton or (Defense Secretary) Leon Panetta,\" Ann Stevens, the ambassador\u2019s sister who serves as the spokesperson for the family, told the New Yorker. \"I don\u2019t see any usefulness in continuing to criticize her.
