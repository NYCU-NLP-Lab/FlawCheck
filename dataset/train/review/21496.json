["By Lori Robertson and Jessica McDonald", "Posted on July 6, 2020", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that through May 30, 14% of confirmed coronavirus cases led to hospitalizations \u2014 including 2% in intensive care units. But President Donald Trump falsely claimed \u201c99%\u201d of cases \u201care totally harmless.\u201d", "The president, according to his press secretary, was referring to the case fatality rate, and he claimed the amount of testing the U.S. has conducted showed this. The testing actually shows a case fatality rate of 4.5%, but not everyone who has contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has been tested. Some estimates say the fatality rate among those infected is likely around 1%.", "Asked whether cases that don\u2019t result in death are \u201charmless,\u201d White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said: \u201cThe president was noting the fact that the vast majority of Americans who contract coronavirus will come out on the other side of this.\u201d", "\u201cSome estimates do place the mortality at about 1%,\u201d Columbia University epidemiologist\u00a0Stephen Morse told us in an email, noting that we don\u2019t have a solid figure for the total number of people who have been infected. \u201cHowever, 1% mortality is not the same as \u201899% \u2026 totally harmless\u2019. I wish that were true. \u2018Totally harmless\u2019 suggests that the infection doesn\u2019t do any harm.\u201d", "In addition to patients who get sick enough to need hospitalization, some who have recovered from COVID-19 report experiencing long-term effects, \u201cincluding lung damage but also other symptoms, and we don\u2019t know how common these sequelae (the term for aftereffects of disease) are,\u201d Morse said.", "Trump made his claim in July 4 remarks at the White House.", "\u201cLikewise, testing \u2014 there were no tests for a new virus, but now we have tested almost 40 million people,\u201d he said. \u201cBy so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country can show, because no other country has testing that we have \u2014 not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality.\u201d", "The president exaggerated the number of tests a bit: 36.3 million had been conducted as of July 3, according to the CDC. The COVID Tracking Project had the total at 34.9 million as of July 4.", "What those tests show is that 2.8 million people had tested positive for COVID-19 and 122,464 had died in the U.S., as of July 4. That puts the case-fatality rate \u2014 the percentage of confirmed cases that resulted in death \u2014 at more than 4%.", "Trump is also wrong to say these are \u201cresults that no other country can show.\u201d Several countries have lower case fatality rates than the U.S.", "Among the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19 now, the U.S. has the sixth highest case fatality rate \u2014 which means 14 other countries have lower rates, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.", "And, as we\u2019ve written before, the president is wrong to claim other countries don\u2019t have the same \u201cquality\u201d of tests. Rangarajan Sampath, the chief scientific officer of the nonprofit\u00a0Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics,\u00a0told us in late April there wasn\u2019t any data to support Trump\u2019s claims that the U.S. tests are better than those in other countries.", "Morse said: \u201cMost of our tests for the virus are of very good quality, but quality varies, too, and many tests in other countries use the same methodology and are just as good.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of debate about the infection fatality rate,\u201d Dr. Ashish Jha, faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said in a July 6 press call. \u201cI think the broad consensus in the community is that the infection fatality rate is somewhere between 0.6% and 1%,\u201d but that varies based on whether a population is older or younger.", "Jha pointed to a study published in the Lancet on July 6 that used antibody tests to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Spain. The findings \u2014 that about 5% of the population could have been infected \u2014 suggest an infection fatality rate of 1.2%, as Jha explained in a Twitter thread.", "Based on several studies in various countries, the World Health Organization\u2019s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said on July 2 that the infection fatality rate is about 0.6% \u2014 at least for now, according to the New York Times.", "Jha said he thinks the rate \u201cshould come down over time because we\u2019re getting better at treating COVID.\u201d", "\u201cAnd so somebody who spends three weeks in the ICU, has severe lung damage and would have died two months ago might now survive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be very clear, that if you spent three weeks in the ICU, have severe, diffuse lung damage and you survive, it\u2019s fabulous that you survived. That was not inconsequential.\u201d", "Even if the infection fatality rate is about 1%, that\u2019s \u201cstill a lot of people,\u201d Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about the actual numbers of people who are dying rather than the percent.\u201d", "As of July 6, that figure was 130,208\u00a0deaths in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins\u2019 figures.", "\u201cWhatever the proportion, we\u2019ve had over 130,000 deaths in the US so far,\u201d Morse, at Columbia University, said, \u201cmore than twice as many as died in the Vietnam War, and more than died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined, but I don\u2019t think war could be called \u201899% harmless\u2019.\u201d", "McEnany said in the July 6 press briefing that Trump\u2019s claim was a reference to \u201cthe fact that mortality in this country is very low.\u201d And the case \u201cfatality rate in this country, vis-a-vis other European countries, is much lower than, let\u2019s say, France and Italy.\u201d", "The U.S., at 4.5%, does have a lower case fatality rate than France (14.6%) and Italy (14.4%), as well as other countries, but a higher rate than many countries, too.", "But McEnany\u2019s explanation doesn\u2019t support what Trump said, in claiming 99% of coronavirus cases are \u201ctotally harmless.\u201d", "In addition to those who die, many are hospitalized. In June, the CDC published data on the 1.3 million reported cases in the U.S. from Jan. 22 to May 30, finding: \u201cOverall, 184,673 (14%) patients were hospitalized, 29,837 (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 71,116 (5%) died.\u201d", "A study published in late February by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention similarly found that 14% of cases in mainland China were severe and 5% were critical. The latter category included \u201crespiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.\u201d", "The WHO also says that 13.8% of confirmed coronavirus patients have severe disease and 6.1% have critical cases.", "Beyond the harm caused by being sick and hospitalized, there are the financial ramifications of that treatment, the impact on hospitals of the pandemic and the burden to the U.S. health system, Riley said.", "And even those who have mild symptoms may transmit the infection to others. \u201cThey can still pass it on to others, who may get sick or even (tragically) die,\u201d Morse said.", "Not much is known about how frequently COVID-19 patients suffer long-term effects, but there are signs that the disease does not always completely resolve itself as rapidly as expected \u2014 and is unlikely to be described as \u201charmless\u201d by many who are affected.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any long-term data because the virus has only been around for a little while,\u201d said Harvard\u2019s Jha. \u201cBut we certainly are seeing more and more cases of people with \u2026 lingering symptoms.\u201d", "According to the WHO, it takes\u00a0about two weeks for a person to recover from a mild case of COVID-19, and three to six weeks to recover from a severe or critical one.", "Anecdotally, however, some patients \u2014 even those with mild cases \u2014 report months of\u00a0extreme fatigue\u00a0or on-and-off again symptoms such as\u00a0headaches, brain fog or shortness of breath that make daily life difficult.", "These so-called \u201clong-haulers,\u201d as some call themselves, have shared their stories in online\u00a0support\u00a0groups\u00a0and\u00a0with\u00a0journalists. One patient in the U.K.\u00a0told\u00a0The Atlantic\u00a0that her case might be \u201cmild relative to dying in a hospital, but this virus has ruined my life.\u201d", "Without more data, it\u2019s difficult to know how common these complaints are or why they might be happening, but similar types of symptoms have been reported in the wake of other viral infections,\u00a0including\u00a0SARS.", "One\u00a0hypothesis\u00a0is that the lingering symptoms are the result of the immune system still reacting to the virus, even if infectious virus is long gone from the body.", "Experts also have concerns that some proportion of those who survive severe COVID-19 infections may be left with organ damage.", "\u201cThe amount of lung damage that we\u2019re seeing in a lot of CAT scans make me very worried about functional capacity and long-term lung function in a lot of these people who survive,\u201d Jha said. \u201cAnd so my best guess \u2014 and it is just a guess \u2014 is a sizable minority of people who end up getting infected, I don\u2019t know, 10, 20% of people will end up having meaningful long-term clinical effects of this virus.\u201d", "The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\u00a0launched\u00a0an observational study in June to investigate the long-term health effects of having been hospitalized with COVID-19, with a special focus on the heart and lungs.", "Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, was asked about Trump\u2019s \u201ctotally harmless\u201d claim on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on July 5. Hahn wouldn\u2019t say whether the president was wrong.", "\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into who is right and who is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201c[W]hat I will say is that we have data in the White House task force. Those data show us that this is a serious problem. People need to take it seriously.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
