["Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton delivers a speech at Texas Southern University, calling for an expansion of early voting and pushing back against Republican-led efforts to restrict voting access.", "2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton went after Republicans by name for repeatedly restricting voting rights in a policy\u00a0speech at Texas Southern University on June 4, 2015.", "She singled out several Republican governors who are also potential presidential candidates. Among them was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who \"vetoed legislation to extend early voting,\" according to Clinton.", "Christie called Clinton\u2019s accusation \"ridiculous,\" on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation a few days later.", "\"She doesn't know what she's talking about,\" he said. \"The fact is that folks in New Jersey have plenty of an opportunity to vote.\"", "Christie has a point that voters in New Jersey could vote before Election Day. But Clinton is right that Christie nixed a plan to \"extend\" early voting. We\u2019ll explain.", "Under New Jersey election law, you can vote early through absentee ballot, but that\u2019s not the same thing as early voting, which experts told us typically means casting your ballot in-person at a limited number of polling locations before election day. With absentee voting, Garden State voters can send their ballots via mail or drop it off in person at an election official\u2019s office as early as 45 days before polls open.", "After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, New Jersey witnessed several logistical polling issues around the state on Election Day. So Democratic lawmakers proposed adding the typical in-person early voting option. Under their bill, S2364, a limited amount of polling locations would open for 14 days leading up to Election Day.", "The New Jersey Legislature passed the bill in March 2013 and sent it to Christie, who threw it out. Christie\u2019s spokesman referred us to his veto message.", "\"This bill risks the integrity and orderly administration of our elections by introducing a new voting method and process,\" Christie wrote. \"Taxpayers should not have to foot a more than $25 million bill to pay for a hasty, counterproductive, and less reliable system, especially when New Jersey\u2019s current early voting process is reliable and cost effective.\"", "Christie\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s definitions of early voting differ. And while there\u2019s no legally or universally recognized definition for the term, experts say Clinton\u2019s is more widely used.", "\"Technically, New Jersey voters can vote early, but it's not what early voting systems look like around the country. It looks like the absentee ballot system,\" said Wendy Weiser, an election law expert at the Brennan Center for Justice.", "Hans von Spakovsky, an election law expert at the Heritage Foundation, agreed but noted that, in his opinion, \"Absentee balloting is actually easier than early voting, since you can do everything from your home.\"", "Our ruling", "Clinton said, \"In New Jersey, Gov. Christie vetoed legislation to extend early voting.\"", "In 2012, state legislators passed a bill that would have added early, in-person voting to New Jersey\u2019s existing absentee ballot mail-in system. While the legislation wouldn\u2019t have extended the time period for early voting, it would have given voters more ways to vote before Election Day. Christie rejected the bill, saying the existing system worked fine.", "We\u2019re not weighing in here on whether the new system was better, but we do find that Clinton was careful in how she worded her claim. The proposal would have extended early voting, and Christie vetoed it. We rate her statement Mostly True.", "Interview with Wendy Weiser, director of the Democracy Project at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, June 8, 2015", "Email interview with Hans von Spakovsky, manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation, June 8, 2015", "The Times of Trenton, \"Christie vetoes early voting bill, angering Democrats,\" May. 9 2012.", "The Star-Ledger, \"N.J.
