["\u201cANTIFA To Desecrate Gettysburg National Cemetery on July 4 - Then MURDER & BURN White Suburbs under cover of \u2018Fireworks\u2019,\u201d claims a lengthy Facebook post shared by many different users ahead of the US national holiday.", "\u201cThis has been confirmed by the Gettysburg police department,\u201d a variant of the claim asserts. Similar theories were posted on YouTube and Twitter, while posters for the alleged event were shared to warn the local population.", "This prompted some online users to plan a counter protest, \u201cPatriots Against Treason\u201d, encouraging people to gather in Gettysburg on the same day \u201cin a show of patriotism against Antifa\u201d.", "The posts appear to stem from a Facebook event for a \u201cpeaceful flag-burning... sponsored by Antifa\u201d on July 4 to \u201cprotest police violence against unarmed civilians\u201d at the Gettysburg National Cemetery, which commemorates casualties of the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg. The event was created by a now-deleted page, Left Behind USA, and caused outrage in the Gettysburg community.", "The Twitter account associated with the Left Behind USA Facebook page was also permanently suspended for violating the platform\u2019s manipulation and spam policy, \u201cspecifically, operating multiple, overlapping accounts,\u201d a spokesperson for the social media company told AFP by email.", "The information number advertised on Left Behind USA\u2019s Twitter account and on the event poster is disconnected.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve had PSP (Pennsylvania State Police) intelligence look into it and federal agencies as well and we haven\u2019t been able to validate the claim,\u201d Gettysburg Police Department officer William Orth told AFP by phone.", "Orth said that his department has been \u201cinundated with phone calls\u201d about the Facebook posts, and added that \u201cwhere it (the Facebook post) says Gettysburg police has confirmed the claim, there\u2019s no truth to that.\u201d", "But the social media furor has left police having to plan for a possible disruption, regardless.", "\u201cWe are preparing for such an event, so we\u2019re hoping for the best and preparing for the worst,\u201d Orth said.", "\u201cNo one from any of these groups associated with the social media posts or scheduled events have applied for a permit here at the park,\u201d Jason Martz, a spokesman for the Gettysburg National Military Park, told AFP by phone.", "Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a structureless movement dedicated to fighting fascism online and in public, and is organized into autonomous groups\u00a0that do not coordinate large-scale events.", "\u201cOften anti-fascists will be the first ones to identify that these accounts are fake,\u201d Brian Friedberg, a researcher who focuses on far-right disinformation at Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, told AFP by phone.", "One Twitter account denounced the event as false, pointing out that a near identical situation unfolded in 2017. Mark Bray, a Rutgers University historian and author of \u201cAntifa: An Anti Fascist Handbook,\u201d told AFP that this Twitter account has legitimate ties to the Antifa movement.", "At that time local press reported that counter-protesters had planned to gather\u00a0at the national cemetery after false reports of an activist group planning an event on the battlefield on July 1.", "\u201cThe posts were made on Facebook, created a lot of fervour, a lot of people were very upset at this idea, lots of counter-protesters showed up, and very little happened,\u201d Martz recalled.", "\u201cI don\u2019t remember exactly which group it was but it had a very similar feel to it,\u201d he added.", "The posts also allude to a recent conspiracy theory that says fireworks will be used to accustom the US population to war-like noises such as explosions. The theory was adapted to the Gettysburg context by claiming fireworks will provide cover for \u201cAntifa\u201d to carry out its plans in the area.", "Although a local news website Gothamist reported a 4,000 percent increase in complaints about fireworks in New York City in early June compared to the previous year, this does not seem to be the case in Gettysburg.", "\u201cWe haven\u2019t received any complaints of fireworks, I haven\u2019t heard any fireworks in the area or in town,\u201d Orth told AFP.", "Antifa has been the subject of several hoaxes in past weeks regarding its involvement in the protests against police violence and racism across the US that were spawned by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man from Minneapolis, who was arrested.", "Over the past month, AFP Fact Check has debunked false reports of flyers seeking \u201cprofessional Anarchists\u201d and claims that Antifa was planning on marching in white neighborhoods.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
