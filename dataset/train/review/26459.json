["\u201cThis ANTIFA Piece if shit proudly admits they were the ones to break into the capital yesterday. ECHO this far and wide so he can be prosecuted,\u201d says a January 7, 2021 post on social media site Parler that was spread by pro-Trump attorney Lin Wood.", "At the time of publication, Wood\u2019s Twitter account had been suspended. AFP Fact Check has previously debunked another false claim he made\u00a0about the events at the Capitol.", "Parler bills itself\u00a0as a home for free speech\u00a0and has attracted disenchanted conservatives who say they have been censored by other social media platforms.", "The Antifa claim also appears on video hosting site Bitchute.", "The president\u2019s supporters stormed a session of Congress held on January 6 to certify Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election, which Trump\u00a0repeatedly and falsely claimed was plagued by widespread fraud, including in a speech shortly before the breach of the Capitol.", "Lawmakers later reconvened and voted to formally certify Biden\u2019s win.\u00a0Facing mounting political pressure, Trump\u00a0acknowledged that\u00a0his presidency was ending and promised a smooth transition to the Democratic administration.", "Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a structureless movement that says it is dedicated to fighting fascism online and in public. It is a favored target of American conservatives, including Trump.", "The clip circulating online does not show someone admitting to being Antifa, or saying its members broke into the Capitol.", "\u201cI just got back from storming the Capitol. We stormed it, we were successful,\u201d a man says in the video.", "He goes on to refer to involvement by Trump supporters, not Antifa.", "\u201cFor all you bitches on Facebook going crazy right now talking about it was Antifa fucking being infiltrating and that it wasn\u2019t us -- it was us. We proudly took back our Capitol,\u201d he says.", "The man in the video has been named on social media as\u00a0hair stylist Kristopher Drew.", "Reached by phone, he told AFP that he is not Antifa, said the original video he posted had been \u201ccut up by people,\u201d and that he did not enter the Capitol building.", "\u201cI\u2019m not a fucking Antifa, I\u2019m a patriot,\u201d he said.", "\u201cI never went in the building, I was... outside, but I said \u2018we\u2019 stormed the Capitol, as like the group of people.\u201d", "The claim\u00a0about the clip has turned into a nightmare.", "\u201cPeople are threatening me, and trying to hurt me every chance they get,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are sending me death threats every five minutes. I can\u2019t take it.\u201d", "The claim\u00a0is part of a broader trend of blaming Antifa for the unrest at the Capitol, which AFP Fact Check has addressed here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
