["About this rating", "In late 2020, amid a COVID-19 pandemic that has burdened many with the responsibility of cutting their own hair, actor George Clooney revealed that he uses the infomercial-famous, vacuum-based \"Flowbee\" for that task.", "More shockingly to some was the revelation that the COVID-19 pandemic had nothing to do with Clooney's decision to turn to the hair trimmer that was once described in a January 2000 Slate article as a \"uniquely American creation\" that is \"too absurd to forget.\" According to Clooney, he has actually been using the Flowbee for the past 25 years.", "As reported in a November 2020 CBS News article stemming from an interview with Tracy Smith, Clooney praised the product's ability to cut through his \"straw like\" hair with ease:", "I've been cutting my own hair for 25 years,\" [Clooney] exclaimed.", "\"So, it has nothing to do with quarantine?\"", "\"Nah. Look, my hair's, like really like straw, you know? And it's so easy to cut. You can't really make too many mistakes.

Yeah. I still have it. ... Listen, man, it works!\" he smiled.", "Clooney's praise for the product led to a tenfold increase in Flowbee sales, according to Vice President Troy Hunts. Speaking to TMZ, he explained that \"Flowbee had already seen a boost in 2020 compared to recent years due to the coronavirus ... but that uptick was nothing compared to what he's calling 'the Clooney effect.'\"", "Skeptics might assume that Clooney had or has some sort of financial arrangement with Flowbee. That assumption would be wrong, according to Flowbee. Hunts told TMZ that they had not \"worked with him before and didn't even know he was a customer.\"", "In a December 2020 appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" Clooney repeated the claim that he has been a Flowbee user for decades, going so far as to demonstrate its use. While we note with caution that Clooney enjoys the occasional prank, we take him at his word that he is a long-time Flowbee user. For that reason, we rank the claim that Clooney regularly uses a Flowbee to cut his hair as \"True.\"", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
