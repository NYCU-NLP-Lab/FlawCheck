["About this rating", "On 27 June 2018 the Facebook page Uncle Sam's Misguided Children shared the photograph reproduced below, purportedly showing women \"screaming\" at United States President Donald Trump, but somehow through their vaginas:", "Text on the image read:", "Not a joke.", "They gathered to scream at Trump through their vaginas.", "These are the people who want to control the government and teach your kids.", "Predictably, no documentary information was presented to support the claim, and Facebook users were both expected to \u2014 and did\u00a0\u2014 take the explanation on its face. However, a reverse image search indicated that the image had been circulating since at least February 2016, well before President Donald Trump was elected.", "A number of backstories were previously attributed to the photograph.

And they call it a celebration.", "At that point, the photograph was at least two years old, and had circulated once again on Reddit in July 2017:", "Originally reported articles about the \"new feminist trend\" of skirt-raising dated back to September 2015, but did not include the photograph seen above:", "\"Raising the Skirt\" by artist Nicola Canavan is exploring [women's relationships with their genitals] in her series of portraits of everyday women, as they share the beauty of their bodies, while exploring their relationships with their vaginas and what they symbolise to them.", "A photograph labeled as \"feminists ... screaming through their vaginas\" at President Trump was taken in or earlier than February 2016, and was later attributed to artist Nicola Canavan's \"Raising the Skirt\" series of portraits. Canavan's work was not a \"feminist trend,\" but rather a photography project undertaken on a relatively small scale.", "We contacted Canavan, who confirmed that this is one of her images.
