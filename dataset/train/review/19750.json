Don\u2019t believe it.", "The photo was posted on the Facebook page Wake Up America and has over 2,700 shares. Red text on the photo purports it is Huckabee Sanders in Little Rock, Ark., on Halloween 1993. But it\u2019s not. A reader asked us to look into the post to verify its accuracy.", "The photo shows a child who appears to be younger than Huckabee Sanders; she would have been 11. The person in the photo also does not resemble known childhood photos of Huckabee Sanders.", "More importantly, this photo already has been discredited on Snopes after it appeared on the satirical site FreeWoodPost.com in August 2012.", "A sloppily photoshopped Chick-fil-A sign had then been layered over the picture.", "That image accompanied a fake news story that purported Dan Cathy, the company\u2019s president, had called for a racist controversy to stir up sales. The post followed news that counter-protests to Cathy\u2019s opposition to gay marriage had caused a record spike in sales.", "\"Let\u2019s milk this for all its worth,\" the fake news story credited Cathy as saying. \"Let\u2019s wait until this gay thing dies down a little, then I will release another statement that says that we don\u2019t like blacks either.\"", "Cathy confirmed to Snopes the marketing ploy was fake.", "We found versions of this same image appearing as far back as 2008, including on a Russian blog dezinfo.net. The Russian blog says the photos are part of a story of a woman who has been sewing KKK uniforms \"for many years.\"", "That appears to track back to a Mother Jones photo essay of \"Ms. Ruth,\" who reportedly \"sews hoods and robes for Klan members seven days a week, blessing each one when it\u2019s done.\"", "The photo essay, by New York photojournalist Anthony Karen, includes a photo of the same child. We took a screengrab below.", "The Facebook page manager told us they didn't know the image was fake.", "An image circulating on Facebook purports to show White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dressed in a Klu Klux Klan robe.", "A Facebook caption to the newly surfaced image said, \"The problem is not whether this photo is real or not -- it's that no one would be surprised in the slightest if it IS real.\"", "It\u2019s definitely not.
