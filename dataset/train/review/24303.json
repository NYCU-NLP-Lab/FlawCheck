But many are from France, many are from Germany, many are from UK. They are mostly from Europe.\u201d", "Trump said he had not yet spoken to Macron about that, and then turned and jokingly said to the French president, \u201cWould you like some nice ISIS fighters? I can give them to you. You can take every one you want.\u201d", "Macron quickly corrected Trump.", "\u201cLet\u2019s be serious,\u201d Macron said. \u201cA very large number of fighters you have on the ground are fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq and the region. It\u2019s true that you have foreign fighters coming from Europe, but it is a\u00a0 tiny minority of the overall problem we have in the region. And I think the No. 1 priority \u2013 because it is not finished \u2013 is to get rid of ISIS. This is our No. 1 priority. And it is not yet done. I\u2019m sorry to say that.\u201d", "Macron is right about most of the captured ISIS fighters being from Iraq and Syria, not Europe.", "A\u00a0report\u00a0from the inspectors general of the Department of Defense, the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development said that, based on information provided by the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs in mid-June, the Syrian Democratic Forces held about 10,000 ISIS fighters in detention centers across northeastern Syria. Of those, about 8,000 were nationals of Iraq and Syria. The remaining 2,000 were \u201cforeigners from more than 50 countries,\u201d including \u201cabout 800 \u2026 believed to be from European nations.\u201d The rest, the report says, \u201care mainly from former republics of the Soviet Union; the Middle East and North Africa; and South and Southeast Asia.\u201d", "During\u00a0a briefing\u00a0on Aug. 1, James Jeffrey, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the global coalition to defeat ISIS, echoed those figures, saying about 10,000 \u201cterrorist fighters\u201d are \u201cunder lock and key in northeast Syria.\u201d And he said, \u201cMost of them, about 8,000, are Iraqi or Syrian nationals.\u201d", "In his meeting with NATO\u2019s secretary-general, Trump again\u00a0wrongly claimed\u00a0too much credit for reducing \u201cvirtually 100%\u201d of the territory held by the Islamic State. According to figures provided by Trump\u2019s own administration, about half of ISIS\u2019 territory had been regained under his predecessor, Barack Obama.", "Trump: We\u2019ve defeated the ISIS caliphate. Nobody thought we could do that so quickly. I did it very quickly. When I came in, it was virtually 100%. And I knocked it down to zero.", "As\u00a0we wrote a week ago\u00a0when Trump made a similar claim, Trump is discounting ISIS territory reclaimed under Obama.", "In a Dec. 21, 2017, briefing, Brett McGurk, then-special presidential envoy for the global coalition to counter ISIS,\u00a0said\u00a0that about 98% of the Islamic State land had been recovered by coalition forces, and 50% of that recovery had happened in 2017. \u201cAnd significantly, 50 percent of all the territory that ISIS has lost, they have lost in the last 11 months, since January,\u201d McGurk said.", "Conversely, that would mean about half of the territory had been recaptured before January 2017, under Obama.", "About a month before Trump was sworn in, the U.S. commander of the coalition operation\u00a0said\u00a0that \u201calmost three million people and more than 44,000 square kilometers of territory have been liberated\u201d from ISIS in 2016. That\u2019s nearly 17,000 square miles.", "Estimates of the Islamic State-held land vary. Figures from IHS Markit, an analytics and consultancy firm,\u00a0show\u00a0a smaller percentage of land recovered under Obama, but still refute Trump\u2019s claim that ISIS\u2019 territory was at its largest (\u201cvirtually 100%\u201d) when he took office. IHS Markit\u2019s estimates put the recovery under Obama at 33%. The rate of recapture did accelerate under Trump, according to the firm\u2019s figures, and in March, the Syrian Democratic Forces\u00a0announced\u00a0that ISIS\u2019 final stronghold in eastern Syria had been retaken.", "Trump made two false claims about the U.S. trade deficit with the European Union.", "In his meeting with Stoltenberg, Trump falsely implied that he has reduced U.S. trade deficits with the EU. Trump said that \u201cthe deficit for many, many years, has been astronomical \u2026 [a]nd I\u2019m changing that, and I\u2019m changing it fairly rapidly.\u201d", "In fact, the trade deficit under Trump has gone up 24% \u2014 not down. (See the chart below.)", "In his meeting with Macron, Trump also exaggerated the size of the U.S. trade deficit with the EU, both currently and before he took office.", "\u201cI came into a position where the European Union was making anywhere from $100 [billion] to $150 billion in deficits to the United States,\u201d\u00a0Trump said. \u201c[W]e have a very unfair trade situation where the U.S. loses a lot of money for many, many years with the European Union \u2014 billions and billions of dollars. I mean, to be specific, over $150 billion a year.\u201d", "Here are the facts: When Trump took office, the U.S. had a total trade deficit in goods and services with the European Union of $93 billion \u2013 not $100 billion to $150 billion \u2014 and it has gone up under Trump. The deficit has exceeded $100 billion only three times in the last 10 years, and two of those years were under Trump.", "The total deficit was $101 billion for 2017 and $115 billion in 2018,\u00a0according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Here is a chart of the U.S. trade deficit with the EU since 1999.", "Trump falsely said that the amount other NATO member countries spent on defense \u201cwas really heading in the wrong direction \u2014 three years ago was heading down.\u201d Before Trump took office, NATO Europe and Canada had increased defense spending in 2015 and 2016.", "He also claimed that \u201ca lot\u201d of countries are \u201cdelinquent\u201d in their payments. But countries make their own decisions on what percentage of their gross domestic product to spend on their own defense. They don\u2019t owe NATO money if they spend less than other countries choose to do.", "The president made his claim about overall defense spending during his appearance with Macron and similarly said in his meeting with Stoltenberg that defense spending for NATO members \u201cwas going down for close to 20 years. If you look at a chart, it was like a rollercoaster down, nothing up. And that was going on for a long time.\u201d", "Here\u2019s the chart from the most recent NATO report on defense spending, published on Nov. 29:", "It does not show defense spending for NATO countries, other than the United States, \u201cgoing down for close to 20 years.\u201d Instead, it shows spending declining for most of the 1990s, before rising or staying level for most of the next decade. Spending declined from 2009 to 2014, before rising again from 2015 to 2019.", "Trump has made similar claims before. As we\u2019ve written, Trump likes to take credit for increased spending by other NATO countries \u2014 which have upped their spending on defense by $40 billion, or 15%, from 2016 to 2019 \u2014 but he\u2019s wrong to claim spending was \u201cheading down\u201d before he took office. Other countries had increased their defense spending by $12 billion or 4.8% from 2014 to 2016, according to the NATO report.", "In his appearance with Stoltenberg, Trump also claimed: \u201cAnd yet, you still have many delinquent \u2014 you know, I call them \u2018delinquent\u2019 when they\u2019re not paid up in full. And then, I asked the other question: When they don\u2019t pay up in full, what happens to the past year? So let\u2019s say Germany is at 1% and they stay at 1% and another 1. \u2026 Because, you know, it\u2019s not like, \u2018Oh, gee. \u00a0Let\u2019s start a brand-new year.\u2019 A lot of countries haven\u2019t paid. And you could make the case that they haven\u2019t paid. They\u2019re, really, delinquent for 25, 30 years.\u201d", "But NATO countries don\u2019t owe money to anyone else if they spend less on defense than other member countries.", "In 2006, NATO countries made a commitment to aim to spend 2% of their GDP on their own defense. A NATO spokesman at the time said: \u201cLet me be clear, this is not a hard commitment that they will do it. But it is a commitment to work towards it. And that will be a first within the Alliance.\u201d", "A 2014 NATO declaration after a summit in Wales again said that countries that weren\u2019t meeting the 2% goal would \u201caim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade.\u201d", "So, they have until 2024 to meet that target. As of the November NATO report, nine of the 29 member countries met the 2% goal in 2019.", "Germany will spend an estimated 1.38% of its GDP on its defense in 2019, while the United States will spend 3.42%.", "Trump wrongly claimed that the U.S. \u201cnever used to win,\u201d or \u201cvery rarely\u201d won, cases before the World Trade Organization prior to him becoming president.", "Trump:\u00a0As you know, we won \u2014 in the World Trade Organization, we won seven and a half billion dollars. We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations. And now they realize \u2014 the World Trade Organization realizes that my attitude on them: If they don\u2019t treat us fairly, well, I\u2019ll tell you someday what will happen.", "And we\u2019ve been winning a lot of cases at the World Trade Organization. We virtually \u2014 very rarely did we ever win a case. They took advantage of the United States.", "Trump is referring to the WTO\u00a0announcement\u00a0on Oct. 14 that it was authorizing the U.S. to impose tariffs of up to $7.5 billion a year on European Union goods and services because the EU had failed to remove subsidies for the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus that were inconsistent with a trade agreement and harmed Airbus\u2019 U.S. rival, Boeing.", "But Trump was wrong when he said the U.S. has dramatically improved its record on winning WTO cases during his presidency. As\u00a0we have written, the U.S. has historically won the vast majority of cases it brings, and lost most of the cases brought against it. (That\u2019s generally how other countries fare before the WTO as well.)", "\u201cGenerally speaking, the US success rate at the WTO is about the same now as it was pre-Trump,\u201d\u00a0Simon Lester, a trade policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute,\u00a0told us\u00a0for an October article. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult thing to measure, but based on my assessment, the overall rate has not changed.\u201d", "William Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official during the Clinton administration,\u00a0also said Trump\u2019s boast about an improved record with the WTO is \u201csimply not true.\u201d", "\u201cThere are different ways to count WTO cases, but the consensus view has long been that our winning record is better than other countries, and we lose less than other countries,\u201d Reinsch told us.", "As for the Airbus ruling, the trade experts said the more than decade-old dispute had been breaking the United States\u2019 way for years, and the award would likely have come down as it did no matter who was president.", "Trump understated South Korea\u2019s prior contributions to the\u00a0shared cost of the U.S. military presence in South Korea by several hundred million dollars.", "Trump: I met with [Republic of Korea] six, seven months ago \u2014 maybe a little bit longer than that. And I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not paying enough. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d", "They were paying $500 \u2014 they were paying less than $500 million a year and it costs us billions. And I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. We do a great job. We have 32,000 soldiers there. It cost us, you know, many times what you\u2019re paying. And you have to pay up.\u201d", "And they said \u2014 again, in a very good way, very fine negotiation. And they were very close to being at the end of their budget, and we agreed to $500 million more, almost \u2014 around $500 million. And that got them up to close to a billion dollars from $500 million \u2014 really less than $500 million, which has been that number for many, many years \u2014 decades. And I got $500 million more a year.", "On Feb. 10,\u00a0South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced\u00a0that it had agreed to contribute 1.039 trillion Korean won (which\u00a0is currently\u00a0about $873\u00a0million) in 2019 as part of a new one-year Special Measures Agreement that helps to offset the cost of maintaining a U.S. military presence in South Korea. The deal, which is only for 2019, was\u00a0officially signed\u00a0in March, and went into force in April.", "But the Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that amount was only an 8.2% increase from what South Korea paid in 2018 under a previous five-year deal approved in 2014 that expired at the end of last year. That earlier deal,\u00a0which went into force in June 2014, called for South Korea to contribute 920 billion won in 2014 and then increase its annual payments at the rate of inflation. That worked out to \u201capproximately $830 million per year,\u201d\u00a0Trump\u2019s own\u00a0State Department said\u00a0in March 2018.", "And under the five-year deal before that one, South Korea still contributed much more than $500 million a year. As the\u00a0State Department said\u00a0on Jan. 15, 2009: \u201cIn the agreement signed in Seoul today, the [Republic of Korea] will provide 760 billion won (approximately U.S. $691.5 million based on the 2008 average exchange rate) in 2009 and will increase the funding level in the subsequent years by the rise in the Consumer Price Index, with a maximum four-percent annual cap.\u201d", "Trump misstated what North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to do about his country\u2019s nuclear weapons program after their first meeting in Singapore on June 12, 2018.", "Trump:\u00a0[M]y relationship with Kim Jong Un is really good, but that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t abide by the agreement we signed.
