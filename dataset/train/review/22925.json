She also alluded to her support for Trump.", "\"Y\u2019all lie all the time about Trump, and NEVER FACT CHECK WHEN THE POST LIE ABOUT TRUMP,\" Smith wrote.", "The term \"super predator\" was coined in 1995 by Princeton University professor\u00a0John DiIulio. It came to define a generation of \"radically impulsive, brutally remorseless youngsters, including ever more preteenage boys, who murder, assault, rape, rob, burglarize, deal deadly drugs, join gun-toting gangs and create serious communal disorders,'' according to a 2001 report by the New York Times.
