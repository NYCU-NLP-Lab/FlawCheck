["The Congress party has fielded former Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) student leader Maskoor Usmani as a candidate for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections. He will be contesting from Jale constituency in Darbhanga district of Bihar. Usmani\u2019s candidature has given the BJP a fresh opportunity to criticise the Congress. The former has accused Usmani of being a \u2018Jinnah supporter\u2019.", "Aaj Tak ran broadcasts suggesting that the Congress will seek votes on the basis of \u2018Jinnah\u2019s genie\u2019 while issues of development and corruption will take a backseat. Anchor Rohit Sardana in his daily show \u2018Dangal\u2019 invited several panellists to discuss Usmani\u2019s candidature. The channel claimed multiple times (1:24 minutes and 6:20 minutes) that in 2018 Usmani installed a portrait of Pakistan\u2019s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah at AMU.", "The graphic plate below reads, \u201cMaskoor Usmani had installed Jinnah\u2019s portrait while he was AMU [students\u2019 union] president.\u201d", "At 6:20 minutes into the broadcast, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra expressed his grief over Congress\u2019s decision to give Usmani a ticket \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s not important who wins or loses elections. Today, India is losing. The oldest national party because of which India was partitioned is again trying to gain votes by selling Jinnah. I am saddened, not happy.\u201d \u2014 to which Sardana said, \u201cPatra ji, you have peered into my heart. But look into your heart too and tell me if you\u2019re not satisfied that they\u2019ve given him a ticket and you can now highlight how he is a massive anti-national?\u201d", "The complete broadcast can be watched below.", "That Jinnah\u2019s portrait has been hanging in AMU since 1938 is public knowledge. The issue raked up controversy in 2018 when armed activists from the Hindu Yuva Vahini descended on AMU campus with alleged police support to demand that the portrait be taken down. Scores of students were injured in the violence.", "For Jinnah portrait hanging since 1938, Hindutva activists attack AMU students https://t.co/sf132cXZN6 pic.twitter.com/Um6lIYhCI7", "\u2014 The Wire (@thewire_in) May 3, 2018", "Visuals of police charging students with lathis and firing tear gas shells were also reported in the media.", "AMU vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor had dismissed the row over Jinnah\u2019s portrait on the campus as a non-issue. \u201cJinnah\u2019s portrait has been here since 1938. Jinnah\u2019s portrait is at many places, including Bombay High Court and Sabarmati Ashram. No one was worried about the portraits until now, I think it is a non-issue,\u201d he was quoted when asked if the portrait should be removed.", "\u201cA country\u2019s history has dark as well as bright pages. No one in AMU supports Jinnah\u2019s two-nation theory, but we must accept that he is an important part of India\u2019s history,\u201d former AMU students\u2019 union president Masksoor Usmani had told The Telegraph. Usmani\u2019s objection to the BJP\u2019s demands to remove the portrait was preserving history.", "His video statement was broadcast by News Nation on August 7, 2018 where Usmani said, \u201cIt is the students\u2019 union\u2019s autonomy to decide what should be done to the painting. This isn\u2019t new. Why does this question keep coming up? It\u2019s because they want to make Jinnah an agenda in the 2019 elections\u2026the portrait is just history which has been in the campus not since today but 80 years. We have said multiple times that Jinnah is our history, not religion.\u201d", "During the Jinnah row, 94-year-old Riaz-Ur-Sherwani who was present when AMUSU unveiled Jinnah\u2019s portrait in 1938 told the media that the matter was a \u201cpersonal affair\u201d of the students. \u201cSherwani is known to vehemently oppose Jinnah and his policies, however, he says that when the portrait was put up, the \u201ccircumstances of the country were different\u201d and no outsider can dictate what is to be hung in the university hall,\u201d wrote News18 in a May 6, 2018 report.", "In an opinion piece on The Tribune, journalist Karan Thapar discussed that the decision to hang Jinnah\u2019s portrait in AMU was based on his politics in the early 20th century. \u201cThe Jinnah of the first three decades of the 20th century was a very different person to the man the Pakistanis call Qaid-e-Azam,\u201d Thapar wrote.", "Maskoor Usmani told Alt News that the narrative being peddled in the media, that he installed Jinnah\u2019s portrait, is false propaganda. \u201cI\u2019d like to clearly and boldly state that I do not hold any views that support Jinnah in any aspect. The movement that had followed in AMU in 2018 had been on different issues and the corrupt ways of the media focussed to highlight a portrait hanging in the Union Hall to disrupt the movement and damage the name of the institution and mine as the leader of the students\u2019 union at the time.", "Firstly, let me state this with complete assurance that the portrait issue was a controversy to divert the attention of the populace. Secondly, that particular portrait hangs there not because I deemed it so. Jinnah\u2019s portrait hangs along with the greatness of Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi. At the time this issue had sprung up, I had addressed a letter to PM Modi and Rajnath Singh stating that neither the movement or I had no issue in removing the portrait in totality,\u201d he said.", "The Congress gave Usmani a ticket instead of former Railway Minister Lalit Narayan Mishra\u2019s grandson Rishi Mishra who said that he left JD(U) to contest from Jale. Mishra termed Usami \u201canti-national and Jinnah worshipper\u201d claiming that he has the Pakistan founder\u2019s photo in his office.", "\u201cIt is a shameful act by a person who wanted to acquire a ticket from Congress. Now when he has not gotten it, goes on to bash the Congress party\u2019s name. All these statements being narrated are proof of how they fear the party moving up. I further suspect that people like him [Mishra] out of resentment for me and the party are spreading the propaganda to make me seem wrong in the eyes of the people and the party,\u201d Usmani further said.", "Aaj Tak\u2019s claim that Maskoor Usmani hung a portrait of Jinnah inside AMU campus is false.
