["About this rating", "The tribulations of an affable Spix\u2019s macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii) named \u201cBlu\u201d are the focus of the \"Rio\" franchise of movies. Blu in the movie is the last known male of his species, and he must travel to Rio de Janeiro from his captivity in Minnesota to meet the last remaining female of his species to save their kind from extinction.", "Back in the real world, scientists in September 2018 recommended that the Spix\u2019s macaw, also known as the \u201clittle blue macaw,\u201d be reclassified from \u201ccritically endangered\u201d to \u201cextinct in the wild.\u201d", "This recommendation has not yet been formalized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which maintains a \u201cred list\u201d of endangered species. The organization last assessed the Spix\u2019s macaw on Aug. 7, 2018, prior to the aforementioned study first published online on Sept. 1, 2018. In their paper, the scientists described the last known sightings of Spix\u2019s macaw in the wild:", "Last known from near the rio S\u00e3o Francisco in north Bahia, Brazil, where only three birds remained in 1985\u20131986, and these were captured for trade in 1987 and 1988. However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw (Propyrrhura maracana), was discovered at the site in July 1990, and survived until the end of 2000. There have been no subsequent records of wild birds, despite searches and fieldworker presence in the area. An observation in 2016 in the Curaca area is believed to relate to a release from captivity. Loss of gallery woodland and trapping for the cagebird trade likely drove declines.", "While wild individuals have likely not been seen since 2000, a captive population of about 60 or 70 species in the hands of both breeding programs and private owners still exists. In 2018, the Brazilian government announced that a population of around 50 Spix\u2019s macaws from Europe would be transferred to a reintroduction facility in Brazil:", "The current batch of survivors being repatriated from Europe will initially stay in a special center due to open in Berlin next Thursday, where they will be prepared for the transition. They will then move to a 72-acre reintroduction center in a conservation area of Brazil's north-eastern state of Bahia, with the first being released into the wild in 2021. Brazil's environment ministry said that international breeding programs for the birds in captivity have seen the population grow from 79 in 2012 to 158 this year.", "The number of blue-named and/or blue-colored macaws has created some internet confusion about what birds are \u2014 and are not \u2014endangered or extinct. A viral meme from the French Facebook page Jadore Les Animaux, for example, shared a picture of a blue-colored macaw with the text: \"The world is in mourning. The blue macaw has been declared extinct.\u201d", "First, while there are multiple species of blue macaws, \u201cblue macaw\u201d is not the common or informal name for any of them. The closest match to that name would be the blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna), whose population is not threatened.", "Secondly, as Agence France-Presse noted in a fact check of that viral post, the species shown in the photo was actually a different species of macaw known as the hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus). This species is classified as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the IUCN.", "But because scientists have determined the wild population of Spix\u2019s macaw to be likely extinct in the wild, we rate the claim about the bird species fictionalized in the \"Rio\" movies as \"True.\"", "Butchart, Stuart H.M., et al. \u00a0 \u201cWhich Bird Species Have Gone Extinct? a Novel Quantitative Classification Approach.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Biological Conservation. \u00a0 1 September 2018.", "IUCN Red List. \u00a0 \u201cCyanopsitta spixii.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 27 August 2019.", "Phys.org. \u00a0 \u201cDozens of Last Blue Macaws to Be Reintroduced to Brazil.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 24 June 2018.", "IUCN Red List. \u00a0 \u201cAra ararauna.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 27 August 2019.", "Butchart, Stuart H.M., et al. \u00a0 \u201cNon, Cette Esp\u00e8ce De Perroquet N'est Pas \u00c9teinte.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 L\u2019Agence France-Presse. \u00a0 24 January 2019.", "IUCN Red List. \u00a0 \u201cAnodorhynchus hyacinthinus.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 27 August 2019.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
