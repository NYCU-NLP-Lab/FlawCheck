["About this rating", "In September 2017, an image purportedly showing a page from a criminology textbook which featured the mugshot of Brock Turner \u2014 the Stanford student who served three months in jail after he was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman \u2014 alongside an entry for \"rape\" was circulated on social media:", "The image was first posted to Imgur with the following description:", "My friend found this in a textbook", "\"He may have been able to get out of prison time but in my Criminal Justice 101 textbook, Brock Turner is the definition of rape, so he's got that goin for him.\" -- Friend's comment", "Although some expressed skepticism about the authenticity of this textbook page, the Imgur user also provided the name of the textbook (Introduction to Criminal Justice, 2nd Ed.) and its ISBN number. We looked over two digital copies of this textbook, one from Google Books and the other from Amazon, and can confirm that this is a genuine page from a genuine textbook was written by University of Colorado, Denver professor Callie Marie Rennison.", "After receiving the Bonnie S. Fisher Victimology Career Award in 2016, Rennison explained that her textbook attempted to change the dialogue about victims of crime as well as its perpetrators within the criminal justice community:", "I\u2019m honored that I can continue to be a part of that change. A major recent way I\u2019ve worked toward that is found in our (with Mary Dodge) Sage textbook Introduction to Criminal Justice: Systems, Diversity and Change. Existing criminal justice books have focused on three elements: cops, courts and corrections. They speak little about victims, reflecting how they have effectively been in the shadows of our criminal justice system. In our book, victims are front and center with equal emphasis as cops, courts and corrections. This is the way it should be.", "Rennison, Callie. \u00a0 Introduction to Criminal Justice: Systems, Diversity, and Change.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 SAGE Publications \u00a0 (Second Edition, 2017). \u00a0' ISBN  1-506-34772-X.", "Johnson, Alex. \u00a0 \"After Months of Requests, Mugshots of Stanford Rapist Brock Turner Finally Emerge.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NBC News. \u00a0 7 June 2016.", "Merritt, John. \u00a0 \"Callie Rennison Receives National Victimology Award.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Views from the West. \u00a0 15 November 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
