["The worksite at the new Oakview Elementary School is full of activity as construction continues Tuesday, December 8, 2015 in Holly Springs, N.C. (News & Observer)", "North Carolina needs new school buildings, but leaders disagree on how to pay for them.", "In December, Republican House Speaker Tim Moore announced his support for putting a\u00a0$1.9 billion school bond\u00a0on the ballot in 2020.", "In January, Senate Republicans introduced a\u00a0pay-as-you-go plan\u00a0that uses tax revenues \u2014 avoiding borrowing and avoiding the ballot.", "In response, Democrats argued that the Senate plan uses money that could go toward other priorities. On Feb. 20, Democratic state Sen. Wiley Nickel took it a step further.", "\"SB5 pays for school construction with teacher pay raises,\" the Cary senator\u00a0tweeted, referring to the bill number.", "In the same tweet, Nickel then walks back his claim, suggesting teacher pay isn\u2019t immediately affected: \"This plan puts into jeopardy funding for teacher pay raises, classroom supplies, broadband, roads and training for corrections officers.\"", "His tweet then concludes with an image of the words, \"NC teachers shouldn\u2019t have to pay the price for school construction.\"", "Politicians often try to extrapolate negative consequences from legislation they oppose \u2013 even if those consequences are unlikely or uncertain. Nickel\u2019s tweet is a prime example of a claim that should raise eyebrows. It suggests elected officials would take money away from teachers (who vote) and put it toward buildings (which don\u2019t vote).", "PolitiFact looked at the bill in question,\u00a0SB 5, to answer the question: Does it take money earmarked for teacher salaries and put it toward capital projects?", "No. We found no evidence that the bill affects teacher salaries or potential raises.", "A SPECIAL FUND", "The bill calls for using money from the State Capital Infrastructure Fund, a new fund created in 2017 that\u2019s expected to receive 4 percent of tax revenues this year.", "\"Senate Republicans propose increasing the contribution to the fund to 4.5 percent of tax revenue, and letting K-12 schools use some of the money for school construction,\"\u00a0The News & Observer reported.", "PolitiFact asked the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction whether the bill immediately affects teacher salaries.", "\"We have looked at the bill and the answer to your first question is no.

He said it drains money from the state\u2019s general fund, leaving the state with less money for other projects.", "As Nickel sees it, the Senate GOP plan leaves the state with one of three options in crafting a budget:", "\u2022 No teacher pay raises", "\u2022 Increase in sales taxes and fees to cover the difference", "\u2022 \"More budget cuts to departments that have already endured massive cuts to staff and services under their spending plan.\"", "Nickel isn\u2019t the only one who says he\u2019s worried about the plan affecting future spending. Joe Coletti, senior fellow at the John Locke Foundation, a conservative think tank, told the\u00a0Carolina Journal\u00a0that the legislature may choose to use other funds if tax revenues ever decrease.", "However, those predictions and concerns are over hypotheticals.
