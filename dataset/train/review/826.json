["By Lori Robertson and Brooks Jackson", "Posted on June 15, 2017", "Opponents of the Republican House health care bill are claiming\u00a0its provisions on preexisting conditions reach further than they actually do.", "It\u2019s not surprising that AARP, a nonprofit membership organization for those age 50 and older, is against the Republican health care bill passed by the\u00a0House.\u00a0The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in its analysis of the legislation that lower-income older people buying coverage on the individual market would see \u201cmuch larger\u201d net premiums on average than under current law. And, the CBO said, an increase in the number of the uninsured under the bill \u201cwould be disproportionately larger among older people with lower income.\u201d", "But a\u00a0TV ad from AARP targeting 11 Republican senators in eight states\u00a0doesn\u2019t tell the whole story about what the bill would mean for those with preexisting health conditions.", "AARP\u2019s ad is airing in Iowa, Ohio, Tennessee, West Virginia, Arizona, Colorado, Alaska and Nevada, and it urges viewers to call Republican senators in those states to tell them to \u201cvote \u2018No\u2019 on the health care bill.\u201d The House passed the American Health Care Act on May 4, and it is now\u00a0under consideration by the Senate, which could make changes to the bill or introduce its own health care legislation.", "The ad launched in late May in four states on a seven-figure ad buy and was expanded to four more states in June. AARP says the ad \u201cwill stay on the air as long as the Senate debates health care.\u201d", "The ad begins with a shot of a storefront window that says, \u201cRyan & Associates Financial & Tax Services,\u201d a reference to House Speaker Paul Ryan. It\u00a0then cuts to an accountant behind a desk asking a man and woman if they\u2019re both over 50 years old. \u201cYes,\u201d the woman responds, and the accountant says, \u201cthat\u2019ll cost you.\u201d", "\u201cThe new health care bill in Congress,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf you\u2019re over 50, insurance companies can charge you five times more. It\u2019s an age tax.\u201d", "It\u2019s not actually a \u201ctax,\u201d but under the bill, insurers can charge older people five times more for premiums than younger people for insurance on the individual market, where those without employer-sponsored insurance or coverage through programs like Medicaid\u00a0buy their own policies. Insurers could even charge more than that, under one of three waivers that states could get under the bill. If a state got the waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services, it could set a higher age-rating ratio than the bill\u2019s 5-to-1 stipulation.", "The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, limits insurers to charging three times as much to older policyholders.", "Then the accountant in the ad asks, \u201cAny preexisting conditions?\u201d The man responds: \u201cI have asthma.\u201d The accountant says, \u201d\u00a0Ok, well, insurers can charge thousands more for that. This is going to be a big bill.\u201d", "Insurers\u00a0can charge more based on health status but only under certain conditions. The couple in the ad \u2014 or those watching the ad \u2014 would have to meet several criteria for that to happen. Under the House Republican bill:", "Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers couldn\u2019t deny anyone coverage based on their health status, and the Republican bill doesn\u2019t change that.", "But the GOP legislation does include a penalty for not maintaining continuous coverage \u2014 regardless of whether an individual has a health condition or not. Those buying policies on the individual market \u2014 such as state and federal insurance marketplaces \u2014 would pay a 30 percent surcharge if they had a lapse in coverage of 63 days or more over the previous year. The waiver that states can get would allow insurers to go above that 30 percent surcharge and instead price policies based on health status.", "For a couple older than 50, that could easily mean \u201cthousands more\u201d in premiums. The CBO estimated that for a single person age 64, the average net premium paid in 2026 would be $13,600 for the year in a state that made \u201cmoderate\u201d changes to the individual market regulations under the available waivers. (The third waiver available would allow states to set their own list of essential health benefits that plans must cover. There are currently 10 such benefits under the ACA. See our story \u201cThe Preexisting Conditions Debate\u201d for more information on these waivers in the GOP bill.)", "To get these waivers, states would apply to the U.S. secretary of health and human services and would have to have a\u00a0\u201crisk mitigation program,\u201d such as a high-risk pool, or participate in a new\u00a0Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program, both designed to help those with high medical costs.", "How many people could potentially be affected by these waivers? It\u2019s difficult to say.", "The CBO estimated that about half of the U.S. population\u00a0lives in states that would not request waivers to allow pricing based on health status or to change the essential health benefit requirements. About one-third lives in states that would \u201cmake moderate changes to market regulations,\u201d and about one-sixth lives in states that would request both waivers, resulting in premiums that would be priced based on health status for a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of the individual market in those states.", "The governors of at least two states where the ads are running have criticized the House bill. Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado issued a statement calling on the Senate to reject the House bill, saying it does not \u201cadequately protect people with preexisting conditions.\u201d Republican Gov. John Kasich of Ohio has said that states \u201cwill not opt\u201d for waivers because the House GOP bill doesn\u2019t provide enough funding for the high-risk pools.", "As we explained, in order to be charged more based on health status, an individual would have to live in a state that got a waiver, have a gap in coverage and buy coverage on the individual market. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates 7 percent of the population had insurance on that market in 2015. In a March 2017 report, AARP estimated, based on the Urban Institute\u2019s work, that 6 million people age 50-64 got individual market insurance \u2014 or 39 percent of those with individual market plans.", "AARP estimated, using KFF\u2019s work, that 40 percent of\u00a0all\u00a050- to 64-year-olds had a health condition that could cause a denial of insurance on the individual market if such denials were allowed. And AARP notes\u00a0that protections for preexisting conditions \u201care especially important for older adults,\u201d since people are likely to develop health issues as they age.", "Despite the difficulty in determining the potential impact, Democrats have taken to exaggerating the number of people with preexisting conditions who would be charged more based on health status.", "At a June 13 Democratic media availability on health care, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada claimed that 1.2 million people in her state \u201cwould\u201d be affected.\u00a0But that\u2019s a high-end estimate for all Nevadans with some preexisting condition \u2014 not just those likely to buy plans on the individual market.", "Cortez Masto, June 13: Right now, there are over 1.2 million Nevadans with preexisting conditions, 1.2 million Nevadans that if Republicans have their way, would be denied coverage or face exorbitant, unaffordable premiums.", "First, no one \u201cwould be denied coverage\u201d under the GOP health care bill.\u00a0The bill keeps the ACA\u2019s\u00a0\u201crequirement to guarantee issue coverage\u201d \u2014 which means coverage must be offered regardless of health status, as a Kaiser Family Foundation summary of the bill says.", "Second, as we\u2019ve explained, some with preexisting conditions could \u201cface exorbitant, unaffordable premiums,\u201d but it\u2019s unknown if they \u201cwould,\u201d as Cortez Masto\u00a0claimed. And her 1.2 million figure includes Nevadans who get their insurance through an employer, as 46 percent of the state\u2019s population does. Seven percent of Nevadans get coverage through the individual market, where the GOP bill\u2019s waivers could directly apply.", "The senator based her claim on a study by the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, according to her spokeswoman Bianca Recto. The CAP study in turn generated state-by-state figures based on a national estimate that the Department of Health and Human Services issued just before President Obama left office.", "That Jan. 5 HHS report found that the percentage of Americans under age 65 who have preexisting medical conditions falls in a rather broad range \u2014 somewhere between 23 percent and 51 percent of the population \u2014 depending on what conditions are included. But the CAP, and Cortez Masto, used only the high end of the range.", "The HHS report said \u201cas many as\u201d 51 percent of Americans had conditions that \u201ccould\u201d lead to denial of coverage, or higher rates without the ACA\u2019s protections. That\u2019s counting people with common conditions including arthritis, asthma, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity.", "But using a narrower definition, HHS found the figure was 23 percent. That\u2019s counting only such serious conditions as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and others that HHS said would cause individuals to be \u201coutright rejected for coverage by private insurers.\u201d", "The HHS report hedged its findings, saying \u201cup to\u201d 51 percent of the under-65 population \u201cmay\u201d have a preexisting condition and \u201ccould\u201d have been denied coverage, or offered coverage only at an exorbitant price, if seeking coverage in the pre-ACA individual market.", "But possibility morphed to certainty by the time Cortez Masto spoke. She said Nevada\u2019s share of this high-end estimate \u201cwould\u201d lose coverage or pay \u201cunaffordable\u201d rates if the GOP bill became law.", "The waivers to allow pricing based on health status apply only to the individual market. But we\u2019ll note that some experts have said that employer plans could be affected by the waivers on essential health benefits. The EHBs are used to determine which benefits are subject to the ACA\u2019s ban on annual and lifetime limits, as well as the cap on policyholders\u2019 out-of-pocket spending, in employer plans.", "But the CBO said it expected that benefits in large-group plans \u201cwould probably not be noticeably affected\u201d by states getting such waivers. The CBO explains:", "CBO, May 24: For the large-group market, which generally consists of employers with more than 50 employees, current regulations allow employers to choose the EHB benchmark plan of any state in which they operate. Because of those regulations, a large employer operating in multiple states, including one that elected an EHB waiver, could base all of the plans it offers on the EHB requirements in a state with the waiver. That decision could allow annual and lifetime limits on benefits not included in the state\u2019s EHBs. However, large employers already have considerable flexibility in the range of the benefits they include in their plans, so CBO and JCT expect that their benefit offerings would probably not be noticeably affected by the actions of states.", "Congressional and administration spokespeople have told reporters that the intent of the bill isn\u2019t to impact employer plans in this way and\u00a0any ambiguity could be remedied through guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services.", "The GOP bill does offer fewer protections for people with preexisting conditions than under current law. But saying that everyone with a health condition \u201cwould\u201d be affected goes way too far, and it has become a pattern. Our fact-checking colleagues at the Washington Post found Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California making a similar claim in May about those at risk nationwide. And we wrote about such Democratic exaggerations way back in 2011.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
