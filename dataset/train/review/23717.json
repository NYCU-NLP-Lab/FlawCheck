["After sidestepping nearly every significant tradition in\u00a0the transfer of power, now former President Donald Trump did uphold one routine of an\u00a0outgoing president \u2014\u00a0leaving his predecessor a note.", "President Joe Biden \u2014\u00a0alongside Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014\u00a0was inaugurated on\u00a0Jan. 20.", "However, despite no evidence of widespread fraud and\u00a0dozens of failures in court, some of Trump's supporters and allies are continuing to push baseless conspiracy theories about a stolen election.", "Following the revelation that Trump had left Biden a note, people took to social media to speculate about whatit said.", "One Instagram post, from a Florida-based lifestyle account, shared an image of a note that reads \"Joe, you know I won,\" with the supposed signature of Trump on White House stationery.

Trump received a letter from Obama in 2017, which said in part, \"Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it\u2019s up to us to leave those instruments of\u00a0our democracy at least as strong as we found them.\u201d", "Before Biden's inauguration, White House spokesperson Judd Deere confirmed that Trump had left a letter for Biden.\u00a0The contents of the letter were not released.", "\"It\u2019s a letter between 45 and 46,\" Deere said.", "After his inauguration, Biden confirmed to reporters that he had received the\u00a0letter from Trump, noting that it was \"very generous.\"", "Biden also did not release the contents of Trump's letter, saying\u00a0\"because it was private, I won't talk about it until I talk to him.\"", "It's unclear if the note means the two will end up having\u00a0a conversation.", "According to White House Press Secretary\u00a0Jen Psaki, there is no planned call between Trump and Biden.", "Fact check:Attendance at Biden's inauguration was restricted by COVID-19 pandemic", "There is no evidence that the letter depicted on social me\u00a0is real. The contents of the post's\u00a0letter also contradict Biden's assessment of it being \"very generous.\"", "Additionally, the seal at the top of the letter does not match the seals used on other letters from Trump that have been made public, like this one. The letter posted to Instagram is also dated \"20th January 2021,\" instead of the typical date formatting with the month first, followed by the day.", "Lastly, the letter's assertion that Trump won the election is false. Election officials, both Republicans and Democrats,\u00a0have confirmed that there was no widespread voter fraud and lawsuits alleging fraud have been largely unsuccessful.", "Fact check:Viral TikTok alters Army Band's music to 'Hit the Road Jack'", "We rate this claim as FALSE, based on our research.
