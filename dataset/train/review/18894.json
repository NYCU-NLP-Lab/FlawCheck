But a state election official later said no Wisconsin ballots were found.

What caught our attention was that, it turned out, one of his claims had a Wisconsin twist.", "\"As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster,\" Trump said in the debate. \"They're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There's fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket.\"", "Several minutes later he circled back to the waterway claim amid another rundown of supposed fraud.", "\"Did you see what's going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots,\" Trump claimed. \"They're being sold. They're being dumped in rivers.

And on Sept. 29, as is the case now, Trump\u2019s statement was wrong in both the literal claim (a \"river\") and the implication (that this is evidence of fraud). A small number of ballots were found with hundreds of pieces of other mail, and authorities have said nothing to indicate election manipulation motivated the incident.", "The information released after the debate \u2014 that no Wisconsin ballots were found \u2014 muddles the situation given the apparent conflict with earlier information.
