["About this rating", "On 20 March 2016, the Now8News web site published an article reporting that a woman claiming to be pregnant and in distress had a dead kitten removed from her vaginal canal in the emergency room:", "Police were called out to a Las Vegas hospital today after a woman entered the emergency room screaming, \u201cHelp my baby.\u201d The 38-year-old woman, Janice Warmington, entered the East Las Vegas hospital complaining of pains in her stomach, telling the nurses she was in her first trimester of pregnancy. They immediately placed her in one of the emergency room beds and performed an ultrasound examination. What doctors found, was absolutely repulsive and shocking.", "\u201cWe began with an ultrasound examination so we could see the condition of the baby,\u201d said attending physician Robert Steinberg. \u201cHowever, what we saw on the screen had us confused so we proceeded with a vaginal examination.

And when they pulled it out, the woman went even more insane.", "Warmington reportedly told the nurses that she is unable to have children and just wanted to \u201cFeel what it was like to have a living being\u2026 life, moving around inside of her.\u201d", "The  report was reproduced by dozens of fly-by-night \"viral news sites\" after its initial appearance:", "The article (like all of Now8News' content) was entirely fabricated.  Now8News is a clickbait fake news site that masquerades as a local television news outlet's web presence.   The photograph purportedly depicting the dead kitten in a surgical environment was in fact a stock image of surgeons' tools, blurred to suggest the original photo contained something graphic (it did not):", "Previous Now8News hoax articles (often replicated by other \"viral news\" sites) include similar claims a\u00a0man had sexual relations with a pig in a Walmart bathroom, aborted fetuses were discovered in McDonald's Chicken McNuggets, Walmart bananas were contaminated with a deadly parasitic worm, a woman engaged in a\u00a0sex act with a sausage at a Walmart, a separate woman was arrested for sampling feminine hygiene items in an aisle at a Walmart, a man fed his unfaithful fiancee's remains to her unsuspecting parents, and a woman gave birth to twins in a casket after being buried alive by her husband.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
