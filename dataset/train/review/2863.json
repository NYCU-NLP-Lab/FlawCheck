["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on September 24, 2019", "Viral posts falsely claim Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke can\u2019t own a gun due to a felony. O\u2019Rourke has not been convicted of a felony.", "Social media users have spread viral posts that falsely call Beto O\u2019Rourke a \u201cfelon\u201d and claim that the Democratic presidential candidate cannot own a firearm. (In fact, the former congressman from El Paso, Texas, has said that he inherited guns from a great uncle.)", "The posts use the deception to suggest that O\u2019Rourke is ill-positioned to advocate for gun control. According to his campaign website, O\u2019Rourke supports universal background checks and wants to \u201cban the manufacturing, sale, and possession of military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\u201d He also has proposed\u00a0a \u201cmandatory buyback program for assault weapons and a voluntary buyback program for handguns.\u201d", "Federal law generally\u00a0prohibits someone \u201cwho has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d \u2014 under U.S. law, a felony \u2014 from possessing a gun.", "But O\u2019Rourke hasn\u2019t been convicted of such a crime.", "El Paso County court records available online show two criminal cases \u2014 both misdemeanors \u2014 involving O\u2019Rourke. The records align with the arrests that O\u2019Rourke has publicly addressed before: a 1995 trespassing incident and a 1998 charge of driving while intoxicated, or DWI.", "The first incident occurred at the University of Texas at El Paso on May 19, 1995. A police report describes the matter as \u201cattempted forcible entry\u201d and \u201cattempted burglary,\u201d and says O\u2019Rourke and two friends entered a facilities plant and triggered an intrusion alarm. O\u2019Rourke has said he was arrested \u201cafter jumping a fence\u201d at the site. An El Paso County court record shows that no charges relating to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s arrest on that date were ever prosecuted.", "Records obtained and published by the Texas Tribune and Houston Chronicle also show O\u2019Rourke was arrested on Sept. 27, 1998, in Anthony, Texas, after he lost control of his car, struck a truck traveling in the same direction, and then crossed the median into a lane for incoming traffic.", "O\u2019Rourke failed a subsequent breathalyzer test, according to the incident report, and was charged with DWI \u2014 which records list as a misdemeanor, not a felony. The police report also says O\u2019Rourke tried to flee the scene. O\u2019Rourke has denied that detail, but the officers involved have said they stand by their report.", "The El Paso County case record shows that the DWI charge was dismissed following O\u2019Rourke\u2019s completion of a \u201cDWI School\u201d as part of a \u201cmisdemeanor diversion\u201d program.", "O\u2019Rourke has spoken about the DWI offense before. In a 2018 Houston Chronicle op-ed, he called the incident a \u201cserious mistake for which there is no excuse.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
