Elizabeth Warren announced on New Year\u2019s Eve that she has formed an exploratory committee for president, an internet conspiracy theorist falsely claimed that she is taking an anti-psychotic medication.", "David Zublick, who runs a website that pushes the thoroughly debunked \u201cpizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton, posted the claim about Warren on Facebook and Twitter. He also has a YouTube channel with more than 125,000 subscribers.", "We\u2019ve written about Zublick\u2019s bunk before when he wrote a story claiming that President Donald Trump called for a new branch of the military called the \u201cspace force\u201d (that actually happened) following communications with aliens (that did not happen). The part about aliens had been lifted largely from an old story on a satirical website.", "Zublick\u2019s claim about Warren was also lifted from elsewhere. When reached by phone, Zublick was unable to provide any evidence to support the claim that the Democratic senator is on Risperdal, an anti-psychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia, mania, and bipolar disorder. He told us that his posts were based entirely on a tweet from another Twitter user, although he said he couldn\u2019t remember which one.", "A cached version of Twitter shows that a user by the name of @Anonamis6 posted a now deleted tweet on Dec. 31 that is, word-for-word, the same as Zublick\u2019s. It says: \u201cBREAKING: According to sources Senator Elizabeth Warren has been on Risperdal since first being prescribed the drug in 2011. Risperdal is used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability caused by autism\u2026..developing.\u201d Zublick\u2019s posts on Facebook and Twitter appeared a day later.", "A spokeswoman for Warren, Kristen Orthman, responded to the claim in an emailed statement to FactCheck.org that said: \u201cShe has never been prescribed, nor has she ever taken Risperdal.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Warren, Elizabeth (@ewarren). \u201cEvery person in America should be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules, & take care of themselves & the people they love. That\u2019s what I\u2019m fighting for, & that\u2019s why I\u2019m launching an exploratory committee for president.
