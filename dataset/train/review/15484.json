["Recently, an image of Jawaharlal Nehru was shared by a few users on social media, suggesting that the first Prime Minister of India was thrashed by a mob after \u201cfailure on China war\u201d in 1962.", "In 2016, Twitter user Mahveer Mehta also circulated the image. He claimed that Nehru was thrashed by people \u201calong J&K for failure on China war\u201d. Mehta is followed on Twitter by PM Modi and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office.

The oldest instance that Alt News found was from 2013.", "Several websites/blogs have also shared the same picture through the years.", "Earlier this month, the same image was shared with an altered narrative suggesting that the former Prime Minister was arrested in 1946 when he attempted to enter Kashmir without a visa. The identical claim was also shared in August 2018 by an individual user on Facebook. It attracted 3,400 shares.", "This is how Mr Ramchand Kak then PM of J&K State Kashmir arrested Nehru to enter in Kashmir without visa\u2026 How Kashmir is integral part of so called democratic India.", "Posted by Bashir Shahdhar on Friday, 31 August 2018", "Several other pages and users, including those who identify themselves as a part of \u201cIndia occupied Kashmir\u201d, circulated the photograph with the identical claim.", "Alt News cropped out the text from the image, reverse searched it on Google and found that it was published by Outlook Magazine in 2014. The photograph was captioned \u2013 \u201cBraced for the worst: Nehru is prevented from plunging into a riotous crowd in 1962, before the war\u201d. The picture was attributed to AP (Associated Press).", "We searched for the image in the archives of AP with the keywords \u201cNehru 1962\u201d and found that it was indeed taken that year, however, the narrative used was false. AP described the image as \u2013 \u201cA security man grabbed Indian Prime Minister Nehru to keep him from plunging into a riotous crowd at a meeting of the Congress Party in Patna, India, January 1962. Later in the year, Communist China\u2019s attack on India plunged Nehru into new troubles.\u201d This implies that the photograph was taken before the Indo-Sino war in 1962.", "As the image was captioned as \u2013 \u201cmeeting of the Congress Party in Patna, India, January 1962\u201d, we looked for newspaper editions published at the time. While rummaging through January 1962 publications of The Indian Express on news.google.com/newspapers, we found an article that pertained to the incident.", "The January 6, 1962 edition of The Indian Express has an article titled \u2013 \u201cOpen Session Adjourns Amidst Disorder.

The article further mentions that Nehru, who has \u201chandled crowds all his life\u201d was only partially successful at controlling them. \u201cAt one stage, an angry Nehru, completely oblivious to his own safety, used his fists and hit out at security men and Congress leaders who prevented him from jumping into the crowd\u2026\u201d", "Another publication The Florence Times, on January 8, 1962, had also reported the incident as \u2013 \u201cSecurity men hold back Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to prevent him from plunging into a disorderly crowd in Patna, India, Friday, in personal effort to restore order. A wild demonstration by Indian peasants broke up this meeting of Nehru\u2019s Congress Party and set 24 persons to the hospital.\u201d", "The articles and the Associated Press description of the image match, therefore, claims of Nehru being \u201cthrashed by a mob due to failure on China war\u201d are completely false.", "The other narrative used to circulate the image \u2013 \u201cNehru was arrested while trying to illegally enter Kashmir without a passport\u201d \u2013 also stands untrue as we have conclusively established the origin of the photograph. In 1946, Nehru was indeed stopped from entering Kashmir to represent politician Sheikh Abdullah who started the \u2018Quit Kashmir Movement\u2019, advocating for self-rule in the state. The then Prime Minister of (the princely state of) Kashmir, Ram Chandra Kak, barred Nehru\u2019s entry into the state and put him in arrest.

As with the aforementioned case, a photograph of an incident unrelated to the claims being made was notoriously shared to malign the reputation of India\u2019s first Prime Minister. Earlier, an image of the former PM was falsely shared as him attending an RSS shakha meeting.
