(Laura Skelding photo/2006 Austin American-Statesman)", "Still got your \"Kinky for Governor: How Hard Could It Be?\" t-shirt? Humorist, author and singer Kinky Friedman told the Dallas Morning News he\u2019s considering another run.\n\nIn an Aug. 1, 2012, commentary, Morning News political writer Wayne Slater quoted Friedman as saying that Gov. Rick \"Perry has created a state that\u2019s first in business climate and 49th in education. What\u2019s wrong with that picture?\"\n\nFriedman ran for governor as an independent in 2006 and for Texas agriculture commissioner as a Democrat in 2010. This time, he told Slater, he\u2019d go after Perry\u2019s job as a Democrat and with a more serious approach.\n\nBy email, we interviewed Friedman spokesman Cleve Hattersley, who worked on the 2006 gubernatorial campaign.\n\nHattersley said Friedman was referring to a recent \"business climate\" ranking from CNBC and state education spending rankings from the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union. He sent us an NEA report plus a Huffington Post news story and an education professor\u2019s blog analysis with more numbers, and noted, \"Kinky has no campaign staff and no fact-checking apparatus, so he was speaking somewhat anecdotally \u2026 His numbers may have been a bit off.\"\n\nThe rationale for evaluating Texas education based on spending, Hattersley said, is \"that spending affects education on every level, and does so far into the future. Everything from teachers to textbooks is affected.\"\n\nWe set out to check Friedman\u2019s measures and give context with other rankings. We set aside the Perry part of the claim; PolitiFact has found many times that governors don\u2019t merit sole credit or blame for the state of a state.\n\nAs to business climate, the picture\u2019s pretty clear. Texas is tops:", "On education, Hattersley pointed us to five tables in the NEA\u2019s December 2011 report on education spending in 2008-09. The five rankings he cited are based on varied ways to calculate per-student spending from state, local and federal sources combined. Texas averages 41st on those five lists, Hattersley (correctly) noted.\n\nThe Oct. 10, 2011, Huffington Post news story Hattersley sent us cited a report from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (which analyzed data from the National Center for Education Statistics). Looking at state budgets only, the report ranked Texas 3rd in percentage cuts of education spending and 7th in dollars cut. Flipping the rankings to make comparison easier, Texas would have been 47th and 43rd on lists ranking states by the smallest cuts in state funding.\n\nThe blog post Hattersley cited is an Oct. 4, 2010, entry on the personal blog of Rutgers University Graduate School of Education professor Bruce Baker. Texas averaged 43rd on the post\u2019s five bar charts analyzing 2007-08 state and local spending per student.\n\nWe checked some other measures as well:", "Because Friedman\u2019s claim referred to \"education\" rather than specifying \"education spending,\" we looked up a few student performance measures as well.\n\u00a0\nTexas placed between 12th and 39th on these lists and was near national SAT averages:", "We also looked at \"adequate yearly progress,\" a measure that\u2019s been in the news recently as data for the 2011-12 school year emerges. States are required by the federal No Child Left Behind Act to assess such progress, but each state sets its own standards and benchmarks.\n\nAn Aug. 8, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story said the Texas Education Agency reported 44.2 percent of schools met the state\u2019s \"adequate yearly progress\" standards.\n\nHow does that compare with other states? We found 2011 state-by-state percentages calculated by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center on Education Policy, though deputy director Diane Stark Rentner warned us not to use them for a \"ranking,\" noting again that each state sets its own standards. Recklessly we plunged ahead, using the center\u2019s collection of data for 2011 (when TEA reported 66 percent of Texas schools hit the mark) to generate our own statistically silly list, on which Texas placed 11th. But again: This compares oranges to apples.\n\nHattersley acknowledged that the backup he provided doesn\u2019t substantiate Friedman\u2019s claim on Texas education. But according to the Morning News interview, we can expect better-researched positions if The Other Man in Black launches a fresh gubernatorial bid.\n\nWould a more serious campaign mean no more \"He Ain\u2019t Kinky, He\u2019s My Governor\" stickers? \"The discussions to which I have been privy are quite serious,\" Hattersley told us, \"but good slogans have always been players in political campaigns.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nFriedman nailed the state\u2019s No. 1 business ranking. But his claim that Texas is 49th in education lacks supporting evidence. That said, Texas usually lands in the bottom half of the states, according to education spending and student achievement measures.\n\nWe rate Friedman\u2019s claim Half True.", "Dallas Morning News commentary, \"Kinky Friedman says he may run for governor again,\" Aug. 1, 2012\n\nEmail interviews with Cleve Hattersley, spokesman for Kinky Friedman, Aug. 10-14, 2012\n\nCNBC rankings, \"Top States for Business,\" July 10, 2012\n\nSite Selection magazine rankings, \"Top U.S. Business Climates,\" November 2011\n\n Chief Executive magazine rankings, \"Best States for Business,\" May 2, 2012\n\nNational Education Association, \"NEA Rankings and Estimates,\" December 2011\n\nHuffington Post news story, \"K-12 Education Funding: Most States At Levels Lower Than Pre-Recession, Cut Spending This Year ,\" Oct. 10, 2011\n\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities report, \"New school year brings steep cuts in state funding for schools,\" Oct. 7, 2011\n\nSchool Finance 101 blog, \"State ranking madness: Who spends most/least?,\" Oct. 4, 2010\n\nEmail interview with Bruce Baker, Rutgers University Graduate School of Education, Aug. 16, 2012\n\nEducation Week rankings, \"Quality Counts 2011\" and \"Quality Counts 2012\"\n\nFederal Education Budget Project of New America Foundation, \"Per Pupil Expenditure,\" accessed online Aug. 17, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Hannah Rose Sacks, research analyst at Editorial Projects in Education Research Center, Aug. 16-17, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Diane Stark Rentner, deputy director of the Center on Education Policy, Aug. 16-17, 2012\n\nFederal Education Budget Project of New America Foundation, \"K-12\" analysis, accessed online Aug. 17, 2012\n\nCollege Board, \"2011 SAT Trends\"\n\nAustin American-Statesman news story, \"48 percent of Texas schools fail federal standards,\" Aug. 8, 2012\n\nCenter on Education Policy report, \"AYP Results for 2010-11 \u2014 May 2012 Update\"", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
