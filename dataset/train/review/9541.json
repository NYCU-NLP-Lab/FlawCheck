["By Robert Farley", "Posted on November 14, 2019", "President Donald Trump wrongly claimed that the two \u201c\u2018star\u2019 witnesses\u201d from the first day of public impeachment hearings \u201cstared straight ahead with a blank look on their face, remained silent, & were unable to answer\u201d when asked whether Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president constituted an impeachable offense.", "That\u2019s not what happened.", "Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe asked witnesses William Taylor, the charge d\u2019affaires ad interim\u00a0at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs in the State Department, if either were there to \u201cassert there was an impeachable offense in that call.\u201d Taylor paused and then attempted to respond. Ratcliffe cut him off, then withdrew the question. But Taylor got an opportunity to respond anyway, saying that neither he nor Kent was there \u201cto decide about impeachment. \u2026 This is your job.\u201d", "Though Trump asserted on the day of the impeachment hearing that he hadn\u2019t watched \u201cone minute\u201d of it, the following morning on Twitter the president drew attention to the exchange Ratcliffe had with the two witnesses that occurred nearly four hours into the hearing.", "Trump claimed Ratcliffe\u2019s question about whether there was an impeachable event in the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stumped Taylor and Kent. Trump then commented, \u201cThat would be the end of a case run by normal people! \u2013 but not Shifty!\u201d (\u201cShifty\u201d is the president\u2019s derogatory nickname for Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, who is running the hearings.)", ".@RepRatcliffe asked the two \u201cstar\u201d witnesses, \u201cwhere is the impeachable event in that call?\u201d Both stared straight ahead with a blank look on their face, remained silent, & were unable to answer the question. That would be the end of a case run by normal people! \u2013 but not Shifty!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 14, 2019", "But as we said, Trump is mischaracterizing the exchange.", "It began when Ratcliffe asked, \u201cIn this impeachment hearing today, where we impeach presidents for treason or bribery or other high crimes, where is the impeachable offense in that call? Are either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call? Shout it out. Anyone?\u201d", "Contrary to Trump\u2019s account that Taylor and Kent \u201cstared straight ahead with a blank look on their face, remained silent, & were unable to answer the question,\u201d Taylor briefly paused and then did attempt to answer Ratcliffe\u2019s question.", "Taylor began, \u201cMr. Ratcliffe, if I could just respond. Let me just reiterate that I\u2019m not here \u2026\u201d But then Ratcliffe cut him off. \u201cI\u2019ve got one minute left,\u201d Ratcliffe said.", "According to rules of the House of Representatives, members of Congress are limited to \u201cthe five-minute rule during the questioning of witnesses in a hearing until such time as each member of the committee who so desires has had an opportunity to question each witness.\u201d Ratcliffe was concerned his remaining time would be eaten up by Taylor\u2019s answer.", "Ratcliffe and Taylor then talked over each other for a brief time, until Ratcliffe said, \u201cI withdraw the question.\u201d", "But Taylor kept talking anyway. \u201cI\u2019m not here to take one side or the other,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s your decision.\u201d", "After more back and forth of the two talking over each other, Ratcliffe asked for his five-minute clock to be suspended, because he withdrew the question. Schiff allowed the suspension, and Taylor was permitted to answer without it counting against Ratcliffe\u2019s time.", "\u201cMr. Ratcliffe, I would just like to say that I\u2019m not here to do anything having to do with, to decide about impeachment,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat is not what either of us [he and Kent] are here to do. This is your job.\u201d", "That response is consistent with comments Taylor made at the start of his testimony.", "Taylor, Nov. 13: I want to emphasize at the outset that while I am aware that the committee has requested my testimony as part of impeachment proceedings, I am not here to take one side or the other or to advocate for any particular outcome of these proceedings. My sole purpose is to provide facts as I know them about the incidents in question, as well as my views about the strategic importance of Ukraine to the United States.", "You can watch the full exchange via C-SPAN below.", "Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, also tweeted the first part of the exchange, commenting \u201c*crickets*\u201d to suggest the two witnesses had no response to Ratcliffe\u2019s question. The video attached to the tweet captures the pause but conveniently cuts off just as Taylor is about to respond.", ".@RepRatcliffe: \"Are either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call?

Taylor did respond, and his answer did not vindicate the president.", "We should also note, as we have before, there is more to the impeachment inquiry than just the July 25 phone call.", "Government officials who have testified in the House impeachment probe have discussed a campaign to pressure Zelensky to make a public statement that he would open an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden and Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had served. Taylor and others have testified that the pressure included the withholding of U.S. security aid, and the dangling of a White House visit for Zelensky.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
