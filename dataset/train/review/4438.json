Now you\u2019ve got law enforcement officers wanting to try and stop the violent situation, but you\u2019ve got to admit they\u2019re humans and they don\u2019t know. Where they would push in a little more, they\u2019re not drawing back and that\u2019s got to be a part of the crime, and a majority of the crime are all these people who have hijacked peaceful protests and they\u2019re killing the very people that they profess to be representing or helping.", "This is a very dangerous time in American history.
