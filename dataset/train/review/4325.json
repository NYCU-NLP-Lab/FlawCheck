["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on March 17, 2021 | Updated on May 14, 2021", "A Food and Drug Administration presentation on monitoring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines listed possible adverse events the agency might track. But an Instagram post misrepresents the document, falsely claiming it shows the vaccines are known to cause harmful side effects \u2014 including death.", "No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.", "One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS \u201cis not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.\u201d", "Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it\u2019s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.", "Another monitoring system is the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.", "In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.", "The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.", "For more, see \u201cHow safe are the vaccines?\u201d", "Link to this", "Common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain and fever.", "Data from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials also show the side effects included joint pain and chills. These reactions are more likely after the second dose of those vaccines, given several weeks after the first, and are more common and severe in younger people. The Johnson & Johnson side effects, too, were more common in 18- to 59-year-old participants, and also included nausea.", "As the CDC explains, these common side effects are normal signs that your body is beginning to mount an immune response and the symptoms should go away within several days. Some people have no side effects, and that is normal, too.", "Rarely, the COVID-19 vaccines may cause more serious problems.", "For more information on these rare adverse events, see \u201cHow safe are the vaccines?\u201d", "Link to this", "A popular\u00a0Instagram post cites a government document to falsely claim that federal officials know that the COVID-19 vaccines cause death and other dangerous side effects \u2014 \u201cyet will not publicly warn\u201d citizens.", "The image \u2014 shared on Instagram accounts such as \u201cawaken_the_mind,\u201d \u201cthe_truth_hunters\u201d and \u201cthe_truth_hunters_2\u201d \u2014 claims: \u201cFDA DOCUMENTS: mRNA VACCINE CAUSES DEATH + 21 SIDE EFFECTS.\u201d It goes on to allege that an \u201cinternal FDA document revealed a shocking revilation\u201d about the purported side effects \u2014 such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, stroke, autoimmune disease and \u201cpregnancy & birth outcomes.\u201d", "But the post is wrong. The Food and Drug Administration presentation cited, which is actually publicly available, doesn\u2019t say that. And as we\u2019ve previously reported, there is no evidence that vaccines have caused any deaths. As of March 15, the CDC reported that it has found \u201cno evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.\u201d", "The \u201cmRNA\u201d refers to one of the ways that COVID-19 vaccines are designed. The first two vaccines approved in the U.S. \u2014 one from Pfizer/BioNTech and the other from Moderna \u2014 both use modified messenger RNA, or mRNA, to provide instructions for cells to make spike proteins. That triggers an immune response against the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. (For more, see our SciCheck stories, \u201cA Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine\u201c\u00a0and \u201cA Guide to Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine.\u201d)", "The third vaccine approved in the U.S., a one-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, is designed differently and does not use mRNA.", "The link cited at the bottom of the Instagram post goes to a presentation by Steve Anderson, who directs the Office of Biostatistics & Epidemiology at the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER. That presentation was given at an Oct. 30 meeting by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a committee that provides vaccine-related guidance for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "Anderson\u2019s report outlined a variety of ways that CBER would monitor vaccine safety upon rollout. The government uses\u00a0several monitoring systems to that end.", "One slide in Anderson\u2019s presentation showed a \u201c[w]orking list of possible adverse event outcomes\u201d that the FDA planned to monitor \u2014 the list now cited in the Instagram post. It wasn\u2019t addressing mRNA vaccines in particular, as the Instagram post claims.", "And the presentation didn\u2019t say the vaccines actually are known to cause those health issues, let alone kill people. The same misrepresentation was made by a dubious website in December and debunked by our fact-checking colleagues at PolitiFact and the Associated Press.", "An FDA spokesperson told us that \u201cthe document cited is a slide deck on how FDA would plan to conduct safety surveillance on a potential COVID-19 vaccine once authorized\u201d and noted the same deck was also presented at an earlier FDA advisory committee meeting in October.", "\u201cNo specific COVID-19 vaccine was discussed at that meeting, but rather that meeting was held to discuss \u2014 in general \u2014 the criteria FDA may take into account when making a decision about emergency use authorization for a COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe list of adverse events on slide 16 is a list of possible outcomes that the FDA could potentially monitor for when conducting safety surveillance once a vaccine was authorized.\u201d", "Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University, told us in a phone interview that it\u2019s \u201cunfortunate\u201d that the list \u2014 part of a precautionary safety process \u2014 is being misconstrued to wrongly suggest that the vaccines are dangerous.", "There\u2019s a difference between a report of an adverse event following immunization and an adverse event caused by the vaccine, he said. Officials develop a list of adverse events following immunization to monitor in order to proactively ensure the vaccine rollout is safe. The list is compiled by experts using a variety of factors; for example, officials may want to track outcomes associated with the disease from which the vaccines are designed to protect.", "By tracking specific adverse events that are reported through its various surveillance systems, the government can conduct rapid analyses to determine whether any observed events following vaccination are more common than expected, Salmon said. In other words, experts can assess whether any health outcomes that are observed are consistent with what would be expected in a given population.", "\u201cThe message here should be: government\u2019s being careful, being cautious, being prudent,\u201d he said.", "According to the CDC, the ongoing monitoring of the COVID-19 vaccines is \u201cthe most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.\u201d And in the months since the distortion first spread, tens of millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have been safely administered in the country.", "With more than 109 million doses administered in the U.S. as of March 15, the CDC says, it received 1,913 reports through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System of deaths that took place after someone received a vaccine. As we\u2019ve explained before, reports of deaths through VAERS do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused an adverse event, since anyone can submit reports \u2014 regardless of whether an immunization is thought to have contributed to the event.", "CDC and FDA physicians review the facts surrounding each death reported through VAERS. And the CDC reported on March 15: \u201cA review of available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records revealed no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.\u201d", "Many people who get the vaccines experience mild side effects \u2014 such as pain at the injection site, a headache, chills or fever \u2014 the CDC notes. A \u201csmall number of people have had a\u00a0severe allergic reaction\u00a0(called \u2018anaphylaxis\u2019) after vaccination, but this is extremely\u00a0rare. If this occurs, vaccination providers have medicines available to effectively and immediately treat the reaction.\u201d", "Update, May 14: After investigating 15 cases of a rare clotting condition out of nearly 8 million Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration are warning of a suggested increased risk of the dangerous condition, which occurred in women and resulted in three deaths as of April 21. The CDC says \u201cwomen younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen.\u201d As of May 11, 28 cases had been identified out of more than 9 million J&J vaccines administered.
