Mary and Roger Jones, both 32, and their daughter, Julie, 11, were all killed after the car filled with water.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a tragic, horrible thing,\u201d said carwash owner Joe Goldsmith. \u201cThing is, we have signs everywhere reminding people to close their windows. The water comes fast and furious, and it\u2019s dangerous to have windows open. This is the first time in my 40 years as a carwash owner that something like this has happened, though.\u201d", "This story is a fabrication.\u00a0Empire News\u00a0is a purveyor of fake and satirical news. \u00a0Its \"About/Disclaimer\" page reads:", "Empire News is intended for entertainment purposes only.
