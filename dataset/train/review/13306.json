["About this rating", "On 11 August 2017, the disreputable web site Neon Nettle posted a story reporting that Russia's president Vladimir Putin made remarks indicating that the United States was threatening war with North Korea not over nuclear weapons, but because of hopes of exploiting \"trillions\" of dollars worth in minerals supposedly untapped in the normally isolated, autocratic nation.", "Neon Nettle attributes the following remarks to the Russian president:", "[North Korea] don't have any nuclear weapons. This is a lie being forced on the people by the corporate-owned Western media.", "They know they can easily provoke the North Koreans and they will react, but the story that they are a threat is false. I will tell you the facts about North Korea: They don't have nuclear bombs. They don't have Western-controlled banks. They don't depend on the US dollar. What they do have is a land full of wealth in unmined minerals.", "We could find no evidence that Putin made these remarks \u2014 the comment is not quoted in any publication outside of Neon Nettle, a web site that propagates and pushes conspiracy theories and fake news. For example, Neon Nettle was one of the many disreputable web sites that pushed the thoroughly debunked PizzaGate conspiracy theory, which also held that Hillary Clinton was involved with a pedophile ring being run out of a New York pizza parlor. They also reported (again falsely) that Soundgarden and Linkin Park singers Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington, respectively, had been murdered because they were about to reveal a pedophile ring. (Both men committed suicide, and there has been absolutely no evidence that they were aware of or otherwise involved in a pedophile ring.)", "We found no evidence that Putin made these remarks, although Neon Nettle does accurately cite the online business magazine Quartz, which did report that North Korea may be sitting on mineral deposits worth vast sums of money:", "Estimates as to the value of the nation\u2019s mineral resources have varied greatly over the years, made difficult by secrecy and lack of access. North Korea itself has made what are likely exaggerated claims about them. According to one estimate from a South Korean state-owned mining company, they\u2019re worth over $6 trillion. Another from a South Korean research institute puts the amount closer to $10 trillion.", "As to the other part of the claim that North Korea \"doesn't have any nuclear weapons\", it is apparently false, because Pyongyang has been testing them.", "Greenberg, Jay. \u00a0 \u00a0\"Putin: North Korea Doesn't Have Nuclear Weapons, It Has Trillions in Minerals.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 NeonNettle.com. \u00a0 \u00a011 August 2017.", "Greenberg, Jay. \u00a0 \u00a0\"FBI Insider: Pizzagate Pedophile Ring Arrests Are Now Imminent.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 NeonNettle.com. \u00a0 \u00a03 February 2017.", "Greenberg, Jay. \u00a0 \u00a0\"Chester Bennington was About to Expose the Truth Behind Chris Cornell's Death.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 NeonNettle.com. \u00a0 \u00a021 July 2017.", "Mollman, Steve. \u00a0 \u00a0\"North Korea Is Sitting on Trillions of Dollars of Untapped Wealth, and Its Neighbors Want In.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Quartz. \u00a0 \u00a016 July 2017.", "Keck, Zachary. \u00a0 \u00a0\"North Korea May Have Two-Thirds of World\u2019s Rare Earths.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The Diplomatic. \u00a0 \u00a022 January 2014.", "BBC. \u00a0 \u00a0\"North Korea's Nuclear Programme: How Advanced Is It?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a010 August 2017.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
