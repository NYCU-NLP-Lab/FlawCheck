(Associate Press).", "Outbreaks of COVID-19 at meat-packing plants around the country \u2014\u00a0including several in Wisconsin \u2014\u00a0have raised concern nationwide over meat supplies.", "But one local official says those fears are overblown.", "In a Facebook post April 30, 2020, Waukesha County Executive Paul Farrow posted a image comparing \"rumor\" and \"fact\" about the meat supply locally. It read:", "RUMOR: The United States is facing a meat shortage because processing plants are closing due to COVID-19.", "FACT: Most meat processing plants across the US are still open. You may see short-term changes in meat selection or prices, but a shortage is not expected.", "Is Farrow right that no shortage is expected?", "There have been clusters of COVID-19 cases linked to meat packing facilities across the country, USA TODAY reported on April 22, 2020. Trump ordered meat packing to stay open, deeming them a \"critical\" industry.", "Wisconsin has seen a number of outbreaks.", "In Brown County, 290 cases are associated with JBS Packerland employees, 203cases with American Foods Group, and 35 cases with Salm Partners as of May 1, as reported by the Green Bay Press-Gazette.", "In Cudahy, officials reported 85 COVID-19 cases at the Patrick Cudahy plant as of May 1, according to FOX-6.", "Asked for evidence of the claim, a spokeswoman for Farrow said the county\u2019s emergency operations center reached out to local farmers and businesses and consulted with the Wisconsin Department of Trade and Consumer Protection to get an overview of the meat supply.", "\"Right now the overwhelming message for members of the public is not to panic buy or overstock meat supplies,\" Nicole Armendariz said in a May 1 email. \"At this time, there are some limitations to certain meat items and fluctuations in prices, but meat is available. There are concerns that panic buying by consumers could aggravate existing limitations.\"", "Armendariz also noted local suppliers said they have enough meat to meet customer demand at this point.", "So Farrow\u2019s evidence is focused on Waukesha County, which is referenced in the graphic he posted.", "But experts said the outbreak has disrupted the supply chain for meat throughout the country.", "USA TODAY reported on April 30 that the U.S. will see meat shortages despite Trump\u2019s order for meat packing plants to remain open.", "Jayson Lusk, head of Department of Agricultural Economics of Purdue University, told USA TODAY, \"The meat sector is in a real serious, critical condition.\" Lusk said there will just be limited availability of certain products, depending on where you live.", "However, Lusk and other experts said most Americans will still be able to buy meat.", "USA TODAY reported meat production in the week of April 20 was 75% of what it had been that time last year.
