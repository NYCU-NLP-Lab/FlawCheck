["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on December 16, 2020", "An Instagram post falsely claims that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting all pneumonia and influenza deaths as caused by COVID-19. That\u2019s wrong and is based on a misreading of one type of monitoring the agency conducts.", "It\u2019s difficult to know exactly how deadly COVID-19 is, but as the World Health Organization has written, studies estimate that the infection fatality ratio, or percentage of deaths out of all infections, is between 0.5% and 1%. The true rate isn\u2019t clear, since the pandemic is ongoing and not all infections have been diagnosed.", "The observed case fatality rate, or percentage of deaths out of confirmed cases, was 1.2% in the United States as of April 6, 2022.", "An individual\u2019s risk of death may be significantly higher or lower than what these numbers suggest, depending on a person\u2019s age or health conditions.", "Link to this", "A prominent anti-vaccine activist\u2019s post on Instagram is misinforming users about the COVID-19 death toll by offering a misinterpretation of one way the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps tabs on the pandemic.", "The post, from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., wrongly claims that the \u201cCDC has officially acknowledged that it has quietly created a new mortality category : PIC, which groups Pneumonia and Influenza and Covid together\u2026 and reports them all as Covid deaths.\u201d", "\u201cIt appears that the new classification gives official imprimatur to a gimmick that CDC adopted early in the pandemic of counting Pneumonia and Influenza deaths as COVID in order to inflate mortality numbers,\u201d Kennedy wrote.", "Paired with his claim was a screenshot of part of a CDC web page focused on COVID-19 surveillance that does look at pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.", "But Kennedy\u2019s post \u2014 which accrued nearly 10,000 likes before it was deleted and has been re-posted by others on Instagram and Facebook \u2014 is wrong.", "\u201c[N]owhere on the CDC or NCHS sites does it say that CDC is counting all PIC deaths as COVID-19 deaths,\u201d Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics, told us in an email statement. \u201cThis is not true. Only the COVID-19 deaths are counted as COVID-19 deaths.\u201d", "He pointed out that the CDC\u2019s provisional death count for COVID-19 distinguishes between deaths attributed to COVID-19 and a category of deaths that includes pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19.", "The provisional death data runs on a lag, so the last few weeks\u2019 worth isn\u2019t complete. But, as of an update Dec. 16, the provisional death count reported 276,061\u00a0deaths attributed to COVID-19 between Feb. 1 and Dec. 12. That\u2019s compared to 423,212\u00a0deaths attributed to either pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 in that same period.", "So Kennedy\u2019s post is wrong that the CDC is simply reporting \u201cthem all as Covid deaths.\u201d If that was true, the reported COVID-19 death count would be much higher.", "The CDC\u2019s measure at the root of the claim \u2014 one that looks at pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19 together \u2014 is one that has a public health rationale and that is consistent with past practices, experts told us.", "The CDC has for years monitored deaths of pneumonia and influenza together as one measure of the flu\u2019s mortality \u2014 as archived CDC pages, such as one from January 2016, show. Influenza can cause pneumonia, and so can the novel coronavirus.", "\u201cThe PIC category was created as a surveillance indicator to monitor COVID-19 mortality, in the same way that we have used combined pneumonia and influenza deaths, for many years, to monitor influenza mortality,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cPneumonia tends to fluctuate in response to and along with influenza (and COVID-19). This is particularly useful where influenza (or COVID-19) mortality is underreported.\u201d", "Alex Washburne, a researcher who has studied the prevalence of the novel coronavirus by analyzing data on influenza-like illnesses, told us in an email that the \u201cCDC\u2019s mortality surveillance is a kind of \u2018syndromic surveillance\u2019 similar to their influenza-like illness surveillance, and it\u2019s a way to obtain very useful glimpses of disease burden from a somewhat clunky US health system.\u201d", "It makes sense that public health officials would use this surveillance as one way to monitor the pandemic, since there are several diagnosis codes that a doctor may use for a patient with COVID-19 symptoms \u2014 especially if a test result isn\u2019t available \u2014 said Washburne, now chief scientist and epidemiological consultant at Selva Analytics. For example, a patient might be recorded as having \u201cpneumonia of unknown cause.\u201d", "Washburne also said the PIC category \u201cis a useful dataset for disease burden due to respiratory pathogens, which itself is likely a useful category for understanding disease control & prevention (e.g. social distancing and mask-wearing may affect many respiratory pathogens).\u201d", "Dr. Justin Silverman, a Penn State assistant professor in the College of Information Science and Technology and assistant professor of medicine who co-authored the aforementioned study with Washburne, agreed. He told us in a phone interview that the PIC metric could be useful for multiple reasons, including \u201cto get a sense of, are we missing COVID deaths?\u201d", "But, Silverman said, \u201cno one\u2019s being misled, it\u2019s incredibly obvious\u201d \u2014 noting that the CDC\u2019s references to the PIC count are clearly labeled as such.", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
