Perdue has also spent a lot of his own money on television ads ridiculing his opponents.", "One of those opponents, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, recently challenged her fellow candidates to release their income taxes.

The television report did not say whether he was asked about releasing his tax returns.", "Four months later, in November, Perdue filled out a financial disclosure report with the U.S. Senate, as required by law. The disclosure forms, though, do not require a candidate to add up his or her entire wealth.", "The report shows Perdue was a board member of five corporations, collecting nearly $900,000.

Critics complained the summary didn\u2019t offer enough details about his finances.

It showed Perdue earned $55 million and paid $21 million in taxes, or 38 percent, over that period. Over the 10 years of tax returns reviewed by the AJC, Perdue donated about $1 million to charities, or just under 2 percent of his income.", "The Associated Press also reported it has looked at Perdue\u2019s returns, along with Gingrey\u2019s and Handel\u2019s.
