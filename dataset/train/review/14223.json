A crowd of hundreds of people had gathered that also began stone-pelting. The tribals retaliated with arrows, injuring five people.\u201d", "SP Ashish added that the police evicted at least 70 tribals from the land to maintain calm. Their huts were taken down and the tribals were moved to a safe location. \u201cThe tribals were influenced by some people who told them that the land belongs to the Bihar government.
