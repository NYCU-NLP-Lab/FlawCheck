["Actor Kangna Ranaut\u2019s name has constantly been in the headlines following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. In the middle of the ongoing investigation, Ranaut compared Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK), which ignited a fiery dispute between her and the Shiv Sena. The bitter back and forth between the Shiv Sena and the actor has been going on for some time now. Following this, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) tore down her office in Mumbai, stating that it had allegedly been constructed illegally. Soon after, the Bombay High Court reprimanded the BMC for its actions. This also led to the Karni Sena coming out in support of the actor.", "Social media was soon flooded with photos and videos claiming that the Karni Sena had sent a 1000 vehicle convoy to Mumbai for her support. Anjali Yadav, who describes herself as a member of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha Karnataka, wrote on Twitter, \u201cIn support of Kangana Ranaut, 1000 Karni Sena vehicles left for Maharashtra. Jai Bhavani Jai Rajputana.
