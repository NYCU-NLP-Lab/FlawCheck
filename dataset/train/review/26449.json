But on May 8, during a phone call with 3,000 former members of his administration, Obama said \u2014 without referring to Trump by name \u2014 that the White House response to the global pandemic has been \u201can absolute chaotic disaster.\u201d", "Obama, May 8: It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset \u2014 of \u201cwhat\u2019s in it for me\u201d and \u201cto heck with everybody else\u201d \u2014 when that mindset is operationalized in our government.", "Two days later, Trump retweeted a meme of Obama\u2019s photo with the words, \u201cFIRST EX-PRESIDENT TO SPEAK AGAINST SUCCESSOR.\u201d This\u00a0and similar memes began to spread across Facebook and Twitter, all claiming that presidents never speak ill of their successors.", "But that\u2019s not true.", "\u201cPresident Obama is surely not the first president to criticize his successor,\u201d presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin said in an email to FactCheck.org.", "\u201cBy no means is this behavior something that is \u2018unprecedented\u2019 or has \u2018never happened\u2019 before,\u201d Lara Brown, an associate professor and the director of the Graduate School of Political Management at the George Washington University, also told us in an email.", "In fact, former presidents have been downright insulting at times. \u201cPresident Theodore Roosevelt called his successor President William Howard Taft a fathead, a puzzle-wit with the brain of a guinea pig,\u201d Goodwin said.", "\u201cPresident Herbert Hoover claimed the despotism of President Franklin Roosevelt was poisoning America. Hoover worked for the last 20 years of his life on a massive indictment of FDR\u2019s handling of World War II. He was so obsessive about this that his heirs decided not to have it published and put it into storage,\u201d said Goodwin, who won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize in history for her book, \u201cNo Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II.\u201d", "In more recent times, Jimmy Carter \u201ccriticized President Bill Clinton\u2019s morals after the Monica Lewinsky scandal and criticized President Ronald Reagan for a perceived failure to accept his responsibilities as president,\u201d Goodwin said.", "Carter also called George W. Bush\u2019s administration the \u201cworst in history\u201d in terms of \u201cadverse impact on the nation around the world.\u201d", "So, no, Obama was not the first president to criticize his successor.", "However, Goodwin said that \u201cin recent decades there has been an unwritten code that presidents, who are members of this very exclusive club, should respect their colleagues.\u201d She said that the \u201cclub\u201d is thought to have been established by Hoover and Harry Truman at Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s funeral in 1969.", "\u201cPresident John F. Kennedy had said that no one knows how tough the job is until he\u2019s been in it a few months,\u201d Goodwin also noted.", "In fact, many presidents seek counsel and offer to help one another, and Goodwin said there are many examples of collaboration, even across party lines.", "Upon receiving an invitation to the White House from Truman, Hoover \u201ctook the first train to Washington, D.C. and was able to give Truman valuable advice on how to deal with the famine in Europe for he had been involved with relief after World War I,\u201d Goodwin said.", "Kennedy sought advice from Eisenhower at Camp David after the failed Bay of Pigs mission, and \u201cPresident Lyndon Johnson traveled to President Harry Truman\u2019s hometown to sign the Medicare bill to honor Truman for having called for it,\u201d she said.", "George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush and Clinton \u201cwere able to transcend their differences in politics to become close friends, even though Clinton defeated the elder Bush,\u201d Goodwin also said. \u201cBush 43 put his father and Clinton together to help with relief effort for Hurricane Katrina, and has even declared Clinton his \u2018brother with a different mother.'\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
