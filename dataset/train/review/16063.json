Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to curb fake news on the site.", "The post, which we also saw on other websites, said that violent clashes Aug. 12 between white nationalists and people demonstrating against their Unite the Right rally were possibly the result of a coordinated protest.", "\"The media flurry after the confusing happenings in Charlottesville yesterday is fueling violence in this country and it appears that this is exactly what the Dems want,\" the post read. \"Users on Reddit found a potential smoking gun Craigslist post seeking to hire protesters in Charlotte, North Carolina for \u2018rallies to protests to corporate PR stunts to celebrity scenes.\u2019\"", "The post included an image of a Craigslist ad for a company called Crowds On Demand, \"a Los Angeles-based Public Relations firm specializing in innovative events.\" The ad, which said it had been posted a week prior, was \"looking for enthusiastic actors and photographers in the Charlotte, NC area to participate in our events.\"", "Note that said Charlotte, N.C., and not Charlottesville, Va.

Crowds On Demand was in no way affiliated with that vigil, he said.", "\"At no time has Indivisible Charlotte hired any actors to attend any of our rallies,\" Huffman said.", "Bloggers said there is proof Democrats hired actors to plan violence in Charlottesville.", "Several websites implied that left-leaning protesters hired crowds to impersonate white supremacists to incite violence.
