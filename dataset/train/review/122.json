["About this rating", "On 2 January 2018, satire site The Last Line of Defense published a hoax article appearing to report that two Christian bakers in Oregon had a stunning reversal in fortune \u2014 according to the claim, the couple had won a $3 million lottery payout shortly after being fined for declining to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding:", "Melissa Morgan and her husband, Ben, have seen way too much bad news with their names on it. After being sued by a gay couple they refused to bake a cake for so they wouldn\u2019t go to hell, they suffered loss after loss at the hands of the courts.", "That streak of bad luck came to an end this morning when the Morgans learned they had won more than $3 million playing Oregon\u2019s State Lottery.", "A spokeswoman for the Sweet Cakes shop told our reporter:", "\u201cMelissa and Ben are thrilled that God has come through for them. They had no idea how they would pay the $165K in \u2019emotional damages\u2019 they legally owe a pair of fairies for having their feels hurt. It\u2019s been a BS, overblown nightmare and they\u2019re happy it\u2019s over.\u201d", "The only smidgen of truth in this story is that a bakery in Oregon called \"Sweet Cakes by Melissa\" was indeed fined after they declined to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding. However, this fake news article incorrectly identified the owners of the shop, misreported the amount that they were fined, and completely fabricated the story about them winning the lottery. The Christian owners of this bakery are actually named Aaron and Melissa Klein, not Melissa and Ben Morgan, and they were fined $135,000, not $165,000.", "The Last Line of Defense bills itself as a \"satire\" web site, and carries a disclaimer labeling all of its content as fiction.

Only the picture is us.", "We also double-checked the Oregon State Lottery page and found no record of an Aaron or Melissa Klein winning a $3 million lottery in January 2018.
