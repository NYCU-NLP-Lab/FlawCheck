Time and time again, his claims have been tested by actions that demonstrate that his loyalties clearly lie elsewhere.", "That was confirmed at the National Prayer Breakfast, where Obama called Islam an American religion.", "While the article\u00a0appeared on 20 May 2016, the comments were excerpted from President Obama's official\u00a0remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast on 5 February 2015:", "Our job is not to ask that God respond to our notion of truth -- our job is to be true to Him, His word, and His commandments.\u00a0 And we should assume humbly that we\u2019re confused and don\u2019t always know what we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re staggering and stumbling towards Him, and have some humility in that process.\u00a0 And that means we have to speak up against those who would misuse His name to justify oppression, or violence, or hatred with that fierce certainty.\u00a0 No God condones terror.\u00a0 No grievance justifies the taking of innocent lives, or the oppression of those who are weaker or fewer in number.", "And so, as people of faith, we are summoned to push back against those who try to distort our religion -- any religion -- for their own nihilistic ends.\u00a0 And here at home and around the world, we will constantly reaffirm that fundamental freedom -- freedom of religion -- the right to practice our faith how we choose, to change our faith if we choose, to practice no faith at all if we choose, and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination.", "[...]", "The Torah says \u201cLove thy neighbor as yourself.\u201d\u00a0 In Islam, there is a Hadith that states: \"None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.\u201d\u00a0 The Holy Bible tells us to \u201cput on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.\u201d\u00a0 Put on love.", "President Obama's\u00a0remarks\u00a0at the National Prayer Breakfast on 4 February 2016 made a single mention of Islam, in an excerpt during which the President affirmed his own faith as Christian:", "Now, those two stories, they give me courage and they give me hope. \u00a0And they instruct me in my own Christian faith. \u00a0I can\u2019t imagine a moment in which that young American sergeant expressed his Christianity more profoundly than when, confronted by his own death, he said \u201cWe are all Jews.\u201d \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0I can\u2019t imagine a clearer expression of Jesus\u2019s teachings. \u00a0I can\u2019t imagine a better expression of the peaceful spirit of Islam than when a Muslim father, filled with fear, drew from the example of a Baptist preacher and a Jewish rabbi to teach his children what God demands.", "American News\u00a0regularly publishes\u00a0outdated, misleading, or otherwise inaccurate items with\u00a0clickbait headlines designed\u00a0to attract traffic via social media.
