["Former first lady Michelle Obama responds to questions during an appearance for her book, \"Becoming: An Intimate Conversation with Michelle Obama\" on Wednesday, Dec. 19, 2018. (AP)", "New year, same old internet.", "An inflammatory post claims former first lady Michelle Obama once said, \"White folks are what\u2019s wrong with America.\" The post displays an image of the former first lady, with words at the bottom saying, \"Now imagine Bush saying \u2018Black folks are what\u2019s wrong with America.\u2019 Still think there is no media bias?\"", "There are other versions of the meme that replace Bush with Trump.", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "We could find no instance of Michelle Obama saying those words, or any variation of that quote.", "The rumor can be traced back to a 2015 commencement speech Obama gave at Tuskegee University, a private, historically black university in Alabama.", "Following the speech, JewsNews.com, a right-wing website that often pushes conspiracy theories, published an article with the headline: \"White Folks And America Are The Problem \u2013 Michelle Obama Addresses All Black University With Divisive Message.\" A few months later the site repurposed the same story, but this time with the headline: \"Michelle Obama says \u2018White Folks\u2019 are what\u2019s Wrong with America\"", "The articles contain misleading content, and the headline of the second is a distorted take on Obama\u2019s speech and not drawn from any statement she made. (She never said \"white folks\" at all.)", "Michelle Obama told graduates the road ahead wouldn\u2019t be easy \"especially for folks like you and me.\"", "\"The world won\u2019t always see you in those caps and gowns. They won\u2019t know how hard you worked and how much you sacrificed to make it to this day \u2026 Instead they will make assumptions about who they think you are based on their limited notion of the world. And my husband and I know how frustrating that experience can be. We\u2019ve both felt the sting of those daily slights throughout our entire lives \u2014 the folks who crossed the street in fear of their safety; the clerks who kept a close eye on us in all those department stores; the people at formal events who assumed we were the \u2018help\u2019 \u2014 and those who have questioned our intelligence, our honesty, even our love of this country.\"", "A full transcript of the speech is available in the White House archives, and a video of the speech is available on YouTube.", "A refurbished meme claims Michelle Obama said, \"White folks are what\u2019s wrong with America.\"", "The false rumor stems from a commencement speech Obama made at a historically black university in 2015. While her message was candid about race relations in the United States, at no point does she say those words.", "The meme (and the stories that helped spur it) spreads misinformation and presents a twisted interpretation of her words.", "We rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "Facebook post, Jan. 1, 2019", "JewsNews articles, May 2015; November 2015", "Transcript of Michelle Obama\u2019s Tuskegee commencement remarks, May 9, 2015", "YouTube.com, Michelle Obama\u2019s full speech, May 11, 2015", "Truthorfiction.com, \"Michelle Obama Said White Folks Are What\u2019s Wrong With America-Fiction!\" Dec. 1, 2015", "Snopes, \"Did Michelle Obama Say \u2018White Folks Are What\u2019s Wrong with America\u2019?\" Nov. 30, 2015", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
