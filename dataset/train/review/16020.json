["Social media has been abuzz recently with many users claiming that the Supreme Court changed its motto \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019 to \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019. On August 21, 2020, Sunil Astay of the Bhim Army posted two images in a tweet, writing, \u201cThe Supreme Court released a list on August 17, which issued the names of six advocates who had been appointed as judges to the Delhi High Court.

Another user had tagged Alt News on Twitter, requesting our team to verify this information.

We checked the official website of the Supreme Court and did not find any press release that mentioned the change or said that its motto was \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019 at any point in time. On the home page of the site, \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019 appears under the words \u2018The Supreme Court of India\u2019. We will now check whether this has been changed recently. We looked up the website of the Supreme Court on Wayback Machine, a webpage archive which keeps automatic records of web pages at different times.", "If you take a look at the archives of the official Supreme Court website on web.archive.org, you will find a total of 130 snapshots taken in the period between November 12, 2019 and August 18, 2020. On the snapshot taken on November 12, 2019, the phrase \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019 can be seen written below the heading, \u2018The Supreme Court of India\u2019. Thus, the slogan cannot be a recent change.", "Now, let\u2019s take a look at what the website of the Supreme Court used to look like. The web address of the top court used to be supremecourtofindia.nic.in earlier.

On this version, the words \u2018Yato Dharastato Jai\u2019 appeared on the page. However, these words were absent in the screenshot taken before November 10, 2010. Therefore, the phrase \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019 appeared on the website for the first time somewhere between November 10. 2010 and November 20, 2010. This can be seen in the video below.", "It is worth noting here that the Supreme Court did not change \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019 to \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019. We did not see \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019 written anywhere on the home page of the website in the first place. As a result, the claims being made online about the Supreme Court\u2019s recent change of its motto are false. Punya Prasun Bajpai later issued a regretful tweet, admitting he had been confused and accidentally circulated the information.", "In reality, the logo of the Supreme Court contains the Ashok Chakra. Below the symbol are the words \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019 inscribed in Sanskrit. On the other hand, \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019 is the motto of the Government of India, and is written underneath the Ashok Pillar.", "Donate Now", "Priyanka Jha specialises in monitoring and researching mis/disinformation at Alt News.
