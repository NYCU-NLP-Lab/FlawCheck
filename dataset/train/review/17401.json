Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was one of just two GOP senators who condemned Moore,\u00a0the party\u2019s Senate nominee in Alabama.", "\"When a judge expressed his personal belief that a practicing Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith, it was wrong,\" Flake said Oct. 31 on the Senate floor. \"That this same judge is now my party\u2019s nominee for the Senate should concern us all. Religious tests have no place in the United States Congress.\"", "Moore is known for many strong stands, including opposing homosexual marriage and defying a court ruling to remove a display of the 10 Commandments from his courtroom.", "But did he say that a Muslim should not be a member of Congress simply because of his faith?", "He did, back in 2006.", "That year, Moore wrote an op-ed for the website WorldNetDaily.com. Keith Ellison from Minnesota had become the first Muslim to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Moore said Ellison\u2019s faith had no place in the government of the United States because the \"Islamic philosophy (is) directly contrary to the principles of the Constitution.\"", "\"The Islamic faith rejects our God and believes that the state must mandate the worship of its own god, Allah,\"\u00a0Moore wrote Dec. 13, 2006. \"Common sense alone dictates that in the midst of a war with Islamic terrorists we should not place someone in a position of great power who shares their doctrine. In 1943, we would never have allowed a member of Congress to take their oath on \u2018Mein Kampf,\u2019 or someone in the 1950s to swear allegiance to the \u2018Communist Manifesto.\u2019 Congress has the authority and should act to prohibit Ellison from taking the congressional oath today!\"", "As far as we can tell, Moore did not take up the issue again. That is, until he was criticized for it by Flake, which Flake first did during an exchange with a Washington Post reporter on Oct. 26.", "Soon after that, at an event in Decatur, Ala., a reporter asked Moore if a Muslim could serve in federal office.", "\"Of course they can serve,\" Moore said Oct. 28. \"But they understand what they swear the Bible on, they swear to on the Bible, is the God that is not of their faith.\"", "Moore had shifted his position, but how much remains unclear.", "On Oct. 31, the same day Flake spoke, Moore was on Capitol Hill. An MSNBC reporter asked him if he still thought Ellison should be ousted from Congress.", "\"Read my article and you\u2019ll find out what I believe,\" Moore said. \"It\u2019s clarified very clearly in my article.\"", "Since Ellison's election,\u00a0Andr\u00e9 Carson, D-Ind., became the second Muslim member of Congress.", "We reached out to Moore\u2019s campaign and did not hear back.", "Flake said that Moore had expressed the belief that a \"practicing Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith.\"", "That\u2019s what Moore wrote in an op-ed in 2006. He said Rep. Ellison should not be seated in Congress solely because he is a Muslim.", "Moore\u2019s response to recent criticism has been equivocal. In one encounter he said that Muslims could serve in federal office. In another, he said his 2006 op-ed clearly explained his beliefs.", "There is no question that Flake accurately described what Moore had written.
