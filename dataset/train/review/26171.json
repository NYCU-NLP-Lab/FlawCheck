["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on October 24, 2017", "President Donald Trump boasted that unemployment claims fell to their lowest level since 1973. He\u2019s right, but it\u2019s part of a post-recession trend that began long before he took office.", "In fact, Trump\u2019s predecessor could have made the same claim \u2014 as illustrated by an April 14, 2016, headline on\u00a0Fortune magazine\u2019s website\u00a0when Barack Obama was president:\u00a0\u201cUnemployment Claims Fall to Lowest Since 1973.\u201d", "Trump made his remarks while hosting a group of minority business owners in the Oval Office.", "Trump, Oct. 24: A recent Department of Labor report showed the fewest jobless claims since 1973. Think of that \u2014 1973. We just had a report \u2014 we have the fewest jobless claims. I don\u2019t think the press \u2014 I tell that because the only way I\u2019ll get the word out there is if I say it because they\u2019ll never say it. (Laughter.)", "The president is referring to an Oct. 19 press release\u00a0by the Department of Labor on weekly unemployment insurance claims.

New jobless claims stood at\u00a0591,000 on Jan. 17, 2009, shortly before Obama took office, and peaked at 665,000 on March 28, 2009. The number of new claims has been falling ever since, dropping to 241,000 on Jan. 14, 2017, the last report before Obama left office.", "The jobless claims declined by 59 percent under Obama and 7.9 percent, so far, under Trump.
