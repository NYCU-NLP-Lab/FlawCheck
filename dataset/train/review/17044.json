["By Lori Robertson, D'Angelo Gore and Jessica McDonald", "Posted on July 24, 2019", "While former special counsel Robert S. Mueller reiterated in congressional testimony what he said in his voluminous report on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, politicians reiterated some claims about the inquiry and its findings.", "Mueller testified before the House judiciary and intelligence committees on July 24. A redacted version of the special counsel\u2019s 448-page report had been released three months earlier, on April 18. It concluded that\u00a0\u201c[t]he Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion,\u201d detailing the hacking and social media operations involved, as we\u2019ve explained before.", "The report said\u00a0the \u201cinvestigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government.\u201d It \u201cdid not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\u201d See our April 18 story \u201cWhat the Mueller Report Says About Russian Contacts\u201d for more on that.", "On the issue of potential obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump, the report \u201cfound multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations,\u201d but it \u201cdid not draw ultimate conclusions about the President\u2019s conduct,\u201d Mueller wrote, because investigators refrained from making a prosecutorial judgment. As he repeated in his congressional testimony, Mueller wrote in the report that an\u00a0opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel finding that a sitting president couldn\u2019t be indicted factored into the decision to not weigh in on prosecution. For more on the \u201ckey events\u201d the report examined regarding\u00a0 obstruction, see \u201cWhat the Mueller Report Says About Obstruction.\u201d", "Attorney General William P. Barr told Congress in a March 24 letter that the Department of Justice wouldn\u2019t bring charges against Trump, concluding that \u201cthe evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\u201d", "For an overview of key moments during the Russia investigation, see our timeline of the probe.", "Let\u2019s take a look at some repeated claims made during and about Mueller\u2019s testimony.", "Claim:\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump cooperated fully with the investigation.\u201d \u2014 Republican Rep. Mike Johnson, during the hearing", "The facts:\u00a0The Mueller report contradicts that. It said after Trump learned that he was being investigated regarding obstruction, he engaged in \u201cpublic attacks on the investigation, non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both public and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation.\u201d The president also didn\u2019t fully cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s requests for an interview.", "Trump declined requests for an in-person interview, and the special counsel sought an interview for \u201cmore than a year,\u201d getting written responses in late November 2018 that included more than 30 \u201cdoes not \u2018recall\u2019 or \u2018remember\u2019 or have an \u2018independent recollection\u2019\u201d answers.\u00a0Mueller\u2019s team considered a subpoena, but ultimately didn\u2019t pursue it.", "For more, see:\u00a0\u201cWhat the Mueller Report Says About Obstruction,\u201d April 18 and \u201cBarr\u2019s Testimony, In Context,\u201d May 2", "Claim: \u201cToday the director outlined in powerful words how Russia intervened massively in our election, systematically in a sweeping fashion. How, during the course of that intervention, they made multiple approaches to the Trump campaign, and far from shunning that foreign involvement in our election, the Trump campaign welcomed it, made full use of it, put it into its communications and messaging strategy and then lied about it.\u201d \u2014 Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, in a post-hearing press conference", "Mueller \u201cfound that Trump would and did benefit from Russia\u2019s help and that the campaign welcomed that help.\u201d \u2014 Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler, in a post-hearing press conference", "The facts: The Mueller report found mixed results on whether the Trump campaign \u201cwelcomed\u201d Russian interference. It said that campaign officials were \u201creceptive\u201d to offers of Russian assistance in some cases but \u201cshied away\u201d in other instances.", "The report said it found \u201cmultiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russia offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away.\u201d For example,\u00a0Russians attempted to have Trump visit Russia during the campaign, but they were rebuffed, according to the Mueller report.", "And in the end, the investigation \u201cdid not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\u201d", "The Democrats\u2019 misleading claim is the opposite of one Trump made in June, when he said the campaign had \u201crebuffed\u201d Russia.", "For more, see: \u201cWhat the Mueller Report Says About Russian Contacts,\u201d April 18 and \u201cVideo: Trump Misleads on \u2018Rebuffed\u2019 Russian Offers,\u201d June 14", "Claim: \u201c448 pages [of the Mueller report] \u2014 the owner of Fusion GPS that did the Steele dossier that started all this \u2014 he\u2019s not mentioned in there.\u201d \u2014 Republican Rep. Steve Chabot, during the hearing", "The facts: The \u201cdossier,\u201d a series of memos compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele on supposed contacts between Russian officials and members of the Trump campaign, is not what \u201cstarted\u201d the Russia investigation.", "Volume I of the Mueller report clearly says: \u201cIn late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks\u2019s first release of stolen documents, a foreign government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested to a representative of that foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July 31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities.\u201d", "Dueling House intelligence committee memos from Democrats and Republicans also agree it wasn\u2019t the dossier that triggered the FBI investigation.", "For more, see: \u201cDossier Not What \u2018Started All of This,'\u201d March 27", "Claim:\u00a0\u201cAmong other things, the FBI used dossier allegations to obtain a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.\u201d\u00a0 \u2014 Republican Rep. Devin Nunes,\u00a0in his opening statement", "The facts:\u00a0The Department of Justice and FBI used the Steele dossier in its application for a court order to conduct\u00a0electronic surveillance\u00a0on\u00a0Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. But Page had already left the campaign when the bureau made its first request before the\u00a0Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The FBI filed its\u00a0request\u00a0sometime in October 2016, and a redacted version of the application refers to Page as a \u201cformer\u201d adviser. Page departed from Trump\u2019s campaign at the end of September that year.", "For more, see:\u00a0\u201cQ&A on the Nunes Memo,\u201d Feb. 7, 2018", "Claim:\u00a0\u201cIn the Paul Manafort case alone, you recovered as much as $42 million \u2014 so that the cost of your investigation to the taxpayers approaches zero.\u201d\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0Rep. Nadler, during the hearing", "The facts:\u00a0As part of his plea deal, Manafort forfeited an\u00a0estimated\u00a0$42 million to $46 million in real estate and cash holdings. Mueller\u2019s investigation doesn\u2019t yet have a final price tag, but at the end of September 2018, the cost was $25.2 million. Assuming expenses continued at a similar clip over the last nearly six months of the probe, the total would be approximately $34 million. That would theoretically put the net total in the black, but the funds brought in by asset forfeitures don\u2019t go directly to the investigation. As our fact-checking colleagues at PolitiFact\u00a0noted, the forfeiture money goes into the\u00a0Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund, a general fund that the attorney general is allowed to use to pay \u201cany necessary expenses associated with forfeiture operations\u201d or to cover \u201ccertain general investigative expenses.\u201d", "For more, see:\u00a0\u201cTrump\u2019s Campaign Kickoff Claims,\u201d June 19", "Claim: \u201cIt has been reported that Robert Mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of FBI Director (and get turned down) the day before he was wrongfully appointed Special Counsel.

I was asked to give my input on what it would take to do the job.\u201d", "Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon also has said that Mueller did not come to the White House for a job interview. In an interview with investigators, the Mueller report says, \u201cBannon recalled that the White House had invited Mueller to speak to the President to offer a perspective on the institution of the FBI. Bannon said that, although the White House thought about beseeching Mueller to become Director again, he did not come in looking for the job.\u201d", "And in a June 2018 MSNBC interview, Bannon said Mueller was there to \u201cgive advice on the type of person that we should select to be FBI director.\u201d", "For more, see: \u201cDebunking Mueller\u2019s \u2018Conflicts,\u2019\u201d April 19", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
