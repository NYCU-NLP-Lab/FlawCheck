["Texas Gov. Greg Abbott gives his state of the state address on Feb. 1, 2021 in Lockhart, Texas. (AP)", "Texas has strict abortion\u00a0regulations, and Gov. Greg Abbott indicated this month that he intends to make them stricter.", "In his state of the state speech Feb. 1,\u00a0Abbott said that in the upcoming legislative session he will encourage laws\u00a0ensuring\u00a0\"that the life of every child will be spared from the ravages of abortion.\"", "A bevy of bills have been filed to further restrict abortion in Texas, including one that would ban the practice all together.\u00a0But\u00a0Abbott and fellow Republican state leaders have long targeted one of the state\u2019s largest abortion and family planning providers: Planned Parenthood.", "Last month, after\u00a0years of litigation, Texas health officials gave Planned Parenthood a 30-day notice before kicking the organization off the state\u2019s Medicaid program. Just before the Feb. 3 deadline, Planned Parenthood sued and\u00a0a judge blocked state officials from\u00a0removing Planned Parenthood as a Medicaid health care provider.", "Abbott posted\u00a0a tweet Jan. 24 anticipating that Feb. 3 deadline, saying that\u00a0\"innocent lives will be saved\" thanks to the state\u2019s actions.", "Planned Parenthood and state leaders are longtime mutual adversaries, squaring off in court multiple times over the years over abortion restrictions. The battle over Medicaid funding began in 2015\u00a0when state officials complained that\u00a0an undercover video shot by abortion opponents showed Planned Parenthood officials in a Houston clinic agreeing\u00a0to illegal activity, such as changing abortion procedures to better acquire fetal tissue for researchers.\u00a0Planned Parenthood officials argued that the video was heavily edited and an Austin federal judge ruled that it did not prove any illegal activity occurred. An appeals court disagreed.", "But will the state\u2019s latest move to cut Planned Parenthood from Medicaid funding result in curbing the state\u2019s abortion numbers, as the governor claims?", "Since\u00a01976, Medicaid has been prohibited from funding abortion services\u00a0under the Hyde Amendment, passed three years after the\u00a0landmark Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court\u00a0decision.", "The law, which bars the use of federal dollars to pay for abortion, was introduced by\u00a0U.S. Rep.\u00a0Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., who famously\u00a0said,\u00a0\"I certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman.\u00a0Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the \u2026 Medicaid bill.\"", "Federal Medicaid dollars that flow through the Texas Medicaid program\u00a0to Planned Parenthood are,\u00a0thanks\u00a0to the Hyde Amendment, not allowed to be used for abortion services. Instead, Planned Parenthood uses those funds for\u00a0non-abortion services for Texas\u2019 poorest women\u00a0\u2014 services such as\u00a0mammograms, cervical cancer screenings,\u00a0contraception\u00a0and STI tests.", "Last year,\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0dollars\u00a0paid\u00a0for the health\u00a0care\u00a0and family planning\u00a0services of 8,800\u00a0Medicaid patients at Planned Parenthood clinics across Texas, according to Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas.\u00a0This money is paid to the organization through reimbursements. For instance, Planned Parenthood receives $71.50 for every\u00a0Depo-Provera birth control shot administered to a Medicaid patient, or\u00a0$8.30 in reimbursement for every HIV rapid test.", "Of Planned Parenthood\u2019s 40 clinics around the state, nine are licensed to perform abortion\u00a0procedures. Last year, those nine centers performed 14,220 surgical or medication-induced abortions. Virtually all of these procedures were paid for by patients out-of-pocket or\u00a0by third-party grants.", "According to experts, Abbott\u2019s tweet connecting Medicaid funding to abortions is a\u00a0misrepresentation.", "\"That statement indicates that somehow this funding is being used to provide abortions, (but) the funding is not allowed to do that,\" said\u00a0Kari White,\u00a0a University of Texas associate professor of social work and a faculty researcher at the Population Research Center.\u00a0\"That\u2019s a misrepresentation of the way this funding is used and what care can be provided with it.\"", "Instead, the effect of\u00a0removing Planned Parenthood from the Medicaid program will cut\u00a0access to\u00a0specialized\u00a0health\u00a0care\u00a0for\u00a08,800 women, experts say.\u00a0If Texas\u2019 bid to cut Planned Parenthood from Medicaid is ultimately successful, that means\u00a0women who qualify for Medicaid \u2014\u00a0such as a single\u00a0mother of two\u00a0who makes\u00a0less than $230 a month \u2014 would lose access to\u00a0Medicaid-funded cancer screenings, contraception, and other preventative healthcare services.", "\"It\u2019s problematic to say that innocent lives will be saved.\u00a0Given that if people can\u2019t get access to mammograms and cervical\u00a0cancer screenings, perhaps lives will be lost,\" said\u00a0associate professor\u00a0Abigail Aiken\u00a0of the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the\u00a0University of Texas.", "It\u2019s unclear how\u00a0Abbott connects\u00a0Medicaid dollars to abortion \u2014 his office did not respond to several requests for comment regarding his tweet.\u00a0But it\u2019s not the first time\u00a0rhetoric around the abortion issue in Texas has connected\u00a0the two.", "Joe Pojman, executive director of Texas Alliance for life \u2014 which is backing a proposal to ban abortion beginning at fertilization (Texas law\u00a0bans abortions after 20 weeks) \u2014\u00a0argues that Planned Parenthood places women on a pathway that, for many,\u00a0ultimately leads to abortion.", "Although \"it\u2019s difficult to make a causal relationship,\" Pojman\u00a0argues\u00a0that\u00a0many\u00a0women seeking pregnancy-related services\u00a0at Planned Parenthood\u00a0are\u00a0ultimately\u00a0getting referred\u00a0to\u00a0Planned Parenthood abortion facilities.", "\"There\u2019s definitely referrals going on,\" he said. \"That\u2019s certainly part of Planned Parenthood\u2019s practices \u2014 is to refer women for abortions.\"", "And women who are seeking non-pregnancy related health services build a \"client relationship\" with Planned Parenthood. Then,\u00a0if those women later become pregnant,\u00a0Pojman said,\u00a0\"they know who to call.\"", "\"A woman searching for breast or cervical cancer screening or high blood pressure screening, if they do a pregnancy test on her and she's positive, then they'd do a referral to their abortion facility,\" he said.", "However,\u00a0because medical referral information is\u00a0protected\u00a0under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Pojman said\u00a0he hasn\u2019t seen\u00a0any\u00a0records showing this connection.", "\"It\u2019s reasonable to believe that fewer women going to Planned Parenthood facilities for any reason will likely result in fewer abortions,\" he said.", "Planned Parenthood spokesperson Sarah Wheat says that none of these claims\u00a0have\u00a0factual basis.\u00a0A standard component of family planning services is providing nondirective pregnancy counseling, Wheat said.\u00a0All patients are informed of all of their legal and medical\u00a0options.", "\"Providing patients with referrals for all of their medical options is not unique to Planned Parenthood,\" Wheat said.", "Furthermore, Pojman\u2019s argument ignores the fact that many women rely on Planned Parenthood\u00a0to obtain contraception\u00a0and avoid unwanted pregnancies, said Aiken. According to Planned Parenthood\u2019s own\u00a0data,\u00a082,400 Texas women received birth control through Planned Parenthood last year.", "Abortion referrals\u00a0\"seems to be exactly what would be precipitated by kicking Planned Parenthood out of Medicaid,\" Aiken said. \"If there are no Medicaid funds to help low-income patients get contraception, I would imagine that more abortion referrals would be necessary precisely because of the lack of funding.\"", "Pojman said Texas\u2019 own\u00a0family planning services program\u00a0could easily absorb the 8,800 Planned Parenthood Medicaid\u00a0patients.", "Created by the Legislature, Healthy Texas Women launched in 2016 to provide family planning and health\u00a0care services to low-income women.\u00a0It served 173,000 women in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available.", "While the program offers services including pregnancy testing, STD testing, breast and cervical cancer screenings and others, it\u00a0follows\u00a0Texas\u2019 ethos of excluding abortions within its\u00a0continuum of care.", "But the program is not without drawbacks and shortcomings, said White, who\u00a0conducted a survey of the program\u2019s\u00a0provider\u00a0network\u00a0in 2019.", "\"What we have found in our research is that it is not so easy for patients to just transfer their care someplace else. In some communities, there aren't very many providers for patients to go to,\" she said.", "White\u2019s research, done with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, found that\u00a0many Healthy Texas Women providers don\u2019t offer\u00a0a\u00a0full range of contraceptive\u00a0options\u00a0or\u00a0lack clinicians trained to place or remove birth control implants\u00a0or intrauterine devices.", "\"There's a lot of variability in the network.
