["A self-described conservative blog revived a rumor from the Clinton body count archives. The blog Conservative Politicus had the stirring headline \"U.N. official John Ashe set to testify against the Clintons may not have died by accident after all,\" on June 17.", "This has the essential ingredients to meet the appetite of any conspiracy fan: Clintons, a legal case and a dead man.", "That doesn\u2019t mean those elements are on the money.", "Yes, Ashe died in 2016, and yes, there was a criminal case. But no, he wasn\u2019t going to testify against either Bill or Hillary Clinton.", "Now, for the back story.", "John Ashe represented Antigua and Barbuda at the United Nations and at one time served as president of the General Assembly.

He was slated for what the spokesman described to Snopes as a standard pre-trial meeting.", "As for Ashe\u2019s death, he died at home in June 2016 when a barbell crushed his throat. That happened near the time he was scheduled to meet with prosecutors. The death was ruled an accident.", "Several conspiracy-minded posts emerged soon after his death. One about a month afterward included Ashe\u2019s name with two others who allegedly died under mysterious circumstances. The one common thread was a tie to the Clintons.", "A conservative blog revived a year-old rumor that a UN official died shortly before he was going to testify against the Clintons. While the man did die and he was scheduled to meet with prosecutors, that\u2019s the extent of the accuracy here.", "Prosecutors said Ashe had received at least half a million dollars in bribes, and he was headed for trial.
