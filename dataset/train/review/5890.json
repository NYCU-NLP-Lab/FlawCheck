["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on June 5, 2019", "In remarks at a technology conference in Brazil, former President Barack Obama misrepresented U.S. gun laws, claiming that \u201canybody can buy any weapon \u2026 without much, if any, regulation,\u201d including \u201cmachine guns.\u201d", "Machine guns have been tightly regulated since 1934 and banned since 1986, except for the sale or transfer of such a weapon that \u201cwas lawfully registered and possessed before May 19, 1986,\u201d according to the\u00a0Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. And even then it can only be transferred from one registered owner to another registered owner.", "Obama made his remarks May 30 at a technology conference hosted by VTEX. During a question and answer period, the former president was asked about his \u201cmost difficult day\u201d in office.", "Obama, May 30:\u00a0Well, I\u2019ve said this before. The most difficult day that I\u2019ve had was the day that there was a shooting in a school, where 20 small children were shot, as well as some teachers, and you know, my daughters were only a little bit older than these young children that had been shot and I had to go and comfort the parents. And some of you may be aware our gun laws in the United States don\u2019t make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon, any time whether or not (applause) you know, without much, if any, regulation. They can buy it over the internet. They can buy machine guns.", "The former president is referring to a mass shooting\u00a0at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012 that left 26 people dead, including 20 children. A month after the shooting, Obama issued a plan designed to strengthen the nation\u2019s gun laws, but he was unsuccessful in passing any legislation \u2014 including his proposals to ban certain assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and expand background checks for gun purchases online and at gun shows.", "Unable to pass those proposals, the former president announced a series of executive actions in 2016.", "So, Obama has long held the opinion that U.S. gun laws aren\u2019t strong enough. But even under existing laws it is nearly impossible to legally buy a machine gun, which has been tightly regulated\u00a0since the passage of the National Firearms Act in 1934, in response to the gangster era.", "A \u201cmachinegun\u201d is defined under existing law as a fully automatic weapon \u2014 that is, \u201cany weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\u201d", "The 1934 law required machine-gun owners to pay a $200 tax and register their weapon with the federal government. In 1986, machine guns were banned for civilian use under the Firearm Owners\u2019 Protection Act \u2014 although the law grandfathered such weapons that were \u201clawfully possessed\u201d prior to May 19, 1986. Under that law, which remains in effect today, machine guns can be sold or transferred only if they were \u201clawfully registered and possessed before May 19, 1986,\u201d according to the ATF.", "As of 2007, there were \u201capproximately 182,600 machine guns available for transfer to civilians in the United States based upon an audit of the ATF-maintained National Firearms Registry and Transfer Record (NFRTR),\u201d according to a 2017\u00a0report\u00a0on gun laws by the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.", "We asked Eric Schultz, a spokesman for the former president, what Obama meant when he said \u201canybody \u2026 can buy machine guns.\u201d", "Schultz said the Obama used the term \u201cmachine gun,\u201d which are fully automatic weapons, when he meant semi-automatic weapons that are currently legal to purchase in the United States, such as AR-15 rifles.", "\u201cHe was using \u2018machine gun\u2019 as a phrase that everybody understands, especially in a foreign country. He\u2019s obviously not talking about Al Capone tommy guns \u2013 he was referring to semi-automatic weapons so people would understand what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Schultz told us in an email.", "As for Obama\u2019s remark that \u201canybody can buy any weapon, any time \u2026 without much, if any, regulation,\u201d Schultz referred us to several news articles \u2014 including a\u00a02016 PolitiFact article that gave Obama a \u201cmostly true\u201d rating when he said a \u201cviolent felon can buy [a gun] over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked.\u201d", "It is illegal for a \u201cviolent felon\u201d to purchase any firearm under existing law. The\u00a0Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits certain people from buying guns, including someone imprisoned for more than one year. Under the\u00a0Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act,\u00a0federally\u00a0licensed firearm dealers are required to conduct background checks and cannot sell to \u201cprohibited persons,\u201d such as violent felons.", "In his 2016 remarks, Obama was referring to those who buy guns online from private sellers, not licensed dealers, and therefore are not required to undergo background checks. While it would be illegal for a violent felon to buy a gun, it still might be possible for them to do so through a private online sale in some states.", "In this case, Obama\u00a0prefaced his remarks about machine guns by saying \u201cour gun laws in the United States don\u2019t make much sense.\u201d But, in fact, there is a law that bans machine guns \u2014 except those that are grandfathered in, as we noted earlier.", "Obama may not draw a distinction between a semi-automatic and a fully automatic weapon, but the law does. And he misrepresented that law in his remarks before a foreign audience.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
