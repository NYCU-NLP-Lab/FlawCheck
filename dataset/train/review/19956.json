["About this rating", "On 18 November 2015, the entertainment web site\u00a0Real News Right Now\u00a0published a fake news article claiming that a Saudi billionaire had purchased Buford, Wyoming and was planning on building \"the Mecca of the west\":", "When Sheikh Mohammed Kamel Alsaud purchased the small town of Buford, Wyoming from a Vietnamese entrepreneur last year for $1.8 million, his lifelong dream of bringing Islam to America was one step closer to becoming a reality.", "\u201cI have fond memories of spending summers on the Mediterranean aboard my father\u2019s yacht. On occasion we\u2019d visit the Gulf [of Mexico] to entertain his American clients,\u201d Alsaud told Forbes magazine. \u201cEven as a child, I was always struck by the distinct lack of mosques in the U.S., but they say what America lacks in mosques, it makes up tenfold in prisons.\u201d", "The above-quoted story didn't gain much traction when it was first published, but on 25 January 2016, web sites such as\u00a0Liveleak and TapWires\u00a0republished the dubious article with the addition of unrelated photos, managing to convince\u00a0Twitter users that the plans to build\u00a0a \"Mecca of the West\" were real. A video purportedly showing the construction site was also published to YouTube.", "These claims, however, are completely fabricated. The story about the Saudi billionaire purchasing Buford, Wyoming originated on a fake news web site. While\u00a0Real News Right Now\u00a0does not specifically label itself as a satire publication, its \"About\" section is full of lies and exaggerations about its (likely completely fictional) fictional founder, R.

While Buford, Wyoming (population: 1) will not be turned into the \"Mecca of the West,\" the town actually was purchased by Pham Dinh Nguyen in 2013 for $900,000, and then renamed\u00a0PhinDeli Town Buford.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
