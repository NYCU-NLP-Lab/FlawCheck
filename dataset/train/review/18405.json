However, some readers may not quite understand just how distant a distant cousin really is.", "The genealogy website reported that Rogers and Hanks are sixth cousins who share a 5x great-grandfather (or a great-great-great-great-great-grandfather). Here's how Ancestry.com described Hanks relationship to Rogers:", "Fred Rogers and Tom Hanks are sixth cousins sharing the same 5x great-grandfather, Johannes Mefford, who immigrated from Germany to America in the 18th century. Johannes raised a family of patriots; three of his sons (including Tom Hanks\u2019 and Fred Rogers\u2019s ancestors) served in the Revolutionary War. Fred Rogers\u2019s 4x great-grandfather, William Mefford, served in the navy and was captured by the British in 1782. He endured life on a prison ship in Barbados and Antigua until he was released ten months later. Tom Hanks\u2019s 4x great-grandfather, Jacob Mefford, joined the War as a private and participated in a skirmish at Chesapeake Bay. So, Rogers and Hanks not only share the same ancestor, they also descend from two brothers who fought for America\u2019s independence.", "While it may be \"true\" to say that Hanks and Rogers are related, phrasing their relationship this way is a bit misleading.", "We found varying estimates about just how closely related sixth cousins really are, but the general conclusion was that these \"relatives\" were very distant. For instance, a study by Ancestry DNA in 2014, based on British birth rates and census data, found that the average person in Britain had about 175,000 sixth cousins.", "While it's true that Hanks and Rogers are related, they are distant cousins who probably don't share much in terms of DNA.
