Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., high-fived Sen.

The 51-46 yea-to-nay vote fell below the filibuster threshold of 60 votes, and Heitkamp\u2019s vote was one of those nays.", "But did Heitkamp follow up her vote with a celebratory high-five with the Senate minority leader?", "The main image, a screen grab from C-SPAN, certainly makes it seem that way. But the video, which is embedded in the story, shows more of an awkward greeting than a crude celebration.", "The footage shows Heitkamp walking into the chamber as she converses with Cory Booker, D-N.J.. She responds to the clerk\u2019s roll call in the negative, and resumes chatting.", "As they speak, Schumer approaches Booker and Heitkamp, and Heitkamp catches his eye. They each wave hello with their hands up, and Heitkamp reaches her hand out to meet Schumer\u2019s as he lands at their side. They clasp hands, exchange a few inaudible words, and let go as Booker pats Schumer\u2019s shoulder. The vote was about halfway through, so the hand clasp was not in reaction to a final tally.", "Typical high fives involve slapping of two hands in celebration.
