["About this rating", "The phrase \"bad day\" came toward the end of a lengthy exchange with reporters in which Baker had attempted to characterize the suspect's motivations and state of mind based on the latter's own statements to investigators. It's unclear whether Baker was quoting/paraphrasing the suspect at that moment, or stating his own opinion.", "On March 17, 2021, the Cherokee Sheriff's Office held a news conference in the aftermath of the deadly Georgia massage-parlor shootings that left eight people dead. Sheriff's Capt. Jay Baker, a spokesperson for the department, answered questions from reporters. According to social media users, he purportedly said that Atlanta-area shooting suspect Robert Aaron Long \u2014 who faces murder and assault charges after the incident \u2014 had had a \"bad day.\"", "We found multiple tweets that claimed Baker said the shooting suspect had a \"bad day.\" For example, one came from The Atlantic writer Jemele Hill via Vox journalist Aaron Rupar.", "The 20-second video received around 10 million views in less than 24 hours.", "We found multiple tweets that were shared far and wide that claimed Baker used those words:", "We were unable to find the full remarks in context in any reports published by major news organizations. It appeared that most articles published a single sentence uttered by Baker.", "In order to confirm whether the quote was accurate, we turned to a previously live feed of the news conference, provided by the Internet Archive. We also located a Fox 5 Atlanta feed.", "We transcribed the comments below with the moment in question being bolded:", "Reporter: \u201cYesterday it was stated that the suspect was perhaps upset at these locations for allowing him to have an outlet for his addiction. Can you elaborate on that?\u201d", "Capt. Jay Baker: \u201cYeah let me go into a little detail. The suspect did take responsibility for the shootings. He said that early on once we began the interviews with him. He claims that these \u2013 and as the chief said, this is still early \u2013 but he does claim that it was not racially motivated. He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as something that allows him to go to these places, and it\u2019s a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate. Like I said, it\u2019s still early on. Those were comments that he made.\u201d", "Reporter: \u201cDid he discuss any kind religious motivation for this, or was he\u2026\u201d", "Baker: \u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d", "Reporter: \u201cOr political?\u201d", "Baker: \u201cNone political. I\u2019ve heard nothing about politics.\u201d", "Reporter: \u201cAny sense of his social media history? Is that something you\u2019ve been able to look up?\u201d", "Baker: \u201cThat\u2019s something that investigators, and they\u2019ve been working on it. That\u2019s certainly one of the things they\u2019ll be doing.\u201d", "Reporter: \u201cSheriff, did you have a sense that he understood the gravity of what he did?\u201d", "Baker: \u201cWhen I spoke with investigators, they interviewed him this morning, and they got that impression that, yes, he understood the gravity of it, and he was pretty much fed up and had been at the end of his rope, and yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did.\u201d", "Reporter: \u201cRemorseful?\u201d", "Baker: \u201cI\u2019m not going to \u2013 I don\u2019t know if he was remorseful or not.\u201d", "Reporter: \u201cHe\u2019s a pretty young guy. Was he a student? Does he live with his parents?", "Baker: \u201c21 years of age. It\u2019s my understanding he does not live with his parents. I don\u2019t know who he was living with at the time of this incident.\u201d", "Reporter: \u201cIs he employed?\u201d", "Baker: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of that either.\u201d", "While Baker did not say the exact words \"had a bad day\" or \"having a bad day,\" he did say \"yesterday was a really bad day for him,\" referring to the Atlanta-area shooting suspect.", "The remarks reminded some social media users of past shooting sprees committed by young white men:", "However, whether Atlanta-area police or other law enforcement officers would make similar \"bad day\" remarks about shooting suspects who are people of color is not the focus of this fact check. The claim here is whether Baker said that the shooting suspect had a \"bad day,\" which we determined to be true.", "In order to understand the \"bad day\" comment, we looked at what was said immediately before and after the moment in question.", "In studying the transcribed news conference, Baker appeared to be referring to the purported \"sex addiction\" that Long was said to have discussed with law enforcement. In the news conference, Baker said the \"sex addiction\" was \"a temptation\" that Long \"wanted to eliminate.\"", "\"He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as something that allows him to go to these places, and it\u2019s a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate,\" Baker said.", "Around 40 seconds after Baker finished the \"sex addiction\" remarks, he mentioned \"bad day\":", "Reporter: \u201cSheriff, did you have a sense that he understood the gravity of what he did?\u201d", "Baker: \u201cWhen I spoke with investigators, they interviewed him this morning, and they got that impression that, yes, he understood the gravity of it, and he was pretty much fed up and had been at the end of his rope, and yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did.\u201d", "It appeared that Baker was saying it was a \"bad day\" for Long's \"temptation\" as it pertained to \"sex addiction.\"", "On the evening of March 17, Baker appeared to delete or disable his Facebook account after social media users discovered it. We previously reported that he had promoted COVID-19-themed T-shirts that read: \"Imported Virus from Chy-na.\" While the investigation into the massage-parlor killings was ongoing, connections were drawn by social media users and bloggers to the fact that he promoted those shirts, and that six of the eight victims were Asian women.", "We reached out to Baker later that same day to receive clarification on his comments, but did not hear back. However, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office put out a statement on March 18:", "In sum, a Georgia sheriff's spokesman did say that the day of the Atlanta-area killings was for the suspect \"a really bad day for him.\" The remarks appeared to refer to a \"bad day\" for the suspect's \"temptation\" in regard to a purported \"sex addiction.\"", "Jordan Liles is a Senior Reporter who has been with Snopes since 2016.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
