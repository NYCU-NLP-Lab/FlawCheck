["About this rating", "Many Americans are unaware that there are two correct versions of a lowercase \"G\" \u2014 and even fewer people are able to correctly identify and write each version if they're asked, according to research conducted by Johns Hopkins University researchers.", "The findings could hold implications for how future generations learn to read and write in a mostly digital world. Overall, just one-quarter of study participants were able to properly recognize the most commonly used English version of the lowercase print \"G.\"", "When it comes to print, the letter \"G\" has two lowercase versions: the \u201copentail,\u201d which looks like a fishhook and is commonly used in handwriting, and the \u201clooptail,\u201d which is often used in printed or typed material. Both the opentail and looptail versions of \"G\" are what are known as \u201callographs,\u201d or different, yet distinct, letter shapes that correspond to the same letter identity. Although the looptail is most commonly used in printed materials, most people never learn how to write or properly identify this version. (There are other allographs of the letter \"G,\" including uppercase printed \"G\" and upper- and lower-case cursive \"G.\")", "\u201cWe think that if we look at something enough, especially if we have to pay attention to its shape as we do during reading, then we would know what it looks like, but our results suggest that\u2019s not always the case,\u201d said Michael McCloskey, a cognitive scientist at Johns Hopkins Krieger School of Arts and Sciences, in a news release at the time.", "\u201cWhat we think may be happening here is that we learn the shapes of most letters in part because we have to write them in school. Looptail 'G' is something we\u2019re never taught to write, so we may not learn its shape as well.\u201d", "As part of their experiment, the researchers first surveyed fonts used in books and found that the looptail appeared in 74% of children\u2019s picture books, 89% of children\u2019s chapter books, and 97% of books for adults. To test how well a person might be able to identify either version, they then turned to a three-part experiment that has been published in a 2018 edition of the Journal of Experimental Psychology.", "In the first segment, 38 participants \u2014 an admittedly small sample size \u2014 were asked whether they knew that there were two forms of a lowercase \"G.\" Only two participants were able to recall the looptail version, and only one person was able to write it correctly. As part of the second experiment, 16 participants \u2014 an even smaller test pool \u2014 were asked to read passages from a book and say any word containing a \"G\" aloud. They were then asked to write the form of \"G\" that they had seen. Half of those participants wrote an opentail \"G\" and only one person wrote the looptail accurately. For the final test, study participants were asked to correctly identify a looptail \"G\" in a multiple-choice test. Just seven of 25 participants were able to do so.", "The researchers concluded that these \u201csurprising\u201d gaps in readers\u2019 knowledge hold implications for understanding how we interpret letters and how that knowledge is acquired. It also implies that a person\u2019s knowledge of a letter may decline when they are not being regularly written out.", "\u201cWhat about children who are just learning to read? Do they have a little bit more trouble with this form of 'g' because they haven\u2019t been forced to pay attention to it and write it?\u201d said McCloskey.", "\u201cThat\u2019s something we don\u2019t really know. Our findings give us an intriguing way of looking at questions about the importance of writing for reading. Here is a naturally occurring situation where unlike most letters, this is a letter we don\u2019t write. We could ask whether children have some reading disadvantage with this form of 'g.'\u201d", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNGaJ0KiEs&feature=emb_logo", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
