Rather, the articles included a fake quote in which the rapper allegedly said, \"I don\u2019t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin\u2019 that someone would do what I did but with a real gun.\"", "The fake reporter in the fake story then supposedly told the Secret Service what Snoop said, landing Snoop in jail.", "To be clear, Snoop is not a Trump fan \u2014 he called the president a \"clown\" in a Billboard interview \u2014 and the video for \"Lavender\"\u00a0does not paint a flattering picture of the current chief executive.

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told TMZ.com on March 13 that \"Snoop shouldn\u2019t have done that.\"", "\"We\u2019ve had presidents assassinated before in this country, so anything like that is really something people should be very careful about,\" Rubio said, adding that if the \"wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea, you could have a real problem.\"", "The Secret Service did tell TheWrap.com on March 14 that they were \"aware\" of Snoop\u2019s video.
