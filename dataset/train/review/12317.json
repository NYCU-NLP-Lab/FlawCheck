["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on March 13, 2017 | Updated on March 14, 2017 | Corrected on October 27, 2017", "President Donald Trump\u2019s chief budget officer claimed \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that \u201cthe Obama administration was manipulating the numbers\u201d to make the nation\u2019s unemployment rate \u201clook smaller.\u201d", "Asked for evidence, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer also offered none. Spicer replied that Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, was \u201cclearly referring to Obamacare.\u201d That\u2019s false.", "Mulvaney was clearly talking about employment data when he made his remarks March 12 on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Host Jake Tapper played a video clip from Feb. 9, 2016 in which Trump called the unemployment rate\u00a0\u201cphony numbers.\u201d At the time, the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent.", "\u201cDon\u2019t believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe number is probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.\u201d", "(As we pointed out at the time, Trump\u2019s 42 percent figure represented the number of Americans 16 years and older who are not in the labor force \u2014 the vast majority of whom did not want a job, such as retirees, students and stay-at-home parents).", "Despite candidate Trump\u2019s skepticism of the unemployment rate, President Trump touted the latest jobs figure released on March 10 by BLS. The U.S. added 235,000 jobs in February\u00a0and the unemployment rate was \u201clittle changed\u201d at 4.7 percent, down from 4.8 percent in January, according to a BLS press release.", "Spicer, Trump\u2019s top spokesman,\u00a0joked about the president\u2019s embrace of the jobs data. Asked at a March 10 press briefing about the president\u2019s change of heart, Spicer said, \u201cYeah, I talked to the president prior to this, and he said to quote him very clearly \u2014 \u2018They may have been phony in the past, but it\u2019s very real now.'\u201d", "On the \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Tapper asked Mulvaney if there were any changes to the methodology used by BLS to calculate the February unemployment rate.", "Tapper: So, did anything actually change at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in terms of methodology or who is running the business there?", "Mulvaney: What I think changed is, you start to look at some of the underlying numbers. You look at the U6 number. We could talk \u2014 I\u2019m already boring your audience. There\u2019s things like U3, U6. And what you should really look at is the number of jobs created.", "We\u2019ve thought for a long time, I did, that the Obama administration was manipulating the numbers in terms of the number of people in the work force to make the unemployment rate, that percentage rate, look smaller than it actually was.", "And we used to tell people back home, the only thing you should really look at, number of jobs created. And as long as that number is above [250,000], then the economy is doing extraordinarily well. And that was the number we hit last week.", "Mulvaney presented no evidence to support his suspicion that \u201cthe Obama administration was manipulating the numbers,\u201d even after he was pressed to do so by Tapper.", "A day later, Trump\u2019s chief spokesman was asked at a White House briefing\u00a0(18:38 mark) for evidence of data manipulation, but he also offered none. In fact, Spicer wrongly claimed that Mulvaney was talking about the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which was clearly not the case, as the exchange above shows.", "Reporter, March 13: Director Mulvaney said yesterday that he felt the Obama administration had been manipulating the unemployment rate. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s a view the president shares and what evidence is there of that?", "Spicer: I think he was clearly referring to Obamacare with the number of people, but I would refer you back to him and his comments with respect to how he characterized that. I think he can discuss the precise nature of what he meant on that.", "As for the Obama administration,\u00a0Erica Groshen, who was commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics during Obama\u2019s second term, told CNN, \u201cDuring the four years I served as commissioner, the administration didn\u2019t try to manipulate the numbers at all.\u201d", "(The first BLS commissioner to serve under Obama was a holdover from the Bush administration.\u00a0Keith Hall, a conservative economist,\u00a0was BLS commissioner until January 2012. Hall is now the director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \u2014 as selected\u00a0by House Republicans in 2015.)", "In the CNN interview,\u00a0Mulvaney sought to highlight the difference between monthly job gains and the unemployment rate. He said adding 250,000 jobs in a month is a sign that \u201cthe economy is doing extraordinarily well.\u201d By that measure, job growth was extraordinary in 20 of the 96 months under Obama. Overall, the nation\u2019s economy has added 11.5 million jobs under Obama, including a record 76 straight months of job growth \u2014 which was extended to 77 months in February.", "As for the unemployment rate, Mulvaney referred to the U-3 and U-6. Those are two of the six \u201calternative measures of labor utilization.\u201d", "The U-3 is the official unemployment rate; it measures the percentage of unemployed workers who are actively searching for a new job. As we said earlier, it was 4.7 percent in February.", "The U-6 is the broadest measure of unemployment and underemployment; it includes not only the\u00a0total unemployed, but also discouraged workers, the marginally attached, and part-time workers who want more hours, but for economic reasons could only find part-time work. The U-6 rate was 9.2 percent in February, down from 9.4 percent in January. (Last year, when Trump criticized the \u201cphony\u201d unemployment rate, the January 2016 U-6 rate was 9.9 percent.)", "As we have written before, there are those who claim U-6 is the \u201creal\u201d unemployment rate. But Mulvaney went beyond that to question the integrity of the employment data.", "In an email to us,\u00a0Jason Furman, chairman of Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, called Mulvaney\u2019s allegations of data manipulation \u201cdangerous.\u201d", "\u201cThe claim that the Obama administration manipulated the jobs numbers is deranged, delusional and dangerous,\u201d Furman said. \u201cThe numbers are produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 an organization with over 2,000 career employees and one highly independent political appointee. They are not manipulable.\u201d", "The official and alternative measures of unemployment are based\u00a0on a monthly household survey\u00a0of about 60,000 U.S. households that include approximately 110,000 individuals. The Census Bureau launched the month survey series, known as the Current Population Survey, in\u00a0the 1940s.", "\u201cWhen all of the details are considered, the definitions [of employment] may seem rather complicated. The basic concepts, however, remain little changed since the inception of the CPS in 1940: People with jobs are employed, people who do not have jobs and are looking for jobs are unemployed, and people who meet neither labor market test are not in the labor force,\u201d the BLS said in explaining its methodology.", "As Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser, Furman would routinely issue statements on the monthly jobs figures. He said his statements \u201cfocused on the number of jobs created (precisely the statistic that OMB Director Mulvaney said was a better measure) and the official unemployment rate, but we also extensively discussed alternative measures of unemployment (U-4, U-5, and U-6), people working part-time for economic reasons, the labor force participation rate, and other measures of labor market performance.\u201d", "Asked about critics of the measurement used for the official unemployment rate, Furman said the U-3 \u2014 the official unemployment rate \u2014 \u201cis very similar to the concept used by other countries and international organizations,\u201d such as the United Nations, World Bank, and\u00a0the\u00a0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. He also said that he \u201cwould consider shifting to U-4 or U-5\u201d of the official unemployment rate, but it would be \u201ca mistake to shift to U-6.\u201d", "Furman said the U-6 \u201cincludes people working part-time for economic reasons, they may be \u2018underemployed\u2019 but it is a misnomer to call them \u2018unemployed.'\u201d The U-6 \u201ccounts someone working 30 hours who wants to work 40 hours the same as someone working 0 hours who wants to work 40 hours, which I think is conceptually off,\u201d he said.", "Mulvaney is perfectly within his rights to question what measurement best captures the nation\u2019s employment situation. But he went beyond that when he accused the Obama administration of manipulating employment data without providing any evidence.", "Update, March 14: During our reporting, we asked the Bureau of Labor Statistics if there had been any changes in how BLS calculated the unemployment rate under the Obama administration. After we posted this article, BLS spokeswoman Stacey Flores responded: \u201cThere have been no changes in how the unemployment rate is calculated during the time periods you mention.\u201d", "Correction, Oct. 27: There were 76 straight months of job growth under Obama \u2014 not 75 as we originally wrote \u2014 and 77 straight months of growth through February.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
