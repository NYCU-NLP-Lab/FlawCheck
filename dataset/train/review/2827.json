Several outlets also referred to the new law as a \"backless booster seat ban,\" further confusing the issue. However, this is also inaccurate, as the legislation is actually geared toward manufacturers and will only affect new products:", "So although the safety guidelines will change - and child car seat experts agree this type of backless booster seat is unsuitable for such young children - those continuing to use one will not face any action.", "A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"New booster cushions without a backrest will only be able to be approved as \u2018Group 3\u2019 products, i.e. for children over 125cm or 22kg.", "Parents who continue to put their children in booster cushions can continue to do so without breaking any laws in the UK. \u00a0In the U.S., laws about child safety restraints vary by state or region.", "Henderson, Emma. \u00a0 \"Backless booster seats to be banned for younger children under new laws.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Independent. \u00a0 27 April 2016.", "Packham, Amy. \u00a0 \"\u2018Booster Seat Ban\u2019: Changes To Child Car Seats \u2018Delayed Until March 2017\u2019.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Huffington Post. \u00a0 27 April 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
