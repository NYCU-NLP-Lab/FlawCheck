However, that isn't exactly the case: a\u00a0spokesperson for the IPC\u00a0told the media\u00a0that Craig wasn't disqualified specifically for having a tattoo that shows the Olympic rings, but because his tattoo was\u00a0viewed as constituting \"advertising\" for a sporting event other than the one in which he was participating:", "Body advertising is not allowed in any way whatsoever and that includes the Olympic rings. The athlete did not wear a cover and was therefore disqualified.", "All teams are informed of the advertising policy at a technical meeting prior to competition so it wasn't as if they had not been reminded about the rules.\"", "Craig, who won a gold medal in a\u00a02012 Paralympics men's swimming event (and didn't have the Olympics rings tattoo at the time) was also not\u00a0automatically\u00a0disqualified from\u00a0all of his events.  He was allowed to continue participating as long as he covered the tattoo, which he did.", "While the Paralympics are sometimes viewed as a subset of the Olympics, they are run by two different organizations.\u00a0The International Paralympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee are separate organizations, operate\u00a0under two different sets of rules, and\u00a0use very different logos (the following is the IPC logo):", "While the IPC will\u00a0not allow their athletes to show Olympic rings tattoos during Olympic events since the symbol could\u00a0be construed as advertising for another event, athletes are still allowed to show Olympic ring tattoos during Olympic events.", "In fact, Olympic rings tattoos are quite popular among Olympic athletes. A gallery of Olympic athletes with tattoos published by the Baltimore Sun shows several athletes competing with the iconic rings design inked on their bodies:", "While it's\u00a0true that a Paralympic athlete was temporarily disqualified from Paralympic events for having an uncovered tattoo of Olympic rings on his chest, which\u00a0violated a rule against\u00a0advertising for other events,\u00a0this rule only applies to athletes competing under IPC regulations, not to all athletes (and that rule can be satisfied through the covering of tattoos).", "The Olympics have similar, strict rules and guidelines\u00a0about brand identification, which extends to tattoos. \u00a0As with the Paralympics, bearing\u00a0a tattoo will not automatically disqualify a participant from all events: if such a tattoo\u00a0violates\u00a0rules about branding or placement, it just must be covered.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
