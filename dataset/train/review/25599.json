["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on March 22, 2018", "There have been eight congressional special elections since Donald Trump was inaugurated, and Republicans have won five of them. But the president spun that into a 5-0 record \u201cup until last week\u201d in a speech at a National Republican Congressional Committee dinner.", "Trump told his audience at the March 20 dinner that \u201cwe have to worry about \u201918 before we worry about \u201920.\u201d He went on to describe an undefeated streak so far for the GOP.", "Trump, March 20:\u00a0And the other thing is, you know, we had five races up until last week. And of the five races, we won all five. These people back here expected us to lose a couple of those races, maybe more than that. We won. They didn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0So they said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t win by as much as we were supposed to.\u201d And, by the way, if we won by more, they would\u2019ve found a reason. So we\u2019re fighting the press, we\u2019re fighting the media; we always will, for whatever reason. But we\u2019re 5 and 0, and then we lost by 300 votes the other night, right? Three-hundred out of two-hundred-and-twenty-some-odd-thousand votes. Three-hundred votes.", "The president was speaking to the NRCC, which supports Republican candidates to the House. In his remarks, Trump counted only the House special elections in which the Republican candidate won to hold on to a Republican seat, ignoring that the Democrats held on to California\u2019s 34th District. In the California race, two Democrats vied for the seat in a runoff after an open primary.", "Trump acknowledged the Republican loss last week in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District, but he downplayed Conor Lamb\u2019s upset over Rick Saccone as a mere 300-vote loss. It was a thin margin of victory, but Lamb is actually ahead by 627 in the unofficial results. Pittsburgh\u2019s Tribune-Review reported that the lead was 758 votes as of March 20, as officials are sorting through provisional and other remaining ballots. In the past two House elections, the Republican ran unopposed in the district, which Trump won by nearly 20 points in the 2016 presidential election.", "Trump is also leaving out the one Senate special election \u2014 the Alabama race in which a Democrat, Doug Jones, won for the first time in 25 years, beating Republican Roy Moore.", "The two upset victories by the Democrats and the closer-than-expected losses in many of the other congressional races have prompted political prognosticators to reassess the political landscape for the 2018 midterm elections.", "In December, after Jones won in Alabama, FiveThirtyEight calculated what it called \u201cpartisan lean\u201d \u2014 a measure of how a district or state would be expected to vote in a \u201cneutral environment,\u201d in which a presidential race would be a 50-50 tie between the two parties. It found that in the 2017 special elections:\u00a0\u201cThe Democrats have outperformed the partisan lean in all of them.\u201d\u00a0After Lamb\u2019s upset in Pennsylvania, the Cook Political Report changed its ratings in 10 House races, giving the Democrats better odds of winning in nine of them.", "Below is the official scorecard for all eight of the congressional special elections so far.", "Of the seven House special elections in 2017 and 2018, the NRCC spent money in five of them, staying out of elections in Utah\u2019s 3rd District, where Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz\u2019s seat was filled by Provo Mayor John Curtis, and California\u2019s 34th District. So, the NRCC\u2019s scorecard so far is 4-1 for the races to which it contributed.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
