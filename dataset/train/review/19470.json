Or they might be in the mood when there aren\u2019t available females around. Cambr\u00e9 noted that a nearby lioness appeared to be pregnant, which would make her unavailable.", "\u201cIf there was a receptive female that would wander up about that point, they would stop that,\u201d said Packer, who compared the lions\u2019 mounting to a dog humping\u00a0a human\u2019s leg.", "But Packer said it\u2019s not \u201cmating,\u201d as some headlines declared. To be specific: Lions let out a \u201cdistinctive yowling noise\u201d when they finish the deed, Packer said,\u00a0and that didn\u2019t happen in Cambr\u00e9\u2019s videos.", "What does all this say\u00a0about the nature of homosexuality, including in humans? Probably not much, Packer said. But that hasn\u2019t stopped people\u00a0from holding up animals\u2019 sexual behavior to make a point about human sexuality, often with political ends.", "It also says that while it's probably never a good idea to overanthropomorphize animal behavior, it's clear that leonine relationships, like their\u00a0human counterparts,\u00a0are\u00a0complicated.", "Brooke Binkowski is a former editor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
