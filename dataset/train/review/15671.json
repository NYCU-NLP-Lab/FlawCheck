But we did want to check out his claim that America leads in climate change skepticism.", "Global lukewarming", "We\u2019ll start with Limbaugh\u2019s source.", "In its first-ever Global Trends Survey, Ipsos MORI used an online poll to survey roughly 32,000 adults in 20 countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Great Britain, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States.)", "Respondents were asked about their attitudes on climate change.

The United States ranked near the middle of the nations when asked if there is too much of a fuss made about the environment. And Americans recycle at average rates -- though Duffy noted recycling could be motivated by other concerns such as use of resources and socialization.", "Hockey stick gaffes", "The survey itself is somewhat limited. While more than 1,000 people were surveyed in some countries including the United States, other countries such as Argentina, Belgium, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Sweden and Turkey included around 500 individuals. Duffy explained that this was due to client interest in the those markets, as Ipsos MORI is a market researcher.", "Who was surveyed is also important. Ipsos MORI said the survey was representative of the general adult population in \"developed\" (shorthand for greater Internet access) nations such as the United States. But in developing nations, Ispos said it surveyed a \"more affluent and \u2018connected\u2019 population\" to represent an emerging middle class, according to Duffy.", "To some pollsters, this method of surveying is problematic. It doesn\u2019t make sense to compare the elites of one country to the general population of another, said University of Maryland public policy researcher Steven Kull.", "\"If you\u2019re looking at public opinion in a country, look at the country. If you want to look at a subset, look at a subset. Otherwise it\u2019s apples to oranges,\" he said.", "Still, Ipsos\u2019 findings are fairly consistent with the most recent Pew Research Center survey -- where 67 percent of Americans said that there is solid evidence of global warming, and 44 percent say it\u2019s mostly due to human activity. A separate Pew Global poll found that when stacked up against 22 other countries, the United States was one of the least concerned about global warming, right under China and Britain and outranking only Poland and Pakistan. (Interestingly, Ipsos found that 91 percent of people in China said the world was heading for an environmental disaster unless we change our habits. Duffy said this can be explained again by the sampling approach and mode of interview.)", "One of the most comprehensive polls we found was Gallup\u2019s 2010 survey of 111 countries. Though nearly all Americans were aware of global warming, 47 percent -- the largest percentage in the world -- said it was due to solely natural causes. About half said global warming was at least partly anthropogenic, a 12-percentage-point drop since the last Gallup poll in 2008.", "That\u2019s slightly below the world\u2019s average but far below the rates in developed countries.", "Lower percentages of belief in human-caused climate change in developing nations make sense, given correspondingly lower rates of awareness, education and literacy, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociologist at Oklahoma State University. But in the United States, it\u2019s politics\u00a0that is causing the skepticism.", "The ruling", "Limbaugh said that the United States is \"the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change.\"", "While he cites an exact figure reported by Ipsos MORI, the study itself doesn\u2019t capture the belief of general populations, only those with an Internet connection. Other polls we looked at indicate that a good proportion of developing countries have higher rates of doubt. But among peers, the United States is one of the most -- if not, the most -- skeptical when it comes to believing climate change has human factors.", "We rate Limbaugh\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "Email interview with Bobby Duffy, managing director of the Social Research Institute at Ipsos MORI, July 27. 2014", "Interview with Riley Dunlap, environmental sociology professor at the Oklahoma State University, July 25, 2014", "Interview with Steven Kull, public opinion researcher at the University of Maryland, July 28, 2014", "Ipsos Mori, \"Global Trends 2014: Environment,\" July 2014", "CBS, Americans more skeptical of climate change than others in global survey, July 23, 2014", "Pew Research Center, Climate Change: Key Data Points from Pew Research, Jan. 27, 2014", "Pew Research Center, Chapter 5: Environmental Issues, Sept. 22, 2010", "Gallup, Worldwide, Blame for Climate Change Falls on Humans, April 22, 2011", "New York Times, Reagan and the Environment, Jan. 2, 1989", "American Behavioral Scientist, Climate Change Denial Books and Conservative Think Tanks, May 14, 2013", "The Guardian, Secret funding helped build vast network of climate denial think tanks, Feb. 14, 2013", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
