There is no evidence that the WHO statement was connected to ongoing protests over police brutality, that it shows social distancing rules lack scientific backing, or that the pandemic itself was fabricated.", "During a June 8 press briefing, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO technical lead for COVID-19, said that asymptomatic spread is \"very rare.\" The next day, she clarified her statement.", "Here are her initial comments from June 8, in context:", "\"We have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing. They\u2019re following asymptomatic cases, they\u2019re following contacts and they\u2019re not finding secondary transmission onward \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s very rare. Much of that is not published in the literature. From the papers that are published, there\u2019s one that came out from Singapore looking at a long-term care facility. There are some household transmission studies where you follow individuals over time and you look at the proportion of those that transmit onwards.", "\"We are constantly looking at this data and we\u2019re trying to get more information from countries to truly answer this question. It still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits onward. What we really want to be focused on is following the symptomatic cases. If we followed all of the symptomatic cases \u2014 because we know that this is a respiratory pathogen, it passes from an individual through infectious droplets. If we actually followed all of the symptomatic cases, isolated those cases, followed the contacts and quarantined those contacts, we could drastically reduce \u2014\u00a0I would love to be able to give a proportion \u2014 of how much transmission we would actually stop. But it would be a drastic reduction in transmission.", "\"If we could focus on that, I think we would do very, very well in terms of suppressing transmission. But from the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual.\"", "Those comments appeared to suggest that the WHO was saying the coronavirus can\u2019t really spread from asymptomatic people.

Here\u2019s what she said:", "\"What I was referring to yesterday in the press conference were a very few studies, some two or three studies, that have been published that actually try to follow asymptomatic cases \u2014 so people who are infected \u2014 over time, and then look at their contacts and see how many additional people were infected. And that\u2019s a very small subset of studies.", "\"I was responding to a question at the press conference. I wasn\u2019t stating a policy of WHO or anything like that. I was just trying to articulate what we know. And in that, I used the phrase \u2018very rare.\u2019 And I think that that\u2019s a misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare. What I was referring to was a subset of studies. I also referred to data that isn\u2019t published.\"", "Van Kerkhove went on to say that some models have predicted that anywhere between 6% and 41% of the population could be asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.

And in fact, the evidence that we have, given the percentage of people \u2014 which is about 25% to 45% \u2014\u00a0of the totality of infected people, likely are without symptoms,\" he said. \"And we know from epidemiological studies they can transmit to someone who is uninfected even when they're without symptoms.\"", "The bottom line: Asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 does occur.
