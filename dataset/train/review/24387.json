The newspaper covers Eastwood\u2019s hometown, where he was elected mayor in 1986.", "A story published in the paper on Sept. 7, 2012, reports that Eastwood had three points that he wanted to make that day: \"That not everybody in Hollywood is on the left, that Obama has broken a lot of the promises he made when he took office, and that the people should feel free to get rid of any politician who\u2019s not doing a good job.\"", "\"President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people,\" the paper quotes Eastwood as saying. \"(Mitt) Romney and (Paul) Ryan would do a much better job running the country, and that\u2019s what everybody needs to know. I may have irritated a lot of the lefties, but I was aiming for people in the middle.\"", "That\u2019s not quite what the Facebook post said.
