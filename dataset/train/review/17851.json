The write-up quotes Putin saying that the country\u2019s laws should be made keeping Russian national interest in mind and Muslim minorities are not Russians. \u201cMuslims will not take over Russia,\u201d said Putin per the speech.

At the recently concluded G-20 summit held at Osaka in Japan on June 2019, Putin had criticised \u2018Western liberalism\u2019, stating that policies like immigration are hurting national interest.", "In 2013, Vladimir Putin had appeared on Russia Today for a discussion with journalists, where he spoke at length about the need for Russian immigration policy to lay greater stress on the integration of immigrants of varied ethnicities into Russian culture and ethos, along with the need to respect Russian traditions and laws. Putin had said, \u201cEU and the US are dealing with people who come from completely different countries\u2026They [immigrants] don\u2019t begin learning the new language for many years and for that reason cannot assimilate into the labour market\u2026We [Russia] have a similar problem going on \u2013 but it is not as harshly felt and it isn\u2019t as dangerous as it is in Europe or the US. When we talk about immigration, we are talking about primarily those from the former Soviet republics.

Here, same as in the viral message, he talked about the need for immigrants to learn Russian and respect Russian culture. \u201cWe must create the conditions for immigrants to normally integrate into our society, learn Russian and, of course, respect our culture and traditions and abide by Russian law. In this regard, I believe that the decision to make learning the Russian language compulsory and administer exams is well-grounded,\u201d read the transcript of the speech.

In this address and in his interview with RT, Putin maintains the stand of integrating immigrants and ethnic minorities into Russian society. He does not make anti-Muslim or anti-Islamic remarks.", "A similar message was circulated on social media and messaging platforms, wherein it was claimed that former Australian PM Julia Gillard had asked Muslims to leave the country if they refused to adapt to local customs and traditions.
