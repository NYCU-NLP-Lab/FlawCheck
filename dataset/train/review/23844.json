States with rising numbers of COVID-19 cases were scrambling to supply hospitals with enough ventilators to meet expected need.", "The Facebook meme claimed that Democrats were purposely trying to make the pandemic worse by stashing ventilators in a warehouse instead of distributing them to hospitals, where they were needed.", "The posts, in part, echoed a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump that suggested New York wasn't acting quickly enough to distribute ventilators delivered by the federal government:\n\nHowever, both the above-displayed Facebook meme and Trump's tweet contained misleading information.", "Ventilators were not \"found\" in a New York warehouse. Officials were storing them there so they can be sent out to hospitals as the need arose. The photograph used in the Facebook meme was taken by Gothamist photographer Scott Lynch on March 24, 2020. According to Lynch's caption, it depicts 400 ventilators that were \"set to be transported to hospitals.\" Officials in New York had requested 30,000 ventilators for when cases were expected to peak in subsequent weeks. As of March 24, officials reported only having a fraction of that number.", "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo responded to Trump's tweet during a March 27 interview on CNN by calling it \"incorrect and grossly uninformed.\" Cuomo said that while state officials had projected they would imminently need 30,000 at the peak of escalating hospitalizations, those ventilators were not needed yet. Cuomo stated:", "\"That is incorrect and grossly uninformed. The point is, we have ventilators in a stockpile, and we didn't send them to the hospitals yet. Of course we didn't. That's the whole point. The hospitals don't need them yet. The hospitals aren't at their apex. The hospitals have enough ventilators today. But the numbers (of hospitalizations from COVID-19) are going up. We're planning for an apex, a high point in about 21 days. That's when we need the 30,000 ventilators, not today. Right now we're putting them in a stockpile. So the point is, well they're in a stockpile, you must not need them. It's just ignorant. Of course you don't need them today. You need them when you hit the apex, which is 30,000 (patients needing ventilators). We're not there yet.\"", "Because meme contains a false description of the photograph of ventilators about to be sent to hospitals in New York, and because it states, contrary to all evidence, that Democrats were \"trying to extend the virus instead of stopping it,\" we rate this claim \"False.\"", "Prokupecz, Shimon and Caroline Kelly.\u00a0\"Cuomo Calls Trump 'Incorrect and Grossly Uninformed' About New York's Ventilator Situation as Fight Escalates.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0CNN.\u00a027 March 2020.", "Kim, Elizabeth and Sydney Pereira.\u00a0\"Coronavirus Updates: White House Task Force Member Says Anyone Leaving NYC Should Quarantine for 14 Days.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Gothamist.\u00a024 March 2020.", "Jackson, David.\u00a0\"Trump Questions NY Request for 30,000 Ventilators: 'I Don\u2019t Believe You Need 40,000 or 30,000 Ventilators.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0USA Today.\u00a027 March 2020.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who started her career as a daily newspaper reporter and has covered everything from crime to government to national politics.
