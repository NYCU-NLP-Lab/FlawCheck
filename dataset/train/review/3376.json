["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Phony marijuana targeted by recent state legislation sounds worse than the real thing, if you believe Georgia\u2019s governor.\n\nChase\u2019s Law strengthens a ban on \"synthetic marijuana,\" ground-up plant material laced with chemicals that mimic marijuana. Chase Burnett, the bill\u2019s namesake, was found dead in March in a hot tub at his Fayette County home, a packet of the drugs nearby. He was 16. \u00a0\n\nThe bill passed with overwhelming support. On March 27, Gov. Nathan Deal signed it into law.\n\nA press release warned of synthetic marijuana\u2019s dangers:\n\n\"As the usage has dramatically increased, instances of violence, bodily harm and even death have risen with it,\" it said.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard that the drug is nasty stuff. But what\u2019s this about violence, bodily harm and death?\n\nA Deal spokeswoman sent PolitiFact Georgia news stories and poison control data to prove the governor\u2019s point. We also talked to researchers and law enforcement officials and reviewed news stories and scientific studies.\n\nThe form of synthetic marijuana that\u2019s sparking so much concern is sold at head shops and gas stations under brand names such as \"Spice\" and \"K2.\" \u00a0\n\nGeorgia made it a felony to manufacture and sell it in 2010. Chase\u2019s Law tries to keep underground chemists from tweaking their recipes to get around state restrictions. \u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s little scholarly research on the drug, which appears to be new to the U.S.\n\nFederal labs first detected these drugs in November 2008, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The earliest U.S. news story we found about its rising popularity appeared in a Hutchinson \u00a0Kan., newspaper in November 2009.\n\nAll signs suggest that synthetic marijuana use is increasing dramatically, but data is in short supply.\n\nWorkers at the American Association of Poison Control Centers began tracking synthetic marijuana calls in 2010 after they noticed more inquiries, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia.\n\nIn 2010, they received 2,906 \u00a0calls; in 2011, there were 6,959.\n\nAbout 11 percent of high school seniors reported using synthetic marijuana in the past year, according to 2011 results of an annual survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It was the first time researchers asked about the drug.\n\nExisting data support Deal\u2019s claim that reports of bodily harm have climbed. Georgia Poison Center call data show 10 users were admitted to a hospital\u2019s critical care unit in 2010 after using the drug. Forty-five were admitted in 2011.\n\nRapid heartbeat, agitation, drowsiness, vomiting, hallucinations and nausea were among the drug\u2019s most common effects, researchers have found. \u00a0\n\nMedia accounts report drug users injured in car crashes, falls and other accidents -- some fatal.\n\nWhether synthetic marijuana is directly responsible for deaths -- and whether they\u2019re increasing -- is a more complicated issue. We found no published studies on the drug\u2019s lethality, but there have been \"scattered reports of deaths,\" said Lloyd Johnston, a University of Michigan professor who conducted the National Institute on Drug Abuse survey.\n\nA count of news stories suggests there are more deadly cases. But whether the drug is a direct cause or contributing factor is not clear in some instances.\n\nConsider Burnett\u2019s death. Toxicology tests are still in the works. Whether the official cause of death was drowning, the drug or something else is unsettled.\n\nGeorgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead told PolitiFact Georgia of two other recent deaths:", "We found other accounts of synthetic marijuana-related deaths. For example, a South Carolina coroner ruled that it was directly responsible for the October death of a college basketball player who collapsed during warm-up, according to multiple news accounts.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia found less support for Deal\u2019s claim about violence. We found no published studies on the subject. News stories, however, suggest there\u2019s cause for concern.\n\nFor instance:", "To sum up:\n\nEvidence supports Deal\u2019s claim that use of the drug has \"dramatically increased,\" as has synthetic marijuana-related \"bodily harm.\" Some evidence suggests that deaths have risen, too.\n\nThe link between the drug and violence is less clear. News accounts suggest there is an increase in both, but we found so few cases it\u2019s hard to tell.\n\nDeal\u2019s statement could use clarification. Still, it earns a Mostly True.", "Office of Gov.
