["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Democratic Congressman Ron Klein has gone on the offensive in his campaign against Republican retired Army Lt. Col. Allen West -- whose $2 million war chest and national media attention have turned the race into one of the hottest Congressional contests in Florida. Klein represents a swing Congressional district that spans parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties.Klein wants to capitalize on voters' anger about the BP spill and hammers West in a June 28 fundraising e-mail. The bulk of his e-mail with the subject line \"Apologize to BP?!\" relates to West's stance on the oil spill and his connection to Congressman Joe Barton, the Texas Republican facing heat after apologizing to BP and calling Obama's demand for the escrow account a \"shakedown.\"\"In short, while sheets of oil are washing up today on Pensacola Beach, he\u2019s more concerned with BP\u2019s profits than the livelihood of fishermen, restaurateurs, or those that depend on FL tourism...,\" Klein wrote about his opponent West. \"Barton called the Obama administration\u2019s push for BP to set up a $20 billion account - a fund that would ultimately help pay for clean up and damages and wages for those who are losing their livelihood - a 'shakedown.' Most Republicans have made it very clear that Barton\u2019s actions were unacceptable. Not Allen West. A continuing supporter of offshore drilling, West\u2019s campaign is now aligned with those who would apparently give BP a pass. Thus far, the most radical Tea Partiers have taken a liking to West and what he stands for. They also haven\u2019t been shy in contributing to his cause. West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free reign.\" There are a lot of strong statements in Klein's letter that we could have chosen to fact-check. But we particularly thought that last sentence was a biting claim, and we don't mean the usual spelling of \"free rein.\" Note Klein didn't say that West would ruin Florida's beaches, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free rein -- he said that $2 million in donations to West came from\u00a0donors who\u00a0held those views. For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore whether \"West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free reign.\"We contacted Klein's campaign and asked for documentation to support their claim. Campaign spokeswoman Sarah Rothschild sent us about two dozen citations for news articles and web sites that relate to West and his donors, but she declined to define what Klein meant by \"give corporations free reign.\" We looked at most of their citations, focusing on BP and Rep. Joe Barton since that was the point of Klein's e-mail, and we break the other donors down by topic below.First, we confirmed that West had raised $2,065,855 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. It's not logical to assume that every one those donors would ruin the beaches and end Medicare and Social Security. We found a few tenuous connections to those issues among a small handful of donors but not enough for a blanket statement.Congressman Joe BartonWest got $1,000 from Rep. Joe Barton's Texas Freedom Fund PAC on March 3, 2010, FEC reports show. On June 17 at a Congressional hearing on BP, Barton, the ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, defended BP. The Wasington Post's Right Now blog reported that Barton said: \"It is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown, in this case a $20 billion shakedown.\"Later the same day, Barton apologized for his apology after Republican leaders threatened to take away his committee leadership position.The Tampa Tribune reported June 25 that West about a week earlier had also raised concerns about the BP escrow account at a business luncheon in Palm Beach Gardens. \"West said that while he was 'angry with BP' for the spill, 'when you have an executive branch that goes to a private sector business and takes their private equity funds and demands that they put it into an escrow account, something is upside down in this country. That is a very dangerous precedent that we establish.'\" Even though West may not like the way the restitution happened, the Freedom Fund donation came about a month before the Gulf oil well blowout.So we moved on to the other citations Klein's camp sent us.Oil and gas, banks", "The PACsNext, we looked at political action committees, some of them\u00a0set up by\u00a0controversial public officials:", "Clearly, West has taken money from at least a few donors that have either been sympathetic to BP, in favor of massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare or affiliated with corporations that have been accused of wrongdoing. But that's not what Klein's campaign said.", "Klein's fundraising e-mail said: \"West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare and give corporations free reign.\" The donors the Klein campaign cited added up to about $25,000 -- only a sliver of his $2 million campaign. The West campaign could cherrypick too and likely find negative headlines about some of Klein's donors -- including BP in previous election cycles. But we don't think that we can draw conclusions about all of Klein's donors based on his BP donations. Similarily, there is no way Klein would know the viewpoints of all of West's donors\u00a0unless he researched all of their views on these topics -- an impossible endeavor.
