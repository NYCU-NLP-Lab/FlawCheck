This article is a reminder that history shows presidential candidates are often elected based on the state of the union and mood of the people in a particular election cycle. If either Hillary or Bernie is elected, better start preparing for the collapse of America as we know it. The author seems to understand that and is sending a warning.", "However, there were many inconsistencies.\u00a0The author of the piece was still only described, not named, and we were unable to find a published article by\u00a0The New Yorker that matched the item.

Around the same time, other\u00a0versions began to appear, all with the same publication claim.", "As it turned out,\u00a0it wasn't written by anyone at The New Yorker\u00a0or Bloomberg, and didn't appear anywhere in either publication. \u00a0The piece\u00a0was\u00a0small-government advocate and President Obama birth certificate\u00a0conspiracy theorist\u00a0Don Fredrick's work, and was originally\u00a0published on his\u00a0blog,\u00a0The Complete Obama Timeline.
