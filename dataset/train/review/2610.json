["Lakhs of students appear for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) every year. Both these exams have been postponed a number of times this year due to COVID-19. On August 25, however, the National Testing Agency (NTA) confirmed that JEE (Main) and NEET (UG) exams will be held as scheduled from September 1 to 6 and September 13 respectively. This started a nationwide debate and social media campaign to postpone the exams in view of rising COVID-19 cases in the country. Hashtags like #ProtestAgainstExamsInCovid and #AntiStudentModiGovt were trended to demand postponement of the entrance tests.", "On August 21, National Vice President of All India Students\u2019 Association (AISA) Ashutosh Kumar tweeted two screenshots of alleged news articles by News18 and NDTV. AISA is the student wing affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation. As per the News18 screenshot, 57 parents and grandparents of students who appeared for an exam in Karanataka passed away after over 5,000 students tested positive for COVID. Kumar wrote, \u201cThis is what happened when only 80,000 candidates appeared for exams all over India just think when 28 Lac students will be appearing what will be the condition! Still they say student cannot decide their welfare. #ProtestAgainstExamsInCOVID.\u201d This tweet was retweeted over 3,000 times.
