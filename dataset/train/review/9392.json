["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on June 30, 2020", "Noting that the United States accounts for about one-quarter of global COVID-19 cases and deaths, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the U.S. has \u201cthe worst record of any country in the world.\u201d While the U.S. has the most confirmed cases and deaths by a wide margin, it does not have the most in either category on a per-capita basis.", "Pelosi emphasized the U.S. share of coronavirus-related cases and deaths during a June 28 interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d\u00a0in which she argued the Trump administration is not taking the growing outbreak in several U.S. states seriously.", "\u201cWe are 4% of the world\u2019s population,\u201d the Democratic leader told host George Stephanopoulos. \u201cWe are 25% of the cases and the deaths, 25%. We have the worst record of any country in the world. And the president says we\u2019re making progress or whatever.\u201d", "Pelosi got the percentages right, but where the U.S. ranks in dealing with the pandemic depends on how one looks at the numbers.", "Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, confirmed to FactCheck.org in an email that the congresswoman labeled the U.S. the \u201cworst\u201d based on it \u201chaving the most coronavirus deaths and confirmed cases of any country.\u201d", "According to the University of Oxford-based project Our World in Data, as of June 28, the day Pelosi made her claim, there were 9.95 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and 2.51 million, or 25%, of those cases were in the U.S \u2014 the most of any nation.", "The U.S. total was 1.2 million cases more than the second-highest country, Brazil, which had 1.31 million cases as of that day.", "But the U.S. did not have the most cases per capita \u2014 which takes into account a country\u2019s population.", "As of June 28, the U.S. had 7,584 confirmed cases per 1 million people, which was fewer cases than nine other nations, including Chile (14,007.27), Kuwait (10,394.65) and Peru (8,370.44). Qatar, which has an estimated population of almost 3 million, had the most cases per capita \u2014 32,509.91 per 1 million people.", "Based on the raw numbers, the U.S. also led all countries with 125,539, or 25%, of the 498,521 confirmed deaths from COVID-19, as of June 28 \u2014 according to Our World in Data figures. Brazil again was second to the U.S. with 57,070 confirmed deaths.", "Per capita, however, the U.S. \u2014 with 379.27 confirmed deaths per 1 million people \u2014 had fewer fatalities from COVID-19 than eight other nations.", "Among those countries with more confirmed deaths per capita: Belgium (839.72), the United Kingdom (640.99), Italy (574.18), Sweden (522.81) and France (456.20).", "In addition, the U.S. had a lower COVID-19 case fatality rate than several nations. The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by confirmed cases.", "As of June 28, the U.S. rate was 5% \u2014 lower than the rate in dozens of other countries.", "According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, out of the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the U.S., as of June 30, has the fifth highest observed case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 and the second highest per-capita death rate.", "Pelosi\u2019s claim, that the U.S. has fared the worst based on its total confirmed cases and deaths, reminded us of President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the U.S. leads the world in testing for COVID-19 simply based on the number of tests performed.", "In Trump\u2019s case, we also pointed out that because of the large U.S. population, a per-capita comparison would be a better gauge of countries\u2019 testing efforts. By that measurement, we found the U.S. trailed at least a dozen countries in testing for the disease, as of May 9, and it\u2019s still not leading the world.", "Pelosi no doubt has a point about the large number of confirmed cases and deaths in the U.S. \u2014 and it is in no way our intention to minimize the seriousness of the situation.", "But, similar to Trump\u2019s boasts on testing, whether the U.S. has the \u201cworst record\u201d \u2013 as Pelosi said \u2014 also depends on the metric used.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
