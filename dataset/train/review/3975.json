["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on September 25, 2017", "Television ads in the Virginia governor\u2019s race criticize Lt. Gov. Ralph\u00a0Northam for his role on a state economic development board. But there is less here than meets the eye:", "Virginia and New Jersey are the only two states with gubernatorial elections in 2017. In Virginia, Republican Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, faces Northam, a Democrat who has served as the state\u2019s lieutenant governor since 2014. Recent polling shows the Virginia race remains close.", "The Gillespie campaign has run two TV ads in recent days that focus on a $1.4 million state economic grant to a Beijing-based company for a failed project in\u00a0Appomattox County.", "Over the years we have written about a lot of TV ads that feature China as the bogeyman, so it is not surprising that one of Gillespie\u2019s ads plays up a Chinese angle.", "The ad says, \u201cChina wins, America loses. It\u2019s a story that Virginia families know all too well. Ralph Northam\u2019s made things worse. Northam helped lead Virginia\u2019s economic development agency that gave $1.4 million to a Chinese company with a fake website. Virginia taxpayers got ripped off.\u201d", "The facts about the project are accurate. Virginia awarded Lindenburg Industry, a Chinese manufacturing company,\u00a0a $1.4 million economic incentive grant in 2014 for a plant that would manufacture industrial clean-air products.\u00a0The\u00a0$113 million project was supposed to create 349 jobs.", "But the project never materialized, and the agency confirmed for us that the funds were not recovered \u2014 a point that is made in Gillespie\u2019s TV ads.", "But the ad overplays Northam\u2019s role in the awarding of the $1.4 million grant for the Appomattox project.", "The ad says Northam \u201chelped lead\u201d the agency. As lieutenant governor, Northam was an ex officio member of the board \u2014 one of 24 voting members at the time. He also sits on 13 other boards.", "The VEDP board has no direct role in the grant process.\u00a0The agency is run by a professional staff, which in most cases \u201chas discretion over which businesses receive grant awards and the amount awarded, pending final approval by the Governor,\u201d according to a 2016 management audit of the agency by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.", "The\u00a0Governor\u2019s Development Opportunity Fund \u2014 now known as the Commonwealth\u2019s Development Opportunity Fund, or COP Fund \u2014\u00a0was the source of the $1.4 million.\u00a0The \u201cfinal approval authority\u201d for that fund is the governor (see table C-1 of the 2016 management audit).", "Gov. Terry McAuliffe was instrumental in awarding the grant, according to agency records.", "The agency lists the Lindenburg project among its \u201ccase studies.\u201d In its description of the project, the agency says: \u201cThis project is a result of Governor McAuliffe\u2019s meeting with company officials in China during VEDP\u2019s Asia Marketing Mission.\u201d", "When he\u00a0announced the grant on Nov. 5, 2014, McAuliffe said: \u201cI had the great privilege of meeting with company officials in Beijing, China and close this significant win during my Asia marketing mission and I am thrilled that Lindenburg Industry is establishing their first U.S. manufacturing operation in Virginia.\u201d", "The Gillespie campaign, in response to our questions about the ad, said Northam should be held accountable for the board\u2019s failure to provide oversight on the Lindenburg project. It referred us to the 2016 management audit.", "That report said the board has a history of failing to provide effective oversight since the economic development agency was established in 1995 by then-Gov. George Allen.\u00a0\u201cThe board has historically not held VEDP sufficiently accountable, largely due to members\u2019 lack of engagement and apparent misunderstanding of their governing responsibilities,\u201d the report says.", "The audit commission recommended that the Legislature amend the statute governing the VEDP to make clear that the board \u201cis a supervisory board and is responsible for ensuring that VEDP executes all of its statutory responsibilities efficiently and effectively.\u201d", "We also note that the report says that improvements have been made to the board since 2014, which is when Northam joined the board.", "\u201cThe board\u2019s demonstrated efforts to improve its level of engagement since 2014 represent an important and necessary step forward with respect to the governance and oversight \u2014 and therefore the accountability \u2014 of VEDP,\u201d the report said.", "The audit commission did an analysis of 133 projects from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2015, saying the agency \u201chas not sought repayment for 23 projects that did not meet their contractual requirements, totaling an estimated $8.7 million.\u201d It also said that nearly half \u2014 46 percent \u2014 of the 133 projects \u201cdid not meet all [contractual] requirements.\u201d", "On the Lindenburg Industry grant, the audit blamed the VEDP professional staff for failing \u201cto validate the legitimacy of a company that received a $1.4 million COF grant in November 2014.\u201d", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "A second Gillespie TV ad also attacks Northam on the failed\u00a0Lindenburg Industry project, but this time it focuses on Northam\u2019s attendance record.", "It says that Northam \u201cskipped 58 percent of the meetings at Virginia\u2019s economic development agency and they gave $1.4 million tax dollars to a bogus Chinese company with a fake website.\u201d", "(To be clear, the company exists, but it had a website that contained false information.)", "When we asked the Gillespie campaign about the claim, it provided us with a list of 12 board meeting minutes from March 12, 2014, which was Northam\u2019s first, to March 9, 2017, which was Northam\u2019s last. (Northam left the board after the governor and state General Assembly agreed on legislation in April that restructured the board, reducing the number of its members to 17 \u2014 including six ex officio members, but not the lieutenant governor.)", "The meeting minutes showed that Northam attended five meetings and sent staff to seven. So while the ad says that Northam \u201cskipped 58 percent\u201d of the meetings, it fails to say that the lieutenant governor\u2019s office was represented at 100 percent of the meetings.", "As we mentioned earlier, Northam was an ex officio member of the board. He also sits on 13 other boards and serves as the Senate president, presiding over the Senate sessions.", "It\u2019s not uncommon for high-ranking ex officio members to send staff to represent them on the boards that are assigned to them by virtue of their position.", "It\u2019s also not uncommon for elected officials to be criticized for not attending meetings, even if they send someone else in their place. In fact, board attendance has been an issue in previous Virginia campaigns, and both parties have used it as an attack line.", "In 2009, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, Jody Wagner, criticized then-Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling at an Oct. 19, 2009, debate for attending only 6 percent of the meetings for seven state boards and commissions.", "\u201cThese are critical times, and we need a lieutenant governor who\u2019s going to show up every day and work full time to make sure we\u2019re moving the commonwealth of\u00a0Virginia\u00a0forward,\u201d Wagner said.", "Bolling, a Republican, called the attack on his board attendance \u201ca classic example of the distortion, the dishonesty and, quite frankly, the hypocrisy\u201d of a failing campaign. He also noted that \u201ca member of my staff\u201d attended meetings he missed \u2013 that\u2019s what happened in Northam\u2019s case as well. But the Gillespie campaign ad does not say that (and neither does a similar ad\u00a0on Northam\u2019s board attendance paid for by the conservative Americans for Prosperity.)", "In fact, both Gillespie ads don\u2019t tell the full story. That\u2019s why we present a more complete story about Northam\u2019s role on the board. We leave it for Virginia voters to make up their own minds about Northam\u2019s culpability in the agency\u2019s decisions, particularly as it pertains to the $1.4 million that state voters lost on the Appomattox project.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
