["President Donald Trump's anti-human trafficking stance has become a hallmark of\u00a0his administration. Daughter and adviser\u00a0Ivanka Trump\u00a0has spurred the president's investment in anti-trafficking measures since the beginning of his term. She called trafficking an \"ugly stain on civilization\" at the\u00a0unveiling of the Trafficking in Persons\u00a0report at the State Department in 2017, according to CNN.", "Ivanka Trump's work to mitigate human\u00a0trafficking globally is also well-documented, from a meeting\u00a0with survivors in Italy\u00a0to her influence in the Oval Office.", "During her speech at the Republican National Convention in August, Trump mentioned nine pieces of anti-trafficking legislation passed during the Trump administration.", "\"To protect the most vulnerable among us, I\u2019ve worked alongside the president as he signed into law nine pieces of legislation to combat the evil of human trafficking,\" Ivanka Trump said, according to a transcript on the transcription blog Rev.", "A claim posted to Facebook days later appeared to reflect Trump's statement, but it referenced nine executive orders instead of laws.", "\"Our President has signed 9 Executive Orders to combat child trafficking!\" user Doug Ellingson\u00a0posted\u00a0on Aug. 29. \"Ask yourself why you don't know this? Who is fighting to keep it from you? And why don't they want you to know?\"", "The viral post has over 39,000 shares and over 1,900 reactions.

According to the website for Congress, before the RNC in August,\u00a0Trump had signed eight bills expressly targeting\u00a0human trafficking into law:", "Budgets for anti-human trafficking programs are referenced in other pieces of legislation passed during Trump's term.

The claim mistakes\u00a0nine pieces of anti-human trafficking legislation for\u00a0executive orders signed by Trump to combat child trafficking. The president has only signed two executive orders,\u00a0one concerning child trafficking and another to prevent international trafficking. It is true that the president has signed\u00a0eight bills expressly targeting\u00a0human trafficking since 2017.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
