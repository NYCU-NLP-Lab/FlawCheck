["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Mayor Lori Lightfoot. (Rich Hein / Chicago Sun-Times)", "While defending Chicago\u2019s offer to the union representing the city\u2019s public school teachers, Mayor Lori Lightfoot claimed it would provide them with a generous salary increase \u2014 on top of an already high payscale.", "At a town hall Lightfoot held last month, a high school student told the mayor students need teachers to be paid well, emphasizing the role they play in students\u2019 lives.", "\"I agree with you 100% that teachers are important,\" Lightfoot responded. \"Teachers do need to be paid well, and in Chicago, they are. Teachers in Chicago Public Schools are paid some of the highest compensation of any school system in the country.\"", "The city\u2019s offer to increase teacher pay by 16% over five years, Lightfoot added, is \"a good deal.\"", "The city\u2019s last contract with the Chicago Teachers Union expired in June, and the district\u2019s 25,000 teachers and support staff have set an Oct. 17 strike date if a deal isn\u2019t hammered out by then.", "Is Lightfoot correct that teachers in Chicago are already among the nation\u2019s highest paid? We decided to find out.", "Under the most recent contract, the district\u2019s base salary for a new teacher with a bachelor\u2019s degree is just under $53,000. The maximum salary a teacher can earn in CPS after years of experience and with higher credentials is a little more than $101,000. That\u2019s before the value of required annual pension contributions the district makes on a teacher\u2019s behalf.", "In response to our inquiry, a spokesperson for Lightfoot\u2019s office provided a spreadsheet comparing CPS teacher salaries at different levels in their careers with those in districts in the nation\u2019s 10 other largest cities, and pointed us to some state-level salary data.", "But Lightfoot didn\u2019t limit her comparison to what teachers make in other large cities, so we went looking for more comprehensive data to assess her sweeping claim.", "None of the sources we found allow for a direct comparison of overall teacher compensation \u2014 not just salary, but pension and health care benefits \u2014 across all districts nationally.", "However, figures compiled by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a nonpartisan policy and research center, make it possible to compare teacher salaries at various levels of education and experience among the nation\u2019s 124 largest districts.", "During the 2017-2018 school year, the latest year for which the group has updated figures, Chicago ranked 22nd out of 124 for its starting salary. The survey adjusted for cost of living using a measure developed by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.", "Chicago\u2019s ranking improved for teachers with more years of teaching and higher education credentials, according to the center\u2019s analysis. For example, a teacher with a master\u2019s degree and 10 years of job experience made more under Chicago\u2019s salary schedule than their counterparts in all but two of the districts included in the group\u2019s database.", "Even so, Lightfoot didn\u2019t constrain her remarks to the nation\u2019s 100-plus largest districts either. And salary schedules are different than the average compensation a teacher in a given district actually receives.", "\"A salary schedule really doesn\u2019t tell you what the reality is on the ground,\" said Robert Bruno, a labor expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, adding that it doesn\u2019t say how many teachers are actually making that pay. \"It says contractually, this is where people would be if they\u2019re at this level.\"", "So we turned to data obtained by the Better Government Association through an open records request to the Illinois State Board of Education to see how Chicago stacked up within state lines. (The Better Government Association runs PolitiFact Illinois.)", "The short answer: Not so well.", "Chicago Public Schools came out 109th of the state\u2019s more than 800 school districts based on average teacher pay alone. Including bonuses, health and pension benefits, its ranking rose somewhat. But it still trailed 34 other districts, many of them located in the more affluent suburbs outside Chicago and in the surrounding collar counties.", "Ben Ost, an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told us it\u2019s likely CPS trails districts in similar suburbs throughout the nation as well.", "Lightfoot said Chicago Public School teachers are \"paid some of the highest compensation of any school system in the country.\"", "Data from teacher salary schedules compiled by the National Council on Teacher Quality shows Chicago ranks 22nd among the nation\u2019s 124 largest districts for starting salary. Its ranking also nears the top of the list for teachers with more years of experience and higher degrees.", "But Lightfoot didn\u2019t limit her remarks to larger districts, nor to salary. So we turned to Illinois data, which shows CPS ranks well outside the top 20 for average teacher compensation in its own state.", "We rate Lightfoot\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "MOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.", "Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "Video, Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s Periscope account, Sept. 25, 2019", "CTU contract, Chicago Public Schools, accessed Oct. 9, 2019", "Email and phone interview, Jordan Troy, spokesperson for Mayor Lightfoot, Oct. 2 & Oct. 9, 2019", "Email, Michael Passman, spokesperson for Chicago Public Schools, Oct. 8, 2019", "Email, Tom Snyder, program director of annual reports and information at the National Center for Education Statistics, Sept. 30, 2019", "Email, Celeste Busser, spokesperson for the National Education Association, Sept. 30, 2019", "Email, Holly Peele, library director at Education Week, Oct. 3, 2019", "Email, Sara Robertson, spokesperson for the Learning Policy Institute, Oct. 3, 2019", "Email, Gary Steinberg, spokesperson for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Oct. 4, 2019", "Email, Andrew Crook, spokesperson for the American Federation of Teachers, Oct. 4, 2019", "Email, Jesse Rothstein, professor of public policy and economics at the University of California Berkeley, Oct. 6 - 7, 2019", "Email and phone interview, Kency Nittler, director of teacher policy at the National Council on Teacher Quality, Oct. 7, 2019", "General salary data, National Council on Teacher Quality, accessed Oct. 7, 2019", "Phone interview, Robert Bruno, director of the Labor Education Program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Oct. 9, 2019", "Teacher pay data for the 2017-2018 school year, obtained via the Illinois Freedom of Information Act from the Illinois State Board of Education", "Email, Ben Ost, professor of economics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Oct. 7- 8, 2019", "Phone interview, Chad Aldeman, teacher pension expert at Bellwether Education Partners, Oct. 8, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
