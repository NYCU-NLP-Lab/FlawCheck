["By Robert Farley", "Posted on August 17, 2016", "It wasn\u2019t enough that a well-respected macroeconomics firm concluded Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposals \u2014 if fully implemented \u2014 would add millions of jobs while Donald Trump\u2019s would cost millions of jobs. Clinton said that report came from \u201csomebody who advised John McCain back in 2008, so you know that, no, he\u2019s not a Democrat.\u201d Actually, he is a Democrat.", "In fact, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, contributed the maximum amount allowable \u2014 $2,700 \u2014 to Clinton\u2019s primary campaign.", "For years, Zandi has been ensnared in a partisan game. Democrats frequently cite his work to bolster their arguments, and then quickly note that Zandi was once an adviser to McCain\u2019s presidential campaign. In other words, the Democrats imply, even one of their guys says our plan is better.", "That\u2019s misleading, as we and other fact-checkers have noted time and again.", "But last week, Clinton upped the rhetoric another notch, from misleading to downright false. She said that Zandi \u201cadvised John McCain back in 2008\u201d and then added, \u201cso you know that, no, he\u2019s not a Democrat.\u201d", "Zandi\u2019s role with the McCain campaign has frequently been overplayed. And Zandi confirmed to us that he is a longtime registered Democrat and that he contributed the maximum amount allowable \u2014 $2,700 \u2014 to Clinton\u2019s primary campaign.", "Some serious caveats to Clinton\u2019s claim are also in order. Moody\u2019s Analytics concluded that if Clinton were able to fully implement the plans she has outlined in her campaign, the economy would add 10.4 million jobs during Clinton\u2019s presidency. But that\u2019s 3.2 million more than it projects would be added under current law. Moreover, Moody\u2019s Analytics doesn\u2019t expect Clinton would be able to pass all of her proposals through a divided Congress. \u201cGiven the current political discord,\u201d Moody\u2019s expects Congress would put up \u201csubstantial roadblocks\u201d to Clinton\u2019s policy proposals, and under its \u201cmost-likely scenario,\u201d a Clinton presidency would result in employment going just \u201ca bit higher\u201d than it otherwise would \u2014 putting the U.S. on a path to create 1.5 million more jobs over 10 years than is expected under current law.", "Reflexively identifying Zandi as \u201can adviser to McCain\u201d or \u201cMcCain\u2019s chief economic adviser\u201d \u2014 as Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, Tim Kaine, wrongly did during his speech at the Democratic convention \u2014 has been an ongoing political game played by leading Democrats for years to try to add another layer of credibility to reports from Zandi\u2019s firm deemed favorable to their position.", "Zandi was hired to provide economic data to the McCain campaign\u2019s economic advisory team and was not a direct adviser to McCain, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was the McCain campaign\u2019s director of domestic and economic policy (aka the actual chief economic adviser to McCain). Clearly irritated, Holtz-Eakin told us in a phone interview that he was weary of and fed up with the false narrative about Zandi\u2019s politics being \u201cpushed for political reasons.\u201d", "\u201cThis ends today,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. \u2026 It\u2019s not fair to Mark.\u201d", "Holtz-Eakin said he reached out to Zandi during the 2008 campaign to ask him to provide reports on economic and financial market data. Holtz-Eakin said he \u2014 not Zandi \u2014 then used that data to inform his policy recommendations to McCain.", "Holtz-Eakin said Zandi did not talk to, meet with or otherwise directly advise McCain.", "Zandi \u201cadvised me and me alone,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said.", "Holtz-Eakin said he hired Zandi because, \u201che\u2019s a good economist, extremely knowledgeable about macroeconomics. \u2026 I have a lot of respect for Mark.\u201d", "For his part, Zandi noted that he was, in fact, named as an economic adviser to the McCain campaign.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of public record, and it was broadcast by the campaign,\u201d Zandi told us, pointing to an article in the Wall Street Journal in 2007 about McCain\u2019s advisory committee of economists. The article noted that Zandi is a registered Democrat but quoted him saying that he has \u201cdone work for both Democrats and Republicans.\u201d", "\u201cI devoted a significant amount of time and energy to the campaign, providing almost daily written briefings on the performance of the economy and financial markets, offering policy suggestions on how to respond to the developing crisis (including on mortgage restructuring and fiscal stimulus), and participating on numerous calls with the entire economics team,\u201d Zandi told us via email.", "In the realm of political infractions, highlighting just this one line from Zandi\u2019s resume is perhaps a parking violation. But it has proven to be an intractable one, and it has been remarkably resistant to fact-checkers\u2019 efforts over the years to set the record straight.", "In September 2010, for example, we corrected\u00a0Kaine, then\u00a0chairman of the Democratic National Committee, when he referred to Zandi as \u201cJohn McCain\u2019s chief economics adviser.\u201d Zandi had strongly endorsed the economic stimulus measure that McCain denounced as wasteful and ineffective. In 2011, we wrote about it again when President Obama referred to Zandi as \u201cJohn McCain\u2019s former economist\u201d when citing Zandi\u2019s report about jobs created by the stimulus.", "Zandi\u2019s role with the McCain campaign was again highlighted by Democrats in 2012, when on CNN, Zandi said of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney\u2019s tax plan, \u201cthe arithmetic doesn\u2019t work as it is right now.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders even joined in \u2014 referring to Zandi as the \u201cformer economic adviser to John McCain\u201d \u2013when Zandi issued a report finding that the budget proposed by Romney\u2019s running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, would result in job losses.", "So when Moody\u2019s Analytics issued reports this year finding Clinton\u2019s plans would do more for jobs than Trump\u2019s, Clinton and Kaine wasted little time in reminding voters that this was McCain\u2019s guy.", "In a June speech in Ohio, Clinton said, \u201cOne of John McCain\u2019s former economic advisers actually calculated what would happen to our country if Trump gets his way. He described the results of a Trump recession. We would lose 3.5 million jobs.\u201d And it has become a regular talking point in her speeches ever since.", "During a speech in St. Petersburg, Florida, on Aug. 8, Clinton said, \u201cOne independent expert \u2014 actually, the economist who advised John McCain in 2008, so you know, not somebody that has any pre-disposition towards our side.\u201d", "And then in a speech in Kissimmee, Florida, on Aug. 8, Clinton went one step further.", "Clinton, Aug. 8: And one particular economist who looked at his plans, somebody who advised John McCain back in 2008, so you know that, no, he\u2019s not a Democrat. He\u2019s an independent economic analyst, and he basically said if Trump were able to implement what he\u2019s proposing, heaven forbid, it would cost 3.5 million jobs. He would actually reduce jobs. And then to be fair, he looked at what I\u2019m proposing, and he said what I\u2019m proposing would create at least 10 million new jobs in the first four years.", "Most recently, in a speech in Fayetteville, North Carolina,\u00a0on Aug. 16, Kaine referred to Moody\u2019s as \u201cthe best economic analysis firm in the country,\u201d adding, \u201cThey\u2019re not Democrats. The chief economist, Mark Zandi, was John McCain\u2019s head economist in 2008.\u201d", "Zandi set the record straight in an email to FactCheck.org.", "Zandi, Aug. 10: Yes, I was an economic advisor to the 2008 McCain campaign for President. Doug Holtz-Eakin was his principal economic advisor. I provided daily reports on economic and financial market conditions, and I also provided policy advice on how to respond to the developing financial crisis. Yes, I\u2019m a registered Democrat and I contributed $2,700 to the Clinton campaign during the Democratic primary. I have contributed in the past to Democrats and Republicans.", "Public records back that up. According to records from the Federal Election Commission, Zandi donated $2,700 to the Clinton campaign in June. In recent years, he also has donated to former Democratic Rep. Joe Sestak and to Katie McGinty, a Pennsylvania Democrat running for the Senate. Zandi also contributed to Sen. Arlen Specter in 2009, but after he had switched his party allegiance to become a Democrat. In the 2008 presidential election, Zandi contributed to Republican John McCain, though he declined to tell the Washington Post whether he voted for McCain or Obama.", "Zandi said he\u00a0will leave it up to the public to decide whether the Moody\u2019s reports on Clinton and Trump are independent.", "\u201cThe studies were done by a team of Moody\u2019s Analytics economists using the same methods and models that we use for all of our work,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cThey are available to the public, and those who are interested should read them and make up their own mind as to their independence.\u201d", "Again, Zandi is a highly regarded economist in the field of macroeconomic analysis, and we have no position on the content of his reports. But enough already with trying to boost the value of Moody\u2019s Analytics reports by making it seem like Zandi is a Republican.", "Now, about those reports. Clinton is spinning them some to present their findings in a light most appealing to her cause.", "According to Clinton, the Moody\u2019s reports found \u201cif Trump were able to implement what he\u2019s proposing, heaven forbid, it would cost 3.5 million jobs. He would actually reduce jobs. And then to be fair, he looked at what I\u2019m proposing, and he said what I\u2019m proposing would create at least 10 million new jobs in the first four years.\u201d", "The reports actually considered three scenarios, starting with forecasts of the economic impact should all of the candidates\u2019 proposed policies be implemented \u2014 what the reports called the \u201cface value\u201d scenario. Then, Moody\u2019s considered a version in which the candidates get what they want \u201cbut on a smaller scale\u201d \u2014 what the reports call the \u201cLite\u201d scenario. And finally, the reports considered a \u201cmost-likely scenario\u201d if the candidate were elected, given that Congress would be unlikely to go along with all of the candidate\u2019s proposals.", "So when Clinton said she was citing the report\u2019s finding on \u201cif Trump were able to implement what he\u2019s proposing,\u201d she was referring to the \u201cface value\u201d alternative.", "That\u2019s fair: Candidates\u2019 plans are often evaluated based on what they propose, even if it is politically unlikely that all of those plans would come to pass if they were elected. But there\u2019s a major caveat to Clinton\u2019s claim that Moody\u2019s Analytics concluded her proposals \u201cwould create at least 10 million new jobs in the first four years.\u201d That\u2019s 3.2 million more jobs than if current laws were to remain in place.", "Moody\u2019s Analytics: During her presidency, the economy would create 10.4 million jobs, 3.2 million more than under current law.", "Moody\u2019s also cautioned that it\u2019s highly unlikely Clinton would be able to enact all of her proposals.", "Moody\u2019s Analytics: Given the current political discord, it is reasonable to expect that the next Congress would put up substantial roadblocks to Secretary Clinton\u2019s economic policy proposals. The current Republican-controlled Congress supports tax cuts and reform, and less non-military spending, not higher taxes and more spending. And it has been largely steadfast in its opposition to larger deficits. It is thus difficult to envisage any future Congress acquiescing to Secretary Clinton\u2019s proposals. In this scenario, the next Congress makes the secretary\u2019s proposals more politically workable. It would be a potential baseline, or most-likely scenario, if Secretary Clinton became president.", "Under what it calls the \u201cmost-likely scenario,\u201d Moody\u2019s projects an economy under Clinton \u201csimilar to that experienced under current law\u201d with more modest job growth. \u201cEmployment is as expected a bit higher,\u201d the report states, than under current law. \u201cBy 2026, there are 1.5 million more jobs\u201d than would be created under current policies.", "Clinton accurately described the dire economic projection Moody\u2019s forecast if Trump were able to implement all of his proposed policies at face value. If his policies were fully implemented, Moody\u2019s predicts the economy would suffer an extended recession beginning in early 2018. The policies would also result in 3.4 million job losses over the course of Trump\u2019s presidency. Under current law, the report states, the economy would otherwise be forecast to create 6 million jobs over the same period. In other words, that\u2019s a swing of more than 9 million jobs.", "But as is the case with Clinton, Moody\u2019s does not expect Congress will go along with all of Trump\u2019s proposals. The jobs projection under the \u201cmost-likely scenario\u201d under Trump is not as dire. According to this scenario, \u201cEmployment barely budges in the first two years, and over his four years as president just over 2.8 million jobs are created. This is about half as many jobs as would be created if there were no changes to current economic policy.\u201d", "In other words, under the most-likely scenario for both candidates in the Moody\u2019s reports, a Clinton or Trump presidency would see job growth \u2014 though under Trump the job gains would be less than under Clinton.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f86b0bdb-7ae2-49e5-865c-0dfc284e942b", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
