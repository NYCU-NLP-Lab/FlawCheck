Now we'll look at the statement that \"if they have children that don't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have, they will be fined.\"", "Obama's health plan does have a mandate that children have insurance, and it would likely include an eventual fine once all the elements of the health plan are in place. Here's how Obama explained it in an interview with the\n\nIndianapolis Recorder\n\npublished Oct. 24, 2008:\n\n\n\n\"We would not impose a penalty until we\u2019ve ensured the (State Children's Health Insurance Program) and other programs have made it absolutely affordable for every child to be covered. My belief is that you\u2019ve got to make sure people have an option before you start fining them. Once we\u2019ve got the options in place, we\u2019d impose a fine in the ballpark of what it\u2019d cost to provide insurance for their child. ... Children are relatively cheap to insure. We\u2019re going to be providing subsidies to make sure people can afford them, but we\u2019re also going to expect our parents are showing some responsibility in signing up their kids.\"", "So McCain is right about a possible fine, even if he doesn't mention that it would not be imposed until after the program is in place.", "We have a bigger problem with McCain's explanation that people get fined if their children \"d\n\non't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have.\" Actually, the fine is if the children are uninsured, not if they are insured under a certain\n\ntype\n\nof plan. Obama wants all children to be insured, but he leaves many options through which this could occur. One of the central premises of Obama's plan is that people who are currently insured keep the insurance they have.", "So we find McCain is correct to say that the parents of children could face fines, but he is wrong to imply that it's the type of coverage that matters.
