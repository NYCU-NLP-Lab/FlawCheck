["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Tweaking a line of attack it first employed in February, the Republican National Committee is charging that Americans would have to finance $1-trillion of new spending if Barack Obama fulfills all of his campaign promises over one term in the White House.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd that\u2019s above and beyond whatever the government decides to spend bailing out the financial system.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA new RNC ad called \u201cWorse,\u201d unveiled Sept. 30, 2008,\u00a0references the calamity gripping the financial markets and the taxpayer-funded bailout now under consideration in Congress, then contends Obama\u2019s agenda would unleash geysers of additional red ink.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWall Street squanders our money and Washington is forced to bail them out with \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 our money,\u201d an announcer says. \u201cCan it get any worse? Under Barack Obama\u2019s plan, the government would spend a trillion dollars more \u2013 even after the bailout.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe ad has its genesis in a graphical device called the \u201cSpend-O-Meter\u201d that the RNC featured on its Web site during the primary season in an effort to depict both Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton as tax-and-spend liberals.\n\nWe\u2019ve already ruled\n\non its February claim that Obama wanted to spend $874-billion during his first term in office, concluding that the Republicans correctly identified about half of the Illinois senator\u2019s proposals as new spending and made some highly creative assumptions about the rest.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut how did the total balloon to the current $1-trillion? The biggest change is Republicans have revised upward their claim on how much Obama\u2019s health care plan would cost. Obama wants to mandate that employers either offer health coverage or pay a sum equal to a percentage of their payrolls to fund a new national insurance plan. His campaign says this so-called \u201cplay or pay\u201d approach would result in $50-billion to $65-billion in new costs to the government.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe RNC, on the other hand, contends the plan would cost $150-billion a year, or $600-billion over four years, and bases its estimate on a Sept. 17 interview Obama gave\n\n60 Minutes\n\n. (In February, the Republicans incorporated the Obama campaign\u2019s high-end estimate of $65-billion a year, or $260-billion over four years,\u00a0in their tally.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s Obama\u2019s exchange with\n\n60 Minutes\n\ncorrespondent Steve Kroft:\n\n\u00a0\n\nKroft: \u201cHow much is it going to cost? $150-billion, right?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nObama: \u201cIt is. It is. But we pay for every dime that we propose to spend \u2026 Roughly speaking, I believe in pay-as-you-go. That if you want to propose a new program, you better cut some old ones. If you want to expand a program, then you better figure out where the money\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not clear to us why Obama agreed with Kroft\u2019s figure when it contradicts his campaign\u2019s own estimate. Regardless, it\u2019s difficult to forecast with any accuracy what such an initiative would cost, in part because Obama\u2019s campaign has yet to flesh out many details. The RNC makes the highly unlikely assumption that the health care plan would go into effect as soon as Obama takes office. And it doesn\u2019t factor Obama\u2019s companion proposal to cover much of the new cost by allowing President Bush\u2019s tax cuts on dividends and capital gains for individuals making more than $200,000 a year to expire in 2010.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAn analysis of Obama\u2019s plan by a group of conservative-leaning health policy experts in the Sept. 16 issue of the journal\n\nHealth Affairs\n\nputs the likely cost at approximately $100-billion annually. The figure is based on cost projections of a proposal released by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund that shares certain features with Obama\u2019s plan, including a mandate for employer-sponsored insurance. However, Commonwealth Fund president Karen Davis says the comparison is strained, because unlike her organization\u2019s blueprint, the Obama plan doesn\u2019t explicitly require adults to have health insurance. Davis added that Obama campaign also hasn\u2019t specified eligibility criteria or the size of subsidies that would come from Medicaid and the federal State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, both of which provide assistance to low-income Americans.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo the Obama health plan remains something of a Rorschach test \u2013 an expensive big-government mandate to its critics, a fiscally responsible exercise in strengthening the social safety net to supporters. Call it what you want, but it\u2019s almost pointless to attach a price tag until the Obama camp more clearly spells out its intentions. And the\n\n60 Minutes\n\ninterview seems like weak evidence, absent any change in policy, on which to hang an additional $340-billion spending claim.", "The next biggest item on the list is $156-billion to expand the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. Obama has said he wants to fix a \"doughnut hole\" in the program that leaves some mid-range drug prescription costs uncovered. The RNC doesn't mention that Obama proposes to pay for that with cost-saving measures, such as allowing the federal government to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies in setting Medicare drug prices. The campaign said it wouldn't close the doughnut hole if it couldn't find cuts to pay for it.", "Some of the Obama campaign's proposals and cost projections cited on the Republicans\u2019 tally continue to be correctly categorized as new spending, in one form or another. They include:", "Even Obama acknowledges uncertainty about his proposals given the downturn in the economy and the cost of the financial bailout.
