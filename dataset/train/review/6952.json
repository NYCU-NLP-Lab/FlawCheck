This video has been digitally manipulated.", "For starters, there are some visual oddities in the above-displayed clip. While there have been genuine incidents of people, for instance, sharing their computer screen with NSFW tabs accidentally open in their browser, we can't imagine what scenario would have led to the above-displayed image. The Pornhub logo doesn't seem to be attached to any program, and it is just floating unattached at a random point on the screen.", "Reporter Tancredi Palmeri managed to find the genuine clip from CNN. While a Pornhub logo was not actually displayed on CNN's screen, King did swipe away an unwanted visual. It's unclear exactly what appeared on King's screen, but it was not related to pornography.", "King, too, has addressed this rumor. When a Twitter user asked the CNN reporter if the clip was real, King responded: \"Not. Some clown taking time away from lying about something else apparently because they don\u2019t like math.\"", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
