["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on June 20, 2018", "In defending its \u201czero tolerance\u201d border policy that has caused the separation of families, the Trump administration has argued that the Obama and Bush administrations did this too. That\u2019s misleading. Experts say there were some separations under previous administrations, but no blanket policy to prosecute parents and, therefore, separate them from their children.", "\u201cBush and Obama did not have policies that resulted in the mass separation of parents and children like we\u2019re seeing under the current administration,\u201d Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, told us.", "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said at a June 18 press briefing: \u201cThe Obama administration, the Bush administration all separated families. \u2026 They did \u2014 their rate was less than ours, but they absolutely did do this. This is not new.\u201d", "Nielsen went on to explain that there is indeed something new, as we wrote in another article on this topic. Under a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d on illegal immigration announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in early April, the administration is now referring all illegal border crossings for criminal prosecution. By doing that, parents have been separated from their children, because children can\u2019t be held in detention facilities for adults.", "DHS told us that 2,342 children were separated from their parents between May 5 and June 9.", "But DHS couldn\u2019t provide any statistics on how many children may have been separated from their parents under the Obama administration.", "Instead, when we asked, it pointed to numbers that show 21 percent of apprehended adults were referred for prosecution under President Barack Obama. From fiscal year 2010 to fiscal 2016, there were 2,362,966 adults apprehended illegally crossing the Southern border, and 492,970 were referred for prosecution, those figures show. But that doesn\u2019t tell us anything about how many children may have been separated from their parents under Obama.", "And we don\u2019t have such statistics to compare the past to the present.", "\u201cWe have not seen any data out of the current or prior administration on how many cases that were prosecuted were individuals who arrived with minors,\u201d\u00a0Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told us in an email. \u201cSo we cannot make any guesses or assumptions about how many separations based on prosecution there were or are.\u201d", "Brown said that even though DHS says 2,342 children have been separated from their parents in about one month, we don\u2019t know what percentage of those cases are due to prosecutions for illegal crossings, and how many are due to other policies that would require separations \u2014 such as suspicion of trafficking, another outstanding warrant or insufficient proof of a family relationship.", "We asked DHS if it would provide such a breakdown, but we haven\u2019t received a response.", "MPI\u2019s Pierce said that the likely reason data aren\u2019t available on child separations under previous administrations is because it was done in \u201creally limited circumstances\u201d such as suspicion of trafficking or other fraud.", "\u201cPrevious administrations used family detention facilities, allowing the whole family to stay together while awaiting their deportation case in immigration court, or alternatives to detention, which required families to be tracked but released from custody to await their court date,\u201d Brown and her co-author, Tim O\u2019Shea, wrote in an explainer piece for the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s website. \u201cSome children may have been separated from the adults they entered with, in cases where the family relationship could not be established, child trafficking was suspected, or there were not sufficient family detention facilities available. \u2026\u00a0However, the zero-tolerance policy is the first time that a policy resulting in separation is being applied across the board.\u201d", "Jeh Johnson, DHS secretary under the Obama administration, told NPR earlier this month that he couldn\u2019t say that family separations \u201cnever happened\u201d during his tenure. \u201cThere may have been some exigent situation, some emergency. There may have been some doubt about whether the adult accompanying the child was in fact the parent of the child. I can\u2019t say it never happened but not as a matter of policy or practice. It\u2019s not something that I could ask our Border Patrol or our immigration enforcement personnel to do,\u201d Johnson said.", "The Obama administration faced a surge of unaccompanied children from Central America trying to cross the border in 2014. Cecilia\u00a0Mu\u00f1oz, director of the Obama administration\u2019s Domestic Policy Council, told the New York Times this month that a multi-agency team was considering \u201cevery possible idea\u201d at the time, including separating families.\u00a0\u201cI do remember looking at each other like, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do this, are we?\u2019 We spent five minutes thinking it through and concluded that it was a bad idea,\u201d the Times quoted\u00a0Mu\u00f1oz saying. \u201cThe morality of it was clear \u2014 that\u2019s not who we are.\u201d", "Brown told us that while the Obama administration \u201cdid separate some families,\u201d it also tried to detain families together. In\u00a02016, a court ruling\u00a0limited how long children with their parents could be in family detention centers. That ruling confirmed that a 1997 settlement applied to both unaccompanied and accompanied minors, as we\u2019ve explained before.", "\u201cAt that point,\u201d Brown said, \u201cfamily detention dwindled and most families were released into the US, either on their own with a notice to appear or under Alternatives to Detention, which could be an ankle bracelet or a supervised monitoring provision where they had to check in with ICE regularly until their immigration court hearing.\u201d", "On June 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing Nielsen to keep families in custody together \u201cduring the pendency of any criminal improper entry or immigration proceedings involving their members\u201d at least \u201cto the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
