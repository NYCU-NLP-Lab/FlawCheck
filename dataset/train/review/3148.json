["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on January 28, 2021", "Baseball legend and civil rights activist Henry \u201cHank\u201d Aaron died from natural causes, according to the medical examiner\u2019s office in Fulton County, Georgia. There\u2019s no evidence that his death was a result of being vaccinated against COVID-19 in early January, as multiple posts and articles shared on social media have suggested.", "No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.", "One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS \u201cis not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.\u201d", "Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it\u2019s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.", "Another monitoring system is the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.", "In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.", "The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.", "For more, see \u201cHow safe are the vaccines?\u201d", "Link to this", "More than\u00a0half a billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have now been administered in the U.S. and only a few, very rare, safety concerns have emerged. The vast majority of people experience only minor, temporary side effects such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, or muscle pain \u2014 or no side effects at all. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said, these vaccines \u201chave undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.\u201d", "A small number of severe allergic reactions known as anaphylaxis, which are expected with any vaccine, have occurred with the authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccines. Fortunately, these reactions are rare, typically occur within minutes of inoculation and can be treated. Approximately 5 per million people vaccinated have experienced anaphylaxis after a COVID-19 vaccine, according\u00a0to the CDC.", "To make sure serious allergic reactions can be identified and treated, all people receiving a vaccine should be observed for 15 minutes after getting a shot, and anyone who has experienced anaphylaxis or had any kind of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection in the past should be monitored for a half hour. People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose or one of the vaccine ingredients should not be immunized. Also, those who shouldn\u2019t receive one type of COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving a different type of vaccine.", "There is evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in male adolescents and young adults.", "Based on data collected through August 2021, the reporting rates of either condition in the U.S. are highest in males 16 to 17 years old after the second dose (105.9 cases per million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine), followed by 12- to 15-year-old males (70.7 cases per million). The rate for 18- to 24-year-old males was 52.4 cases and 56.3 cases per million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively.", "Health officials have emphasized that vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. Early evidence suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones. The CDC has also noted that most patients who were treated \u201cresponded well to medicine and rest and felt better quickly.\u201d", "The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been linked to an\u00a0increased risk of rare blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets, especially in women ages 30\u00a0to 49. Early symptoms of the condition, which is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS, can appear as late as three weeks after vaccination and\u00a0include\u00a0severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, leg swelling, and easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin outside of the injection site.", "According to the CDC, TTS has occurred in around 4 people per million doses administered. As of early April,\u00a0the syndrome has been confirmed in 60 cases, including nine deaths, after more than 18.6 million doses of the J&J vaccine. Although TTS remains rare, because of the availability of mRNA vaccines, which are not associated with this serious side effect, the FDA on May 5 limited authorized use of the J&J vaccine to adults who either couldn\u2019t get one of the other authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines because of medical or access reasons, or only wanted a J&J vaccine for protection against the disease. Several months earlier, on Dec. 16, 2021,\u00a0the CDC had recommended the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots over J&J\u2019s.", "The J&J vaccine has also been linked to an increased risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, a rare disorder in which the immune system attacks nerve cells.\u00a0Most people\u00a0who develop GBS fully recover, although some have permanent nerve damage and the condition can be fatal.", "Safety surveillance data suggest that compared with the mRNA vaccines, which have not been linked to GBS, the J&J vaccine is associated with 15.5 additional GBS cases per million doses of vaccine in the three weeks following vaccination. Most reported cases following J&J vaccination have occurred in men 50 years old and older.", "Link to this", "Henry \u201cHank\u201d Aaron, 86, \u201cpassed away peacefully in his sleep\u201d on Jan. 22, according to a statement from the Atlanta Braves, the team for which he played 21 of his 23 seasons in Major League Baseball. He died more than two weeks after he publicly received his first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at a Morehouse Healthcare clinic on Jan. 5.", "That sequence of events has led some social media users to suggest there was a direct link between his getting the shot and then dying several days later.", "But there is no evidence that is the case.", "One person wrote on Facebook: \u201cOur Brother Hank Aaron \u2013 RIP \u2013 wanted to be an example and an inspiration to Black People by taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Unfortunately, he may have become a clear example to Black People of why this vaccine CANNOT be trusted. \u2026 Two weeks after receiving his first Moderna shot, Hank Aaron died in his sleep. No cause of death is given, but you do the math.\u201d", "Another Facebook user, who juxtaposed one news article about Aaron getting the vaccine and another about his subsequent death, wrote: \u201cI hope people receive the message that this mans death should send to the rest of us!\u201d", "And Robert F.

In addition, he received treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee and used a wheelchair later in life.", "The Morehouse School of Medicine, which is affiliated with the Atlanta clinic where Aaron was immunized, also said the vaccine was not a factor in his death.", "The historically Black medical school emailed us a statement that said: \u201cMr. Aaron was a public health advocate and worked with us to help bridge the health equity gap in Atlanta and around the world. His passing was not related to the vaccine, nor did he experience any side effects from the immunization. He passed away peacefully in his sleep.\u201d", "Aaron was among more than 20 civil and human rights activists \u2014 all over age 75 \u2014 who were vaccinated at the new health facility to \u201cpromote vaccine acceptance in the Black community,\u201d the medical school said in a Jan. 5 press release.", "A December survey by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research had found that just 23% of Black Americans at the time said they definitely planned to get the coronavirus vaccine when it became available. That was much lower than the 53% of whites and 34% of Hispanics who said the same.", "On the day of his vaccination, Aaron told the Associated Press: \u201cI don\u2019t have any qualms about it at all, you know. I feel quite proud of myself for doing something like this. \u2026 It\u2019s just a small thing that can help zillions of people in this country.\u201d", "Andrew Young, the former congressman, mayor and U.S. ambassador, who also was vaccinated at the clinic the same day as Aaron, told Atlanta\u2019s 11Alive that he was told Aaron \u201cnever had any reaction\u201d to the shot prior to his death.", "\u201cI talked to the fella who was his driver, and I said, \u2018was Hank feeling any discomfort or any problem over the last few days?\u2019 and he said, \u2018no, he wanted to keep his schedule,'\u201d the news station quoted Young as saying.", "As we have written, the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines both received emergency use authorizations from the Food and Drug Administration after being thoroughly tested for safety and effectiveness in clinical trials with thousands of participants.
