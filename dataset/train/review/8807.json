["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on May 1, 2020 | Updated on June 25, 2020", "President Donald Trump falsely claimed that his administration was not initially able to meet the increasing demand for ventilators to treat COVID-19 patients because \u201cwe weren\u2019t left ventilators by a previous administration.\u201d", "We can\u2019t say for sure how many ventilators there were in the Strategic National Stockpile when Trump took office, but there were likely thousands.", "Update, June 25: In a June 20 statement to FactCheck.org, an HHS spokesperson said the SNS had 16,660 ventilators \u201cimmediately available for use\u201d when the federal government began distributing them to states in March. The spokesperson also told us none of the 16,660 ventilators ready for use in March was \u201cacquired\u201d by the Trump administration, which began announcing federal contracts for new ventilators in April. For more, read our June 22 post \u201cTrump Inherited More Ventilators Than Have Been Distributed.\u201d", "A 2017 article published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated there were roughly 9,000 ventilators in the federal stockpile as of at least 2010, and ventilators in the U.S. stockpile had never been distributed in the 20 years prior to the global coronavirus outbreak in 2020, according to Richard Branson, a respiratory care specialist and professor at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center who advises the federal government on ventilator supplies.", "Reporters also described seeing some of the government\u2019s stash of ventilators in 2016, when they toured at least one of the secret U.S. warehouses where the breathing machines and other equipment are stored in the event of a health crisis, such as a pandemic.", "Trump repeatedly has made the general claim that the federal stockpile of emergency medicine and supplies was \u201cempty\u201d or \u201cbare\u201d when he took office. That\u2019s false, as we have written before.", "But he specifically said there weren\u2019t any ventilators when answering reporters\u2019 questions during a recent White House event about his administration\u2019s efforts to protect seniors from contracting the novel coronavirus. Seniors are vulnerable to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, particularly those in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes.", "Trump, April 30: We had a ventilator problem that was caused by the fact that we weren\u2019t left ventilators by a previous administration. The cupboards were bare, as I say often.\u00a0 And not only are the cupboards full now, we have ventilators; we\u2019re the king in the world of ventilators. We have thousands and thousands of them now being delivered.", "But it\u2019s not true that the Trump administration did not inherit any ventilators. Reporters said they saw ventilators during a tour of one of the U.S. facilities housing the stockpile\u2019s massive inventory.", "\u201cAs we walk, I hear a loud hum. It\u2019s a giant freezer packed with products that have to be kept cold,\u201d wrote NPR science correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce in June 2016 \u2014 only months before Trump was inaugurated in January 2017.", "\u201cJust outside it, there are rows upon rows of ventilators that could keep sick or injured people breathing. [Shirley] Mabry explains that they\u2019re kept in a constant state of readiness. \u2018If you look down to the side you\u2019ll see there\u2019s electrical outlets so they can be charged once a month,\u2019 she says. Not only that\u2014the ventilators get sent out for yearly maintenance.\u201d", "VICE News also reported seeing the machines when its film crew visited one of the facilities for an episode of \u201cVICE News Tonight\u201d that aired in December 2016.", "\u201c[A]lthough we couldn\u2019t reveal where it was or what exactly it had inside. It looked like a prepper\u2019s Ikea, with row after row of containers filled with mystery medications and equipment \u2014 including that one item everyone\u2019s been talking about lately, ventilators,\u201d Vice News said.", "We can\u2019t say exactly how many ventilators were in the stockpile when Trump was inaugurated; the federal government doesn\u2019t usually publicize the specific numbers.", "But, as of 2010, there were around 9,000, according to a 2017 article published in the CDC\u2019s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. And in an April 7 article, the technology news website Recode quoted Branson, an adviser to the federal government, as saying, \u201cThis is the first time in 20 years ventilators from the stockpile have been used.\u201d", "In fact, a 2012 report from the Department of Health and Human Services said: \u201cDuring the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, ventilator shortages were not reported to HHS, and ventilators were not deployed from the SNS.\u201d That\u2019s the same pandemic that caused the SNS to distribute \u201c12.5 million regimens of antiviral drugs, 19.6 million pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE), 85.1 million N95 respirators, and 2,129 doses of IV peramivir,\u201d according to Greg Burel, the stockpile\u2019s former director.", "Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said there were 12,700 ventilators in the stockpile, as of March 15. At the time, the CDC says there were about 9,500 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. Currently, there are nearly 1.1 million cases in the U.S. and more than 64,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.", "Trump can argue that there initially weren\u2019t enough ventilators to accommodate every state\u2019s request, although the stockpile was never designed to be able to do that, Burel has said.", "But it\u2019s simply not the case that the federal government did not have any ventilators on hand when Trump took the reins from President Barack Obama more than three years ago.", "FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
