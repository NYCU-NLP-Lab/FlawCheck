Measures enacted to protect the public health, both during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 and in earlier health crises, have consistently been upheld against challenges in U.S. courts. For example, on May 6, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to lift a shutdown order issued by the governor of Pennsylvania requiring all non-life-sustaining businesses to temporarily close:", "The U.S. Supreme Court refused to lift Pennsylvania\u2019s shutdown order, rejecting a request from businesses and a political campaign that said their constitutional rights were being violated.", "Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses closed in March to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The state has since begun easing the restrictions.", "The challengers included a golf course, laundromat, timber company, real-estate agent and political committee tied to a Republican state legislative candidate. They turned to the nation\u2019s top court after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected their arguments.", "As well, in their survey of pandemic-related law, the American Bar Association (ABA) noted that:", "Under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 10th Amendment and U.S. Supreme Court decisions over nearly 200 years, state governments have the primary authority to control the spread of dangerous diseases within their jurisdictions. The 10th Amendment, which gives states all powers not specifically given to the federal government, allows them the authority to take public health emergency actions, such as setting quarantines and business restrictions.", "With states adopting emergency measures, there are several broad public health tools that governors can invoke. They can, for example, order quarantines to separate and restrict the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. They can also direct that those who are sick with a quarantinable communicable disease be isolated from people who are not sick. And, as a growing number of governors have done in recent days, states can order residents to stay at home with exceptions for essential work, food or other needs. Curfews are another tool they can impose.", "In a broader sense, this message is also wrong in that individuals do not have a right to defy laws they disagree with and then \"collect damages\" if those laws are enforced against them. Certainly individuals can mount challenges to laws on various grounds (e.g., those laws are unconstitutional, are in conflict with other laws, are contrary to public policy, etc.), but they cannot take it upon themselves to decide those laws are not valid and pre-emptively ignore them with impunity.", "Stohr, Greg. \u00a0 \"Supreme Court Won\u2019t Lift Pennsylvania Governor\u2019s Shutdown Order.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Bloomberg. \u00a0 6 May 2020.", "American Bar Association. \u00a0 \"Two Centuries of Law Guide Legal Approach to Modern Pandemic.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 April 2020.", "Klein, Adam and Benjamin Wittes. \u00a0 \"The Long History of Coercive Health Responses in American Law.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Lawfare. \u00a0 13 April 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
