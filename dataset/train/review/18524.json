["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on August 22, 2019", "Social media posts erroneously attribute a quote to House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy. He didn\u2019t say that \u201cthere are no mass shootings in Japan because there are no video games there.\u201d", "In the days after the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, some politicians returned attention to the idea that violent video games may contribute to such attacks \u2014 which has not been established by research.", "Notably, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy appeared on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo\u201d on Aug. 4 and discussed what he called \u201cvideo games that dehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals and others.\u201d", "But McCarthy did not say in that interview that \u201c[t]here are no mass shootings in Japan because there are no video games there.\u201d And we found no instance of him saying it anywhere else.", "That quotation has been erroneously attributed to McCarthy in viral social media posts that include a screenshot of McCarthy\u2019s interview with Bartiromo.", "It appears the false attribution stems from a misrepresentation of a tweet about McCarthy\u2019s remarks.", "The morning of McCarthy\u2019s interview, Washington Post reporter David Weigel jokingly tweeted the line about Japan when sharing another user\u2019s post about McCarthy\u2019s comments. But Weigel\u2019s tweet \u2014 which has been lifted verbatim by the bogus posts \u2014 did not claim that McCarthy actually said that.", "\u201cThe tweet was obviously, obviously a deadpan joke,\u201d Weigel told us in an email. \u201cI never used quotation marks and I absolutely never would; those \u2018parody\u2019 tweets, in which people pretend to be famous people in order to get [retweets], are some of the worst stuff online.\u201d", "In his Fox News interview, McCarthy espoused the idea that video games may be at fault for such mass shootings, but he did not mention Japan.", "\u201cBut the idea of these video games that dehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals and others \u2014 I\u2019ve always felt that is a problem for future generations and others,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve watched from studies shown before of what it does to individuals. When you look at these photos of how it took place, you can see the actions within video games and others.\u201d", "As we\u2019ve explained before, some studies have documented a link between violent video games and aggressive thoughts and behaviors. But that is not the same as establishing a link between video games and criminal violence, or more specifically mass shootings. (For more, see \u201cThe Facts on Media Violence.\u201d)", "Japan, where video games are popular and firearm laws are strict, reports a very low number of gun deaths. Mass killings there are also rare and have been carried out with knives or other weapons.", "In 2017, violent deaths by firearms in Japan occurred at a rate of 0.037 per 100,000 people, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Violent deaths by firearms in the U.S., meanwhile, occurred at a rate of 4.43 per 100,000 people. (Those figures do not include accidental gun deaths or suicides by firearms.)", "And estimates from a gaming analytics company suggest that \u2014 on a per-person basis \u2014 gamers in Japan spend more on video games than gamers in the U.S.", "Newzoo estimated 2019 game revenues (which do not include hardware sales or online gambling) to be nearly $36.9 billion in the U.S. and $19 billion in Japan. The company told us in an email that the estimated number of players for 2019 is 164.3 million players in the U.S. and 65.2 million players in Japan. That works out to about $224 per player in the U.S. and $291 per player in Japan.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
