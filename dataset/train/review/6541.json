Let\u2019s continue observing guidelines from our health experts to protect ourselves as well as protecting others,\u201d Abbasi tweeted in Swahili.", "While Magufuli did not issue the claimed\u00a0banning order, Tanzania has not strictly enforced precautionary measures against COVID-19 such as wearing face masks and avoiding social gatherings.
