In 2016, when the top court was hearing the JNU sedition row, Yadav shouted \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 inside the courtroom and was chided by the bench. The lawyer was escorted out by security officials and had to submit an unconditional apology before the Supreme Court for his actions.", "During the India Today debate, Yadav defended his sloganeering.

A judge will decide which issue is right, which lawyer is wrong. You are arguing that in the court. You argue with Prashant Bhushan in the court. Why are you raising slogans like this? Why are you are doing the anti-national activity? Why are you doing the anti-legal activity? I allege that what you did is anti-national. The slogans of Vande Mataram, you raised, is anti-national activity.\u201d", "Kanwal\u2019s reply to Yadav\u2019s argument that chanting Vande Mataram is not anti-national was, \u201cto raise [slogans] inside the court, is to spoil the dignity of the Supreme Court. It\u2019s totally wrong. It hurts the dignity of this country. Your act is wrong.\u201d", "A 20-second bit from the complete discussion was clipped to take out the context and portray Rahul Kanwal as against the slogan of \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 when in fact he was suggesting that sloganeering inside a courtroom is unacceptable.", "Swarajya columnist Shefali Vaidya and former Shiv Sena member Ramesh Solanki also tweeted the clip with the false narrative. Their tweets have garnered a combined retweet count of nearly 3,600.", "IAS officer Sanjay Dixit also quote-tweeted the same video and opined, \u201cRahul Uvach: @rahulkanwal loftily declares Vande Mataram to be anti-National.
