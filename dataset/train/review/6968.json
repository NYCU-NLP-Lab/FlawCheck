Another group of about 50 people asked that the United States speed up and increase the processing of asylum seekers.", "Both groups had a letter with them and reported to have been received by U.S. consulate staff, but they were unaware of each others' demands, the San Diego Union-Tribune said.

About 6,000 arrived in Tijuana in November, but the number of people still seeking to be let into the United States is believed to be much lower. Hundreds have gone back to their countries, hundreds more have being deported by Mexican authorities, and many more have applied for permission to stay in Mexico, according to news reports.", "A headline on thefederalistpapers.org says, \"Migrants DEMAND $50,000 each to go home, or else\u2026\"", "A group of about 100 migrants went to the U.S. consulate in Tijuana requesting to be let into the United States or be paid $50,000 each, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. The letter is addressed to Trump and offers a greeting on behalf all caravan members. Another group that had a separate letter for the consulate about asylum processing said it was unaware of the other group\u2019s demands.
