On 8 March 2016, the Facebook page \"The People for Bernie Sanders 2016\" published a photo of a\u00a0\"sample ballot\":", "This is a sample ballot sent out in Chicago. It doesn't list Bernie Sanders as a candidate for president. Misinformation is voter suppression.", "Posted by The People For Bernie Sanders 2016 on\u00a0Tuesday, March 8, 2016", "Commenters on that post were quick to point out that votes for Sanders could and had been cast in that primary, calling the claim into question:", "Here in Chicago My grandmother voted early and she voted for Bernie so idk what this is.", "From that point, many other social media users inferred that the only way to cast a vote for Sanders was through\u00a0a write-in vote, assuming he was not listed on ballots. The claim reached a much\u00a0larger audience when actor and comedian Sarah Silverman sent the following tweet on 10 March 2016:", "#BernieSanders not on Chicago sample ballot.\nWOW. Can someone explain this? pic.twitter.com/s9ZXcrGLYb", "\u2014 Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) March 10, 2016", "At that point, the claim was also receiving additional visibility on Facebook:", "Was the DNC presuming Bernie would be gone by then? Honest mistake? This is not the first pic of these \"sample\" \"democratic\" ballots from Chicago...", "Posted by Marie Myung-Ok Lee on\u00a0Thursday, March 10, 2016", "Many were confused by the use of the term\u00a0\"sample ballot,\" believing that they were literal samples of the actual documents. Further complicating matters was the fact that the Chicago Board of Elections did make available\u00a0sample ballots viewable by voters ahead of primary elections; some people seemed to be confusing\u00a0actual sample ballots with party-issued endorsements.", "We spoke to an individual at\u00a0Chicago's Board of Elections, who told he he\u00a0was aware of the claims and explained that social media users were confusing\u00a0campaign literature\u00a0with\u00a0actual state ballots. He confirmed that Sanders was indeed a candidate for whom registered voters in Chicago and the state of Illinois could vote if they wished, and that \"sample ballots\" were\u00a0not in any way to be considered legitimate examples of actual primary election ballots.", "The Chicago\u00a0Board of Elections\u00a0has an\u00a0official web site where anyone can\u00a0view an official sample ballot\u00a0(a valid address was a pre-requisite to view the ballot, and we used the Cook County Democrats N. LaSalle Street location). Sanders was indeed listed on that ballot:", "The controversial\u00a0campaign literature\u00a0was also available on the\u00a0Cook County Democratic Party's web site, both as a page and a downloadable PDF.

However, Sanders was not omitted from any official\u00a0ballots, nor did supporters in Cook County need to write-in a primary ballot vote for Sanders. Whether or not voters in Chicago and elsewhere approved of Cook County Democrats' endorsements, the sample ballot had no bearing on actual official ballots where Sanders appeared alongside Clinton as a candidate. Localized political parties regularly can and do endorse their own preferred candidates,\u00a0an activity that is both common and accepted in the course of elections.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
