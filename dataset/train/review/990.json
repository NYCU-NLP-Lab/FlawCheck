["Donald Trump released a tax plan in September that would give huge tax cuts to the top 0.1 percent and bloat the deficit by at least $10 trillion over the next decade. But after he became the GOP\u2019s last man standing and presumptive nominee, Trump said this week he\u2019s considering raising taxes on the rich.", "\"Should we assume that most of your plans, then, we shouldn\u2019t take you at your words, as sort of that they\u2019re floors?\" Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Trump.", "\"It is called life, Chuck. It\u2019s not my word, of course. I put in a proposal. You know what they are? They're really proposals. People can say it\u2019s a tax plan. It\u2019s really a tax proposal. Because after I put it in, and I think you know the Senate and Congress, you know as much as anybody, they start working with you and they start fighting,\" \u00a0Trump responded. \"But I\u2019m not under the illusion that that it\u2019s going to pass. They\u2019re going to come to me. They\u2019re going to want to raise it for the rich more than anybody else.\"", "He then explained why, despite that, he\u2019s still sticking to his guns and giving \"a massive\" tax cut to businesses: \"We\u2019re the highest taxed nation in the world. Our businesses pay more taxes than any businesses in the world. That\u2019s why companies are leaving.\"", "This is a version of one of Trump\u2019s oft-repeated talking points, and it\u2019s inaccurate.", "When we looked at this claim in the past, we compared the United States to the 33 other industrialized nations in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.", "Data from 2014, the most recent year available, shows that the United States wasn\u2019t the most highly taxed by the typical metrics and actually places near the bottom or around the middle of the pack.", "Trump specified this time that he was talking about business taxes, but the essential data doesn\u2019t back him there, either.", "Trump would have been more accurate if he had been more specific. The United States does have one of the highest top marginal corporate tax rates in the world. However, companies pay less in practice because they can take deductions and exclusions. When we look at the actual tax burden on U.S. companies, it\u2019s far from highest in the world.", "Here\u2019s a chart breaking it down:", "Tax revenue as percentage of GDP", "Corporate tax revenue as percentage of GDP", "Tax revenue per capita", "1.
