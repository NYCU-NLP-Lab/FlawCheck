And, as he did in past campaign speeches, Trump spoke for a long time and reeled off numerous false and misleading claims:", "The president visited Iowa on June 21, making an official stop first at Kirkwood Community College\u00a0in Cedar Rapids\u00a0to talk about agriculture. Later that evening, Trump spoke to a large crowd in the nearby U.S. Cellular Center at a political rally\u00a0organized by his campaign.", "At his rally, Trump exaggerated when he claimed that his administration had deported MS-13 gang members \u201cby the thousands.\u201d It is by the hundreds, not thousands.", "Trump, June 21:\u00a0The other thing that I have to tell you. You have a gang called MS-13. \u2026\u00a0These are true animals. We are moving them out of the country by the thousands, by the thousands.", "Trump is referring to the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, a gang that was formed by Salvadoran immigrants in Los Angeles in the 1980s. In April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u00a0said\u00a0that there are 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. That made us skeptical of the claim that \u201cthousands\u201d already had been deported.", "We asked the White House how many gang members have been removed under the Trump administration, but it declined to comment.", "However, the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0on May 24\u00a0wrote\u00a0that this year the U.S. has deported 398 gang members to El Salvador \u201ccompared with 534 in all of 2016, according to Salvadoran government statistics.\u201d Those figures represent members of all El Salvador gangs, such as MS-13 and the 18th Street gang.\u00a0MS-13 is \u201cprimarily El Salvadoran,\u201d according to a\u00a02005 National Gang Threat Assessment\u00a0report by the National Alliance of Gang Investigators Association, though it\u2019s possible there are members from other countries.", "Danielle Bennett, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told us in an email that so far in fiscal year 2017 \u2014 from Oct. 1, 2016, to June 4, 2017 \u2014 ICE has removed 2,798 gang members. But that includes all gang members, not just MS-13 members. She said ICE \u201cdoes not track gang removals by specific gang,\u201d so it does not know how many of the 2,798 were MS-13 members. The 2,798 removals also span both the Obama and Trump administrations, so not all of the FY 2017 deportations occurred under Trump.", "By contrast, there were 2,057 gang members deported in fiscal 2016, so there has been an increase this fiscal year. We don\u2019t know how much of that is attributable to Trump\u2019s policies, but Bennett said that ICE under the Trump administration \u201cdoes specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal.\u201d That appears to be corroborated by the statistics from El Salvador published in the Post.", "Bennett\u00a0also said that ICE Homeland Security Investigations has made 602 criminal arrests and 170 administrative immigration arrests of MS-13 members so far in fiscal year 2017, as of June 4. But those figures include arrests made under both administrations, and the criminal arrests include citizens and noncitizens alike. For example, ICE\u00a0reported\u00a0last month that it arrested 104 MS-13 gang members as part of a six-week anti-gang enforcement operation that resulted in 1,378 arrests from March 26 to May 6. But nearly two-thirds of all those arrested were U.S. citizens, so most would not have been eligible for deportation.", "Trump can take credit perhaps for cracking down on gang members and increasing the deportation rate of gang members from El Salvador.

For those who do owe tax, the study estimated that the average effective rate would be 20 percent \u2014 with the option of spreading payments over 14 years.", "Separate research by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center\u00a0puts the number even lower. TPC estimates that only 50 farms and closely held businesses will pay any estate tax in 2017.", "And regardless of whether the number is 161 or 50, those farm estates that owe any tax at all have the option to spread installments over 14 years at reduced interest rates.", "When we wrote\u00a0about this estate-tax myth in 2015, we reached out to\u00a0Neil Harl, an Iowa State University professor of economics and agriculture, who has been studying the estate tax\u2019s impact on small businesses and farms for decades.", "\u201cI have been involved in this area since 1958\u00a0and I have never seen land that had to be sold to pay the federal estate tax\u00a0and I have conducted more than 3,400 seminars in 43 states which included federal estate tax planning,\u201d Harl wrote to us in an email.
