["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "CNN host Piers Morgan has joined the chorus of national voices asking Gov. Chris Christie if he\u2019ll make a bid for the White House in 2012.\n\nAlthough Christie said he wouldn\u2019t, Morgan pressed him on the issue.\n\n\"Here's the thing. I don't understand why you wouldn't want to run this time. I mean, you've got the economy in tatters. Your record on that is pretty strong. You're admired for it. Your poll ratings have been going up,\" Morgan said in an interview with Christie on \"Piers Morgan Tonight\" that aired June 14.\n\nReally? PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check if Christie\u2019s poll ratings are increasing.\n\nThe publicist for \"Piers Morgan Tonight\" declined comment on Morgan\u2019s claim.\n\nWe looked at two measurements with enough data available to compare over time: the governor\u2019s job approval and favorability ratings -- and found that recently, the governor\u2019s ratings have not increased.\n\nPolls on job approval ratings conducted by Quinnipiac University, Fairleigh Dickinson University\u2019s PublicMind and Monmouth University interview registered New Jersey voters.\n\nQuinnipiac\u2019s polls show Christie\u2019s job approval rating climbed from 44 percent in June 2010 to 52 percent in February, before falling to 47 percent in April and then to 44 percent in June. Those polls had a margin of error between 2.4 and 2.7 percentage points.\n\nPublicMind polls also show a recent decline. They put Christie\u2019s job approval rating at\u00a052 percent in the beginning of March 2010 and at 43 percent by the end of that month. By January it had climbed to 53 percent. By April it had dropped to 51 percent and in May it fell to 44 percent. The margins of error on those polls are between 3.5 and 4 percentage points.\n\nMonmouth University/NJ Press Media polls showed the governor\u2019s job approval rating at 42 percent in April 2010, 49 percent in February and 46 percent this May. Those polls had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.\n\nAccording to Rasmussen Reports polls, which survey likely New Jersey voters, Christie\u2019s job approval rating was 53 percent in April 2010. In September 2010 it jumped to 57 percent. But a May poll shows it has leveled back off at 53 percent. Those polls had a 4.5 percentage point margin of error. Rasmussen is widely considered Republican-leaning.\n\nBen Dworkin, director of the the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, noted that a poll is \"just a scientific model of a particular moment in time\" and that if a poll goes up or down a point or two \"it can also be considered statistically the same thing.\" But, he said, if done well, polls can offer a pretty accurate portrayal of the public\u2019s mood.\n\nDworkin also said that when people discuss whether poll ratings are increasing, \"they are talking about from one poll to the next,\" unless they say otherwise.\n\nWe then spoke to the heads of three polling institutes to get their analyses of the data.\n\nPatrick Murray, director of Monmouth University\u2019s Polling Institute, and Peter Woolley, the executive director of PublicMind, both said Christie\u2019s job approval ratings are not increasing.\n\nScott Rasmussen, founder of Rasmussen Reports, said the governor\u2019s job approval ratings have been \"pretty steady\" since he took office.\n\nWe also looked at the governor\u2019s favorability rating -- a measurement that focuses more on personal attributes than policy issues. We found two institutes that tracked that rating over time. PublicMind showed a drop from 47 percent to 40 percent between the most recent surveys and the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University showed a very slight dip. Both polling institutes show the rating going down when compared over a longer period of time.\n\nLet\u2019s review. Morgan said Christie\u2019s poll ratings \"have been going up.\"\n\nPolls measuring the governor\u2019s job approval and favorability ratings all show a dip in the numbers among the most recent surveys.\n\nIf we look at the same polls over a longer time frame, they show Christie\u2019s ratings have remained relatively steady -- but staying even isn\u2019t growth\n\nFor these reasons, we rate Morgan\u2019s statement False.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "Transcript, CNN\u2019s \"Piers Morgan Tonight,\" June, 14, 2011", "Email interview with Meghan McPartland, publicist for \"Piers Morgan Tonight,\" June 17, 2011\n\nInterview with Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, June 17, 2011\n\nInterview with Peter Woolley, executive director of Fairleigh Dickinson University\u2019s PublicMind, June 17, 2011\n\nInterview with Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University\u2019s Polling Institute, June 17, 2011\n\nInterview with Scott Rasmussen, founder of Rasmussen Reports, June 17, 2011\n\nQuinnipiac University, New Jersey Voters Split On Christie As Leader Or Bully, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Voters Oppose Many Budget-Cutting Ideas, June 17, 2010\n\nQuinnipiac University, New Jersey Voters Say Christie's First Year A Success, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Obama Approval Bouncing Back, Feb. 9, 2011\n\nQuinnipiac University, Obama Tops Christie On Every Measure In New Jersey, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Big Gender Gap Leaves Governor's Approval Under 50%, April 20, 2011\n\nQuinnipiac University, Big Gender Gap Drops New Jersey's Christie To New Low, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Voters Say 2-1 He'd Make A Bad Vice President, June 21, 2011\n\nFDU PublicMind, Public Backs Governor, Pension Reforms, March 3, 2010\n\nFDU PublicMind, Christie Approval Ratings Strong at End of Inaugural Year, Jan. 11, 2011\n\nFDU PublicMind, Garden State Voters Feeling Blue, May 24, 2011\n\nFDU PublicMind, Christie\u2019s Approval Slips But Voters Still Say Cut Spending, Cap Property Tax Increases, March 30, 2010\n\nFDU PublicMind, Governor\u2019s Approval Is Strong: Can it Translate to Legislative Elections?, April 6, 2011\n\nMonmouth University/NJ Press Media Poll, New Jersey Divided on Governor, May 18, 2011\n\nRasmussen Reports, NJ Voters Like Christie\u2019s Budget Performance Better Than Obama\u2019s, May 31, 2011\n\nRasmussen Reports, 57% in New Jersey Approve of Governor\u2019s Job Performance, Sept. 7, 2010\n\nRasmussen Reports, 53% in New Jersey Approve of Governor\u2019s Job Performance, April 19, 2010\n\nRutgers University\u2019s Eagleton Institute of Politics, NJ Voters Show Sharply Diverging Views of Gov.
