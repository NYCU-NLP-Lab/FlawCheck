["About this rating", "On 20 October 2016, Nevada County Scooper (also known as NC Scooper) published an article that appeared to report that according to a\u00a0WikiLeaks document, the Clintons bought a $200 million mansion in the Maldives:", "Several recorded phone conversations between Christie\u2019s executives and Clinton board member, Frank Guistra, clearly show that a deal for \u201cThe Imperial Maldives\u201d had been closed. \u201cThe Imperial Maldives\u201d is a development of 185 water villas set above the turquoise waters of the North Male Atoll. According to the recordings, the agreed price was $200 million (U.S).", "Also according to the recordings, this deal began the morning after the last debate. The morning after Trump told Clinton he would appoint a special prosecutor and put her in prison. Mr. Guistra is heard to say, \u201cTrump can drag his sorry orange ass down to the Maldives if he wants her so bad. There\u2019s no extradition treaty!\u201d [laughing]", "Many social media users appeared to share the article without reading down to the bottom of the page and catching the piece's less-than-serious closing sentence:", "WikiLeaks seems to suggest that the Clintons are feeling the pressure of a world-wide criminal organization becoming frayed at the seams ... [o]r, those fuckers just need a real good vacation.", "The image that appeared with the story, purportedly showing Bill Clinton walking his dog Buster at the mansion, was in fact a stock photograph dating back to at least 2015. NC Scooper's manifesto explains that the web site's content is purely satirical, and not meant to be taken seriously:", "The Scooper is a satirical website is in scope and intent. Sometimes it\u2019s funny; often it is not. We provide fake news and social criticism in a satirical setting. Our intention is not to fool or trick anyone, but obviously it happens. We firmly believe that you can soften a person\u2019s willingness to listen by injecting irony, and yes sometimes humor, into the conversation ... We\u2019ve found that many people are confused by the satirical genre, often believing that it is supposed to be funny. Although that often is true, satire is primarily a medium of criticism that employs irony, criticism, juxtaposition and hyperbole to illuminate the issues of the day. In recent years, television shows such as the Daily Show have injected non-satirical humor into their formats, which has probably lead to the confusion. This is why the Scooper\u2019s first commandment is: \u201cDon\u2019t try to be funny. Humor is a byproduct of the Truth.\u201d", "The page about the Clintons' Maldives mansion wasn't the first NC Scooper effort that readers mistook for straightforward news. Prior \"crossover\" articles included claims that five million uncounted Bernie Sanders ballots were found on Hillary Clinton's e-mail server (and that Sanders had called for \"chemtrail reform\"), that Meg White was announced as the new drummer for the band Rush, that Merle Haggard had left his entire estate to a LGBT group, and that roving gun confiscation vans had been spotted in California.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
