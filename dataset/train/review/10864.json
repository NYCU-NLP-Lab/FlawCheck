Since 2011, Assange has been avoiding prosecution in the United States for leaking documents through his organization, Wikileaks, relating to foreign affairs with information that had been given \u201csecret\u201d classification by the U.S. government ... In light of his anti-Clinton sentiment and despite the fact that he once likened Trump to cholera, Assange is now appealing to Trump to pardon him \u2014 the fact that he is currently under investigation and hasn\u2019t actually been convicted of anything notwithstanding.", "With a history of anti-semitism and misogyny behind him, Julian Assange would fit in well with the company Trump currently surrounds himself, including alt-right advocate Steve Bannon and of course, Trump himself.", "As Breitbart correctly noted, WikiLeaks has already been negotiating with American authorities for several years with respect to the organization's operations.

The sort of information that a news organization can be prosecuted for publishing is limited to: nuclear secrets (Atomic Energy Act), the identities of covert agents (Intelligence Identities Protection Act), and certain forms of communications intelligence (Section 798 of the Espionage Act).", "Perhaps lamenting that the U.S. does not have an Official Secrets Act like the United Kingdom, right wing columnists have consistently misinterpreted these Acts, or have cited other provisions of our espionage laws which almost surely do not apply to Wikileaks.", "The most commonly cited statute by those who advocate prosecuting Wikileaks is Section 793(e) of the Espionage Act. In August, former Bush speechwriter Marc Theissen linked to this section in an article for the Washington Post when he wrote that Wikileaks is \u201ca criminal enterprise\u201d whose founder, Julian Assange, should be arrested by U.S. forces on foreign soil, international law be damned.", "But this provision does not apply to those who publish information.", "Section 793(e)reads \u201cWhoever having unauthorized possession of, access to, or control over any document\u2026relating to the national defense\u2026willfully communicates\u2026 the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it\u2026[s]hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\u201d", "As made clear in the Pentagon Papers case, the word \u201ccommunicates\u201d was never meant \u201cto encompass publication\u201d or to affect the press.

But I'm sure they'll invoke trade secrets, copyright, privacy, or whatever other legal window dressing they find convenient.
