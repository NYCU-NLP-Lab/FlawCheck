["About this rating", "Michelle Obama obtained a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in law from Harvard University in 1988, and as first lady of the U.S., she received numerous honorary doctorates, including one in law.", "A J.D. is a professional degree, not a Ph.D. No evidence indicates Obama pursued coursework to obtain a Ph.D. in law after serving as first lady.", "Michelle Obama may have accomplished a lot since leaving the White House in 2017, but getting a Ph.D. in law was not on her to-do list. A popular internet rumor that made the rounds in June 2020 claimed the former first lady completed her research doctorate in law after U.S. President Barack Obama left office and their daughters went to college.", "Snopes readers asked us if this was true, and we found no evidence that she completed coursework for a Ph.D.", "We know that Obama graduated from Harvard Law School in 1988 with a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree, which is a professional degree required to practice law in the United States. One usually has to have a J.D. in order to get a Ph.D in law \u2014 also known as a research doctorate \u2014 which mainly prepares students for careers as legal scholars and teachers.", "Obama was a practicing lawyer in the late 1980s and early '90s, but in her 2018 book \"Becoming,\" she famously recounted hating the work. She told Oprah Winfrey:", "I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t do this for the rest of my life. I can\u2019t sit in a room and look at documents.\u201d I won\u2019t get into what that is, but it\u2019s deadly. Deadly. Document production ... I\u2019m just not happy. I don\u2019t feel my passion.", "Based on this recollection, it seems highly unlikely that Obama would have gone back to study more law.", "She did, however, receive a number of honorary doctorate degrees, which are given to outstanding non-students. In 2013, while still first lady, Obama received an Honorary Doctorate of Law from Bowie State University. Such degrees are recognition of achievement, don't require completing coursework, and recipients don\u2019t really use them for anything, mainly because such people are already so accomplished.", "Since departing the White House in 2017, she has written a memoir, received an honorary induction into the Academy of Arts and Sciences, and signed a production deal with Netflix.", "In sum, while Obama has indeed received degrees in law, including an honorary doctorate, she did not actively pursue or complete coursework for a Ph.D. in law. We thus rate this claim \"Mostly False.\"", "Chen, James.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Juris Doctor (JD).\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Investopedia.\u00a0 \u00a08 April 2019.", "Encyclopaedia Britannica.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Michelle Obama.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a06 May 2020.", "GW Today.\u00a0 \u00a0\"A Capitol Commencement.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a016 May 2010.", "Jackson State University.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Michelle Obama, J.D., Ph.D., \u201916 Former First Lady of the United States.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a01 March 2017.", "Merriam-Webster.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Honorary Degree.\"", "NBC News.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Michelle Obama Gets Honorary Degree, Gives Speech at Bowie State Graduation.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a017 May 2013.", "Oregon State University.\u00a0 \u00a0\"First!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a021 June 2012.", "Robinson, Jessica.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Honorary Degree: What Is It Good For?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0NPR.\u00a0 \u00a010 May 2012.", "UIC Today.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Faculty Fellow Elected to American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a016 April 2019.", "Winfrey, Oprah.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Michelle Obama Gets Candid With Oprah About Her New Memoir, 'Becoming.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Town and Country.\u00a0 \u00a012 November 2018.", "Yale University.\u00a0 \u00a0\"The Ph.D. in Law Degree.\"", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
