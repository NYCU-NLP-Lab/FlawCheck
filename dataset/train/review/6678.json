The 2008 strain of the influenza had no significant influence on elections that we could determine.", "The swine flu, more specifically H1N1, started spreading in early 2009 and combined avian, swine, and human influenza in one new strain.

It also spreads like most influenza, with infected droplets that could be airborne or left on surfaces.", "The 2009 swine flu outbreak was the \"first global flu pandemic in 40 years,\" according to the CDC.

All cases of MERS in 2012 were within the Arabian Peninsula, with two unlinked cases only reaching the U.S. in 2014.", "MERS was not brought up by any campaigns or included in any party platforms in the 2012 presidential election. It didn\u2019t affect the U.S. until 2014, and even then the only comment was from press secretary Jay Carney, when he said at a press conference that President Barack Obama had \"been briefed\" on the MERS developments. Even though MERS did occur during the 2012 election, it didn\u2019t seem to have any effect on U.S. politics.", "The Ebola virus emerged periodically and caused outbreaks in many African countries as early as 1995.

The New York Times reported that they voted to advance the funding, despite disagreements between Republicans and Democrats on where the funding should come from. A month later, the bill had fallen apart, with the Democrats rejecting provisions added by the Republicans. Finally, the bill passed on Sept. 28, 2016, with concessions made by both sides.", "During this congressional tug of war, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both brought up the Zika virus only once during their campaigns. When Trump was asked about how he would deal with the Zika virus while he campaigned in Florida, he said that Rick Scott, the state\u2019s Republican governor, was doing a great job and \"he's going to have it under control, he probably already does.\" Clinton urged Congress to pass a spending bill and \"called for more public education about the virus\u2019 dangers, the development of a rapid diagnostic test, investment in treatment and a vaccine, better mosquito control and abatement, and improved access to health and family planning services.\"", "While the Zika virus had an impact on Americans in 2016 and showed how divided the Senate was, we found little impact on the 2016 presidential election.", "The 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or COVID-19, is a respiratory disease that has symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
