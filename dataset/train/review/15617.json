["About this rating", "On 19 December 2016, amateur photographer Karim Bouchetata posted an album to Facebook of images capturing snow in the Algerian town of Ain Sefra, located in the hills just bordering the Sahara desert, and several online news outlets published the stunning photographs.", "According to Gizmodo, the last significant snowfall occurred in that area in February 1979:", "The last major snowfall \u2014 if it can be called that \u2014 to hit Ain Sefra was in February 1979 when it snowed for a whopping 30 minutes. Subsequent dustings of snow also appeared in 2005 and 2012.", "Some viewers expressed skepticism about the authenticity of the photographs or the likelihood that a town located just next to the Sahara flatlands would see any snow in the first place. The fact that it snowed in Ain Sefra on December 19th can be confirmed, however, via NASA satellite data that shows pockets of snow in the region:", "While snowfall is indeed a rare occurrence in Ain Sefra, the temperatures that led to air cool enough to produce snow are not all that rare. Historical data from the region show that December and January temperatures often dip into the 30s.", "Dvorsky, George. \u00a0 \"Photos of Freak Snowfall in the Sahara Look Unreal.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Gizmodo. \u00a0 12 December 2016.", "worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov \u00a0 \u201cNASA Worldview.\u201d", "wolframalpha.com \u00a0 input: \u201cain sefra weather 1976 to present\u201d via Wolfram Alpha Knowledgebase, 2017.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
