Someone had to pay. Castle President Michelle Myrter is scheduled to plead guilty this month to criminal charges. She faces up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.", "Although most outlets referenced \"cellulose,\" the FDA's list of food additives generally recognized as safe primarily listed\u00a0carboxymethylcellulose (cellulose gum) as an approved additive in cheese production, which isn't necessarily made from wood. The FDA said:", "Cellulose is a major constituent of many foods of plant origin. As such it is a significant portion of the diet, but is neither degraded nor absorbed.

Cellulose also helps capture and retain moisture and keeps products from seeming dry.", "We're seeing more foods with added fiber, such as cellulose, because most people aren't eating enough foods that are naturally high in fiber \u2014 namely vegetables, fruits and whole grains. Manufacturers are also adding cellulose because it means they can use less fat and sugar without losing the desired mouthfeel or moistness. The rising cost of flour, sugar and oil may be another reason for this trend.", "Castle Cheese was the recipient of a FDA warning letter dated 11 July 2013, and the mention of cellulose had to do with possible labeling inconsistencies, not wood in cheese:", "3.\u00a0Your International Packing Parmesan Cheese, (b)(4) Romano 100% Grated Cheese and (b)(4) 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese products are adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(b)(4) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 342(b)(4)] in that a substance has been added to increase the products\u2019 bulk and weight.\u00a0Specifically, cellulose and/or starch were used to increase the weight of the cheese base used to manufacture your products.", "Another approach during the February 2016 wood cheese dustup\u00a0came in the form of a February 2016\u00a0Bon App\u00e9tit article. \u00a0The piece made a\u00a0distinction between proper labeling of specific cheeses and the presence of \"wood pulp\" in parmesan:", "Eating cellulose won\u2019t kill you.

It could even have been made from the crate the apples came in.

The FDA indeed investigated cheese manufacturers over the presence of cellulose in cheese, but only in the larger context of honest labeling (not safety or health concerns). Cellulose is considered safe in all expected concentrations (though it could certainly dilute the flavor of parmesan) and it didn't in any way resemble wood or wood pulp as many outlets suggested.", "Finally, the early 2016 outpouring of concern was not new at the time it occurred.
