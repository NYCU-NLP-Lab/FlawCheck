Jeb Bush takes a photo with a supporter at a fund-raiser in Sweetwater on May 18, 2015. (Getty Images)", "A Democratic political action committee ripped Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign, saying his positions as Florida\u2019s governor preview what he\u2019d be like as commander in chief -- particularly when it comes to women\u2019s issues.", "Stephanie Schriock, president of the group Emily\u2019s List, said in an essay on Medium that Bush spent his two terms curbing women\u2019s reproductive and health rights. (Emily\u2019s List helps Democratic women candidates who support abortion rights.) Schriock ticked off several actions that ran counter to the group\u2019s stance, including Bush\u2019s support of abstinence-only sex education.", "\"And let\u2019s not forget that Jeb once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all,\" she wrote.", "We wondered what Schriock meant about Bush holding grant money hostage, so we took a closer look at the books.", "Not talking about it", "We found only a few media mentions of a situation resembling a hostage crisis, and they were the same ones Emily\u2019s List sent to us as proof. The primary source was a March 2001 story in the Tampa Bay Times that focused on a budget request from Bush for lawmakers to consider during the legislative session.", "The story detailed how Bush wanted $1 million of the state Department of Health\u2019s $5.7 million family planning allocation to create education grants for chastity counseling. This would have mirrored some federally funded programs in the state that told teens to wait until marriage to have sex, without discussing birth control methods. Those programs, many of which were privately run by religious groups, operated under names like Best Friends, Sex Can Wait and Everyone's Not Doing It.", "The request would have marked the first time the state would have funded an abstinence-based counseling program. The idea was criticized by sex education advocates and legislators who said teaching abstinence didn\u2019t work. They also said diverting $1 million would keep many poor women from getting HIV tests, pap smears, birth control counseling and other services at clinics and county health departments.", "But except for a couple of mentions in other articles about the proposal, the March 2001 Times article was the only place we found that the request was fully examined. Even Emily\u2019s List couldn\u2019t tell us what happened to Bush\u2019s proposal. They did tell us their aim was to point out Bush had made clear he preferred abstinence-only counseling, and was willing to put conditions on funding to achieve that goal. That doesn\u2019t strike us as Bush literally preventing that money from being used for regular family planning services, however.", "Though the Times story says the request was supported by then-health secretary Bob Brooks, it was still just a request. Florida governors routinely submit a proposed budget each year before the session, but the Legislature has the final say on how money is spent. It appears in 2001 lawmakers didn\u2019t follow Bush\u2019s wishes.", "The state Department of Health shared appropriations for family planning services going back to 2000\u00a0and found nothing specifying funds had to go to abstinence education exclusively.", "\"It does not appear that there was any proviso language that directed $1 million to be spent on chastity programs from the family planning category,\" spokeswoman Mara Burger told us. The 2001 appropriation for family planning was almost $5.8 million, a figure that has since fallen to $4.2 million today.", "Florida continues to specify abstinence should be taught as a part of sex ed classes, although school districts are given plenty of leeway. The state is still one of the biggest recipients of federal money for chastity programs. Even anti-Obamacare Republicans in the Legislature agreed in 2012 to take millions set aside for abstinence education in the Affordable Care Act, even while rejecting other aid tied to the law.", "Our ruling", "Emily\u2019s List said, \"Jeb once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all.\"", "There are a handful of news stories that say Bush in 2001 asked the Legislature to set aside $1 million for chastity programs out of the state\u2019s almost $5.8 million for family planning. That's a bit different from threatening existing programs with a gag order. More importantly, there's no evidence Bush's proposal\u00a0went into effect. The health department said no requirements for abstinence programs were passed by lawmakers.", "We rate the statement Mostly False.", "Medium, \"Jeb Bush Really Is His Own Man,\" May 14, 2015", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Florida expands chastity program,\" Nov. 27, 1999", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Bush wants to fund chastity education,\" March 10, 2001", "Jupiter Courier, \"Governor\u2019s sex education $1 million funding plan panned,\" March 25, 2001, accessed via Nexis", "USA Today, \"\u2018Abstinence only\u2019 funding may rise,\" June 5, 2001", "Washington Monthly, \"Pork for Prudes,\" September 2002", "University of Florida news archive, \"Sex education in Florida schools varies widely, not available to all students,\" Nov. 5, 2007", "Sexual Information and Education Council of the United States, \"Sex Education in the Sunshine State,\" March 2009", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Florida legislators okay funds for abstinence education,\" Aug. 3, 2011", "First Coast News, \"Florida Turns Down Millions in Federal Aid; Accepts Abstinence Only Sex-Ed Money,\" Aug. 9, 2011", "Broward/Palm Beach New Times, \"Nan Rich: Florida Republicans take federal funds only if it promotes \u2018extreme agenda\u2019,\" Aug. 9, 2011", "U.S. News & World Report, \"Obama's Budget Proposal Slashes Obamacare Abstinence Grants,\" March 5, 2014", "U.S. Family and Youth Services Bureau, \"2014 Title V State Abstinence Education Grant Program Awards,\" June 20, 2014", "U.S. Family and Youth Services Bureau, \"2012 Title V State Abstinence Education Grant Program Awards,\" June 20, 2014", "Daily Dot, \"Jeb Bush banned sex education at his own charter school,\" March 12, 2015", "Sexual Information and Education Council of the United States, Florida state profile, accessed May 19, 2015", "State Library and Archives of Florida, \"Senate Bill No. 2000,\" accessed May 19, 2015", "Florida fiscal portal, \"Florida\u2019s Ten\u2013Year Summary of Appropriations Data: 2000\u20102001 through 2009\u20102010,\" accessed May 19, 2015", "Online Sunshine, \"The 2014 Florida Statutes: Title XLVIII, Chapter 1003,\" accessed May 19, 2015", "Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, \"Affordable Care Act (ACA) Abstinence Education Program,\" accessed May 19, 2015", "Florida Department of Health, General revenue allocated for Family Planning Services for 2000-2015, accessed May 19, 2015", "Interview with Damien Filer, Planned Parenthood Florida spokesman, May 18-20, 2015", "Interview with Natalie Spindle, Florida Department of Health spokeswoman, May 18, 2015", "Interview with Mara Burger, Florida Department of Health press secretary, May 19, 2015", "Interview with Cheryl Etters, Florida Department of Education spokeswoman, May 19, 2015", "Interview with Amy Baker,\u00a0Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research coordinator, May 19, 2015", "Interview with Marcy Stech, Emily\u2019s List press secretary, May 19, 2015", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
