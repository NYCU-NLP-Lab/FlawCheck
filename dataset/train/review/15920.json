["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on June 13, 2018", "The official U.S. statistics on trade with Canada show that the United States has a trade surplus with our neighbor to the north. The U.S. surplus was $2.8 billion in 2017, according to the Census Bureau.\u00a0Yet, President Donald Trump has claimed that the U.S. has \u201cclose to $100 billion a year loss with Canada\u201d or $17\u00a0billion \u201cminimum.\u201d", "Both figures refer to trade in goods only, not services. And the $100 billion figure factors in re-exports, which are products that come from a third country to the U.S. but travel through Canada.", "The U.S. isn\u2019t \u201closing\u201d $100 billion\u00a0on trade.", "Trump used his figures in a tweet on June 10, a day after he criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and said the U.S. wouldn\u2019t sign a joint statement issued by the other G-7 nations after the leaders met in Canada.", "Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal. According to a Canada release, they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). Minimum is 17B. Tax Dairy from us at 270%. Then Justin acts hurt when called out!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2018", "And he again used the figures in a June 12 press conference, falsely claiming that Canada has \u201cvery big advantages over us in terms of trade deficits.\u201d", "Trump, June 12: Canada does have very big advantages over us in terms of trade deficits. We have a big trade deficit with Canada, I was reading, where, oh, it\u2019s actually a surplus. Not a surplus. It\u2019s either 17, but it could actually be 100. You know, they put out a document. I don\u2019t know if you saw it. They didn\u2019t want me to see it, but we found it. Perhaps they were trying to show the power they have. It\u2019s close to $100 billion a year loss with Canada.", "There are several problems with the president\u2019s statements: As we said, he focuses on goods only and ignores trade in services. In the process, he\u2019s ignoring his own administration\u2019s statistics, which show a trade surplus with Canada. Trump also wrongly describes a deficit as a \u201closs,\u201d and he narrowly focuses on one bilateral relationship.", "Alan V. Deardorff, the John W. Sweetland professor of international economics and professor of public policy\u00a0at the University of Michigan, told us in an email that \u201ceconomists are almost universally dismissive of bilateral balances anyway.\u201d (That\u2019s a balance between two countries.) \u201cOnly the overall balance of a country has any economic significance,\u201d he said.", "The overall trade balance for the United States was a $552 billion deficit in 2017.", "Andrew Stanley, an associate fellow at the\u00a0Center for Strategic and International Studies, told us it may be easy politically to frame something as a \u201closs,\u201d but \u201cat the end of the day, a deficit represents that the U.S. is importing more goods which are consumed, which is also a benefit to U.S. consumers.\u201d", "The Census Bureau says the U.S. had a trade surplus with Canada of $2.8 billion in 2017.\u00a0The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative puts the surplus at $8.4 billion for last year, and the total trade between the two countries at $673.9 billion.", "(The Census and USTR trade balance numbers differ, because the Census numbers are on a \u201cbalance of payments basis.\u201d That\u2019s an adjustment made by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the source of the trade figures, \u201cto eliminate duplication of transactions recorded elsewhere in the international accounts, and to value transactions at market prices.\u201d You can read more about BEA\u2019s methodology here.)", "Trump, though, cites a figure for goods only when he says that the U.S. has a deficit of $17 billion with Canada. He often does this in citing trade figures, giving a skewed and misleading picture of U.S. trade, particularly given the importance of services, such as travel and telecommunications, to the United States.", "Overall, with all countries combined, the U.S. has a services surplus, as the \u201ceconomy\u00a0has grown more dependent on private service-producing industries,\u201d says a February 2018 report from the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.", "That report says: \u201cFocusing only on the trade in goods alone ignores the United States\u2019 comparative advantage in services, which rose as a share of U.S. exports to 33.5 percent\u201d through the third quarter of 2017.", "So the president doesn\u2019t follow the advice of his economic advisers when he disregards the trade in services.", "While U.S. figures show a small surplus in trade with Canada, the statistics from Canada show a small trade surplus in 2017 for that country of\u00a0$26.2 billion, which would be about $20.2 billion U.S. dollars.", "Why is there variation in the two countries\u2019 figures?", "When we wrote about this issue in March, the Census Bureau told us that one factor is re-exports, and the experts we interviewed for this article agreed. Re-exports are products that originate in a third country but ship through Canada on their way to the U.S., or vice versa. How each country attributes the re-exports can lead to discrepancies between the bilateral trade figures.", "There are other factors that cause discrepancies. Deardorff explained that\u00a0\u201ceach country can define and measure differently, including the question of what price is attached to any particular product.\u201d And\u00a0Stanley noted that these statistics are revised as more data becomes available.", "Trump claimed that Canada\u2019s surplus was \u201cclose to $100 billion a year\u201d and that the Canadians \u201cdidn\u2019t want me to see it, but we found it.\u201d But that figure includes goods only, and the value of re-exports.", "The figures are available on the website for Statistics Canada, a governmental entity. They show about a $98 billion (in U.S. dollars) gap between exports and imports, if including re-exports, for 2017.", "The president isn\u2019t the only one citing this misleading number. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has used a similar figure, and while the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s website starts off by saying the U.S. has a trade surplus with Canada, it also says that for goods only, \u201cCanada reported a $97.7 billion surplus.\u201d It then explains the role of re-exports.", "Each country attributes re-exports in a different way. Stanley explained that \u201cexports are attributed to the last known destination of those goods.\u201d So Canada may attribute Chinese goods that pass through its borders on the way to the U.S. as Canadian exports. But when those goods are imported by the U.S., they are \u201cattributed to the country of origin.\u201d In this example, that would be China. The U.S. would do the same thing, which is one reason the two countries\u2019 trade figures can vary.", "But if the U.S. wanted to count Chinese goods that pass through Canada to the U.S. as imports from Canada, it would then have to stop counting such products as imports from China. In other words, if the president wants to count re-exports and claim there\u2019s a larger deficit in goods with Canada, he will have to start citing a smaller deficit for China and other countries.", "Overall, the U.S.-Canadian trade relationship is \u201cvery balanced in comparison to some of the other deficits the U.S. has,\u201d Stanley told us. The deficit with China, for instance, was $335.7 billion for 2017. But, he said, focusing on country-by-country balances is \u201cfutile.\u201d", "\u201cTrying to address one bilateral imbalance won\u2019t bring you toward addressing the overall deficit,\u201d he said. For instance, Canada\u2019s top export to the U.S. is crude oil, and it has a large surplus with the U.S. on energy. But the U.S. needs energy, and if it didn\u2019t come from Canada, it would come from somewhere else.", "The \u201covert focus on individual bilateral relations,\u201d notes Stanley, \u201cI just don\u2019t understand the reasoning behind it.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
