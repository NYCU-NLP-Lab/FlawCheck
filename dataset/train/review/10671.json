But those headline-grabbing pledges have been kept:", "\"The mayor does give credit to the council for getting a lot of his ideas done and passed,\" said Reed spokeswoman Anne Torres. \"He realized in order to get the city in the right direction, and fulfill his promises, he really had to get Atlanta on proper financial footing.\"", "We could nitpick since Atlanta had just 1,971 officers on the force this week, as it struggles with the same churn other local law enforcement agencies face.", "But PolitiFact Georgia wants to be more skeptical than cynical. So we dug into press coverage during Reed\u2019s 2009 campaign and found smaller promises that need some explaining:", "City records show Atlanta spent $12.8 million for outside counsel in the fiscal year 2014, which ended in June. That\u2019s about 9 percent less than 2009\u2019s $14 million bill.", "The fire station remains closed. But a 2013 press release announced Reed\u2019s plans to renovate the city\u2019s oldest station.", "The city has spent $2.5 million so far on design work for the station, built in 1910. Torres said the fire department is preparing bids for the full renovation, expected to take a year once the city selects a contractor.", "Employee overtime cost the city $12 million in OT in 2014, an 88 percent increase from overtime bill in 2009, the last year before Reed took office.", "Torres notes, though, that 2009 was a year of furloughs and layoffs because of the city\u2019s financial woes. Reed\u2019s promise was based on the 2008 tab, of nearly $18 million, she said. Looking at it that way, Reed cut OT by 39 percent.", "The city budget shows a 13 percent increase in IT spending: $25,242,270 in 2009 and 28,544,187 for the fiscal year that began July 1.", "Hans Utz, the city\u2019s deputy chief operating officer, said Atlanta had long put individual departments\u2019 IT costs in those department budgets \u2013 not the overall information technology budget.", "That artificially inflated department budgets, Utz said. Starting in 2013, the city began shifting all IT costs to that department and saving by buying in bulk.", "The move increased the IT budget by $3.3 million but decreased other department budgets by $5.6 million \u2013 a $2.3 million net reduction, budget records show.", "So, would accepting those explanations mean giving Reed too much leeway to keep his promises?", "Not necessarily. Politicians tend to keep promises more than you might think, said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University.", "Blame \u2013 sigh \u2013 the media for implying candidates don\u2019t at least try, according to Thomas Patterson\u2019s 1993 book, \"Out of Order,\" Swint said. It cites four studies of seven presidential campaigns and found once elected, presidents keep the promises they made as candidates.", "\"In general, politicians try to keep their promises because it\u2019s in their best interest to do so,\" Swint said. \"\"From their point of view, they can\u2019t wave a magic wand and make things happen. There is a process, and that can seem like foot-dragging to critics.\"", "Or, we concede, to cynics. So while there is a window for promises we may not know Reed made when he ran for office, the pledges big and small appear at least in process, if not done.", "We rate Reed\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "Kasim Reed press release", "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"Atlanta council unanimously approves pension overhaul,\" June 30, 2011", "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"Public pension crisis threatens your wallet,\" March 27, 2011", "New York Times, \"Cut Here.
