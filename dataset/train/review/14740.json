She later lost in the general election to Democrat Lucy McBath. (AP/John Bazemore, File)", "In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats managed to seize more than three dozen Republican-held House seats. One of these was Georgia\u2019s 6th District, where Democratic challenger Lucy McBath defeated Republican incumbent Karen Handel.", "McBath\u2019s underdog victory \u2014 driven in part by suburban Atlanta voters\u2019 frustration over gun violence \u2014 caught the eye of another incoming Democratic freshman lawmaker, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who herself had pulled off an upset. In the primary, Ocasio-Cortez ousted a senior Democrat in a New York City district.", "Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Nov. 19:", "\"Lucy McBath is a hero. After losing her son to gun violence, she ran for Congress against her NRA incumbent. She was previously a flight attendant. Lucy was outspent 5-1, but she kept running with her conviction. She won. Flipped GA-06 in a major upset. No one saw her coming.\"", "Lucy McBath is a hero. After losing her son to gun violence, she ran for Congress against her NRA incumbent.

No one saw her coming. https://t.co/txWhV2j52A", "In fact, the spending differential wasn\u2019t as big as Ocasio-Cortez said \u2014 and once spending by outside groups is factored in, McBath actually had the edge.", "The reason: As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution initially noted, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s statement conflates money not just from the Handel-McBath matchup but also from the high-spending special election in 2017 in which Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff. (Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)", "We looked at the Georgia 6th page on the campaign finance data website OpenSecrets.org and found that for the 2018 election cycle, Handel had spent $7.99 million and McBath had spent $1.23 million. That\u2019s a 6.5-to-1 ratio in Handel\u2019s favor. (The amount each candidate raised \u2014 rather than spent \u2014 was closer to the 5-to-1 Handel edge that Ocasio-Cortez had tweeted about.)", "However, Handel\u2019s total was artificially inflated by the hard-fought and expensive open-seat battle she waged against Ossoff the previous year. That earlier race officially counts as being in the two-year-long 2018 election cycle.", "Sarah Bryner, the research director for the Center for Responsive Politics, which runs OpenSecrets.org, said their website is organized that way because that\u2019s how the Federal Election Commission tabulates the data.", "\"It's not really possible to isolate out spending and fundraising numbers for specific time periods,\" Bryner said.", "We estimated the amount of money in the McBath-Handel race based on what the Journal-Constitution reported about dollars spent and raised in the special election.", "In July 2017, the newspaper reported that Handel had raised $6.3 million for the special election, with $430,000 remaining for the 2018 general election.", "That means that Handel raised $1.69 million specifically for the general election. If you add in the $430,000 she held over from the special election, that works out to about $2.12 million.", "McBath, for her part, raised $1.79 million for the general election. So depending on how you treat the $430,000 that Handel held over, she either modestly out-raised McBath or was modestly outraised by McBath. Either way, the two candidates\u2019 fundraising ended up on pretty even footing, not a 5-to-1 edge for Handel.", "We can also estimate the amount each candidate spent, which is how Ocasio-Cortez phrased her tweet.", "Handel finished the general election with $402,000 left in the bank. Subtracting that from the money she had available for for the general election means that she actually spent $1.72 million. That\u2019s is more than the $1.22 million that McBath spent, but the difference is still more modest than what Ocasio-Cortez had tweeted \u2014 a ratio of about 1.4-to-1 in Handel\u2019s favor.", "But even this is misleading about the overall spending patterns in the race, because these figures only include dollars spent by the campaigns themselves, not by outside groups aligned with one candidate or the other.", "When outside groups are factored in, McBath actually had a sizable spending edge over Handel.", "We asked the Center for Responsive Politics to break down the outside spending on Georgia\u2019s 6th District, and they tallied up just the contributions made after June 20, 2017, the date of the special runoff.", "Groups that either supported Handel or opposed McBath spent $1.6 million. By contrast, groups supporting McBath or opposing Handel spent almost $4.9 million.", "According to the Journal-Constitution, Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group affiliated with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, was the biggest spender aligned with McBath, allocating $4.5 million to the race. The primary outside group spending on behalf of Handel, the National Republican Congressional Committee, spent $1.4 million.", "So the outside spending edge for McBath actually dwarfed the candidate spending edge for Handel. This severely undercuts the point of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tweet.", "Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that McBath \"was outspent 5-1\" in her race against Handel.", "Even looking just at the candidates\u2019 own money, Handel\u2019s edge in fundraising and spending was no higher than 1.4-to-1. And once you include spending by outside groups, it was McBath who actually had the edge.", "We rate the statement False.", "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, tweet, Nov. 19. 2018", "OpenSecrets.org, Georgia District 6 main page, accessed Nov. 28, 2018", "OpenSecrets.org, Georgia District 6 outside spending, accessed Nov. 28, 2018", "Federal Election Commission, Karen Handel 2018 page, accessed Nov. 28, 2018", "Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"The Jolt: Georgia\u2019s runoff for secretary of state gets nasty,\" Nov. 26, 2018", "Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"A lot came together to help McBath score big win for Georgia Democrats,\" Nov. 9, 2018", "Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"House GOP looks to bolster Handel with last-minute ad buy,\" Oct. 22, 2018", "Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"A final tally: Ossoff raised nearly $30M in 6th District race,\" July 22, 2017", "Email interview with Sarah Bryner and Doug Weber, Center for Responsive Politics, Nov. 27-28, 2018", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
