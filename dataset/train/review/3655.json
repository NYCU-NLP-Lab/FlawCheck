It was illegal to make such weapons for use by private citizens during the 10 years the ban was in effect. But, as this Washington Post primer on the ban notes, it was legal to own or resell any assault weapon manufactured before the law went into effect, meaning if you owned a banned gun before the ban, you could keep it or sell it.", "When we asked the NRA about the post, Amy Hunter, a spokesperson for the organization\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, said: \"When we say Joe Biden promises to ban guns, we mean exactly what we say: He plans to ban guns.

But as he vies for the Democratic presidential nomination, he isn\u2019t promising to prohibit Americans from owning any gun. He said he\u2019d again champion a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like the bans he supported in 1994.
