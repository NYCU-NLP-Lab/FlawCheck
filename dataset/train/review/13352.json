["An article shared more than 14,000 times on Facebook claims the Nigerian government gave N20,000 ($52) to \u201ceveryone\u201d across the country\u2019s 36 states. This is false; the\u00a0article in question shares a true story but uses an unrelated and misleading headline. Nigeria has a social investment programme to help the poor and handed out cash and food during the lockdown, but not to all citizens.", "One post,\u00a0shared over a thousand times on Facebook and archived here, has been generating anger among some commenters, after the person who posted it suggested authorities were lying about giving financial help to all citizens.", "The same article has been shared in other posts\u00a0here, here and here.", "Before the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the Nigerian government had instituted a social investment programme (SIP) in partnership with the World Bank. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who spearheaded the programme,\u00a0said\u00a0in October 2019 that \u201ctwo million informal traders\u201d had\u00a0benefitted from the programme, stating that its \u201cconditional cash transfer scheme\u201d is \u201cmeant to cover over a million of the poorest in our communities\u201d.", "The programme provides low-interest loans to small businesses and smallholder farmers, offers jobs and training to unemployed people, and gives cash handouts to the poor and vulnerable. It also has a national school feeding programme, which provides a meal a day for pupils in government-run schools across Nigeria.", "During Nigeria\u2019s lockdown, to slow the spread of COVID-19 across certain states, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered distribution of food items and cash to the most vulnerable in society for two months. Rice, beans and other staples were part of the programme from authorities to feed some of the poor and attempt to cushion the blow as shops and businesses were forced to shut. However, these handouts were for the most vulnerable in the country -- not for everyone.", "I have also directed that the current Social Register be expanded from 2.6 million households to 3.6 million households in the next two weeks.", "The misleading article with the headline \u201cHow We Gave N20,000 & Food Items To Everyone In 36 States \u2014 Minister\u201d\u00a0does not actually go on to say anything about handing out cash and food parcels\u00a0to all Nigerians.", "The body of the story talks about digitising the payment of cash transfers to the poor. A Google search of the first paragraph of the story shows it was copied word-for-word from this Vanguard newspaper report on digitising the SIP.", "The article featured a photo\u00a0Sadiya Umar-Farouq, the minister of humanitarian affairs, disaster management and social development. Contacted by AFP Fact Check, Halima Oyelade, special adviser to the minister, said that Umar-Farouq had made no such statement. She explained that the social investment programme is not for all Nigerians.", "\u201cThe scheme has been in existence since 2016, and we have a national register, which has the names of the poorest of the poor in Nigeria, who benefit from the programme,\u201d she said. \"We got these names from working with the community.\"", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
