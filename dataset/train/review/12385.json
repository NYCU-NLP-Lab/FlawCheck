After all, if you\u2019re seeking expertise in what\u2019s happened someplace beyond North America, you probably didn\u2019t get steeped in it before college.", "Still, do most American colleges not require that history majors take even one American history course?", "Willett cites report", "We asked Willett, whose name appeared on a 2016 Donald Trump list of U.S. Supreme Court prospects, the basis of his claim. Willett, known for his oft-humorous Twitter account, answered with an email pointing out a report, closing his reply: \"Gotta avoid that dreaded Robe on Fire rating.\"", "The July 2016 report -- \u00a0issued by the Washington-based American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which says it\u2019s an independent group \"committed to academic freedom, excellence, and accountability at America's colleges and universities\" -- states that 23 of the 76 U.S. colleges and universities ranked most highly by U.S. News & World Report were requiring students seeking a history degree to take courses in American history--so 70 percent were not.", "Do Top-Ranked U.S. Universities Require History Majors to take American History?", "SOURCE: Report, \"No U.S. History?,\" the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, July 1, 2016", "Also, the report says that among the high-ranked institutions requiring a course in American history, \"11 allow courses so narrow in scope\u2014such as \u2018History of Sexualities\u2019 or \u2018History of the FBI\u2019\u2014that it takes a leap of the imagination to see these as an adequate fulfillment of an undergraduate history requirement.\"", "At the council, the study's lead author,\u00a0Michael Poliakoff, told us by email that the focus was on university requirements \"based on the understanding that it is through requirements that a program articulates its own concept of academic priorities.\" Poliakoff said the research did not try to gauge how many history students take at least one U.S. history course.", "Texas universities", "We checked some of the report\u2019s accounts, starting with the two Texas universities included in the review.", "Rice University, the report says, previously required history majors to take a U.S. history course, \"but their new set of requirements makes it merely optional.\"", "On a web page, Rice says that each history major matriculating after fall 2014 must take 10 history courses including one each in four of five fields: Premodern; Europe; U.S.; Asia, Latin America, Africa; and transnational history--perhaps an indication there\u2019s a good chance a Rice history major takes American history. But it\u2019s not required.", "Also, according to the report, the University of Texas requires history majors to take two U.S. history courses though, the study says, a class on Jews in American entertainment can count.", "To our inquiry, a UT spokesman, J.B. Bird, noted by email that by state law, every degree-seeking student at public colleges and universities--regardless of major--must take a couple American history courses.", "We confirmed that: The relevant state law, tracing to 1955, states that \"a college or university receiving state support or state aid from public funds may not grant a baccalaureate degree or a lesser degree or academic certificate to any person unless the person has credit for six semester hours or its equivalent in American History.\"", "Bird also guided us to Jacqueline Jones, who chairs the university\u2019s history department.", "By email, Jones said most UT undergraduates take the department\u2019s survey courses, one covering American history before 1865, the other picking up from there. Jones also said it would be highly unlikely for a student to take an upper-level history course, including the one on Jews in American entertainment, toward complying with the state mandate.", "Jones further\u00a0offered that she takes issue with \"the premise that if a college student does not take history-department courses, s/he has learned no American history. My colleagues in the American Studies department teach many different history courses. Faculty in the Government department who teach U.S. politics and political institutions also teach American history.

In spring 2017, about when Willett spoke, we noticed more than\u00a025 course options in this category including nine courses centered on American history such as one on the American Revolution; another introducing American history with an emphasis on democratic political institutions; a course on the New Deal; and a course on U.S. legal history from 1776 to 1865.", "The University of Michigan, the highest-ranked public university identified in the report as not requiring history majors to take American history, says on a web page that each major must take 10 history courses--including one each from four of seven regions/categories including U.S./Canada.", "At the University of North Carolina, also listed in the report as not requiring history majors to take an American history course, history majors also must take 10 history courses, according to a university web page. Up to six of the courses can be in the student\u2019s chosen \"concentration,\" the page says; the university\u2019s eight history concentrations include one in U.S. history.", "National expert", "We asked UT\u2019s Jones to suggest a national expert who might speak to what universities require of history majors.
