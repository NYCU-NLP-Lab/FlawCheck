["By Lori Robertson, Jessica McDonald, Robert Farley, D'Angelo Gore and Rem Rieder", "Posted on November 6, 2020", "In remarks resembling an attack on democratic elections, rather than a presidential speech, President Donald Trump doubled down on his campaign pledge: \u201cThe only way we can lose, in my opinion, is massive fraud.\u201d", "In his Nov. 5 comments, he offered no evidence for the \u201cillegal votes\u201d that he claimed would need to be counted in order for former Vice President Joe Biden to win the election. He offered several false, misleading and baseless claims instead.", "We\u2019ll go through Trump\u2019s claims about voting in several states, beginning with Pennsylvania. But readers can skip ahead by clicking on the links for the other states:", "In speaking about the Keystone State, Trump baselessly alleged election engineering and mischaracterized a court ruling related to partisan election observers. While one ruling allowed observers to get as close as 6 feet, the president\u2019s claim that \u201cthey don\u2019t want us to have any observers\u201d is false. There is also no evidence that local officials have improperly handled the election.", "\u201cWe were up by nearly 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. I won Pennsylvania by a lot. And that gets whittled down to, I think they said now we\u2019re up by 90,000 votes and they\u2019ll keep coming and coming and coming,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey find them all over and they don\u2019t want us to have any observers. Although we won a court case, the judge said, \u2018You have to have observers.\u2019\u201d", "As we\u2019ve\u00a0explained\u00a0before, Trump cannot claim to have won Pennsylvania. The earlier vote returns were in his favor, as the in-person votes were counted more quickly, but mail-in and absentee ballots could not even be opened and prepared for counting until 7 a.m. on Nov. 3. The count of legitimately cast ballots is still proceeding.", "Because more Democrats tended to vote by mail \u2014 likely due, in part, to the party\u2019s active encouragement of such ballots to lock in votes early \u2014 many more of the votes that were counted later were for Biden, leading to a \u201cblue shift\u201d over time. Democrats accounted for nearly two-thirds of the 2.6 million returned mail-in ballots, according to\u00a0an analysis of Pennsylvania election data by\u00a0Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor who maintains\u00a0the U.S. Elections Project.", "And indeed, as many analysts expected, the Democratic nominee took the lead\u00a0in the state on the morning of Nov. 6.", "Trump also baselessly said that Philadelphia was in the process of \u201cengineering the outcome of a presidential race\u201d and that \u201cofficials overseeing the counting in Pennsylvania and other key states are all part of a corrupt Democrat machine.\u201d", "There\u2019s no indication that any election malfeasance has occurred. It\u2019s also not true that all of the officials in charge of counting ballots are Democrats. In Philadelphia, that job falls to a bipartisan\u00a0trio of commissioners\u00a0that\u00a0includes one Republican.", "The commonwealth\u2019s website similarly\u00a0states\u00a0that \u201cbipartisan teams of election officials in each county are making sure your vote is accurately counted and verified.\u201d", "Trump then proceeded to mischaracterize litigation pertaining to observers watching the vote counting process, saying that Democrats \u201chave gone to the state Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers and very strongly.\u201d", "The\u00a0dispute\u00a0has been over how close observers can get to the canvassing proceedings, not whether observers are allowed to be present. Initially, a trial court denied the Trump campaign\u2019s request for closer observation in Philadelphia,\u00a0finding\u00a0on Nov. 3 that by the campaign\u2019s own admission, it had been given the opportunity to observe \u201cthe opening and sorting of ballots.\u201d", "The next day, a state court\u00a0reversed\u00a0that ruling,\u00a0allowing\u00a0observers within 6 feet, \u201cwhile adhering to all COVID-19 protocols, including, wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.\u201d Philadelphia\u2019s election board then\u00a0appealed\u00a0the ruling to the state Supreme Court, saying that it had complied with the law and that closer inspection \u201cjeopardizes both the\u00a0safety of the City Defendants\u2019 canvass, plus the privacy of voters.\u201d", "Separately, but on the same issue, the Trump campaign\u00a0filed suit\u00a0in federal court on Nov. 5 to stop the vote count in Philadelphia. That request was\u00a0dismissed by a judge \u2014 who was appointed by President George W. Bush \u2014 after both sides agreed that each would be allowed 60 observers. The Trump lawyer admitted\u00a0during the hearing that the campaign did have some canvassing observers present, stating, \u201cThere\u2019s a non-zero number of people in the room.\u201d", "Philadelphia, notably, has been\u00a0livestreaming\u00a0its vote canvassing, which is available online for anyone to watch.", "Trump also misleadingly summarized a previous state Supreme Court decision that permits ballots that are postmarked by Nov. 3 to be accepted if received by Nov. 6. (In refusing\u00a0a Republican request to expedite review of the case, the U.S. Supreme Court let the state court decision stand \u2014 but could opt to revisit the case after the election.)", "\u201cIn Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election, and we think much more than that, and they\u2019re counting those without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have postmarks, you don\u2019t have identification.\u201d", "According to the rules, which were implemented due to concerns about postal delays during the COVID-19 pandemic, a ballot postmarked by Election Day can be accepted if received by\u00a05 p.m. on Nov. 6. In the rare case in which there is a missing or illegible postmark, ballots without postmarks will be allowed unless there is a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d they were mailed after the deadline.", "Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth\u00a0Kathy Boockvar\u00a0explained in a Nov. 4\u00a0press conference\u00a0that the vast majority of these later-arriving ballots should have postmarks on them, as that is standard fare for mail. Trump, therefore, is wrong to suggest that most or all of these ballots would not have postmarks.", "It\u2019s also false for the president to claim that the ballots do not require \u201cany identification whatsoever.\u201d According to the state\u2019s\u00a0website, \u201cIn order to apply for an absentee or mail-in ballot, you must supply proof of identification.\u201d", "Furthermore, the later-arriving ballots are not even relevant yet, as none of the mail-in ballots received past the 8 p.m. Nov. 3 cutoff have been\u00a0included\u00a0in the counts so far.\u00a0Counties are keeping those ballots\u00a0separate\u00a0so they can be distinguished in case of further litigation.", "Trump falsely claimed he \u201cwon\u201d Michigan, because he was up in the vote count on election night. But of course, the votes were still being counted, and Biden\u00a0is now ahead by more than 146,000\u00a0with 99% of the votes in. All major news organizations, including Fox News, have called the state for Biden.", "The president claimed: \u201cOur campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit.\u201d But his own campaign hasn\u2019t alleged that. Instead, the campaign has complained about not getting \u201cmeaningful access\u201d to observe the counting in \u201cnumerous\u201d locations, which it does not identify.", "Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien\u00a0said\u00a0in a Nov. 4 statement: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process, as guaranteed by Michigan law. We have filed suit today in the Michigan Court of Claims to halt counting until meaningful access has been granted.\u201d", "In a\u00a0court documents, Jonathan Brater, director of the Michigan Bureau of Elections, said, \u201cI am not aware of any complaints received by the Bureau of Elections that an election inspector was not allowed to be present at an absent voter counting board in any jurisdiction in this State.\u201d", "The Trump campaign\u00a0lawsuit,\u00a0which a state judge\u00a0dismissed,\u00a0charged that Michigan\u2019s \u201cabsent voter counting boards\u201d weren\u2019t complying with a statute to have \u201c[a]t all times, at least 1 election inspector from each major political party \u2026 present at the absent voter counting place.\u201d", "The suit also said election \u201cchallengers\u201d \u2014 who are not the same as political party inspectors \u2014 weren\u2019t able to observe video of ballot drop boxes, charging this violated the state Constitution. It named one individual \u2014 Eric Ostergren, an election challenger, who claimed he was told to leave the Oakland County counting board. Oakland County is part of the Detroit metropolitan area.", "Brater further said that state law exempts drop boxes ordered before October 1 from video surveillance requirements.", "Trump appeared to reference a debunked claim from a conservative website when he said the \u201cfinal batch\u201d of votes in Detroit \u201cdid not arrive until 4 in the morning. And even though the polls closed at 8 o\u2019clock, so they brought it in and the batches came in and nobody knew where they came from.\u201d", "A video posted by a site called Texas Scorecard turned out to show a TV news photographer bringing equipment to the Detroit voting center in the early morning hours of Nov. 4. The video doesn\u2019t show any ballots at all. Instead, it shows a man unloading a black box from a white van and putting it into a wagon that he wheels into the TCF Center in Detroit. The website then claims then is \u201csuspicious.\u201d", "Ross Jones, an investigative reporter for WXYZ-TV,\u00a0said\u00a0on Twitter: \u201cThe \u2018ballot thief\u2019 was my photographer.

But Trump\u2019s implication that no one was observing the vote into the hall is false.", "Lawrence Garcia, Detroit\u2019s corporation counsel and an election commissioner, said more election challengers couldn\u2019t enter the hall because it had hit the permitted capacity for each party,\u00a0according to Crain\u2019s Detroit Business.", "Finally,\u00a0Trump claimed, \u201cPoll workers in Michigan were duplicating ballots.\u201d We don\u2019t know what Trump is talking about; we asked his campaign but haven\u2019t received a response. The president further said: \u201cBut when our observers attempted to challenge the activity, those poll workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their views so that they couldn\u2019t see what they were doing and it became a little bit dangerous.\u201d", "The only reference we could find to duplicating ballots is a comment \u2014 in\u00a0a\u00a0Detroit News\u00a0article\u00a0\u2014 by Christopher Schormak, an election challenger with the Election Integrity Fund, a project of the conservative Thomas More Society law firm, who said military and overseas ballots \u201cwon\u2019t feed into the machine,\u201d so they \u201chave to be duplicated and double-checked by another worker.\u201d", "Schormak didn\u2019t allege anything was nefarious or fraudulent about that.", "Trump made several unfounded, baseless and specious claims about alleged election counting issues in Georgia, where Biden pulled into a slight lead over the president, according to counts as of the morning of Nov. 6.", "In a Nov. 6\u00a0press conference, the morning after Trump spoke, Georgia Voting System Implementation Manager Gabriel Sterling, a Republican, said state officials have not seen any evidence of widespread voter fraud.", "\u201cAre we seeing any widespread fraud?

And by the way, got whittled down and now it\u2019s getting to be to a point where I\u2019ll go from winning by a lot to perhaps being even down a little bit. In Georgia, a pipe burst in a far away location, totally unrelated to the location of what was happening and they stopped counting for four hours. And a lot of things happened. The election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats.", "There are several misleading statements here. Trump did not \u201cwin\u201d the state by a lot (or at all), though he is correct that he was\u00a0leading\u00a0in the vote tallies on election night. But as we have\u00a0written repeatedly, vote counting always goes past Election Day. There\u2019s nothing unusual about that. Like\u00a0most states, Georgia could not start counting mail-in ballots until the day of the election, and it had roughly\u00a01.3 million mail-in ballots\u00a0returned and accepted. As has been in the case in other states, most of the mail-in ballots being counted in the days after the election broke in Biden\u2019s favor.", "As for Trump\u2019s claim that \u201ca pipe burst in a far away location, totally unrelated to the location of what was happening and they stopped counting for four hours,\u201d there\u2019s some truth in that, though there\u2019s no evidence that it ultimately affected vote tallies in any way.", "As the\u00a0Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u00a0reported, a water leak at\u00a0State Farm Arena\u00a0in Atlanta, which serves as a ballot processing site, caused a several hours delay in vote-counting on election night. No ballots were damaged, and vote processing resumed normally.", "Finally, Trump is wrong to say, \u201cThe election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats.\u201d Georgia has a\u00a0Republican governor.\u00a0Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger \u2014 who oversees elections \u2014 is a Republican. And the state\u2019s voting implementation manager, Sterling, is a Republican.", "Asked at a\u00a0press conference\u00a0on Nov. 6 about Trump\u2019s comment, Sterling said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to try to get into the president\u2019s actual mindset on that, because there are Republicans who are involved, there are Democrats involved at different levels. It\u2019s sort of a shared service delivery model. There are Republican election directors. There are Democrat election directors. Obviously, Secretary Raffensperger is a Republican. I\u2019m a Republican. I don\u2019t make any bones about that. \u2026 In general, we have people who have partisan beliefs, but the job of elections directors and this office is to count every legal vote, follow the law and assure that every legal vote is counted, and the will and intent of the voters is met.\u201d", "Trump:\u00a0The 11th Circuit ruled that in Georgia, the votes have been in by Election Day, that they should be in by Election Day, and they weren\u2019t. Votes are coming in after Election Day. And they had a ruling already that you have to have the votes in by Election Day. To the best of my knowledge, votes should be in by Election Day, and they didn\u2019t do that.", "It\u2019s true that Georgia requires ballots to be received by the close of the polls on Election Day if they are to be counted. (There are\u00a022 states\u00a0that allow ballots postmarked by Election Day and received in the days after the election to be counted, but Georgia is not one of them.) As Trump noted, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in early October\u00a0reinstated\u00a0the Election Day deadline for Georgia voters to return their absentee ballots.", "But there is no evidence that any votes received after Election Day are being counted in Georgia, as the president claimed.", "The Trump campaign and the Georgia Republican Party filed\u00a0a lawsuit that included an affidavit from a Republican poll observer who expressed concern that 53 ballots may have been received in Chatham County after the 7 p.m. deadline on Election Day but intermingled with on-time ballots.", "Colin McRae, chair of the Chatham County registrars board,\u00a0testified\u00a0in a hearing that he reviewed all of the 53 ballots in question and verified that each was time-stamped as having been received before the deadline. Sabrina German, director of the registrars office, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u00a0that the 53 ballots had initially been separated and flagged for further review, but were received on time. (As of Thursday morning, McRae said, 41 ballots in Chatham County arrived too late, and will not be counted.)", "Superior Court Judge James Bass dismissed the Republican lawsuit,\u00a0stating: \u201c[T]he Court finds that there is no evidence that the ballots referenced in the petition were received after 7:00 p.m. on election day, thereby making those ballots invalid.\u201d", "Trump:\u00a0We\u2019ve also been denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia.", "There\u2019s also no evidence of this.", "David Shafer, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, tweeted complaints about at least two instances of alleged obstruction of Republican observers, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be much to either of those.", "In one case, Shafer\u00a0complained\u00a0about workers in a tabulation center in Fulton County \u201coperating a fork lift between the place the ballot scanners are located and the area our observers have been instructed to stand.\u201d", "In another\u00a0tweet\u00a0on the afternoon after Election Day, Shafer alleged, \u201cFulton County told our observers last night to go home because they were closing up and then continued to count ballots in secret.\u201d", "But Fulton County officials say that\u2019s not true. According to the\u00a0Associated Press, Rick Barron, the county elections supervisor, told the county board of commissioners \u201cthat when he learned staffers were dismissed at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday night, he advised that some of them needed to stay, county spokeswoman Jessica Corbitt said in an email.\u201d", "\u201cBased on that directive, a smaller crew continued to work through the night,\u201d Corbitt told the AP. \u201cIt may be possible that\u00a0observers\u00a0left at the time the majority of the staff left, but from the information we have, the processing area was never closed to\u00a0observers.\u201d", "In\u00a0a press conference\u00a0on Nov. 6, Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, said that while there have been allegations in other states about monitors not being allowed to watch the counts, \u201cIn Georgia, this process is and will remain open and transparent to monitors.\u201d", "Trump complained about developments in North Carolina, even though he continues to lead in the Tar Heel State.
