["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on December 9, 2020", "A TV ad from Democrat Raphael Warnock falsely says Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler \u201csupports raising taxes on Georgia\u2019s middle class.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to the 2017 Republican tax law that temporarily cut individual income taxes, but Loeffler supports making permanent provisions that are set to expire after 2025.", "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for which Loeffler also has voiced support, cut taxes on average initially, but it will raise them after 2025 for most taxpayers, unless the law\u2019s provisions are extended.", "Loeffler says on her campaign website that she wants to: \u201cMake the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u2019s tax cuts for working and middle class families permanent.\u201d", "Warnock and Loeffler are facing off in one of\u00a0two runoff elections\u00a0in Georgia that will decide which political party has control of the U.S. Senate.\u00a0Loeffler, a wealthy businesswoman, was\u00a0appointed\u00a0to her seat after Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson\u00a0retired\u00a0in December 2019 for health reasons. The winner of the upcoming Jan. 5 election will serve the\u00a0last two years\u00a0of Isakson\u2019s six-year term.", "Loeffler wasn\u2019t able to vote on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, since she took office in January 2020, but she has voiced support for the law. When Republicans passed it in December 2017, they designed the law with expiring individual income tax provisions so they could keep down the cost of the legislation to pass it with a simple majority. At the time, they said they expected a future Congress to extend those tax cuts, rather than allowing taxes for many to increase.", "But Loeffler is on record saying she wants to make the law\u2019s tax cut provisions \u201cfor working and middle class families permanent.\u201d That\u2019s what she says in an economic plan she unveiled\u00a0in late April.", "The Warnock campaign argues that its statement is accurate, because Loeffler hasn\u2019t introduced legislation to extend the individual income tax cuts. The campaign points to bills Loeffler introduced in June that are associated with her economic plan, noting they don\u2019t address the expiring tax cuts.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean Loeffler won\u2019t introduce \u2013 or support \u2013 efforts to extend those cuts in the future, particularly given the provisions don\u2019t expire until after 2025.", "Loeffler also has signed a pledge with Americans for Tax Reform, saying she would \u201coppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses.\u201d In a press release, her campaign said she was \u201ccommitted to opposing all tax increases at the federal level.\u201d", "No action is needed, however, for the Republican tax law\u2019s individual income tax provisions to expire. Instead, Congress would need to act to preserve those provisions.", "Warnock\u2019s ad begins by highlighting a Sept. 11 Salon article about Loeffler\u2019s work as an executive with the financial company Intercontinental Exchange. (Her husband, Jeff Sprecher, is the founder and CEO of the company, as well as chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.)", "The ad charges that \u201cafter the Great Recession, Loeffler made millions helping big banks get offshore tax relief by setting up a complicated corporate web in the Caymans, allowing banks to hide assets there to avoid paying U. S taxes.\u201d That reflects the Salon article, which called the arrangement an \u201coffshore tax dodge.\u201d We asked Loeffler\u2019s campaign repeatedly about the Warnock ad and the Salon article, but we haven\u2019t received a response. A spokesperson for Intercontinental Exchange told Salon \u201cthere has been no avoidance of U.S. taxation whatsoever\u201d with the holding company in question.", "We\u2019ll concentrate here on the ad\u2019s next claim: that Loeffler is \u201cfor raising taxes on Georgia\u2019s middle class.\u201d The ad cites an Oct. 31 New York Times opinion piece on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a Dec. 30, 2019, radio interview in which Loeffler voices support for that law, two days before she took office.", "Loeffler, Dec. 30, 2019: I think President Trump\u2019s tax cuts were incredibly helpful in making America more competitive from a business perspective. When you look at the ability of companies to repatriate money into the United States, that they were having to keep offshore for unreasonable tax implications. All of these things add up and have created more jobs.", "As for individuals, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did lower taxes, on average, for all income groups after it was enacted. An analysis of the legislation by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center found: \u201cCompared to current law, taxes would fall for all income groups on average in 2018, increasing overall average after-tax income by 2.2 percent.\u201d", "The TPC found that only 5% of taxpayers would pay more in taxes under the law in 2018. Those in the middle quintile, earning\u00a0between $49,000 and $86,000, would get about a $900 tax cut, on average, the TPC said.", "In 2025, all income groups, on average, would still see a tax cut, compared with prior law, with the middle quintile still receiving about a $900 average cut.", "But after that year, most individual income tax provisions in the law expire, leading to higher taxes for 53% of taxpayers in 2027. The bottom three quintiles (those earning up to about $93,000) would see small tax increases of $20 to $40, on average, compared with prior law.", "Mark J. Mazur, director of the Tax Policy Center, told us the tax law is a \u201cvery idiosyncratic\u201d piece of legislation. Whether or not a taxpayer saw a tax cut or an increase depended on their personal circumstances.", "By 2025, most taxpayers \u2014 76% \u2014 still get a tax cut from the law, but 9% get an \u201can average tax increase of almost $2,500,\u201d the TPC analysis found.", "In the middle quintile of income earners, 87% get an average tax cut of $1,220 in 2025, while 11% pay an average $1,040 more in taxes, compared with prior law. That\u2019s an increase from the 7% in that group paying higher taxes in 2018.", "One reason the benefits of the law lessen over time for some is a change in the way tax thresholds are indexed for inflation.", "Mazur explained that several individual income tax provisions, including the thresholds for the tax brackets and the maximum earned income tax credit, are indexed for inflation. Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that inflation measure was the consumer price index for all urban consumers (or the CPI-U). The tax law changed that to what\u2019s called the chained CPI, which is a slower inflation adjustment.", "\u201cEconomists think it\u2019s a better measure of inflation,\u201d Mazur said, because it allows for changes in the basket of goods people buy. Consumers might buy more apples, he explained, if the cost of oranges goes up, instead of buying more expensive oranges.", "But this change in the CPI reduces the measure of inflation \u201cby somewhere around two-tenths or .25% a year,\u201d he said. That means people will be pushed into slightly higher tax brackets over time or get \u201cslightly smaller\u201d earned income tax credits.", "So, some people will see slight tax increases due to the inflation change, which is a permanent part of the law. Mazur said the impact of that is small, but it \u201ccompounds over time.\u201d", "But the big impact that leads to a tax increase for a majority of taxpayers \u2014 and 70% of those in the middle quintile \u2014 is the expiration of most of the individual income tax provisions after 2025.", "\u201cAbsent action by Congress, individuals will face a higher tax burden in 2026,\u201d the business-backed Tax Foundation has said.", "But, as we said, Loeffler supports extending those expiring tax provisions, so she is not \u201cfor raising taxes on Georgia\u2019s middle class,\u201d as the ad claims.", "Why do these individual tax cuts expire in the law? As we\u2019ve explained before,\u00a0in order to pass their tax bill through budget reconciliation, a process requiring only a majority vote in the Senate, Republican lawmakers could not add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Nor could they have a bill that added to the deficit beyond that 10-year window.", "So \u201cthe \u2018easy\u2019 options\u201d to make that happen, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget noted, was to have some of the tax cuts expire.", "Democrats, including the Warnock campaign, have criticized Republicans\u2019 move to keep in place corporate tax cuts in the law while letting the individual income tax cuts expire. The campaign pointed us to a Dec. 20, 2017, CNN Money article headlined: \u201cEnjoy your tax cuts while they last.\u201d", "\u201cRepublicans made individual tax cuts temporary so they could meet budget rules that let them pass their tax overhaul with no Democratic votes,\u201d the CNN Money article said. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, they say. A future Congress won\u2019t let middle class tax cuts expire. Recent precedents \u2014 like the oft-extended Bush tax cuts \u2014 suggest they may be right. Still, there\u2019s zero guarantee of that. After all, a lot can change over eight years.\u201d", "Warnock\u2019s ad cites a New York Times opinion piece by Joseph E. Stiglitz, an economist and Columbia University professor. In that piece, Stiglitz wrote that those earning between $10,000 and $30,000 \u201care among those scheduled to pay a higher average tax rate in 2021 than in years before the tax \u2018cut\u2019 was passed,\u201d citing estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.", "But Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst with the Tax Foundation, called that \u201cmisleading\u201d in a Nov. 18 post. He explained that the apparent increase in JCT tables is due to fewer people using Affordable Care Act premium tax credits. The tax law eliminated the monetary penalty for not having insurance, reducing the incentive for some people to get coverage.", "In fact, the TPC analysis, which doesn\u2019t show average tax increases for some income groups until 2027, doesn\u2019t include the health insurance tax credits, Mazur confirmed. The impact of eliminating the penalty for not having coverage, Mazur said, is that \u201cfewer people sign up for the Affordable Care [Act] plans through the marketplaces, so they\u2019re less likely to get a tax credit for that\u201d and \u201cfewer people sign up for Medicaid.\u201d", "We asked Stiglitz about his assertion about 2021 tax rates. He replied in an email: \u201cThe main point of my piece is that tax rate increases in 2027 \u2014 increases relative to average taxes paid in 2019 and average tax rates paid under prior law \u2014 have already been legislated, and most people are not aware of that.", "\u201cIn terms of using the language of tax increase or tax decrease, in economic analysis we look at net changes (e.g. taking into account, say, reductions in tax expenditures),\u201d he continued. \u201cI followed the practice of my fellow economists and the Joint Committee on Taxation in looking at net payments. My use of \u2018average tax rates\u2019 (and changes in those rates) is precisely that of the Joint Tax Committee.\u201d", "As for Warnock\u2019s position on the tax law, Michael J. Brewer, a spokesman for the campaign, told us Warnock \u201cbelieves the permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest and corporations should be repealed and that Congress should make permanent the tax breaks for the middle class, which would otherwise expire.\u201d", "In other words, both candidates support making the \u201cmiddle class\u201d tax breaks \u2014 however they might define that \u2014 permanent.", "It\u2019s not clear either candidate would get an opportunity to alter the GOP tax law in the near term.", "Mazur noted that given the expirations don\u2019t take effect until 2026, it would probably be 2024 when we see some action from Congress.", "By then, the initial term of whoever wins this Georgia runoff election \u2014 Warnock or Loeffler \u2014 would be over. The winner will have to mount a reelection campaign in 2022.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising. We rely on grants and individual donations from people like you.
