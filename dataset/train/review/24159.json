["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on November 27, 2018", "After a group of migrants tried to breach the U.S. border at Tijuana, with some throwing rocks and border agents responding with tear gas,\u00a0Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said there were no \u201creported serious injuries on either side of the border.\u201d But President Donald Trump told reporters the same day that \u201cthree Border Patrol people yesterday were very badly hurt through getting hit with rocks and stones.\u201d", "We asked the White House and the Department of Homeland Security about the president\u2019s claim, but we have not received a response.", "The conflict occurred at the San\u00a0Ysidro Port of Entry, the major border crossing between Tijuana and San Diego. There are more than 5,600 Central American migrants, who had traveled in caravans through Mexico, housed in a Tijuana sports complex, according to the director of Mexico\u2019s\u00a0Social Development Secretariat, CNN reports. Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum\u00a0has declared a humanitarian crisis.", "On Nov. 25, when planned protests in Mexico reached the border, some migrants attempted to cross into the U.S. at the port of entry and then tried to enter through fencing along the border, according to\u00a0U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\u00a0The port of entry was closed temporarily and the incident involved\u00a0\u201cover 1,000 individuals who sought to enter the U.S. unlawfully in large groups,\u201d McAleenan, the CBP commissioner, said.", "McAleenan\u00a0told reporters on Nov. 26 that some of those individuals threw rocks or other projectiles at U.S. border personnel but that no one was seriously hurt. \u201cFour agents were hit with rocks, but were wearing protective gear and did not suffer serious injuries,\u201d he said. A White House blog post repeated McAleenan\u2019s statement.", "Video and images showed tear gas being used to disperse the crowds. In a statement posted on Facebook, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said, \u201cI want to thank those officers and agents in San Ysidro who, under tremendous strain, used professionalism and restraint to ensure that no one was injured as they were attacked themselves.\u201d", "The president, however, contradicted McAleenan\u2019s and Nielsen\u2019s statements. In answering reporters\u2019 questions after a roundtable event in Mississippi on Nov. 26, Trump said\u00a0that \u201cwe had tremendous violence \u2014 three Border Patrol people yesterday were very badly hurt through getting hit with rocks and stones.\u201d", "We\u2019ll update this story if we receive any further information about the president\u2019s claim from the administration.", "Trump also claimed that there are \u201cover 500 people that are serious criminals and gang members\u201d among the migrants in the caravan. Similarly, Nielsen said in her statement: \u201c[A]t this point we have confirmed that there are over 600 convicted criminals traveling with the caravan flow. This includes individuals known to law enforcement for assault, battery, drug crimes, burglary, rape, child abuse and more.\u201d", "But there is no evidence to support either claim.", "We asked the White House and DHS for more information on those figures, including how the administration has identified those convicted criminals and whether the crimes were committed in the U.S. or other countries. We have not received a response.", "Trump also repeated a claim he has made before, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re building big parts of the wall.\u201d He said the breach on Sunday was \u201cin one area where the wall wasn\u2019t quite built yet; it wasn\u2019t completed. But the areas that have been completed have been very, very strong.\u201d As we\u2019ve explained before, Congress has approved funding for some new fencing, but it\u2019s far less than the wall Trump had touted during the presidential campaign.", "The $1.6 billion in approved funding in the fiscal 2018 omnibus spending bill includes money to\u00a0replace 14 miles of existing 8- to 10-foot high fencing in San Diego with 18- to 30-foot high bollard-style fences, according to CBP. But that\u2019s not the kind of concrete wall Trump described during the campaign, and the funding is a fraction of the $25 billion the president requested.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
