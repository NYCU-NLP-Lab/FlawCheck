Jackson extols free markets, he points to the gulf coast in Texas.\n\n\"Right now, in our own country, in Galveston, Texas, they have allowed people to privatize part of their Social Security. And people are building wealth,\" he said in a recent debate between the four Republicans running in the June 12 primary for the U.S. Senate.\n\nWe decided check out Jackson\u2019s statement. It required two determinations: 1) Does Galveston have a private retirement plan in lieu of Social Security taxes and; 2) If so, how does the system build wealth?\n\nThe Galveston Plan\n\nGreg Aldridge, a spokesman for Jackson\u2019s campaign, pointed us to a number of news stories about Galveston\u2019s alternative to Social Security. The plan has been considered as a potential model for changing the federal entitlement.\n\nThe program is an oddity in American retirement-security policy. In 1981, municipal employees of three adjoining Texas counties -- Galveston, Matagorda and Brazoria -- voted to withdraw from Social Security and initiate a system of individual accounts to provide retirement, survivor and disability benefits.\n\nIn 1983, the federal government barred any more such moves by local governments. Today, there are about 10 million Americans in the workforce who do not contribute and will not benefit from Social Security. Most of them are employees of school districts and higher education institutions that opted out before the ban.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Galveston plan works: Instead of paying into Social Security, county government workers contribute a similar amount to their investment accounts. The General Accounting Office wrote in 1999 that the plan made \"very conservative\" investments in bonds and preferred stocks.\n\nThe investments are made through fixed annuity contracts with private firms that guarantee minimum annual rates of return. While each worker is assigned an individual account, the employee does not control all investment decisions.\n\nThe interest earned on investments is deposited in each worker\u2019s account. Employees can put extra money beyond the required amount into their accounts.\n\nThe required retirement contribution is 9.7 percent of gross pay -- of which 6.1 percent is paid by the employees and 3.6 percent by the county.\n\nSocial Security traditionally collects 12.4 percent in payroll tax on up to $106,800 in total salary, with workers and employers evenly splitting the levy. But under President Barack Obama\u2019s FICA tax cut over the last two years, the federal government has collected only 10.4 percent -- of which 4.2 percent is paid by the worker. Social Security invests the contributions in government securities.\n\nWhen the Texas county employees retire, they may choose to take the entire account\u2019s earnings in lump sum, take monthly payments for a specified number of years, or accept smaller monthly payments in a lifetime annuity. The Galveston plan does not offer cost-of-living increases to those receiving monthly checks.\n\nSocial Security provides a lifetime annuity with annual cost-of-living adjustments. And, unlike the Galveston system, it also provides increased payment to beneficiaries with spouses and dependents.\n\nDoes it build wealth?\n\nJackson supports a Republican proposal that would create individual Social Security accounts and phase in investment options. \u00a0He says on his website that the proposal would \"allow participants to obtain better returns on the market\" than they do under the current system.\n\nBut Jackson, while extolling the Galveston plan during the debate, did not claim that it was outperforming Social Security. Aldridge said that Jackson, in saying the program was \"building wealth,\" simply meant that individuals have ownership and some control over their retirement account.\n\nGalveston plan designer Rick Gornto, who is president of First Financial Benefits Inc., claimed that as the major advantage to the plan.\n\n\"The key thing is you don\u2019t have ownership in Social Security or a right to that except the right that they decide to give you, which can change,\" he said.\n\nGornto could not provide an average annual return for plan investors because each chooses a mix of mutual funds to go along with the more stable bond investments in the fund. But, he said, retirement funds must, by contract, increase annually by at least 3.75 percent or 4 percent. During good times, Gornto said employees have seen annual returns of 10 percent or better.\n\nDoes the Galveston plan outperform Social Security? The most recent studies of this question are 13 years old and provided a complicated answer.\n\nThe GAO and the Social Security Administration each analyzed the Galveston plan in 1999. They generally agreed that the higher an employee\u2019s salary, the more he or she would benefit from the counties\u2019 system. But middle- and low-income earners would likely collect less from Galveston plan than they would from Social Security.\n\nWe spoke to Eric Kingson, professor at Syracuse University\u2019s School of Social Work and co-chairman of Strengthen Social Security, a group that wants to maintain benefits from the federal entitlement. \u00a0He said the Galveston program is a \"savings plan, not a retirement insurance plan\" that best serves a small group of workers.\n\n\"The only people who might do better are single persons who have higher incomes,\" he said. \"Particularly for low and moderate income persons, they are not better off. If you are not married, not going to drop dead early, not leave widows or survivors and don\u2019t want automatic life insurance for children, then it could be better.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nJackson is correct that Galveston, Texas, has a privately run retirement plan in lieu of Social Security. The program benefits municipal workers in Galveston County and two neighboring counties.\n\nIt\u2019s debatable whether the Galveston plan, overall, offers workers a superior financial alternative to Social Security; in some cases it does, in others it doesn\u2019t. But, as Jackson said, the plan \u00a0does build wealth because it allows workers to create individual retirement accounts that are guaranteed to earn interest each year. The employees have some control over their accounts and can leave them to their survivors. \u00a0\n\nSo we rate Jackson\u2019s claim True.", "E.W.
