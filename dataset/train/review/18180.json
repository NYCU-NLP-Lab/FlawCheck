Indeed, he continuously undermined and humiliated the scientific community,\u201d one user said.", "The confusion over the company\u2019s participation in Warp Speed likely stemmed from Pfizer senior vice president Kathrin Jansen\u2019s misleading statement quoted in The New York Times: \u201cWe were never part of the Warp Speed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have never taken any money from the US government, or from anyone.\u201d", "Another spokesperson later clarified, as did the Times, that the company is involved in Operation Warp Speed \u201cas a supplier of a potential coronavirus vaccine.\u201d", "Coronavirus cases are surging across the United States and Europe, with governments forced to take more drastic action despite economic crises.", "The pandemic and vaccines were major issues in the November 3 presidential election.
