No. There's no public record of Janet Reno having declared anything like this. Moreover, Reno was suffering from late-stage Parkinson's disease during the final years of her life and had difficulty speaking at all. When the New York Times attempted to interview her in the summer of 2016 (after Donald Trump had become the GOP nominee), they were unable to do so, even with the help of Reno's sister.", "We can safely assume that Reno, a lifelong Democrat, did not support Donald Trump for president, but there's no evidence she ever expressed the sentiment that he would not be elected during her lifetime. Like similar claims that conservative gadfly Phyllis Schlafly, who died in September 2016, said \"There will be a woman president over my dead body,\" it's just an attempt at ironic humor at the expense of the recently deceased.", "Garateix, Marilyn and Frances Robles. \u00a0\"Janet Reno Refused to Let Parkinson's Define Her.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 7 November 2016.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
