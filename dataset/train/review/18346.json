What does this say about them? They\u2019re DemocRATS.\"", "Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news. We found that video of Trump\u2019s speech showed a bipartisan chamber stood up and applauded the victims\u2019 parents.", "Trump invited the parents of Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens, two teenage girls from Long Island, to listen to his speech. The girls were murdered in September 2016 while walking together in their hometown.

They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.\"", "But then when Trump spoke to the girls\u2019 parents, the chamber sounded silent.", "Speaking to the girls\u2019 parents, Trump said: \"Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand,\" he said, as the parents then stood. \"Thank you very much. I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you.\"", "The videos show that members stood up and applauded the girls\u2019 parents.", "Some Democrats did boo and hiss a separate part of Trump\u2019s speech about immigration when he called for an end to \"chain migration.\"", "\"Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives,\" Trump said.", "Many Democrats brought to the speech as their guests Dreamers, people brought to the U.S. illegally as children.
