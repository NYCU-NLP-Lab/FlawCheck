["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on March 8, 2019", "President Donald Trump tweeted that the U.S. is \u201con track to APPREHEND more than one million people coming across the Southern Border this year.\u201d That\u2019s not the case, based on the\u00a0number of apprehensions so far this fiscal or calendar year.", "Through the first five months of fiscal year 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports there have been 268,044 apprehensions \u2013 a monthly average of 53,609, which would put the U.S. on track for 643,306 this fiscal year.", "CBP tracks apprehensions by fiscal year, and 643,306 would be 62 percent higher than last fiscal year and the highest total since fiscal year 2008 \u2014 as the chart below illustrates. But it is far short of the \u201cmore than one million people\u201d that Trump claimed. The last time the U.S. topped 1 million apprehensions was in fiscal year 2006, when\u00a01,071,972 people were captured crossing the border illegally.", "As for the 2019 calendar year, there have been\u00a0114,436 apprehensions in the first two months of this year. That\u2019s an average of 57,218 per month, or 686,616 a year.", "There was a significant increase in apprehensions last month, when\u00a066,450 people were caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. That was the highest single month since March 2009, when\u00a067,342 people were captured. (There were a total of\u00a0540,865 apprehensions in fiscal year 2009.)", "Even if apprehensions remained at that higher level for the last seven months of the fiscal year, there would still be far fewer than 1 million border apprehensions in fiscal 2019.", "We asked the White House how the president arrived at his 1 million figure, but we didn\u2019t get a response.", "However, Department of Homeland Security Secretary\u00a0Kirstjen M. Nielsen said at a March 6 congressional hearing that CBP saw its \u201cagents apprehending or encountering nearly 75,000 aliens\u201d in February.", "Notice that Nielsen used the word \u201cencountering.\u201d That\u2019s because her number includes apprehensions and so-called \u201cinadmissibles,\u201d which are \u201cindividuals encountered at ports of entry who are seeking lawful admission into the United States but are determined to be inadmissible,\u201d as CBP explains on its website. In other words, Nielsen is counting those trying to enter the U.S. legally and illegally.\u00a0There were\u00a066,450 apprehensions and\u00a09,653 inadmissibles in February for a total of 76,103 \u201cencounters,\u201d as Nielsen called them.", "At the hearing, Nielsen went on to say that \u201cCBP is forecasting the problem will get even worse this spring, as the weather warms up,\u201d and \u201cat the current pace, we are on track to encounter close to 1 million illegal aliens at our southern border this year.\u201d", "When Nielsen said \u201cthis year,\u201d she was referring to calendar year 2019, not the fiscal year, a department spokesperson told us. The secretary gets to \u201cclose to 1 million\u201d based on \u201cthe rough estimate of 2,700 people encountered per day in February,\u201d the spokesperson said.", "But Nielsen is talking about apprehensions and inadmissibles, not just apprehensions \u2014 contrary to what the president tweeted in capital letters on March 7:", "We are on track to APPREHEND more than one million people coming across the Southern Border this year. Great job by Border Patrol (and others) who are working in a Broken System. Can be fixed by Congress so easily and quickly if only the Democrats would get on board!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2019", "We can\u2019t predict the future, but the apprehensions data collected so far show the U.S. is not \u201con track\u201d to exceed 1 million apprehensions this fiscal year or even this calendar year.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
