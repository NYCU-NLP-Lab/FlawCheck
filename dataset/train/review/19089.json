Its woes have been used as a cudgel against some American politicians like U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), who bill themselves as democratic socialists.\nThe Trump administration had made a priority of ousting Venezuela's socialist President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro (whom Trump has referred to as a \"Cuban puppet\"), recognizing instead his political opponent Juan Guaid\u00f3 as president. Despite that rhetoric, Maduro has remained in office.", "Venezuela is suffering extreme economic instability \u2014 about 90 percent of the population lives in poverty, according to a UN report cited by American Public Media's \"Marketplace,\" and Reuters reported that some Venezuelans have been reduced to scavenging for edible food in garbage bins.", "Because of this, the South American country has been the focus of ideologues campaigning against socialism as an economic model.
