The finance department data, accessed by TOI, reveals that the state\u2019s GSDP in the 2020-2021 financial year has crossed Rs 19.48 lakh crore, equivalent to $268 billion, and UP has climbed to the second spot from number five in 2019-2020.\u201d The same was reported by The New Indian Express and Swarajya.", "TOI also stated, \u201cMaharashtra continues to lead from the top position while UP moved up three ranks past Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka\u2026 Tamil Nadu was second and Gujarat third last fiscal [2019-20] while Karnataka was at the fourth slot.\u201d", "TOI\u2019s report was shared by OpIndia columnist @AbhishBanerj, Prayagraj MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi, BJP supporter Shehzad Poonawala, Swarajya columnist Aashish Chandorkar, and Ashwini Mahajan national co-convener of RRS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagaran Manch.", "This slideshow requires JavaScript.", "CM Adityanath\u2019s tweet and media reports give the impression that Uttar Pradesh (UP) attaining the second-highest Gross State Domestic Product is a new achievement.

This data was also published by the Reserve Bank of India (RB) in October 2020 and Economic Survey 2020-21.", "As per MOSPI, the latest GSDP data available is for the financial year 2019-20.

Therefore, The Times of India\u2019s claim that UP\u2019s GSDP rank fell to fifth in FY 2019-20 and is back to the second cannot be ascertained based on the lastest available data in the public domain. Alt News spoke to journalists who reported on the matter. They said that FY 2020-21 data was presented by the UP finance department. Alt News has reached out to the state government and will update the article if we are able to access the data.", "However, what can be ascertained is the fact-check that UP\u2019s GSDP was second or third highest between the financial years 2004-05 and 2018-19.", "As per MOSPI data, UP had the second-highest GSDP from the financial year (FY) 2004-05 to 2013-14. In the FY 2014-15, UP\u2019s GSDP was third-highest just behind Tamil Nadu. Maharashtra had the highest GSDP between 2004 and 2015. MOSPI set FY 2004-05 as the base year.

Barring FY 2019-20, where the GSDP data is missing for several states, and FY 2020-21 which isn\u2019t in the public domain yet, UP\u2019s GSDP has always been higher than that of Gujarat and Karnataka.
