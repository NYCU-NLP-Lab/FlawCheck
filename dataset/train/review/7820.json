["\u201cTrudeau laughs with reporters over $600 million media bribe,\u201d says the caption of a video viewed more than 210,000 times on Facebook. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what Justin Trudeau was just caught admitting on camera,\u201d adds Canada Proud, one partisan Facebook page that also\u00a0shared the video on Twitter.", "The video was also shared more than 12,000 times from this page which says it is not directly affiliated with Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer\u2019s campaign despite it\u2019s appearance.", "The video is real, but it is only a short snippet of the May 2019 Parliamentary Press Gallery Dinner, a yearly Canadian tradition during which accredited parliament journalists bring politicians, MPs, and diplomats as their dates for an evening usually punctuated by jokes and jabs between journalists and politicians.", "It was in that context that Trudeau jokingly referred to his government\u2019s promise to grant Cad$595 million in subsidies to various Canadian media organizations. Critics have called the plan\u00a0a media buyout from the Liberals, so the prime minister jokingly pointed out that the reason media was so kind to him was because he paid them.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t get stellar headlines like these, without greasing the wheels a bit,\u201d he said as headlines from major Canadian media criticizing Trudeau appeared on a screen next to him. They\u00a0included,\u00a0\u201cJustin Trudeau is tampering with Canada\u2019s brand\u201d and \u201cTrudeau has lost the moral mandate to govern.\u201d", "This latter part of the joke was not included in the video shared by Conservative leaning groups, thus giving the video the appearance of an admittance from the prime minister.", "A video of the entire Parliamentary Press Gallery Dinner is available from several sources online, and although it is a private event, what happens inside is not kept secret. Watching the speech in full makes it clear that Trudeau was not \u201ccaught admitting\u201d a secret plan to buy Canadian media.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
