(AP/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)", "At a rally in Wheeling, W.Va, President Donald Trump touted record-low poverty rates for minorities in the United States.", "\"The poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans -- it\u2019s been incredible, they\u2019ve all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country,\" he said at the rally on Sept. 29, 2018.", "Is this correct? Yes, at least as far back as poverty data has been calculated.", "First, a refresher on how poverty is calculated.", "The Census Bureau \"uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. If a family's total income is less than the family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty.\"", "While the official poverty line is the same regardless of geography, they are updated yearly for inflation. Non-cash benefits, such as public housing, Medicaid, or food stamps, are not factored into the calculation.", "We looked at Census Bureau data for the poverty status by race and Hispanic origin from 1966 to 2017.

Hispanic poverty peaked at 30.7 percent in 1994.", "While Trump didn\u2019t directly take credit for the decline in his Wheeling remarks, it\u2019s worth noting that the poverty rate had fallen for several years running under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. So the pattern stems from the generally improving economy under both presidents.", "Trump said, \"The poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans -- it\u2019s been incredible, they\u2019ve all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country.\"", "He\u2019s right that poverty rates hit their historical lows in 2017 since the statistic was first calculated consistently in 1966.
