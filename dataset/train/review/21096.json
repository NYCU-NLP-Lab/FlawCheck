The story was authored by former deputy editor at India Today Uday Mahurkar who was recently appointed as information commissioner by the Government of India (GOI). Mahurkar wrote how the prime minister\u2019s family comes from a humble background that has largely remained unchanged despite PM Modi\u2019s rise to power. The article elaborates how PM Modi has kept his personal and political life distant.

Moreover, their early occupations are also identical.", "CLAIM 1: Somabhai Modi is chairman of the recruitment board in Gujarat", "FACT-CHECK: Somabhai Modi is PM Modi\u2019s eldest brother. A cursory look at the claim that he is \u201cchairman of the recruitment board in Gujarat\u201d itself suggests it cannot be true. The message merely says \u201crecruitment board\u201d without stating which one. Any state government would have separate recruitment boards for different departments. There cannot be just one board in-charge of all. An advanced Google search in both English and Gujarati across Gujarat government websites shows that the principal recruitment boards are in the railway, police (lokrakshak) and education departments.", "The top officials in these recruitment boards can be found on their respective sites. However, since the claim doesn\u2019t specify which board we performed multiple advance search (restricting the results to government sites) on Google with different combinations in which Somabhai Modi\u2019s name can be written in English.

Alt News mapped the number of Hyundai, Maruti and Honda showrooms in Ahmedabad and Vadodara.

Reliance Mall is a sub-brand of Reliance Retail.

However, we did find one Agiyaras Mata Temple in the Chanakyapuri locality of Ahmedabad which has no petrol pump by that name within a five-kilometre radius of the temple. In the likelihood that the petrol pump has not been listed on Google Maps, lack of media reports also suggests that the claim is false.

For instance, the claim that Ramesh Modi \u201cowns five schools\u201d is extremely generic \u2014 neither the names of the schools are given nor their location. There are thousands of schools in the country thus, making the claim impossible to be fact-checked unless Ramesh Modi himself produces evidence contracting the message. But assuming that the claim is false, how does one produce evidence of something that doesn\u2019t exist? This is a classic example where a lie so enormous is manufactured that people believe that at least some portions of it may be true. Certain facts published in the past (names of the family members and their approximate ages) have been presented with false claims to make the message look authentic. This is a common method applied by both sides of the political spectrum to inject credence into rumours and hope that personal biases lead to belief.", "Full text of the viral message:", "1.
