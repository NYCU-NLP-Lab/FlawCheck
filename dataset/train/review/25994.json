["Since the U.S. trial\u00a0of Mexican drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n \u2014 who\u00a0was first imprisoned in 1993 and gained international notoriety\u00a0for his escapefrom a maximum-security prison through a mile-long tunnel \u2014 a\u00a0litany of social media posts have popularized claims about Guzman's relationship with U.S. politicians.", "Days before his\u00a0trial ended on Feb. 12, 2019, Snopes reported on a post claiming El Chapo testified he had given millions of dollars to\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.,\u00a0and former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\u00a0The post accrued nearly 30,000 shares.", "In October 2019, another theory cropped up stating that\u00a0former FBI Director James Comey laundered $150 million of Guzm\u00e1n's \"cartel money\" for Pelosi. Other theories that have gained traction include a conspiracy among Guzm\u00e1n, Pelosi, and \u00a0Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.\u00a0All of these claims are false.", "Facebook users have recently resurrected this category of theories, however,\u00a0in relation to Pelosi. A claim is circulating that during his testimony in U.S. court, Guzm\u00e1n said he bribed Pelosi in exchange for an \"open border\" \u2013\u00a0likely referring to\u00a0Pelosi's\u00a0opposition to \u00a0the construction of a fortified wall on the southern border of the U.S.", "At least two viral posts made the claim, including one posted by user Michael Casey on March 4, shared upward of 3,400 times, and one posted on March 7 and since deleted.", "\u201cEl Chappo (sic) testifies in U.S. court he paid off Nancy Pelosi to keep the Mexican/U.S. border open for drug cartels! Impeach Pelosi!\u201d the post reads.", "USA TODAY reached out to both users for comment. Casey said he first shared the post several years ago, after seeing it on the timeline of a friend. \"I shared it years ago, with no warnings on it when I first shared it,\" he said.", "The viral claims about El Chapo's testimony are\u00a0impossible because\u00a0Guzm\u00e1n never testified in his U.S. trial.\u00a0In addition to USA TODAY, many outlets reported that his defense decided to rest\u00a0without testimony from Guzm\u00e1n, including Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, and The Associated Press.", "In an email to USA TODAY, Guzm\u00e1n's defense lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman\u00a0wrote, \"He has not made any public comment about this issue or any other issue. About anything. Any suggestion otherwise is false.\"", "A\u00a0PDF\u00a0transcript\u00a0from the court reporter of El Chapo's\u00a030-minute defense along\u00a0with his final remarks,\u00a0during which he decried his treatment in\u00a0the U.S. prison, shows he never mentioned Pelosi.\u00a0The Justice Department\u2019s press release stating findings from the trial doesn't mention\u00a0Pelosi or any other U.S. political figure.", "More:Feds rest case against Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n; accused drug lord won't testify in his own defense", "The\u00a0suggestion within the claim that El Chapo gave money to Pelosi is also baseless. No evidence for this claim was provided by the poster of the claim; in addition,\u00a0Snopes tracked down the\u00a0user who\u00a0most likely originated\u00a0the viral claim from July 2019 that El Chapo bribed Schiff, Pelosi and Clinton and found that he could not provide any evidence for his claim, either.", "\"This is obviously false,\"\u00a0Drew Hammill,\u00a0Pelosi\u2019s spokesman and deputy chief of staff, wrote to USA TODAY in an email.", "Along with\u00a0declining to testify, Guzm\u00e1n remained almost entirely silent during his\u00a0trial, which began on Nov. 5, 2018, after a yearlong effort on the part of the Mexican government to extradite him\u00a0and nearly two more years spent in the U.S.\u00a0awaiting the trial. On Feb. 12, 2019, the jury found him guilty on all counts.", "That same day, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas,\u00a0introduced a bill stating that any illegal profits forfeited to the U.S. government as a result of El Chapo's\u00a0trial would be put toward the construction of a southern border wall.\u00a0Cruz's bill did not pass.", "More:Ted Cruz says billions in assets tied to 'El Chapo' should fund the border wall", "U.S. District Court Judge Brian Cogan sentenced El Chapo to life in prison plus 30 years and ordered him to forfeit $12.6 billion on July 17, 2019.", "We rate the claim that\u00a0Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n\u00a0testified that he bribed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to maintain an open U.S.-Mexico border\u00a0FALSE, based on our research.
