["About this rating", "On 12 November 2016, the Tribunist web site reported that Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer\u00a0(who is also\u00a0the son-in-law of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin) had been invited to the Marine Corps' 241st birthday celebration at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, but his invitation was\u00a0revoked by the Obama administration (or, at least, by a U.S. ambassador) at the last minute for political reasons:", "As arrangements were being finalized, however, the Medal of Honor recipient was told that he would not be able to come. Why? Because Meyer has been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration.", "Ambassador P. Michael McKinley ordered his chief of mission to \u201clook into\u201d the Medal of Honor recipient and, based on the report he was given about Meyer\u2019s political views, decided he would not allow Meyer to attend the ball inside the embassy.", "Meyer told us in a phone interview that \u201cI was told he doesn\u2019t like my position and comments on the administration, but those views are my right.\u00a0Blocking access to the American embassy is his right as the ambassador.\u201d", "Meyer, who was awarded\u00a0the Medal of Honor for saving the lives of dozens of ambushed U.S. and Afghan soldiers\u00a0in Kunar Province in 2009, was honorably discharged from the Marines\u00a0in 2010. He\u00a0co-wrote a book about his combat experiences,\u00a0Into the Fire: A Firsthand Account of the Most Extraordinary Battle in the Afghan War, in 2012, and currently travels doing\u00a0speaking engagements.", "Through\u00a0a spokesperson, Meyer told snopes.com that the Tribunist\u00a0account is accurate, though he would\u00a0not reveal who told him\u00a0that the decision against his attendance\u00a0was based on political considerations to prevent\u00a0retaliation against them.", "An official at the U.S. State Dept. gave us\u00a0a different explanation, however, stating \u00a0that the decision was taken\u00a0for safety\u00a0reasons. Embassy security officers felt that such a high-profile visitor would have put everyone in attendance\u00a0at higher risk of\u00a0attack (and, in fact, the Embassy was shut down a few days later\u00a0after a suicide bomb attack on Bagram Airfield). The same official told snopes.com that the U.S. Mission in Kabul has the highest respect for Sgt. Meyer and\u00a0would welcome a\u00a0visit from him\u00a0in the future under better security\u00a0conditions.", "Heil, Emily. \u00a0 \"Bristol Palin and Husband Dakota Meyer Shop Around Downtown D.C.\"\r\nThe Washington Post. \u00a0 3 November 2016.", "Solis, Steph.\u00a0\u00a0 \"U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan Closed After Suicide Bombing on Military Base.\"\r\nUSA Today.\u00a0\u00a0 13 November 2016.", "Congressional Medal of Honor Society.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Meyer, Dakota.\"\r\n2017.", "Tribunist. \u00a0 \"Obama Administration Tells Medal of Honor Recipient He Cannot Attend Marine Corps Ball.\"\r\n12 November 2016.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
