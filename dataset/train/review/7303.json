["About this rating", "Signs warning drivers about distracted walkers were spotted in Sweden at the end of 2015.", "These signs were installed by the Swedish government.", "A photograph purportedly showing a street sign in Sweden warning drivers about oblivious pedestrians watching their phones instead of traffic started spreading around the internet in February 2016.
