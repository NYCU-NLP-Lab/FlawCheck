["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on October 25, 2016", "In a TV ad, Donald Trump falsely claims that Hillary Clinton \u201chanded over American uranium rights to the Russians\u201d as part of a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d scheme to get \u201cfilthy rich.\u201d Clinton did not have the authority to unilaterally approve that deal.", "As secretary of state, Clinton was one of nine voting members of the foreign investment committee in 2010 that\u00a0approved the uranium deal, which was then approved by the president and passed through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.", "The ad, titled \u201cCorruption,\u201d has aired on national cable and in 12 states this month, most heavily in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. The ad makes several shaky claims as it tries to link the income Bill and Hillary Clinton have earned\u00a0since leaving political office with donations to the Clinton Foundation.", "\u201cThe Clintons: from dead broke to worth hundreds of millions. So how did Hillary end up filthy rich?\u201d the ad asks. \u201cPay to play politics. Staggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America.\u201d", "But the Clintons didn\u2019t pocket money that was donated to the nonprofit Clinton Foundation, set up by Bill Clinton after his time as president. Instead, they made their money outside of office by giving speeches and writing books, as the Fortune.com article the ad cites explains. That article doesn\u2019t say anything about the foundation and puts the Clintons\u2019 estimated net worth at $110 million (which isn\u2019t \u201chundreds of millions,\u201d the claim in the ad).", "The foundation, which says it has more than 330,000 contributors, has been criticized for accepting foreign donations while Clinton was secretary of state, including from Algeria, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman, and for accepting Saudi Arabia\u2019s money before and after her tenure. As the Washington Post noted, some of those countries have \u201ccomplicated diplomatic, military and financial relationships with the U.S. government.\u201d But it\u2019s a stretch to classify them as \u201ccountries that hate America.\u201d", "There are other examples of the citations in the ad not quite supporting the claims, but the most egregious is the uranium example. So we\u2019ll start there.", "The ad claims that Hillary Clinton \u201ceven handed over American uranium rights to the Russians,\u201d citing an April 2015 New York Times story. But the story doesn\u2019t say that. And the idea that Clinton could have \u201chanded over\u201d uranium rights, even if she wanted to, isn\u2019t supported by the facts.", "Clinton\u2019s role, and the link to the Clinton Foundation, first became an issue a year and a half ago, when news organizations received advance copies of the book \u201cClinton Cash:\u00a0The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,\u201d by Peter\u00a0Schweizer, a former fellow at a conservative think tank. On April 23, 2015, the New York Times wrote about the uranium issue, saying the paper\u00a0had \u201cbuilt upon\u201d Schweizer\u2019s\u00a0information.", "The story doesn\u2019t find evidence of a pay-to-play scandal or say that Clinton was responsible for the uranium deal. The Times\u00a0details how the Clinton Foundation had received millions in donations from investors in Uranium One, a Canadian-based company that sold a\u00a0controlling stake in 2010 to\u00a0Rosatom, the Russian nuclear energy agency, in a deal that had to be approved by the U.S. government. Uranium One had mining stakes in the Western United States, amounting to one-fifth of the uranium production capacity in the U.S., the Times reported.", "The donations from those with ties to Uranium One weren\u2019t publicly disclosed by the Clinton Foundation, even though then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had an agreement with the White House that the foundation would disclose all contributors. Days after the Times story, the foundation acknowledged that it \u201cmade mistakes,\u201d saying it had disclosed donations from a Canadian charity, for instance, but not the donors to that charity who were associated with the uranium company.", "The Times wrote that\u00a0the circumstances raised \u201cethical challenges\u201d:", "New York Times, April 23, 2015:\u00a0Whether the donations played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown. But the episode underscores the special ethical challenges presented by the Clinton Foundation, headed by a former president who relied heavily on foreign cash to accumulate $250 million in assets even as his wife helped steer American foreign policy as secretary of state, presiding over decisions with the potential to benefit the foundation\u2019s donors.", "A few days after the Times story, Schweizer made the false claim on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Clinton, as secretary of state,\u00a0had \u201cveto power\u201d and \u201ccould have stopped\u201d\u00a0the sale. We found that only the president had that power.", "As we explained in our story at the time, Clinton was one of nine government officials to make up the\u00a0Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, which is required by law to investigate all U.S. transactions that involve a company owned or controlled by a foreign government. Committee members include the secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce and Energy, the attorney general, and representatives from two White House offices \u2014 the United States Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy.", "The committee can\u2019t actually stop a sale from going through \u2014 it can only approve a sale. The president is the only one who can stop a sale, if the committee or any one member \u201crecommends suspension or prohibition of the transaction,\u201d according to guidelines issued by the Treasury Department in December 2008 after the department adopted its final rule a month earlier.", "So, Clinton could have objected \u2014 as could the eight other voting members \u2014 but that objection alone wouldn\u2019t have stopped the sale of the stake of Uranium One to Rosatom.\u00a0\u201cOnly the President has the authority to suspend or prohibit a covered transaction,\u201d the federal guidelines say.", "And the president would need to have\u00a0\u201ccredible evidence,\u201d the guidelines say, that the \u201cforeign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair the national security.\u201d In 2010, when the deal was finalized, \u201cthe geopolitical backdrop was far different from today\u2019s,\u201d the Times notes, as the U.S. wanted to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia.", "We don\u2019t know much about the approval of\u00a0the deal from the Committee on Foreign Investments, which goes by the acronym CFIUS. There are \u201cstrong confidentiality requirements\u201d prohibiting disclosure of information filed with the committee, and it doesn\u2019t disclose the results of its review, the Treasury Department says on its website. But we should have known if even one of the voting members objected to the Uranium One deal.\u00a0\u201cWhen a transaction is referred to the President, however, the decision of the President is announced publicly,\u201d Treasury says.", "It\u2019s unclear whether Clinton herself was involved in the CFIUS approval.\u00a0According to the Times, Jose Fernandez, a former assistant secretary of state, represented the department on the committee. He told the Times: \u201cMrs. Clinton never intervened with me on any C.F.I.U.S. matter.\u201d", "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also had to approve \u2014 and did \u2014 the transfer of two uranium recovery licenses in Wyoming\u00a0from Uranium One to the Russian company.", "As the Times\u00a0wrote, there are certainly ethical considerations when a former president is accepting foundation\u00a0donations from people who have a stake in a business deal and his spouse sits on a committee that approves such deals. But Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t responsible for \u201chand[ing] over American uranium rights to the Russians,\u201d as the Trump ad claims. The Uranium One deal passed muster with nine members of the foreign investments committee, the president and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.", "The Trump ad makes other weak claims in an attempt to support its \u201cpay-to-play\u201d theme.", "It says Clinton \u201ccut deals for donors,\u201d citing a Wall Street Journal article on Clinton, who, in 2009, worked on an agreement for the Swiss-based UBS, which was facing an IRS lawsuit to get the identities of Americans with secret bank accounts.", "The Journal reported in the July 31, 2015, story that Clinton \u201cwas summoned to Geneva by her Swiss counterpart\u201d to discuss the case, which, if it proceeded, would leave UBS to either \u201c[v]iolate Swiss secrecy laws by handing over the names, or refuse and face criminal charges in U.S. federal court.\u201d", "Clinton, who wanted to discuss other diplomatic matters, including a Swiss energy company\u2019s alleged involvement in providing nuclear technology to Iran, worked out a tentative deal for UBS with the Swiss foreign minister. The company ended up settling with the Justice Department and gave\u00a0information on about 4,450 accounts out of 52,000 total.", "What\u2019s the connection to the Clinton Foundation? The Journal reported that UBS donations to the foundation grew \u2013 from $60,000 through 2008, before the settlement, to $600,000 through end of 2014. UBS denied any connection between the donations and the IRS case. UBS also paid Bill Clinton $1.5 million for a series of panel discussions, held along with former President George W. Bush, in cities across the United States. The Journal reported that spokesmen for Bush and UBS wouldn\u2019t say how much Bush received.", "\u201cThere is no evidence of any link between Mrs.\u00a0Clinton\u2019s involvement in the case and the bank\u2019s donations to the\u00a0Bill, Hillary and Chelsea\u00a0Clinton Foundation, or its hiring of Mr.\u00a0Clinton,\u201d the Journal wrote. But the connections raise questions.", "Stu Gibson, a lawyer for the Justice Department on the UBS case, told the Journal: \u201cIt raises questions that need to be addressed, or should be addressed. \u2026 \u00a0Maybe there\u2019s nothing to it. Maybe there is something to it.\u201d", "We asked the Trump campaign if it had any other evidence that Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, \u201ccut deals for [foundation] donors,\u201d and we haven\u2019t received a response.", "The ad cites even thinner evidence for its claim that Clinton \u201csold out American workers.\u201d The citation is for a May 2015\u00a0CBS News article\u00a0on Clinton earning millions\u00a0for her paid speeches, after she left office, including at least 10 to groups that have lobbied on trade issues.", "We\u2019re not sure how giving a speech to groups concerned about trade amounts to selling out American workers, particularly when \u201cthese companies have lobbied on a variety of issues,\u201d as the CBS article says. The list of companies to which Clinton gave speeches includes General Electric, Xerox, eBay, Corning Inc., technology companies and the Institute of Scrap Recycling.", "Finally, the ad claims Clinton \u201cexploited Haitians in need,\u201d citing a National Review article, which is an excerpt of a book by Dinesh D\u2019Souza called \u201cHillary\u2019s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party.\u201d The excerpt cites several examples of Clinton Foundation-backed Haiti projects, after the 2010 earthquake in the country, that didn\u2019t live up to expectations. Some involved the hiring of companies owned by foundation donors.", "D\u2019Souza concludes: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say the Clintons don\u2019t care about Haiti. Yet it seems clear that Haitian welfare is not their priority. Their priority is, well, themselves. The Clintons seem to believe in Haitian reconstruction and Haitian investment as long as these projects match their own private economic interests.\u201d", "Bill Clinton was deeply involved in Haiti relief efforts. He served as the United Nations special envoy to Haiti when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, and, after the earthquake, teamed up with\u00a0former President George H.W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. He was also co-chairman with then-Haiti Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. The Clinton Foundation says it\u00a0has raised more than $30 million for the country since 2010.", "The verdict on the results of those aid efforts has been mixed. In January, a group of Haitians protested outside the Clinton Foundation offices in New York, saying Haiti hadn\u2019t seen any benefit from earthquake aid money.\u00a0The Washington Post reported in March 2015 on both successes of Clinton-backed projects, such as farming and an entrepreneurship center, and failures, such as an industrial park that hasn\u2019t lived up to its billing in terms of job creation.", "It\u2019s difficult to fact-check this claim in the ad. Some Haitians, as evidenced by the record of some projects in Haiti and the January protest, would agree that Clinton-backed relief efforts didn\u2019t do enough to help the poor. Others, particularly those who benefited from successful projects, would disagree. Regardless, is that evidence of a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d scheme?", "Schweizer, the author of \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d devoted a chapter in his book to Haiti, but even he acknowledged that \u201ccorruption of the kind I have described in this book is very difficult to prove.\u201d Indeed, circumstances that raise questions are one thing, an actual quid pro quo is another. And this Trump ad falls far short of proving anything beyond the fact that the Clintons made a lot of money on speaking fees and book contracts after they left office.", "The ad\u2019s support doesn\u2019t back up the claims that Clinton \u201ccut deals for donors\u201d or \u201csold out American workers.\u201d And it\u2019s simply false to claim she \u201chanded over American uranium rights to the Russians.\u201d", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8944351f-9528-42f3-b4f2-4623253d7968", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
