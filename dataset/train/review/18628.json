The United States has a progressive tax system, which means people who earn more pay a higher tax rate. Essentially, the wealthy shoulder a larger part of the tax burden.", "So while the Tax Foundation reports that Americans paid an average of 18.6 percent of their income in federal taxes in 2004, the Center would like you to consider an average taxpayer, someone in the middle fifth of the income distribution. In 2004, that segment of people paid an average of only 13.9 percent of their income in taxes.", "So, the Center would argue, Huckabee's claim that the \"average American\" works until May to pay off his or her taxes is an exaggeration. The \"typical\" American, they say, would pay off taxes much sooner.", "It's overstated every year, the Center says.", "Both sides are right here. The Tax Foundation provides an accurate overall average. And the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities accurately says that figure overstates the impact on an average American.", "Bottom line, it's mostly a debate over the term average.
