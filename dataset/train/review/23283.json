["The claim is based on the now-famous\u00a0\"distracted boyfriend\"\u00a0meme, which surfaced in 2017 and has become a frequent template for jokes. It \u00a0shows a man pursing his lips at a passing woman\u00a0while his companion, presumably his girlfriend, looks at him in disgust. The original picture comes from a stockphoto site.", "The misleading post, shared more than 1,400 times here on Facebook, features a picture of three people recreating the \"distracted boyfriend\" scene.", "It claims those in the image are\u00a0\u201cthe actual people from that meme, 10 years later!\u201d", "The Facebook claim originated here on Twitter, where it has been retweeted more than 250,000 times since it was posted on March 13, 2021. Other Facebook pages have shared it here, here and here.", "AFP Fact Check studied digital time stamps and used a reverse image search to find the source of the original picture.", "We discovered it was uploaded by Antonio Guillem to iStock by Getty Images on November 2, 2015, with the description \u201cdisloyal man walking with his girlfriend and looking amazed at another seductive girl\u201d.", "A further search for more information on Guillem led to this Wired.com interview where he confirmed his now-famous picture was taken in 2015 \u2013 not 10 years ago, as claimed.", "This reply to the viral tweet\u00a0disputed\u00a0the claim with\u00a0a link to a Reddit page where a user by the name of Charlie Todd confirmed three years ago that he was the man in the copycat photo. He said it had been\u00a0shot at a \u201cKnow Your Meme\u201d party at the Museum of the Moving Image in NYC (New York City).", "\u201cThey had a gallery of memes hanging on the wall,\u201d Todd wrote. \u201cI noticed my wife was wearing a red dress so I suggested she pose in front of the girl in the photo. While I was taking her picture someone came up to me and asked if I wanted to be in it, so I hopped in. Then the girl in blue walked up and said, \u2018Hey! Let me be the other girl!\u2019 The whole thing was spontaneous and random.\u201d", "Todd\u2019s story was corroborated by the host of the exhibition at the New York museum. In 2018, KnowYourMeme hosted a \u201dTwo Decades Of Memes\u201d event at the museum and inducted 10 memes into an informal Hall Of Fame.", "According to KnowYourMeme, a website which documents internet memes, Todd and his wife Cody Livingston recreated the \u201cDistracted Boyfriend\u201d scene in front of an enlargement of the original picture, while confirming that they were not the same people from the meme.", "The models who play the couple in the original image are identified only by their first names as \u201cLaura and Mario\u201d in an interview by New York Magazine here.
