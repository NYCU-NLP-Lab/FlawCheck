However this one has been going around numerous instagram accounts for a few months now so since it's April fools' day I am going to take the opportunity to give some info on the image. I shot the original photo of Tahitian surfer Manoa Drollet @dmanoa nearly 10 years ago , on July 28 th , 2006 at #teahupoo #tahiti. Manoa was actually nominated for biggest barrel of the year at the XXL awards in 2007 , now the @wsl @wslbigwaveawards Digital graphic artist Julian Herbrig @care4art took the original photo and flipped it. Regular foot Manoa Drollet ends being a goofy foot charging a massive right hander. He then added an aerial drone photo of a Blue whale in the face of the wave. Although we do see many humpback whales cruise by Teahupoo in winter time, I have never witnessed a blue whale in French Polynesia and certainly not trying to drop in at Teahupoo ! Certainly is catchy ! #fake #surfing #whale #bigwaves #ps #tahiti #photoshop #whalebodysurfing", "A post shared by  Tim McKenna Photography (@timmckenna) on Apr 1, 2016 at 10:36am PDT", "In the lengthy caption, McKenna states he captured the photo of surfer Manoa Drollet surfing in 2006, and digital graphic artist Julian Herbrig subsequently edited it to include the image of the whale.", "The caption states: \u201cI shot the original photo of Tahitian surfer Manoa Drollet @dmanoa nearly 10 years ago , on July 28 th , 2006 at #teahupoo #tahiti.\u201d", "\u201cDigital graphic artist Julian Herbrig @care4art took the original photo and flipped it.
