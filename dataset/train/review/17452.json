["Multiple posts, such as this one\u00a0and this one \u2013 both published on February 26, 2019, and each shared around 240 times since \u2013 contain a photo showing people standing beside a highway overpass with a\u00a0banner.", "The text on the banner, translated into English, says in capital letters: \"We are EDSA. United people's action\".", "EDSA refers to the \"People Power\" revolution\u00a0that ended the two-decade rule of Marcos\u00a0on February 25, 1986. Here is a\u00a0Philippine government website about the revolution.", "Below is a screenshot of one of the misleading posts:", "In the doctored image, the first letter of each word on the banner appears in yellow and the rest of each\u00a0word is written in white.", "The letters highlighted in yellow spell\u00a0out the Filipino profanity \"tae\", which means \"shit\"\u00a0in English.", "The post\u2019s caption says in Filipino: \"You're the one who said it yourselves! You even have a banner!!! You even highlighted it!!! EDSA is SHIT!!!!\"", "However the banner did not have the letters 'T', 'A' and 'E' highlighted in yellow. AFP tracked down multiple images of the banner with the same people at the same event in which those letters are not highlighted.", "Those images\u00a0show the event was held on February 23, 2019, and that the banner celebrated the revolution rather than criticised it.", "One of those\u00a0images was shared in this tweet posted on February 23, 2019, by the small political party Kabataan, which represents Filipino youth.", "TAYO ANG EDSA! TAYO ANG PAG-ASA!

WE ARE THE HOPE! FIGHT THE DICTATORSHIP! Different sectors from the ranks of students, workers, peasants and the church came together to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of EDSA People Power 1.\"", "In the photo from\u00a0the Kabataan tweet, the people holding the banner appear in the same location wearing the same clothes. However\u00a0the\u00a0banner text does not include letters in yellow.", "The image in the doctored banner and the one from the Kabataan tweet are shown below:", "The Union of Catholic Asian News, a Catholic news site in the Philippines, also published a similar photo in this\u00a0report dated February 26, 2019.", "That image shows people\u00a0in white religious dress carrying\u00a0a blue banner with white text in front of an overpass.", "\"Priests, nuns and seminarians lead a protest march reminiscent of the 1986 'people power' uprising in Manila on Feb 23,\" the photo\u00a0caption in the article says.", "A search using online tool IntelTechniques\u00a0found\u00a0a third example of the banner's original appearance in\u00a0this video, published February 27, 2019, on\u00a0the Facebook page of Altermidya or The People\u2019s Alternative Media Network.", "The people holding the banner \u2013 with no yellow letters spelling out \"tae\"\u00a0\u2013 appear four seconds into the video, as seen in the screenshot below:", "Comments on the misleading Facebook post, such as the two below, indicate that some people believed the banner really did criticise the 1986 revolution.", "Translated to English, the comment below says: \"It's all written by them\u2026.
