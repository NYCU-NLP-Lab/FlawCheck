The U.S. is the world\u2019s largest combined producer of gas and oil.

Saudi Arabia again ranked third, at 28.7 quadrillion Btu.", "The EIA and other energy experts attribute the growth in U.S. production to a surge in extracting oil and gas from shale by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The process involves using water pressure to fracture rocks and release their natural gas and oil. The U.S. is the world leader in shale gas production.", "Shale production has made the U.S. the \"undisputed global oil and gas leader,\" Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, which advises 30 nations, told a U.S. Senate committee in January 2018.
