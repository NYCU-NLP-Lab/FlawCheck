["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on January 24, 2020", "President Donald Trump, who last year froze hundreds of millions of dollars in security aid for Ukraine, claimed \u201cthey got all\u201d of it \u201clong before schedule.\u201d That\u2019s false.", "The freeze that Trump directed lasted about two months last summer and not all of the money was later disbursed on time. Congress had to grant an extension to ensure the government could spend any federal funds on assistance for Ukraine that had not been contracted out by Sept. 30, which was the original deadline set by Congress.", "In fact, the Los Angeles Times reported in November that the Department of Defense still had not disbursed more than $35 million of its $250 million in security assistance for Ukraine. And, as of December, there were still $20 million in unobligated defense funds for the U.S. ally, the newspaper discovered.", "A Pentagon official told us that, as of Jan. 23, the department had \u201cexecuted 99.8% of the funds\u201d for Ukraine and was \u201cworking to obligate the remainder.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s decision to hold up the funding, and then ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, is one reason a majority of House members voted to impeach Trump in December. The Senate, which will either convict or acquit the president, began its impeachment trial this week.", "When the trial started on Jan. 21, Trump was in Davos, Switzerland for the annual World Economic Forum. A day later, during a press conference with other administration officials, the president made the claim about Ukraine getting its U.S. assistance on time.", "Trump, Jan. 22: Now, here\u2019s the other thing: They [Ukraine] got their money long before schedule. They got all their money. What nobody says \u2014 this is very important to me: Why isn\u2019t Germany paying? Why isn\u2019t UK paying? Why isn\u2019t France paying? Why aren\u2019t the European nations paying? Why is it always the sucker \u2014 United States?", "It\u2019s not true that Germany, France, the United Kingdom and other European nations don\u2019t provide aid to Ukraine. As we have written before, the European Union and European financial institutions have contributed more than $16.4 billion in grants and loans to Ukraine since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and launched a conflict in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.", "And Ukraine did not receive its aid from the U.S. \u201clong before schedule.\u201d", "For fiscal year 2019, Congress authorized $391 million in security assistance, including training, equipment and other support, for Ukraine. Of that amount, $250 million was appropriated to the Defense Department for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, and $141.5 million was allocated to the State Department for the Foreign Military Financing program. The funds were meant to be spent by those departments by Sept. 30, 2019.", "In June, the Defense Department announced its plans to provide the $250 million in security assistance to Ukraine. However, in July, Trump directed the White House Office of Management and Budget to put the aid on hold. He also had OMB block the assistance from the State Department.", "It wasn\u2019t until about two months later, on Sept. 11, when the White House \u2014 under pressure from members of Congress and administration officials \u2014 released the money.", "But because the Defense Department was required to wait another 15 days before it could begin obligating the funds, it wasn\u2019t able to spend all of the money before the end of September, when the federal fiscal year ends.", "Congress had to add a provision to a continuing appropriations bill \u2014 which Trump signed into law on Sept. 27 \u2014 allowing the unspent funds to be used in fiscal year 2020.", "Mark Sandy, the deputy associate director for national security at OMB, testified at his Nov. 16 deposition that approximately $35 million had been left unobligated by the Defense Department. Those funds, he said, \u201cwould have expired\u201d if not for Congress stepping in.", "Then, three days later, the Los Angeles Times reported that those funds still had not been spent, according to Pentagon documents the newspaper reviewed. And the following month, on Dec. 12, the Times reported that about $20 million in aid \u201cstill hasn\u2019t reached Ukraine.\u201d", "That demonstrates all funds did not go out on schedule, as the president said.", "In an email, a Pentagon spokesperson told us that, as of Jan. 23, all but 0.2% of the $250 million in security assistance for Ukraine has been obligated.", "In a Dec. 11 letter to the Government Accountability Office, which later ruled that the aid freeze violated federal law, general counsel for the OMB, Mark Paoletta, said the State Department obligated the $141.5 million for Ukraine before Sept. 30.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
