The World Health Organisation (WHO) states, \u201cCoronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such a MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.\u201d A novel coronavirus (nCoV) and its outbreak COVID-19 has not been previously identified in humans. Its symptoms include fever, tiredness and dry cough. In most severe cases it causes shortness of breath, aches and pains, sore throat or in rare cases \u2013 diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose.", "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. \u201cSometimes coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and make people sick and become a new human coronavirus.

Coronavirus cannot be \u2018cured\u2019 with aspirin, antihistamines and nasal spray.", "When any of the coronaviruses (or rhinoviruses for that matter) cause the common cold, the physicians\u2019 aim is to (a) stop the transmission of the infection to other people and (b) treat the symptoms. This is because the common cold is a self-limited disease \u2013 it cures by itself. It is for this reason, antivirals or antibiotics are not given for a common cold. In the usual clinical picture, it is also not required to find out which organism has caused the common cold since it has no bearing on its treatment. The mainstay of symptomatic treatment for the common cold is anti-inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs (aspirin is one of them), antihistamines, anticholinergic drugs and decongestants (which can be given as nasal spray). All of these can be bought at pharmaceutical stores without a doctor\u2019s prescription.", "However, when coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cause severe disease with manifestations like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, the treatment involves intensive care and not over-the-counter medications.", "Therefore, it is inappropriate to extrapolate the treatment for the common cold as the treatment of all coronavirus infections.", "The textbook itself mentions inexact and inappropriate treatment. \u201cNasal spray\u201d only implies the route through which the medicine is given \u2013 through the nose. There are many drugs given through the nasal route, decongestants for the common cold are only one of them.", "Thus an excerpt from a zoology textbook covering the basics of the common cold was taken out of context. The claims made rest on the misconception that there is only one coronavirus and that coronavirus only causes the common cold. In fact, there are many coronaviruses that infect different animals. Of those, from the mid-1960s till date, seven coronaviruses have been shown to infect humans including SARS, MERS and the novel COVID-19. These viruses cause a wide range of illnesses from common cold to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Hence these viral tweets are misleading people on the treatment available for coronavirus and fuel conspiracy theories that the current coronavirus pandemic is not new.", "Note: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India has exceeded 600. This has caused the government to impose a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services. Globally, more than 4 lakh confirmed cases and over 19,000 deaths have been reported. There is a growing sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments.
