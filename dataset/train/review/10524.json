["By Robert Farley", "Posted on April 20, 2018", "In Republican primaries where loyalty to President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda is a litmus test for many voters, the approval of a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill has become a political weapon \u2014 no matter how lawmakers voted.", "Indiana Republican Rep. Todd Rokita voted against the bill, while North Carolina Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger voted for it. Now, both face misleading attacks from challengers who claim their opponents voted against Trump\u2019s border wall.", "In fact, Rokita, now running for the Senate, and Pittenger, who seeks to retain his seat in the House, both support Trump\u2019s wall.", "The vote on the $1.3 trillion spending bill put Republican supporters of Trump\u2019s proposed border wall in a bind. It included $1.6 billion for border security, including money to replace fencing and build new barriers. But the funding was far short of the $25 billion Trump sought, and it cannot be used for any of the wall prototypes ordered by the president.", "Some Republicans took a take-what-you-can-get approach and voted for the bill. Others took a hard line and voted against the bill, saying it fell well short of meaningful funding for the promised wall.", "In the Indiana and North Carolina primaries, the Republican candidates have tried to portray themselves as more supportive of Trump\u2019s agenda than their opponents. But how one voted on the omnibus spending bill is an unreliable measure. After all, the president himself waffled on the bill before he signed it.", "The $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill (also known as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018) passed in bipartisan fashion, ending a months-long funding stalemate and averting a partial government shutdown.", "Trump himself was conflicted about the bill. In a tweet, the president said he was considering vetoing it, in part, because \u201cthe BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\u201d Ultimately, on March 23, Trump did\u00a0sign the bill, though he said there were \u201ca lot of things that I\u2019m unhappy about\u201d in it.", "As we have written before, the omnibus bill funds some new fencing, but the new barriers are not the kind of solid, concrete wall Trump once described during the campaign. The bill also precludes funding for barriers that are anything like the wall prototypes Trump visited\u00a0on a trip to California in mid-March.", "And, while Trump administration officials said the omnibus would fund about 100 miles of \u201cnew\u201d wall, most of that will replace existing border fencing deemed inadequate or dilapidated.\u00a0In all, we found the bill will fund less than 40 miles of new barrier where there wasn\u2019t any before.", "The president would ultimately like to have 1,000 miles of barrier,\u00a0according to Customs and Border Protection Acting Deputy Commissioner\u00a0Ronald D. Vitiello, and there is currently 654 miles of fencing. So the funding bill leaves the president\u00a0more than 300 miles short of his goal.", "Despite Trump\u2019s misgivings about the border wall funding in the bill, once he signed it, he repeatedly said the funding was enough to finally get his long-promised wall started.", "\u201cWe started building our wall,\u201d he said in Ohio on March 30. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of it. We started. We started. We have $1.6 billion, and we\u2019ve already started. \u2026 We have $1.6 billion toward the wall, and we\u2019ve done the planning.\u201d", "Trump also tweeted that \u201cmuch can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall,\u201d adding that the money was \u201cjust a down payment\u201d and promising that \u201cthe rest of the money will come\u201d in the future.", "Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come \u2013 and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2018", "Given all that, was a vote against the bill a vote against Trump\u2019s wall?", "An ad from Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer says it was.", "Messer\u2019s ad asserts that while Rokita (who has taken to sporting MAGA hats in campaign ads) \u201cpretends he always supports President Trump,\u201d his voting record says otherwise. For example, the ad says, Rokita voted \u201cagainst Trump\u2019s border wall.\u201d The small print in the ad cites \u201cRoll Call Vote #127\u2033 on March 22. That\u2019s the vote on the omnibus spending bill, which passed the House 256-167.", "Republicans voted in favor of the bill 145-90. Messer and Rokita, both currently members of the House, are facing each other in a bid for the Senate. Rokita voted against the omnibus bill.", "Messer, who voted for the bill, told Fox59 in Indianapolis\u00a0that he \u201cvoted to stand with President Trump\u201d and that the bill \u201cprovides a down payment on President Trump\u2019s border wall.\u201d", "\u201cThis is the only thing that has actually funded the wall so far,\u201d Chasen Bullock, Messer\u2019s campaign manager, told us. There was no other legislative option on the table for greater wall funding, Bullock added, so when Rokita voted against the bill, he \u201cdidn\u2019t support border wall funding when he had the chance.\u201d", "In a press release explaining his vote, Rokita said that while \u201cthere are good provisions in this bill,\u201d it is \u201clittered with concessions to liberal Democrats\u201d and \u201cfails to fund an effective wall.\u201d", "\u201cDonald Trump and I still want to build the wall, and all we got was a few miles of fence and no concrete,\u201d Rokita said in an interview with CBS4 in Indianapolis after the vote.", "Both Messer and Rokita support Trump\u2019s call for a border wall. Voters can question Rokita\u2019s hard-line stance, or argue that it\u2019s better to take a little something rather than nothing, but it\u2019s misleading for Messer\u2019s ad to claim that Rokita \u201cvoted against Trump\u2019s border wall,\u201d when his opposition was rooted, in part, in the belief that it didn\u2019t fund the border wall enough.", "In the 2016 election, Trump won the state of Indiana by nearly 20 percentage points against Hillary Clinton. According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, Rokita has voted with Trump 90.1 percent of the time, compared with Messer\u2019s 92.9 percent. In the May 8 primary, Rokita and Messer also face former state Rep. Mike Braun \u2014 who said he would have voted against the omnibus bill. The winner will take on Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly.", "In North Carolina, the script was flipped, with Republican congressional candidate Mark Harris asserting in a Facebook post that when his opponent, Rep. Robert Pittenger, voted for the omnibus bill he \u201cstood against funding for the border wall.\u201d", "Robert Pittenger stood against funding for the border wall.Congressman Pittenger and other Republicans committed to us\u2026", "Posted by Mark Harris on\u00a0Thursday, March 29, 2018", "The Washington Examiner article attached to the post includes quotes from some conservative Republicans who viewed the bill as a missed opportunity to get significantly more funding for a border wall. Rep. Jim Jordan, a founder of the House Freedom Caucus, said the bill \u201cdidn\u2019t fund what we said we would,\u201d and that it\u2019s now \u201cgoing to be tough\u201d to get the full $25 billion for the wall that the president initially requested. He voted against it.", "In an interview with Fox News, Jordan said of the omnibus bill: \u201cThe one thing we don\u2019t fund is the one issue we all campaigned on \u2014 a border security wall \u2014 and that is not in the legislation.\u201d", "Jason Williams, campaign manager for Harris, echoed that sentiment in a phone interview, saying the bill includes \u201csome funding for some fencing and some border security, but not the actual construction of the wall itself.\u201d", "We explored this question in detail in our story \u201cHas the Border Wall Begun?\u201d As we wrote, \u201cThe short answer is that the omnibus bill funds some new fencing, though far less than Trump had hoped it would. The new barriers are also not the kind of solid, concrete wall Trump once described during the campaign. Nor is it anything like any of the prototypes Trump visited in mid-March.\u201d", "Pittenger\u2019s campaign pointed us to statements from Republican leaders who said the omnibus funds the wall.", "In a statement provided to us, Pittenger said: \u201cAs Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, I have always been in favor of building a wall and securing our porous southern border. The FY2018 omnibus and earlier legislation\u00a0I supported clearly provides funding to begin construction, and President Trump himself tweeted that \u2018much can be done with the $1.6 billion given to building and fixing the border wall.'\u201d", "One can argue, as Harris does, that the omnibus bill should have provided more funding for Trump\u2019s wall, or even that the funding in the bill does not deliver on Trump\u2019s promise. But it is misleading to say Pittenger \u201cstood against funding for the border wall\u201d for several reasons: a) the bill Pittenger voted for included funding to replace existing barriers and build new ones; b) the president called it an \u201cinitial down payment\u201d on his wall; and c) Trump signed \u2014 and did not veto \u2014 the bill.", "According to FiveThirtyEight, Pittenger votes in line with Trump\u2019s position 97.1 percent of the time. In North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District, Trump won by a margin of 11.6 percent.", "This is the second time Harris has squared off against Pittenger in a Republican primary for the 9th Congressional District. In 2016, Pittenger edged Harris by a mere 134 votes in a three-way race.", "Joining this year\u2019s rematch is Republican Clarence Goins. Christian Cano and Dan McCready vie for the Democratic nomination. The primaries will be held on May 8.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
