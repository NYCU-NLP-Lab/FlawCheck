He reiterated to the officials that he did not know the identity of the commenter. In a video he posted after the shooting, Bennight said:", "I would like to think that they were already investigating this guy and they had him on the top of their radar and that's how they wound up contacting me so quickly. I wish I could've given him more information but it was just a comment on my channel, a generic name \u2014 the person's name \u2014 and they think it was related so they came out to talk to me.", "Both the comment and YouTube account associated with it have been taken down.", "On 15 February 2018, the Jewish advocacy group the Anti-Defamation League reported that Cruz \"had participated in one or more training exercises\" with a white supremacist group, the Republic of Florida (ROF).
