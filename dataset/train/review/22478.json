["A Facebook post attempting to portray U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib as anti-American has resurfaced as tensions between the United States and Iran escalate. The content of the post is fabricated.", "There are multiple parts to the image in the Facebook post \u2014 it includes a picture of Tlaib on the left, a screenshot of a purported tweet by Tlaib, commentary about it by another Twitter user named \"Fed up American,\" and a description at the bottom of the image claiming that the alleged tweet was \"her comment on the Protesters Siege of the U.S. Embassy in Iraqi.\" (sic)", "\"She tweeted this out and deleted it immediately but not quick enough. She\u2019s clearly anti-american and should not be in office,\" says Fed up American.", "The tweet that Tlaib allegedly wrote says: \"Americans have spent decades raping and pillaging my people. What goes around comes around. #FridayFeeling.\"", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "That\u2019s because Tlaib never tweeted that. This faux tweet first surfaced a year ago shortly after Tlaib was sworn into office and made headlines for using profanity in a vow to impeach President Donald Trump. Tlaib was born and raised in Detroit and is the daughter of Palestinian immigrants. She\u2019s a Democrat representing Michigan\u2019s 13th congressional district.", "As PolitiFact reported, the hoax tweet originated on Jan. 4, 2019, and came from another user who tried to make it seem as if it was a real account for the congresswoman. Tlaib\u2019s real account has a blue checkmark badge by her name to indicate that it\u2019s been verified by Twitter as truly belonging to her.", "\"Quick public servant announcement: If there isn't a checkmark next to my name on the tweet then it's fake! To all the foreign countries & reckless commentators out there spreading lies about me: Try to focus on disagreeing with me with facts, instead of making up shit,\" Tlaib tweeted Jan. 6, 2020.", "Quick public servant announcement: If there isn't a checkmark next to my name on the tweet then it's fake!

A series of events have intensified tensions between the United States and Iran, including a break into a U.S. embassy compound in Baghdad by supporters of an Iranian-backed militia (the Facebook post alludes to the embassy events.)", "As for the fake tweet in the Facebook post, we rate it Pants on Fire!", "Facebook post, Jan. 5, 2020", "Twitter, @RashidaTlaib tweet, Jan. 6, 2020; tweet Jan. 3, 2020", "Twitter, About Verified Accounts", "Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib official website, About page", "PolitiFact, No, Rashida Tlaib did not tweet about 'raping and pillaging' America, Jan. 9, 2019", "Washington Post, Militia supporters chanting \u2018Death to America\u2019 break into U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad, Dec. 31, 2019", "Defense Department, Statement on Hill Briefing, Jan. 3, 2020; Statement by the Department of Defense, Jan. 2, 2020", "State Department, Designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, April 8, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
