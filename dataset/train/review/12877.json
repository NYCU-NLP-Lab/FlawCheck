While the matter is being considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, so far the agency hasn\u2019t advised face masks for healthy people.", "It did recently update its guidance to say that, when masks are available, sick people should wear them when they are around others and upon entering healthcare providers\u2019 offices. The CDC also says that if a sick person is unable to wear a mask, their caregiver should wear one when in the same room.", "Public health officials have said that they don\u2019t consider the virus to be airborne because its droplets are too large and heavy to remain in the air long, falling within a few seconds.", "\"The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces,\" the World Health Organization says.", "\"You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 meter of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands.\"", "The Facebook post\u2019s claim that the virus can remain in the air up to eight hours is unsubstantiated. Furthermore, the CNBC article the post references makes no such statement.", "The article does refer to one recent study that suggests the virus might be able to stay in the air longer in some settings such as when medical staff are engaged in an \"aerosol-generating procedure.\" Such procedures might include intubation, ventilation and airway suction. Under those circumstances, health officials are considering \"airborne precautions\" for medical staff, the story said.", "The study, published March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that transmission by aerosol \u2014 defined as a suspension of tiny particles or droplets in the air \u2014 is plausible in this virus, technically called SARS-CoV-2, in some settings. The virus \"remained viable in aerosols\" for three hours, the study said.", "But this doesn\u2019t mean the virus is now considered airborne.

Some secretions are on the bigger end, and we tend to call those \u2018droplets.\u2019 Others are smaller, and we tend to call them \u2018aerosols,\u2019\" Morris says.", "\"The tricky crux of the matter is that when people say \u2018airborne,\u2019 what they often mean is \u2018you\u2019re at risk from virus particles hanging in the air \u2014 or being kicked back up into the air after falling to the ground \u2014 long, long after an infectious person sneezed them out.\u2019 That\u2019s much more of a risk for smaller, \u2018aerosol\u2019-end-of-the-spectrum secretions.

Even though measles and flu illnesses can both be found in aerosol-like and in droplet-like secretions, Morris says, the flu is less transmissible. So far, scientists think COVID-19 looks more like the flu.", "Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne disease transmission at Virginia Tech, told FactCheck.org that there isn\u2019t enough evidence showing how exactly the new coronavirus is being spread between people, but said transmission is much more likely if you\u2019re close to someone who is sick.", "She gave an example of being directly next to someone smoking a cigarette \u2014 the closer you are, the more off a whiff you could catch \u2014 but the farther away you are from someone releasing the virus into the air, the lesser the concentration.", "A Facebook post says the virus that causes\u00a0COVID-19 remains in the air for eight hours, and everyone is now required to wear masks.", "This is\u00a0inaccurate. There is no current evidence that the virus can remain in the air for eight hours. While the CDC is exploring its position on whether masks should be worn more widely in the general population, it doesn\u2019t \"require\" everyone to wear masks \"everywhere.\" As more studies are done on how the virus persists in various environments, there may be extra precautions put in place, especially for health care professionals treating COVID-19 patients.", "There is still not enough known to say definitively how this new virus behaves in every setting. Preliminary studies suggest the virus may be more \"airborne\" than initially believed. But the term \"airborne\" should not be applied loosely as current research doesn\u2019t indicate that COVID-19 is comparable to highly transmissible airborne illnesses like measles.
