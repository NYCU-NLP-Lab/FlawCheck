["By Brooks Jackson", "Posted on May 20, 2016", "A primary challenger to Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolina falsely claims Jones\u00a0\u201ccaved to Obama\u201d and \u201cempowered Obama to cut a deal with Iran.\u201d", "Actually, all Jones did was co-author a letter in 2012 beseeching the president to conduct \u201crobust, sustained diplomacy\u201d with Iran as an alternative to war.", "And far from \u201ccaving,\u201d Jones voted against Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal in 2015, stating that \u201cit does not provide for adequate inspections and verification.\u201d", "The misleading attack ad is the work of GOP hopeful Taylor Griffin, a former aide to the late Sen. Jesse Helms. Griffin is challenging Jones for a second time in the June 7 congressional primary, after falling\u00a06 percentage points short of defeating Jones in 2014. The district is solidly Republican, and the primary winner will most likely be elected in November. Jones is seeking his 11th term.", "In the ad, Griffin denounces Obama for avoiding the use of the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d then says Jones \u201cis taking the president\u2019s way.\u201d On screen the ad shows an image of Obama next to an image of Jones.", "Griffin goes on to say, \u201cCongressman Jones empowered Obama to cut a deal with Iran.\u201d", "That\u2019s false; Obama did not need any new power to negotiate a deal with Iran. Congress had already granted the president broad power to lift sanctions related to Iran\u2019s nuclear program when it imposed them years earlier.", "Griffin would have been correct to say Jones urged Obama to negotiate a nuclear deal rather than go to war.", "The letter shown in the ad was authored by Jones and Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota. Eventually it was signed by 37 House members.", "Dated March 2, 2012, the letter began, \u201cAs tension with Iran continues to escalate, we urge your Administration to utilize all available tools of diplomacy to resolve the crisis over Iran\u2019\u0092s nuclear program and prevent another costly war in the Middle East.\u201d", "The letter warned that a military strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities would lead to a wider conflict, and concluded: \u201c[W]e believe that robust, sustained diplomacy is the best option to resolve our serious concerns about Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and to prevent a costly war.\u201d", "Though not mentioned in the ad itself, the Griffin campaign also points to Jones\u2019\u00a0cosponsorship of a Democratic bill in 2012 that would have directed the president to appoint a high-level envoy to Iran. But that didn\u2019t \u201cempower\u201d Obama either; it died without getting out of committee.", "Conspicuously absent from the ad is any mention of Jones\u2019 opposition to the Iran nuclear deal itself. On Sept. 11, 2015, Jones joined other House Republicans in casting a vote against a measure stating simply that \u201cCongress does favor\u201d the deal. That measure failed 162 to 269.", "Moments later, Jones voted in favor of a measure that would have suspended the president\u2019s existing authority under previous law to grant Iran relief from sanctions. That passed the House 247 to 186, but Senate Democrats were able to block a similar measure from being taken up by the Senate.", "Unlike some of his colleagues who voiced disapproval of the deal before it was even made public, Jones engaged in what he called a \u201ccareful review\u201d before announcing his opposition.", "On his House website, Jones explained his votes this way: \u201cIn my judgment, President Obama\u2019s deal falls short because it does not provide for adequate inspections and verification. As a result, the American people will never be able to trust that Iran isn\u2019t cheating their way to a nuclear bomb.\u201d", "We also note that the ad is misleading in the way it jumbles and confuses the issues of Islamic State terrorism and Iran\u2019s nuclear capability. The first part of the ad is devoted to images of what appear to be Islamic State fighters marching and carrying the Islamic State flag\u00a0while Griffin says \u201cthey\u2019ve declared war on America.\u201d", "Then Griffin pivots to the Iran deal. But the fact is, Iran\u2019s Shia regime is an enemy of the Sunni Islamic State insurgency.", "Iranian warplanes have conducted strikes in neighboring Iraq against fighters of the Islamic\u00a0State, which is also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Iran is also\u00a0deeply involved in the fighting in Syria. The BBC recently reported that a high-ranking Iranian general \u201chas been co-ordinating the Iraqi government\u2019s operations against Islamic State\u201d in Syria. Earlier, Iranian media reported that hundreds of Iranian \u201cvolunteers\u201d had died fighting in Syria against the Islamic State forces.", "To be sure, Iran is still officially considered a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\u201d by the U.S. State Department, mainly because of its arming and training of Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon, and its support for the Assad regime in Syria.", "The ad concludes with Griffin saying, \u201cI\u2019ll stand with our friends, and against our enemies. I know the difference.\u201d But this ad should make voters wonder if he knows the difference between ISIS and Iran.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ad02f8d9-07b6-4bc5-9b5d-f9cd5c87fd86", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
