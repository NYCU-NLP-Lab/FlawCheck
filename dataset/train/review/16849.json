Chris Christie for the following statistic: property taxes increased 4.1 percent in 2010, marking the highest increase since 2007.\n\n\"New Jersey property taxes increased 4.1 percent in 2010,\" according to a May 10 press release. \"This is the highest increase since 2007.\"\n\nThat number showed up in the press release as one of the examples of the \"governor\u2019s property tax failure.\" Assembly Democrats said the tax hike followed cuts made by Christie to school and municipal aid.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey found the Assembly Democrats\u2019 numbers to be accurate. A report by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs shows that the average residential property tax bill increased in 2010 by 4.1 percent.\n\nThat report also points out that last year\u2019s percentage increase was higher than the 3.3 percent and 3.7 percent increases in 2009 and 2008, respectively. (Because of budget increases, average bills went up by 5.4 percent in 2007 and 7 percent in 2006, according to the report.)\n\nBut PolitiFact New Jersey still thought some things were missing from the Democrats\u2019 underlying argument that Christie bears responsibility for the 2010 tax hikes. It\u2019s worth noting that Christie didn\u2019t begin his tenure until after the previous fiscal year had started, and some policy decisions affecting the beginning of 2010 predated him.\n\nFor a clearer picture, we reached out to five experts on economic policy and taxes, and learned that although they believe Christie holds some responsibility, the property tax hikes also had to do with the recession and rising costs facing local officials.\n\nAs some experts pointed out, there\u2019s no doubt the reduction in state aid last year contributed to property tax increases. Property taxes are determined by county, municipal and school officials, but their local budgets are influenced by the level of state aid received.\n\nTo help meet an $11 billion budget gap, Christie\u2019s first budget as governor cut school aid by about $829 million and reduced municipal aid by nearly $446 million, according to the state\u2019s \"Citizens\u2019 Guide to the Budget.\"\n\nDemocrats are blaming Christie for those aid reductions, but keep this in mind: the cuts were part of a budget approved by the Legislature, including both Democratic and Republican representatives.\n\nReferring to the decision to not raise state taxes to meet the revenue shortfall, Rutgers University professor Joseph Seneca said: \"It was a shock to the way fiscal business was done in New Jersey before.\"\n\nGlen Fandl, an adjunct professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University, said the aid reduction played a role in the tax hikes, but he argued a larger factor is that the number of municipal revaluations slowed in 2010 due to declining property values.\n\nIn revaluations, properties\u2019 assessed values are revised -- meaning the amounts that taxes are based on -- and tax rates are reduced. Without as many revaluations, tax rates mostly went up in 2010, Fandl said. Fandl said another reason was a significant increase in tax appeals from commercial property owners.\n\nFandl said of Christie: \"The recession\u2019s not his fault.\"\n\nFandl noted that towns and school districts still faced contractual obligations to their employees, despite cutting expenses.\n\nRising utility and healthcare costs are beyond Christie\u2019s control, but at the same time, the governor declined last year to support extending a higher tax rate on personal income over $1 million, according to Jon Shure of the Washington, DC-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The center leans Democratic.\n\nThe state\u2019s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services estimated the higher rate would have generated about $637 million for the property tax relief fund in the current fiscal year.\n\n\"Any time New Jersey reduces its state income tax, it has less money available for property tax relief,\" said Shure, former president of the Trenton-based New Jersey Policy Perspective, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nDavid Brunori, a research professor at The George Washington University in Washington, DC, offered a few other targets to place blame for the tax hikes, including the dependence on state aid and a desire to maintain the same level of local services. New Jerseyans want a great deal of services and there are two ways of paying for them: state aid and higher property taxes, Brunori said.\n\nAcross the country, states historically cut local aid when faced with budget deficits, Brunori said. At the end of the day, towns decided to maintain services, he said.\n\n\"I\u2019m not sure I would blame the governor,\" Brunori said.\n\nMontclair State University assistant professor James DiGabriele said he\u2019s not blaming anybody, including Christie. The larger problem is that government has not revised its structure for generating revenue, DiGabriele said. Towns could charge a fee for services, such as garbage collection, he said.\n\n\"In the new economy, I don\u2019t know if we have a choice,\" DiGabriele said.\n\nPointing to the number of school administrators and school boards, Fandl said there is so much home rule in New Jersey that is driving up costs. That system itself is the problem, Fandl said.\n\n\"The costs are never going to go down and that\u2019s the problem,\" Fandl said.\n\nNow let\u2019s go back to the blame game:\n\nThe Assembly Democrats are criticizing Christie for tax increases in 2010. They are correct taxes increased 4.1 percent.\n\nThe governor\u2019s aid cuts contributed to the tax hikes, and Christie rejected a tax increase that would have provided more property tax relief. But some Democratic legislators also signed off on aid reductions by approving the state budget.\n\nThere also are several other factors at play here -- the recession, declining property values, tax appeals, rising costs, a local desire to maintain services and an expensive system of running school districts.\n\nWe rate the Democrats\u2019 statement Half True.", "To comment on this ruling, join the conversation at NJ.com.", "New Jersey Assembly Democrats, press release, May 10, 2011\n\nNew Jersey Department of Community Affairs, 2010 Property Tax and Statewide Spending Summary, accessed May 17, 2011\n\nInterview with Joseph Seneca, Edward J.
