We rated that claim False. There was no gun, and while there are varying reports of whether he had a knife in his hand or it was found on the floorboard of the car he was entering, he was not \"brandishing\" it at police on the scene.", "So we will focus here on Moore\u2019s characterization of how authorities in Kenosha treated Rittenhouse in the moments after the shooting.", "Let\u2019s take a look at her account.", "When asked for evidence to support Moore\u2019s claim, her office pointed to four news articles about the Aug. 25, 2020 incident that led to Rittenhouse\u2019s arrest.", "Here\u2019s what we know:", "According to eyewitness videos and the criminal complaint, Rittenhouse shot and killed Rosenbaum in a parking lot after Rosenbaum chased him and tried to grab his gun.", "Rittenhouse then began running slowly down the street, but tripped and fell as a crowd began to follow him.
