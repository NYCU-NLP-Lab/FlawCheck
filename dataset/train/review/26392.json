This problem remains a persistent issue on social media platforms such as Twitter, especially for celebrities who have a penchant for changing their names.", "In August 2018, a screenshot supposedly showing the futile attempts of a musician variously known as \"Diddy,\" \"P.

Diddy back in 2001 (and later, just \u201cDiddy\u201d), but now claims that he has always been Puff Daddy, tweeting: \u201cFor the record, I did not change my name. I always have been and always will be PUFF DADDY!\u201d The only problem is, his official Twitter handle is \u201c@iamdiddy,\u201d and all the good Puff Daddy handles are taken.", "Although the image showing Diddy's attempt to secure the \"Sean's Combs\" handle might been seemed somewhat plausible on its own, the \"Funny or Die\" article included five additional images supposedly chronicling the musician's failed attempts to secure other Twitter handles such as @PuffDaddy and @PuffDaddy2.
