["About this rating", "Some of the mailboxes at the Disneyland theme park in Southern California can be used to send mail, such as postcards, from inside the park.", "The mailboxes aren't serviced by the U.S. Postal Service. Park employees collect the contents and take it to a post office in Anaheim.", "If you've visited Disneyland in California, you've probably noticed that the park is set up to mimic a miniature metropolis, with themed areas like Tomorrowland and Adventureland. So some may have assumed that mailboxes adorning the park are just decorations.", "Some of them are. But some of the mailboxes are in fact useable. According to the website for D23, the Disney company's official fan club, \"There are real functioning mailboxes spread around the resort and themed to blend in with the surroundings.
