Shortly after the fact-check published, a Rubio spokesman\u00a0said Rubio said North Korea possessed \"over two-dozen nuclear warheads.\" As such, we have updated this fact-check and changed the rating to Half True.", "In a \"happy hour\"\u00a0meet-and-greet at Bev\u2019s on the River in Sioux City, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio rattled off a litany of international threats facing the United States.", "Topping that list was North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons stockpile and the reclusive communist country\u2019s potential for launching a nuclear missile at the United States.", "\"And then you look abroad, and you see a world that\u2019s increasingly dangerous. You have a lunatic in North Korea,\" Rubio said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. \"A lunatic. Except he has over two-dozen nuclear warheads. And a long-range missile that can already reach the United States with that warhead on it.\"", "So, the statement to be evaluated is: Does North Korea really have more than two-dozen nuclear weapons?", "The short answer is no, not quite.", "Numerous credible arms and security organizations estimate North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal at\u00a0six to\u00a016 nuclear weapons. Even at the high side of those estimates,\u00a0Rubio is overestimating the North Korean nuclear threat by about 50 percent.", "When asked for sources supporting Rubio's claim, his campaign provided a\u00a0link to a story echoing that 16-warhead estimate\u00a0but also noting a Chinese estimate of up to 20.", "A wide consensus exists that North Korea has the capability to construct up to eight plutonium-fueled nuclear weapons. This view is shared by think tanks including the\u00a0Nuclear Threat Initiative, the\u00a0Arms Control Association\u00a0and the\u00a0Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute.", "Similarly, a 2013\u00a0report from the Congressional Research Service\u00a0estimated that North Korea has enough plutonium for \"at least a half dozen\" weapons and the capability to produce another single \"bomb\u2019s worth of plutonium per year.\"", "Additionally, a\u00a0report from the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Advanced International Studies\u00a0agrees with the estimate of eight plutonium bombs and adds that North Korea may also have enough uranium for\u00a0four to\u00a0eight more nuclear bombs.", "The Johns Hopkins paper goes on to project the potential growth of North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal. In its most aggressive prediction, the paper suggests the country could have 100 weapons by 2020.", "Rubio also claimed that North Korea has long-range missiles capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to American shores. He's on firm ground there.\u00a0Admiral Bill Gortney, commander of U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command\u00a0told a Washington think tank last month\u00a0that North Korea has the ability to miniaturize its nuclear weapons and place them on a missile that could reach the United States. That view is also reflected in the Johns Hopkins report\u00a0and elsewhere.", "There are some caveats, though. According to\u00a0another Johns Hopkins report, one intercontinental ballistic missile in North Korea\u2019s arsenal, the Taepodong-2, is a \"militarized version\" of a rocket designed to launch satellites into space. It is believed to have a range that would allow it to reach Alaska, but not the continental United States.", "Three of the Taepodong-2\u2019s four known test launches ended in failure. The re-entry vehicle necessary for deploying a nuclear weapon from the missile, moreover, is crude, inaccurate and has never been tested, according to the Johns Hopkins report.", "Gortney, the NORAD commander, referred to another missile, the KN-08, which is believed to be\u00a0capable of reaching targets on the West Coast of the United States. But it\u00a0hasn't been flight tested and, like the Taepodong-2, is\u00a0probably not accurate enough to reliably hit a target.", "Our ruling", "Rubio claimed that\u00a0North Korea\u00a0\"has over two-dozen nuclear warheads.\"", "That overstates North Korea\u2019s estimated nuclear arsenal by about 50 percent, but isn\u2019t egregious given the relatively small numbers involved.
