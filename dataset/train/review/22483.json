["About this rating", "Among the toughest long-term challenges facing President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming 115th U.S. Congress is ensuring the continued viability of the Social Security and Medicare programs, both of which, according to reports by their boards of trustees, face insolvency by the year 2034.", "On 8 December 2016, Republican Congressman Sam Johnson, chairman of the House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee, introduced legislation \u2014 titled The Social Security Reform Act of 2016 (H.R. 6489) \u2014 designed to \"permanently\" save Social Security:", "My commonsense plan is the start of a fact-based conversation about how we do just that.\u00a0 I urge my colleagues to also put pen to paper and offer their ideas about how they would save Social Security for generations to come.\u00a0 Americans want, need, and deserve for us to finally come up with a solution to saving this important program.", "Among other measures proposed by Johnson, the plan would gradually increase the normal retirement age to 69, progressively reduce benefits for the top half (in income) of retirees, and limit cost-of-living adjustments and spousal benefits for the highest-income retirees, while increasing minimum benefits for those who earn the lowest.", "No matter how it's sliced and diced, Johnson's plan calls for benefit cuts \u2014 one of the biggest no-nos in American politics. All eyes are therefore on President-elect Trump, who repeatedly said during the 2016 campaign that he would not consider cutting Social Security \u2014 or did he?", "Former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders certainly thinks Trump said he wouldn't:", "Donald Trump said he would not cut Medicare or Social Security. He must keep his word. It's a life-and-death issue for millions of people.", "\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) December 10, 2016", "But Johnson's plan has caused confusion, even among some who supported him, about Trump's own position on the issue. At snopes.com we've been inundated with questions about what Trump does or doesn't plan to do about Social Security, so we gathered together some of his more recent statements to see how they added up. On the whole \u2014 at least during the campaign \u2014 Trump has consistently said he's against cutting benefits, while acknowledging that the system needs fixing:", "\"Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it. Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that\u2019s being lost.\" (16 June 2015)", "Scott Pelley: \"In your book, The America We Deserve, you proposed raising the Social Security retirement age to 70. Is that still your plan?\"", "Donald Trump: \"Yeah, not anymore because now what I want to do is take money back from other countries that are killing us and I want to save Social Security. And we're going to save it without increases. We're not going to raise the age and it will be just fine.\" (27 September 2015)", "\"I'm going to save Social Security. You have tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. We have in Social Security thousands of people over 106 years old. You know they don't exist. There's tremendous waste, fraud and abuse, and we're going to get it. But we're not going to hurt the people who have been paying into Social Security their whole life and then all of a sudden they're supposed to get less. We're bringing jobs back.\" (13 February 2016)", "\"And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.\" (10 March 2016)", "\"We\u2019re going to save your Social Security and we\u2019re going to save your Medicare. We are going to save it because we\u2019re going to make our country rich again, we\u2019re going to bring back our jobs. We\u2019re not going to let our jobs go. And we\u2019re going to be able to afford. You\u2019ve been paying in it for a long time and a lot of these guys want it to be knocked to hell. It\u2019s not going to happen, OK? Remember that. It\u2019s not going to happen.\" (4 April 2016)", "Going back further in time, we found statements contradicting his statements during the campaign, such as when, in his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, Trump compared Social Security to a Ponzi scheme. \"The pyramids are made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9,\" he wrote, going on to suggest that the retirement age be raised to 70 and the system be at least partially privatized. But that was 16 years ago. He's said nothing of the kind more recently.", "According to an unnamed source quoted by Bloomberg Week in May 2016, Trump insisted during a conversation with House Speaker Paul Ryan (who has generally supported entitlements cuts and has spoken in favor of Social Security privatization), that no Republican who vowed to cut Social Security could win the presidential election:", "According to a source in the room, Trump criticized Ryan's proposed entitlement cuts as unfair and politically foolish. \"From a moral standpoint, I believe in it,\" Trump told Ryan. \"But you also have to get elected. And there's no way a Republican is going to beat a Democrat when the Republican is saying, 'We're going to cut your Social Security' and the Democrat is saying, 'We're going to keep it and give you more.'\"", "There's often a considerable disconnect between the promises candidates make on the campaign trail and the positions they take in office \u2014 especially when those promises differ from the stands taken by other powerful members of their own party \u2014 so we can't predict whether or not Donald Trump will hold the line against any and all Social Security cuts.", "But we can tell you with certainty that he said he would.", "Biggs, Andrew.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"At Last: A New Social Security Reform Plan.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forbes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08 December 2016.", "Green, Joshua.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A Day in the Life of Reince Priebus, Reluctant GOP Peacemaker.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloomberg Businessweek.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a026 May 2016.", "Hiltzik, Michael.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The GOP Unveils a 'Permanent Save' for Social Security \u2014\u00a0with Massive Benefit Cuts.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Los Angeles Times.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09 December 2016.", "Kaczynski, Andrew.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Trump on Social Security in His 2000 Book: A Ponzi Scheme We Must Privatize.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BuzzFeed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a029 September 2015.", "Matthews, Chris.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why Donald Trump and Paul Ryan's Political Divide Is Bigger Than It Looks.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fortune.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a015 November 2016.", "Timiraos, Nick.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Social Security, Medicare Face Insolvency Over 20 Years, Trustees Report.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a022 June 2016.", "Vernon, Steve.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump View Social Security.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CBS Moneywatch.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a012 July 2016.", "OnTheIssues.org.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Donald Trump on Social Security.\"", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
