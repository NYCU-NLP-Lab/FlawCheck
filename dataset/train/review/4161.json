["The video of the water car\u00a0has been viewed more than 1.3 million times and shared more than 65,000 times since it was posted\u00a0on Facebook on December 23, 2018.", "The footage is\u00a0from a\u00a02012 show on Pakistan's ARY news channel,\u00a0posted\u00a0on their official YouTube channel\u00a0May 5,\u00a02017, in which the inventor, Agha Waqar, demonstrates his purported groundbreaking discovery.", "In the video, Waqar claims he has\u00a0discovered a way to easily split the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in water molecules with almost no energy, thereby allowing cars to run using water, not petrol, as fuel.", "\u201cIt can run 800 cc to 1,000 cc cars without any petrol,\u201d claims Pakistani inventor Agha Waqar", "The claim attracted\u00a0widespread coverage in the Pakistani\u00a0media\u00a0in 2012, and even\u00a0politicians, for example then-religious affairs minister, Khurshid Shah, expressed support for the purported\u00a0discovery.", "International media including the New York Times covered Waqar's claims here\u00a0in an 4 August, 2012 article, describing the excitement in Pakistan at the time.", "\"Across Pakistan, where crippling electricity cuts have left millions drenched in the sweat of a powerless summer, and where there is hunger for tales of homegrown glory, the shimmering mirage of a 'water car'\u00a0received a broad and serious embrace,\" the paper wrote.", "Waqar's claims were widely dismissed by scientists\u00a0and there has been no official\u00a0follow-up or implementation\u00a0of the claimed invention in the seven years since he first announced it.", "Here is the original 2012 TV program on ARY's official YouTube channel:", "The caption of the misleading\u00a0Facebook post says:\u00a0\"Spread this video like a wildfire in the jungle so it reaches the Chief Justice and Prime Minister Imran Khan.", "\"This is engineer Agha Waqar who in 2012 during Zardari\u00a0era claimed to run car on water, but our country's oil mafia failed his plan and a conscience-selling media like Geo\u00a0declared him insane.\"", "Zardari refers to Pakistan's former president Asif Ali Zardari and Geo is a Pakistani television network.", "Pakistan's Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) told AFP the claim a car could be run on water\u00a0was a hoax.", "\"It's very obviously a false claim and oil industry has nothing to do with it,\" Adil Khattak, OCAC\u00a0Chairman told AFP by\u00a0email.", "AFP spoke to three scientists who all said it was not possible to use water to\u00a0fuel a car.", "Philip Ball, a British science writer who was an editor for the\u00a0journal Nature\u00a0for more than 20 years, said the purported invention was scientifically impossible.", "\u201cIn short, water is not a fuel,\" says British science writer Philip Ball", "\u201cIn short, water is not a fuel. Water is an exhaust: it's what is produced by burning fuel, specifically burning hydrogen gas (or, say, methane or acetylene, in which case you get carbon oxides too). What are you going to convert water into, in order to have a net energy release? It just doesn't add up,\u201d he said.", "Professor Hua Zhao, vice dean of the engineering department at Brunel University London, said you cannot\u00a0run a car using water as fuel.", "\u201cWater cannot be burned as hydrocarbon fuels (petrol, ethanol, natural gas) or hydrogen. The hydrogen atoms in water molecule are bond to oxygen atom and would take energy (typically by electrolysis) to release these hydrogen atoms to be burned in an engine or used in a fuel cell,\u201d he told AFP.", "\u201cThe energy required to break those bonds between hydrogen and oxygen in water will always take more energy than the energy needed to get them together in a fuel cell or produced by the engine.\u201d", "Pakistani scientist Pervez Hoodbhoy, who has previously argued against Waqar\u2019s claims in a 2012 article and video blog, told AFP he was disappointed to see the claim resurfacing online.", "\"I'm astonished. This fraudster has emerged again? I am amazed that he had the nerve. Also that people are so gullible,\" he told AFP by email.", "\u201cThe fact is that water can never be set on fire -- it is, in fact, used to quench fires,\u201d he said.", "\"Technically speaking that's because water is in a state of low thermodynamic Helmholtz Free Energy; to separate it into hydrogen and oxygen raises the Helmholtz Free Energy. So just as a stone doesn't fall upward, water doesn't spontaneously turn into hydrogen and oxygen.\"", "Here is\u00a0Hoodbhoy's video debunking the water car claims:", "The scientists' assessments\u00a0match previously published articles on the topic by MIT School of Engineering\u00a0and the Scientific American journal.", "A January 2018 blog\u00a0from the MIT School of Engineering says that using water to power cars is \u201conly a pipe dream\u201d.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
