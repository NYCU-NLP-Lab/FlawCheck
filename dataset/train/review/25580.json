["About this rating", "Mike Pence's father worked for a company that operated a chain of gas stations.", "A purported photograph of Mike Pence at one of those stations is not a picture of him, and we found no evidence the stations in question were 'whites only.'", "In October 2016, a photograph purportedly showing current Indiana governor and Republican vice Presidential candidate Mike Pence standing in front of a \"whites only\" gas station owned by his parents began circulating online:", "This image does not show Mike Pence, nor does it depict a \"whites only\" gas station run by Pence's family in Indiana.

Several news outlets, including ABC, Indinapolis Star, and CNN have mentioned this fact since Mike Pence was chosen to be Donald Trump's running mate in July 2016. None of these sources reported that the gas stations run by Pence's father, Edward Pence, were \"whites only,\" however.", "According to a September 2016 Forbes  article, Edward Pence did not own the gas stations himself; rather, he worked for the Kiel Brothers Oil Company:", "Kiel Brothers Oil Company and a related C corporation KP Oil Inc ran over 200 convenience store gas stations in Indiana and surrounding states. Edward Pence, Mike\u2019s father had spent his career there and Gregory Pence, Mike\u2019s brother, was CEO towards the end. \u00a0It was a family business, but not really a Pence family business.
