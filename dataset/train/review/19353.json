Scott Perry, R-Pa., claimed the former administration purged information that could \"allow us to see in totality the threat that faces America.\"", "\"Just curious if you can tell me if the FBI has taken any steps to reverse the previous administration's purge of training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood,\" Perry asked FBI director Christopher Wray at the Nov. 30 hearing.", "Wray said he was not aware of efforts to purge training material.", "\"They were purged in the last administration,\" Perry told him.", "Is that true?", "Perry's office did not respond to our requests for information.\u00a0We found the FBI did rescind training material during the Obama administration \u2014 but it was less than 1 percent of 160,000 pages of training documents that were found to contain information that was factually inaccurate, imprecise or used stereotypes.", "The review came after media reports show that training material included claims identifying \"mainstream\" American Muslims as \"likely to be terrorist sympathizers.\"", "The Arab American Institute said the documents \"crudely\" depicted Arab Americans and American Muslims \"as threatening, irrational, or otherwise abnormal.\"", "Here\u2019s what we know about the FBI\u2019s review and rescinded documents.", "Wired in July 2011 reported that part of a January 2009 presentation for new FBI recruits said that Islam \"transforms (a) country's culture into 7th-century Arabian ways.\"", "Additional Wired reporting in September 2011 found that during a training session at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., agents were told that \"mainstream\" American Muslims were \"likely to be terrorist sympathizers; that the Prophet Mohammed was a \u2018cult leader\u2019; and that the Islamic practice of giving charity is no more than a \u2018funding mechanism for combat\u2019.\" A chart in the presentation contended that the more \"devout\" Muslims are, the likelier they are to be violent, Wired reported.", "The FBI distanced itself from the messages in the training.", "It told Wired that the presentation had a disclaimer saying the views expressed were of the author and \"do not necessarily reflect the views of the U.S. government.\" An FBI press release issued a day after Wired\u2019s report said the training segment was presented only one time and quickly discontinued.", "At a November 2011 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen.
