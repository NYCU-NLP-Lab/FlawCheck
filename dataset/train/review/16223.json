Only 168 have been revoked. That's 0.006 percent.\"", "Trump\u2019s statement isn\u2019t exactly right because he is only citing a certain category of revocations.

As of April, about 1.6 million people in Florida currently have the permits.", "But Trump got his facts wrong about revocations, because he only cited a slice of them.", "Between October 1987 and April 2016, Florida revoked 10,841 concealed weapon or firearm license permits, according to a summary provided by the state\u2019s division of licensing within the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
