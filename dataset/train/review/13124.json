She worried about Jordan being able to vet all the refugees coming into that country \u2014 she wasn\u2019t talking about ISIS infiltrating refugees that were coming into the United States.", "Here\u2019s the full excerpt, attributed in the attachment to the email to a speech on Oct. 28, 2013, to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago Vanguard Luncheon: \u201cSo I think you\u2019re right to have gone to the places that you visited because there\u2019s a discussion going on now across the region to try to see where there might be common ground to deal with the threat posed by extremism and particularly with Syria which has everyone quite worried, Jordan because it\u2019s on their border and they have hundreds of thousands of refugees and they can\u2019t possibly vet all those refugees so they don\u2019t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees. Turkey for the same reason.\u201d", "Clinton has said that the U.S. should admit 65,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016, which ended Sept. 30.

Instead, she says, she hopes to build on the Affordable Care Act to \u201cget to\u00a0affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in Canada.\u201d Having universal coverage through a single-payer system and having it by building on the United States\u2019 primarily employer-based system are different things. The speech was given Jan. 21, 2015, in Saskatoon, Canada.", "In another excerpt, Clinton says that \u201cit would be very difficult to get a consensus politically that would dramatically change\u201d the United States\u2019 employer-based health care model. That excerpt is dated June 17, 2013, from a speech to the Economic Club of\u00a0Grand Rapids.", "Here\u2019s the full quote from the Canada speech, with the relevant passages in bold:", "Jan. 21, 2015, excerpt, Saskatoon, Canada: You know, on healthcare we are the prisoner of our past. The way we got to develop any kind of medical insurance program was during World War II when companies facing shortages of workers began to offer healthcare benefits as an inducement for employment. So from the early 1940s healthcare was seen as a privilege connected to employment. And after the war when soldiers came back and went back into the market there was a lot of competition, because the economy was so heated up.", "So that model continued. And then of course our large labor unions bargained for healthcare with the employers that their members worked for. So from the early 1940s until the early 1960s we did not have any Medicare, or our program for the poor called Medicaid until President Johnson was able to get both passed in 1965. So the employer model continued as the primary means by which working people got health insurance. People over 65 were eligible for Medicare. Medicaid, which was a partnership, a funding partnership between the federal government and state governments, provided some, but by no means all poor people with access to healthcare.", "So what we\u2019ve been struggling with certainly Harry Truman, then Johnson was successful on Medicare and Medicaid, but didn\u2019t touch the employer based system, then actually Richard Nixon made a proposal that didn\u2019t go anywhere, but was quite far reaching. Then with my husband\u2019s administration we worked very hard to come up with a system, but we were very much constricted by the political realities that if you had your insurance from your employer you were reluctant to try anything else. And so we were trying to build a universal system around the employer-based system. And indeed now with President Obama\u2019s legislative success in getting the Affordable Care Act passed that is what we\u2019ve done.", "We still have primarily an employer-based system, but we now have people able to get subsidized insurance. So we have health insurance companies playing a major role in the provision of healthcare, both to the employed whose employers provide health insurance, and to those who are working but on their own are not able to afford it and their employers either don\u2019t provide it, or don\u2019t provide it at an affordable price. We are still struggling. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress. Ten million Americans now have insurance who didn\u2019t have it before the Affordable Care Act, and that is a great step forward. (Applause.)", "And what we\u2019re going to have to continue to do is monitor what the costs are and watch closely to see whether employers drop more people from insurance so that they go into what we call the health exchange system. So we\u2019re really just at the beginning. But we do have Medicare for people over 65. And you couldn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think, take it away if you tried, because people are very satisfied with it, but we also have a lot of political and financial resistance to expanding that system to more people. So we\u2019re in a learning period as we move forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m hoping that whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a big piece of legislation you\u2019re going to have, those will be remedied and we can really take a hard look at what\u2019s succeeding, fix what isn\u2019t, and keep moving forward to get to affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in Canada.", "It\u2019s worth noting that in his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d Trump called for creating a form of single-payer, saying: \u201cThe Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than Americans. There are fewer medical lawsuits, less loss of labor to sickness, and lower costs to companies paying for the medical care of their employees. \u2026 We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing. But implementing such a plan is not simple. One major problem is that the single-payer plan in Canada is in financial difficulty, as is the nationalized plan in the United Kingdom. We have to improve on the prototype.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s campaign plan, however, is to repeal the ACA and use \u201cfree market principles.\u201d", "As for wait times for surgeries in Canada, that has been a concern in the country, and press reports have said some Canadians come to the U.S. and pay for operations here, as Trump said. Clinton, too, mentioned this problem in her Grand Rapids speech, saying: \u201cIf you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know.

According to the WikiLeaks documents, Clinton said in a speech at Morgan Stanley on April 18, 2013, that \u201cSimpson-Bowles,\u201d as the commission\u2019s work was often called, \u201cput forth the right framework\u201d of looking at both spending and revenues to balance the budget. \u201cThe specifics can be negotiated and argued over,\u201d Clinton is quoted as saying. \u201cBut you got to do all three. You have to restrain spending, you have to have adequate revenues, and you have to have growth.\u201d", "Simpson-Bowles released the commission\u2019s plan in December 2010 and later put forth another fiscal plan in April 2013. Both included recommended changes to Social Security \u2014 which won\u2019t be able to pay full benefits by 2034, as estimated by the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees. Those changes included raising the retirement age, with a \u201chardship\u201d exemption; creating a progressive benefit formula based on income; and raising the percentage of earnings subject to the payroll tax. The 2013 plan recommended that a bipartisan commission be formed to come up with a package of Social Security changes, saying the original 2010 plan \u201ccould serve as a starting point for reform.\u201d", "Simpson-Bowles offered recommendations to strengthen Medicare\u2019s financing, too, including raising the eligibility age and income-related premiums, and enacting changes and reductions to payments for care. Medicare Part A, which covers hospital stays, hospice and some home health costs, is expected to be able to cover only 87 percent of costs in 2028.", "But Clinton didn\u2019t talk about any of these specific proposals.", "Here\u2019s an excerpt from a speech to Morgan Stanley on April 18, 2013: \u201cWell, this may be borne more out of hope than experience in the last few years. But Simpson-Bowles \u2014 and I know you heard from Erskine earlier today \u2014 put forth the right framework. Namely, we have to restrain spending, we have to have adequate revenues, and we have to incentivize growth. It\u2019s a three-part formula. The specifics can be negotiated depending upon whether we\u2019re acting in good faith or not. And what Senator Simpson and Erskine did was to bring Republicans and Democrats alike to the table, and you had the full range of ideological views from I think Tom Coburn to Dick Durbin. And they reached an agreement. But what is very hard to do is to then take that agreement if you don\u2019t believe that you\u2019re going to be able to move the other side. And where we are now is in this gridlocked dysfunction. So you\u2019ve got Democrats saying that, you know, you have to have more revenues; that\u2019s the sine qua non of any kind of agreement. You have Republicans saying no, no, no on revenues; you have to cut much more deeply into spending. Well, looks what\u2019s happened. We are slowly returning to growth. It\u2019s not as much or as fast as many of us would like to see, but, you know, we\u2019re certainly better off than our European friends, and we\u2019re beginning to, I believe, kind of come out of the long aftermath of the \u201908 crisis.\u201d", "In another speech in April 2013 to the National Multifamily Housing Council, Clinton is quoted as saying she won\u2019t discuss the details of the proposals but approves of both cutting spending and growing revenues. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sort of piecemeal all their recommendations, but their overall approach is right, because here\u2019s what they basically say. They say we need to constrain spending, we need to have adequate revenues, and we\u2019ve got to incentivize growth. I mean, that\u2019s pretty much the framework for Simpson-Bowles.\u201d", "Another excerpt of that speech shows Clinton talking about both sides compromising on budget issues: \u201cSo, I really think that we have to get back into the business of democracy and listening to each other, working with each other, and quit drawing lines and taking positions that are against compromise of any kind, because, I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019ve just lived long enough. I think usually, you know, you try to come to the table and figure out how to make it as close to a win-win as you can, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do, and the whole world is watching us.\u201d", "As for the candidates\u2019 positions on Social Security and Medicare, there has been very little discussion of that during this campaign. Clinton\u2019s website says she\u2019ll fight attempts at \u201cprivatization,\u201d oppose raising the retirement age or reducing cost-of-living adjustments, and expand income subject to the Social Security payroll tax. On Medicare, she proposes some steps aimed at lowering prescription drug costs and backs allowing those over age 55 to buy into Medicare. Trump has said he wouldn\u2019t make any changes to either program.

So I think that it\u2019s something \u2014 I would like \u2014 you know, obviously as somebody who has been through it, I would like it not to last as long because I think it\u2019s very distracting from what we should be doing every day in our public business. I would like it not to be so expensive. I have no idea how you do that. I mean, in my campaign \u2014 I lose track, but I think I raised $250 million or some such enormous amount, and in the last campaign President Obama raised 1.1 billion, and that was before the Super PACs and all of this other money just rushing in, and it\u2019s so ridiculous that we have this kind of free for all with all of this financial interest at stake, but, you know, the Supreme Court said that\u2019s basically what we\u2019re in for. So we\u2019re kind of in the wild west, and, you know, it would be very difficult to run for president without raising a huge amount of money and without having other people supporting you because your opponent will have their supporters. So I think as hard as it was when I ran, I think it\u2019s even harder now.", "Both of those excerpts \u2014 which we provide in full \u2014 do not show Clinton saying that she needs Wall Street money to run a successful campaign. It shows her saying she needs a lot of money to run a successful campaign, presumably with the hope that some in her audience at Goldman Sachs and General Electric will support her.", "So why did Trump, who was reading from a piece of paper, say that the memo, \u201cSays here, quote, \u2018Needs Wall Street money to successfully run her campaign\u2019?", "The memo was written by a Clinton campaign researcher who flagged potential problematic statements from Clinton\u2019s paid speeches by subject area. Both of the excerpts above were under the heading, \u201cCLINTON ADMITS NEEDING WALL STREET FUNDING.\u201d", "That header\u00a0characterized how Clinton\u2019s critics may use the speeches against her, and that is exactly how Trump used it. But that\u2019s not what she actually said. She admitted to needing a lot of money to run a campaign.", "How much money has Clinton raised from Wall Street donors? Is it true that that\u2019s \u201cwhere she gets all the money,\u201d as Trump said? No.", "For Wall Street donations, we turn to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign donations on its website opensecrets.org. The center defines \u201cWall Street\u201d donations as contributions from those in the securities and investment\u00a0industry, which includes hedge funds, and the commercial banking industry.", "In the 2016 campaign, Clinton so far has received\u00a0$7,498,185 from the\u00a0securities and investment industry and\u00a0$1,945,460 from those in the commercial banking industry for a total of a little more than $9.4 million, according to the center.", "The $9.4 million represents just 2.5 percent of the $373.3 million the Clinton campaign has raised so far, according to the center.\u00a0That\u2019s far less than what Trump claimed when he said, \u201cHillary Clinton has received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds.\u201d", "Trump gets closer \u2014 but still falls short \u2014 if we include money that outside groups supporting Clinton have received in donations from Wall Street donors.", "According to the center, the Clinton campaign and outside groups that support her received a total of\u00a0$58,849,957 from\u00a0the securities and investment industry. Add to that the\u00a0$1,945,460 that the Clinton campaign received from those in the commercial banking industry, and the total in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds comes to almost $61 million for both the Clinton campaign and outside groups supporting her.", "The $61 million represents nearly 12 percent of the $516.8 million that Clinton and outside groups supporting her have received from all donors.", "The Trump campaign and outside groups supporting him received just\u00a0$585,397\u00a0from the securities and investment industry, and his campaign received only $122,379 from commercial banks. So he has a point that Wall Street has given her much more support. But Trump exaggerated the amount the Clinton campaign received and was wrong to say that\u00a0Wall Street is where \u201cshe gets all the money.\u201d", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9afcea89-9dc3-4fc0-9ba6-879eab977e6d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
