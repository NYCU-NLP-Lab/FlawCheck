He missed 435 of 835 votes, or more than 52 percent, during his final four years. After that, Smathers declined to run for re-election and became a lobbyist.", "If we look at the sheer number of missed votes over a similar length of time, Paula Hawkins skipped 245 over six years, while Edward Gurney missed 293.

His career rate was 7.7 percent.", "But back to Floridians: A Rubio spokesman pointed out that Bob Graham, who ran for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, missed about the same number of votes during his campaign as Rubio did.", "That was a compelling bit of trivia to check. We found that between April 2015 and March 2016, the months Rubio was on the trail, he missed 157 of 242 votes, a 65 percent absentee rate. (Rubio's campaign clarified that he both declared and ended his campaign in the middle of those months, so his absentee rate then\u00a0was 53.3 percent.)", "Graham missed 149 of 459 votes between January and November 2003, roughly the time he considered and campaigned for the presidency. That\u2019s an absentee rate of 32 percent. He\u00a0underwent heart surgery on Jan. 31 that year, which caused him to miss votes before his official campaign launch on May 6. (Rubio's campaign noted that between May 6 and when Graham\u00a0dropped out on Oct. 6, Graham's absentee rate was 50.4 percent.)", "That overall period also accounted for three-quarters of Graham\u2019s missed votes over 18 years in the Senate. Graham routinely spent months without missing a single roll call vote.", "Finally, overall voting trends in the U.S. Senate do change. Spessard Holland was a senator for 24 years between 1946 and 1971. GovTrack noted that in that time period, the average absentee rate for his peers was considerably higher \u2014 14.5 percent.", "Our ruling", "Murphy said, \"Sen. Rubio has the worst vote attendance record of any Florida senator in nearly 50 years.\"", "Rubio has the highest absentee rate since Smathers, who left office in 1969. There are plenty of ways to slice the data: Some senators missed more votes overall, and his record is largely in line with other presidential candidates from the U.S. Senate.
