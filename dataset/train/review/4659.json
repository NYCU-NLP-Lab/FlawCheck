["About this rating", "On 23 August 2017, comedy web site Funny or Die posted an article appearing to report that Harry Potter series author J.K. Rowling had taken vengeance on a Twitter critic by buying his home. \"Two years ago,\" the article says, \"Rowling tweeted this, in support of refugees coming to Europe.\"", "The article includes the following, which is a real tweet posted by Rowling in September 2015:", "If you can't imagine yourself in one of those boats, you have something missing.

Rowling (@jk_rowling) September 4, 2015", "The article veers into satire at this point with an entirely fabricated tweet. J.K. Rowling never responded to @lukekocura, vowing that she would own his \"shack\" within two years. Nor did she then follow up two years later, bitterly inviting @lukekocura to visit his former home. The article also includes several details about \"Luke Kocura\", all of which are entirely fabricated for comedic effect.", "Despite being published on a comedy web site, the Funny or Die article appears to have fooled plenty of Twitter users.", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
