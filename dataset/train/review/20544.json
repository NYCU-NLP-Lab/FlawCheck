["About this rating", "Some of the most spectacular images of natural phenomena in the annals of photography are long-exposure shots of lightning, such as this example reportedly captured by art photographer Amery Carlson during a lightning storm off the coast of Ventura, California:", "A similar eye-catching image has been widely reposted on the Internet with captions identifying it as a \"Long Exposure Picture of a Lightning Bolt Hitting a Tree,\" supposedly a sensational capturing of lightning striking a tree and producing an amazingly colorful result:", "However, this image is actually an artistic work (a form of light painting) created from a composite of two different photographs, as the creator of this image, Darren Pearson of dariustwin.com, told us:", "The original photo was posted to flickr on March 20th, 2010. It is not real, it's a composite of two photographs: One is mine (a photo of a tree taken at the Presidio in San Diego, CA) and the other is from the NOAA webpage:", "My image is a long exposure, 619 seconds, taken at night. During this time, I used 'el wire' to create the blue smoke-looking effect, and a color-gelled spotlight to give the tree a pink glow.", "The lightning bolt was an idea that my roommate Joey (also a photographer/filmmaker) had while I was processing the photo. He mentioned, \"You know what would be incredible? A lightning bolt striking the tree!\" I was amused by this idea, and added in the lightning, which I thought looked awesome!", "I never intended it to be taken for a real photo of lightning striking a tree. It was meant to be an artistic expression, but turned into an internet misinformation fiasco.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
