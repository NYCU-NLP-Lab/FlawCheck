But Trump made his remark when he was asked about raising the federal minimum wage to $15. He said he was opposed to raising the minimum wage; he did not say that the overall wages are currently too high.", "\u201c[T]axes too high, wages too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is,\u201d he said.

For instance, here\u2019s Trump on Sept. 12 speaking at a National Guard Association Convention: \u201cMy plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military and the elimination of the defense \u2014 and we have to do this so quickly, it\u2019s a disaster \u2014 of the defense sequester.

Let\u2019s start with the claim that Clinton \u201cbleached\u201d some of her emails, which Trump went on to describe as unusual and expensive. This frequent line from Trump is wrong on two counts: The software used to delete Clinton\u2019s emails is free, and no chemicals were used. The FBI said that Platte River Networks, which set up and maintained Clinton\u2019s server, used an open-source software program called BleachBit. BleachBit debunks Trump\u2019s claims on its FAQ page: \u201cActually, it is completely free of charge for everyone in all situations.\u201d It also says, \u201cBleachBit is neither a chemical nor a physical device.

It is true that 31,830 emails that Clinton\u2019s lawyers deemed personal were deleted after Clinton received a subpoena from a Republican-controlled House committee investigating the 2012 deaths of four Americans in Benghazi. But there is no evidence that Clinton knew that the emails were deleted after the subpoena was issued. The Clinton campaign directed a contractor managing Clinton\u2019s server to delete the emails in December 2014. But the contractor didn\u2019t get around to deleting the emails until late March 2015, after the subpoena was issued.
