What we found is that while some accounts have been challenged, none have been shown to be untrue by any objective measure.", "We\u2019ll discuss the situation surrounding each accuser.", "Jessica Leeds", "Leeds told the New York Times that in the 1980s, Trump groped her during an airplane flight to New York. According to the New York Times, Leeds \"told the story to at least four people close to her, who also spoke with The New York Times.\"", "The Trump campaign offered a contrary account from a man who said he was on that flight. Anthony Gilberthorpe told the New York Post that Leeds was the one who was being flirtatious and that he saw nothing inappropriate. Gilberthorpe has a checkered past involving his revelation that he procured young boys for high-ranking British politicians, but more importantly, he told the Post he has no evidence to support his story.", "Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson challenged Leeds\u2019 story on the grounds that the airplane Pierson said Leeds flew in didn\u2019t have armrests as Leed\u2019s described. No one knows what sort of plane Leeds was in.", "For the most part, it\u2019s word against word.", "Mindy McGillivray", "McGillivray told the Palm Beach Post that in 2003, Trump grabbed her behind at a Mar-a-Lago concert. McGillivray was assisting photographer Ken Davidoff. Davidoff told the Post reporter he \"vividly remembers when McGillivray pulled him aside moments after the alleged incident and told him, \u2018Donald just grabbed my ass!\u2019 \"", "The counter information comes from the conservative website thegatewaypundit, which claims that there was no concert on the day Davidoff said. But the website asserts that without proof.", "Even if the photographer got the date wrong, and there\u2019s no proof that he did, that doesn\u2019t debunk the allegation.", "Natasha Stoynoff", "Stoynoff wrote in People magazine that during a pause in a 2005 interview with Trump and his wife Melania, Trump and she were alone in a room briefly where he forcibly kissed her. She told a co-worker, friends and family soon after the event happened but did not include it in her article.", "The counter information comes from Trump\u2019s former butler Anthony Senecal who told the Palm Beach Post that \"it never happened.\" \u00a0Melania Trump also disputes later meeting Stoynoff on the street as Stoynoff said.", "Again, we have the confirmation of Stoynoff\u2019s friends, and at most, it\u2019s her word against Senecal\u2019s.", "Summer Zervos", "Zervos was a former contestant on Trump\u2019s reality show The Apprentice. She said she went to Trump\u2019s golf course in Palos Verdes, Calif., in 2007 to apply for a job and Trump forcibly kissed her and groped her. In a news conference, a social worker said that Zervos told her about the encounter in 2010, years before Trump announced his presidential bid.", "Trump posted on Facebook that he never met Zervos at a hotel and that she stayed in touch with him. Trump wrote that as recently as April this year, she invited him to come to her restaurant in California. Also, Zervos\u2019cousin said she only had good things to say about Trump.", "Trump\u2019s account raises questions about Zervos\u2019 contact with him, but it does not rebut her claim.", "Claims from other women", "There are five other women who say that Trump groped or kissed them without their consent. They are Cassandra Searles, Rachel Crooks, Kristen Anderson, Jill Harth and Temple Taggert McDowell.", "We found no evidence to undermine their claims other than Trump\u2019s own denials.", "We asked the Trump campaign to send us details that would disprove the women\u2019s accounts and did not hear back.", "Our ruling", "Trump said that the stories of him groping or forcing himself on women \"have been largely debunked.\" His campaign offered no evidence of that. We found that five of the nine stories have not been independently disputed. Of the remaining four stories, the women told friends, family or colleagues at the time, which provides some support. On the flip side, there is the account of Trump\u2019s former butler and a man who acknowledges that he has no proof of his version of events.", "While some of the women\u2019s stories have been questioned, not one has been conclusively debunked, and the majority of the stories haven\u2019t been challenged by any facts other than Trump\u2019s denials.", "We rate this claim False.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa622a1b-1c53-4b62-b3ec-629c8a468bc5", "Daily Beast, All of Donald Trump\u2019s Accusers: A Timeline of Every Alleged Grope and Assault, Oct. 14, 2016", "New York Post, Trump camp puts forward witness to refute sex assault claim, Oct. 14, 2016", "New York Times, Two Women Say Donald Trump Touched Them Inappropriately, Oct. 12, 2016", "Washington Post, Woman says Trump reached under her skirt and groped her in early 1990s, Oct. 14, 2016", "New York Times, Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private, May 14, 2016", "Palm Beach Post, Palm Beach Post exclusive: Local woman says Trump groped her, Oct. 12, 2016", "Thegatewaypundit.com, HERE IT IS=> List of Debunked Groper Allegations by Corrupt Media Against Donald Trump, Oct. 15, 2016", "Palm Beach Post, Trump\u2019s former butler denies groping claims against candidate, Oct. 13, 2016", "People, Physically Attacked by Donald Trump \u2013 a PEOPLE Writer\u2019s Own Harrowing Story, Oct. 12, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
