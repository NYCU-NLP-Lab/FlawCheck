["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on September 27, 2018", "In his press conference at the United Nations, President Donald Trump defended his decision not to ask the\u00a0FBI to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. But his reasons for his decision did not square with the facts:", "Trump made his remarks on the eve of dueling testimony by Kavanaugh and Ford\u00a0before the Senate Judiciary Committee.", "The president, who was wrapping up a visit to the United Nations, was asked numerous questions about accusations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh while he was in high school and college. Three women have made separate accusations \u2014 including Ford, who has told the committee that Kavanaugh \u201cphysically and sexually assaulted\u201d her in high school in the early 1980s.", "Here\u2019s the exchange that Trump had at the press conference:", "Reporter, Sept. 26:\u00a0Mr. President, thank you very much. Of course, what you\u2019re looking forward to tomorrow is the hearings with Judge Kavanaugh before the Judiciary Committee.\u00a0In 1991, when Joe Biden passed along to the Bush 41 White House the allegations that Anita Hill had raised against Clarence Thomas, the Bush White House asked the FBI to look into it as part of Judge Thomas\u2019s background investigation \u2014 not a criminal investigation, but the background investigation. When these allegations were raised, why didn\u2019t this White House do the same thing? And with all of the allegations that are coming out now about Judge Kavanaugh, was there an opportunity missed here to have investigators look into this and get some sort of clarity one way or the other?", "Trump: Well, the FBI told us they\u2019ve investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times, many times over the years. They know him very well. But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint. They didn\u2019t know the location. They didn\u2019t know the time. They didn\u2019t know the year. They didn\u2019t know anything. And it\u2019s like, where do you go? Also, it\u2019s not for the FBI. If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, \u201cThey don\u2019t do this.\u201d And he said it very clearly.", "Let\u2019s first look at the president\u2019s claim that there was nothing for the FBI to investigate.", "The president said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t know the location. They didn\u2019t know the time. They didn\u2019t know the year. They didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d That is not true in Ford\u2019s case.", "Of the three accusers, Ford has given the most detailed account of her allegations.", "In a July 30 letter to the Sen. Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford said the alleged attack occurred in a \u201csuburban Maryland area home\u201d in the \u201cearly 1980s\u201d when both Kavanaugh and Ford were in high school. She told the Washington Post\u00a0in a Sept. 16 article that it occurred in the summer of 1982 at a house in Montgomery County, not far from the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase.", "In\u00a0an update\u00a0to the Senate judiciary investigation posted on Sept. 23,\u00a0the committee states that it \u201clearned the identities of the four other individuals Dr. Ford claimed were at the party when the incident took place.\u201d The committee identified them as Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, Patrick J. Smyth and Leland Ingham Keyser.", "All this is more than enough information for the FBI to reopen its background investigation of Kavanaugh \u2014 if directed to do so by the president.", "That is exactly what happened in the fall of 1991, when Anita Hill accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas\u00a0of sexual harassment when the two worked together at the Education Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the early 1980s.", "Trump made reference to that case when he inaccurately quoted Biden, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Thomas confirmation hearings.", "The Thomas confirmation hearings began on Sept. 10, 1991, and continued through Sept. 20, 1991, without any public knowledge of Hill\u2019s accusations. NPR\u2019s Nina Totenberg broke the story when she\u00a0interviewed Hill\u00a0for an Oct. 6, 1991, broadcast.", "In her report, Totenberg included a statement from the White House saying it learned of the accusations on Sept. 23, 1991.", "Totenberg, Oct. 6, 1991:\u00a0Last night the White House, responding to inquiries from NPR, issued a statement saying that it had been informed by the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 23 about the allegation against Thomas and that the president had directed the FBI to conduct an investigation. Two days later, the White House reviewed the report and, quote, \u201cdetermined that the allegation was unfounded,\u201d close quote. A White House spokesman said the president continues to believe that Judge Thomas is eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, but several senators contacted by NPR say they are troubled by the Hill allegations and the long delay in investigating them by Chairman Biden.", "Biden and his staff, as Totenberg\u2019s report mentioned, came under criticism at the time for what some perceived as a slow response to Hill\u2019s accusations.", "\u201cBy the time Clarence Thomas was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee the week of September 10, Hill had contacted the staff of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s chairman, Joseph Biden. She says that while Biden\u2019s staff seemed interested, it was not until 10 days later, after repeated calls from her, that she was interviewed by the FBI,\u201d Totenberg said in her Oct. 6, 1991, report.", "In an Oct. 8, 1991, floor speech, Biden said that it wasn\u2019t until after the Sept. 20, 1991, hearing that he was able to get Hill\u2019s permission to have the FBI investigate her allegations.", "Setting aside Biden\u2019s response time, there is no doubt that the committee chairman at the time was involved in the decision to refer Hill\u2019s charges to the FBI.", "On Oct. 5, 1991, the White House issued a statement that said the White House and committee jointly agreed to direct the FBI to conduct a \u201cfull, thorough and expeditious investigation,\u201d according to an Oct. 6, 1991, story in Newsday (available on Nexis).", "Newsday, Oct. 6, 1991:\u00a0The White House last night released the following statement to Newsday.", "\u201cOn Sept. 23, the allegation was brought to the attention of the Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee immediately informed the White House. In consultation with the committee, the White House\u00a0promptly directed the FBI to conduct a full, thorough and expeditious investigation.\u00a0Upon completion of the FBI investigation on Sept. 26, the report was submitted to the White House and the committee. The White House reviewed the report and determined that the allegation was unfounded. The president continues to believe that Judge Thomas is eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court and expects him to be confirmed promptly.\u201d", "Also, Sen. Alan Simpson, a Republican, defended\u00a0the committee chairman, Biden, and the committee members in an Oct. 8, 1991, floor speech. Simpson called criticism that the committee did not take Hill\u2019s charges seriously \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cwholly without foundation.\u201d", "Simpson, Oct. 8, 1991: And to say that the chairman, somehow, is not responsive to that is wrong; or the members \u2014 that is just plain wrong. We take it very seriously. The Judiciary Committee took those charges against a Supreme Court nominee extremely seriously. The committee took the most serious and effective course it could possibly take under the circumstances. It turned those charges over to the FBI for investigation. And the FBI investigation included interviewing Professor Hill, Judge Thomas, and all of the possible corroborating witnesses suggested by Professor Hill. These were her suggestions as to who the FBI interview.", "For his part, Biden gave a fiery defense\u00a0of his actions when the confirmation hearings resumed on Oct. 11, 1991. Some Republicans, including current Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, have referred to Biden\u2019s remarks that day as justification for not referring the accusations against Kavanaugh to the FBI. Trump did, too, but he misquoted Biden in doing so.", "In answering the question about why he did not refer the allegations to the FBI, Trump said, \u201cAlso, it\u2019s not for the FBI. If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, \u2018They don\u2019t do this.\u2019 And he said it very clearly.\u201d", "That is not what Biden said.", "In remarks directed at \u201cmy pontificating colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike,\u201d Biden said\u00a0it\u2019s not the FBI\u2019s job to draw conclusions or make recommendations to the committee. The FBI turns over its material to the committee for its consideration, Biden said.", "Biden, Oct. 11, 1991:\u00a0And the last thing I will point out, the next person who refers to an FBI report as being worth anything, obviously doesn\u2019t understand anything. FBI explicitly does not, in this or any other case reach a conclusion, period, period. So, Judge, there is no reason why you should know this. The reason why we cannot rely on the FBI report, you would not like it if we did because it is inconclusive. They say he said, she said, and they said, period. So when people wave an FBI report before you, understand they do not, they do not reach conclusions. They do not make, as my friend points out more accurately, they do not make recommendations.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that Biden said that \u201cno one has proved a pattern\u201d of sexual harassment against Thomas.\u00a0\u201cIf there is not a pattern, to me that is probative. That has some dispositive weight. No one has proved a pattern here of anything. We are not finished yet. But no one has proved a pattern,\u201d he said.", "A deadlocked Senate Judiciary Committee moved Thomas\u2019 nomination without recommendation to the full Senate for a vote. In the final floor vote, Biden\u00a0voted against Thomas, who was approved 52 to 48.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
