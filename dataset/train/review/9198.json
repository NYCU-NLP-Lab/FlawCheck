["One Facebook post sharing the story, which we\u2019ve archived here, reports that Atuche \u201cis a hacker and he had done something that no hacker had ever attempted to do before.\u201d\u00a0It adds that \u201cAtuche hacked the US government and gave all members of his family and 15 of his friends\u2019 permanent American citizenship. As we speak the American government is in a process of deporting all 33 people who got their citizenship as a result of Atuche\u2019s hack.\u201d", "The story has made its way into numerous YouTube videos, which have racked up more than 10,000 views between them. We\u2019ve archived some of them here, here, and here.", "Numerous blogs across Africa and the United States have shared the same story, with a picture of a man being taken away by an officer from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). We\u2018ve archived some of them here, here, and here.", "The posts claim that Atuche was one of \u201cover 80 Nigerians\u201d\u00a0who were\u00a0\u201carrested in the USA for internet fraud and other online crimes\u201d.", "This part of the story appears to be based on a real-life event.", "In August, the FBI announced a 252-count indictment that accused 80 people in the US and Nigeria -- including 77 Nigerians -- of participating in a \u201cmassive conspiracy to steal millions of dollars through a variety of fraud schemes.\u201d\u00a0The names and offences of all 77 Nigerians were published by the FBI -- you can read the indictment here. There is no\u00a0\u201cAbaeze Atuche\u201d on the list.", "We ran several reverse image searches of the photo used alongside some versions of the story, supposedly depicting Atuche. We found that it shows one of the 80 people who were really were charged in the FBI probe -- you can see him in this ABC News video, wearing the same floral shirt.", "All 80 of the suspects were picked up over allegations of involvement of cyber crime and internet fraud amounting to an estimated $46 million. These alleged cyber attacks were against private citizens and companies, and the FBI report makes no link to any bid for US citizenship.", "We traced the article to find its earliest version. After multiple searches, we found that the article was first published by Ihlaya News, a South African parody website which has been the source of several viral stories fact-checked by AFP. The Afrikaans word \u2018Ihlaya\u2019 translates as \u2018joke\u2019 in English, while its tagline, \u2018nuusparodie waarvan jy hou\u2019, translates to \u2018news parody you like\u2019.", "So, the story was invented, playing on the image some of Nigerians abroad and stereotypes surrounding the country\u2019s notorious online fraudsters. But like several other tales that have migrated from the parody site, it was subsequently reported as genuine news.", "You can find other fact-checks of stories that originated on the site here and here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
