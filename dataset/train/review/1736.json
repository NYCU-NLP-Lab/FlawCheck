["By Angelo Fichera and Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on November 13, 2020", "A baseless conspiracy theory claims that a secret supercomputer was used to switch votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. Experts \u2014 and the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency \u2014 have said the theory is a hoax and that safeguards, including paper trails, would deter such an effort.", "As President-elect Joe Biden prepares a transition to the White House and President Donald Trump mounts challenges to election results, federal and state officials have declared that the 2020 election was the \u201cmost secure in American history.\u201d", "But a conspiracy theory that has been swirling online suggests the opposite, baselessly claiming that a supercomputer and special software were used to systematically switch votes and cement Biden\u2019s victory.", "That bogus theory is directly disputed by federal and state officials, as well as experts who study election security.", "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has flatly rejected such claims. The agency\u2019s director, Chris Krebs \u2014 who was appointed by Trump \u2014 called the theory \u201cnonsense\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d", "CISA has said that safeguards \u2014 including auditable logs and software checks \u2014 used by states ensure accuracy in the vote totals.", "Still, in the days after the election, the theory has received significant attention on social media and on national TV.", "Sidney Powell, an attorney who has represented Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, espoused it on Fox Business on Nov. 6 \u2014 saying that ballots were changed \u201cusing the Hammer program and a software program called Scorecard\u201d \u2014 and that she had \u201cevidence that that is exactly what happened.\u201d She repeated the theory two days later to Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo.", "We reached out to Powell to ask what her supposed \u201cevidence\u201d was and she didn\u2019t provide any, telling us instead to \u201cStay tuned.\u201d", "The conspiracy theory appeared several days before the election on a dubious blog called the American Report, which ran an Oct. 31 story claiming that Biden was \u201cusing SCORECARD and THE HAMMER To Steal Another Presidential Election.\u201d", "The story cited a so-called \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d Dennis Montgomery, to claim that an intelligence supercomputer (\u201cHAMMER\u201d) and accompanying software (\u201cSCORECARD\u201d) had the capability to hack elections and steal votes. It went on to claim with no proof that Biden and former President Barack Obama had won reelection in 2012 using the system, and that Biden had beaten his rival in the Democratic primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders, through such means.", "Montgomery has a history of making dubious claims going back more than a decade.", "A company he co-owned, called eTreppid, won\u00a0millions of dollars\u00a0in federal defense contracts following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But, according to an FBI investigation in 2006, his partner in the business said that he deceived Pentagon officials.", "In one case, according to an FBI interview with the business partner, Montgomery fabricated a test for Department of Defense officials of the company\u2019s \u201crecognition software\u201d for weapons. While the officials waited inside the company\u2019s office, the business partner said, Montgomery took a toy bazooka into a nearby field and, instead of having the technology actually recognize the weapon, he pinged the cell phone of an employee, who was waiting to push a button and make a picture of a bazooka appear on the screen.", "In another case detailed in a\u00a02014 book, the CIA believed that one of Montgomery\u2019s programs could detect secret codes from al Qaeda that were hidden in broadcasts from the news network Al-Jazeera. Although this led to the grounding of U.S.-bound flights from France, Britain and Mexico in December 2003, the technology was ultimately determined to be bogus. Montgomery objected to that characterization and sued the author and publisher. But he failed to provide evidence that his technology actually worked, and the\u00a0judge ruled against him.", "The theory espoused in the American Report story doesn\u2019t make sense for several reasons, Dan Wallach, a computer science professor at Rice University who researches voting security, told us in a phone interview.", "The story claims that \u201cSCORECARD steals elections by tampering with the computers at transfer points of state election computer systems and outside third party data election result vaults.\u201d", "If a hacking operation tried to change votes at the state aggregation level, Wallach said, there are county-level results with which to compare those figures. And if a county\u2019s votes were manipulated, there are results from precincts \u2014 and individual paper ballots or individual paperless voting machines \u2014 to verify those figures.", "Ballot boxes, voting machines and election equipment are also subject to various chain-of-custody protections.", "\u201cThe implication of this conspiracy theory is that there can be an undetectable, irrevocable change made \u2014 and that implication is false,\u201d he said.", "Likewise, J. Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan, told us the conspiracy theory is \u201cnonsense.\u201d", "\u201cMost votes across the country are counted by computer scanners at polling places or, for mail-in ballots, at central locations in each county,\u201d Halderman, who is also director of the university\u2019s Center for Computer Security and Society, said in an email. \u201cElection workers then copy the totals from each scanner (most often using memory cards or USB sticks) to a computer called an election management system, which adds them up and produces the initial, unofficial results.\u201d", "\u201cHowever, every ballot scanner is required by law (under the Help America Vote Act of 2002) to produce a paper printout summarizing the vote totals for the ballots it counted,\u201d he continued. \u201cNearly every state, before it certifies the official election results, compares the reported results to the physical printout from each scanner. If an error or fraud affected the reporting process, it will be caught during this process, before the results are declared official. These routine checks both add an extra layer of security and help deter attackers from targeting the reporting process in the first place.\u201d", "The American Report story also argued that votes would be stolen in Florida when the state transferred data to a third party called VR Systems. As the fact-checking website Lead Stories points out, that company doesn\u2019t even work with vote tabulation.", "VR Systems Chief Operating Officer Ben Martin confirmed in a statement to us that the company \u201cdoes not do voter tabulation and is not connected to county or state voter tabulation systems.\u201d The company instead \u201cprovides elections software and services to election officials who manage the voter check-in process\u201d and also supports officials with websites and databases for voters to check polling locations and voter registration status.", "And while the American Report story claims the company has contracts in eight states, Martin said the company only does work in three.", "On Twitter and Facebook, thousands of users shared a false claim\u00a0that a CNN video from election night is evidence of the supposed vote-stealing operation in action.", "It\u2019s not.", "In the video, vote totals for Pennsylvania displayed on screen by CNN can be seen going up for Biden by 19,958 as they go down for Trump by that same amount.", "But the error was actually a simple mistake by a research firm that gathers results data for CNN and others; it wasn\u2019t a change in the reporting by election officials. (It\u2019s worth noting, though, that those vote tallies are unofficial tallies, not final, official results.) The mistake was corrected about an hour later.", "Edison Research, which provides vote tabulation data to CNN and other networks, said that the moment of Trump dropping by 19,958 was caused by a brief reporting error on its end.", "Rob Farbman, Edison\u2019s executive vice president, told us that Edison did receive the correct vote totals from Armstrong County in Pennsylvania through a state feed \u2014 which at that point in time was 24,233 votes for Trump and 4,275 votes for Biden. But a team member, while scouring individual county vote totals, then mistakenly entered the county\u2019s totals backwards \u2014 24,233 votes for Biden and 4,275 votes for Trump.", "A CNN source also confirmed that the matter came down to vote totals in Armstrong County being briefly transposed in the feed provided to the network, but that the accurate figures were soon restored.", "\u201cIt was simple human error,\u201d Farbman told us by email, noting the mistake was corrected about an hour later.", "Trump has secured 27,340 votes in Armstrong County, compared with Biden\u2019s 8,417. Biden\u2019s lead in the state is about 60,000 votes.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
