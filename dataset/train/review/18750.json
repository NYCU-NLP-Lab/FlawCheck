Kindly claim ownership and confirm for delivery here.\"", "Other posts echoed that message and showed screenshots of similar text messages, each seemingly addressing the recipient by their name and each including a link. One post uses the #SaveOurChildren hashtag, which is linked to the unfounded QAnon conspiracy theory that there is a global child-sex trafficking ring involving Democratic politicians and celebrities who have been supportive of the party.", "These posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Traffickers commonly prey on a victim\u2019s specific vulnerabilities and make promises aimed at addressing that person\u2019s needs as a way to impose their control and \"they may establish strong psychological and emotional ties with their victims before forcing or coercing them to engage in commercial sex.\"", "The text messages that appear in the Facebook posts seem similar to a so-called \"smishing\" scam that received news coverage in January.
