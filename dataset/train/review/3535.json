["Jab pani mein se bijli nikal jayegi, aur pani kheto mein jayega, toh pani mein se bijli nikal jayegi toh takat hi nikal jayegi, phir kheto mein pani kaam kya ayega (If electricity is removed from water and the water goes to the farm, such water will have no energy and will be useless in the farm- translated). AICC General Secretary and former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot is being roasted on social media after he purportedly made these daft remarks at a press conference. A 16-second clip is circulating widely on Twitter in which Gehlot can be heard saying these words. Sambit Patra, National spokesperson of the BJP tweeted about this video with the words \u201cIs it authentic? Is this the way Congress misguided our farmers?\u201d It was also shared by Akhilesh Mishra who is a former director of MyGoV. Mishra has now deleted his tweet. It has been tweeted by several others who are followed by the Prime Minister on the social media platform.", "Friends I received this video! Is it authentic??

Indeed he did, as can clearly be seen in the video which is real. But, did he mean these words? What was the context in which they were uttered?

A longer version of this video which explains the context has been posted below.", "The video is of a press conference by the Congress party on May 26. Watching the video in totality makes it clear that Gehlot is referring to Jan Sangh, the forerunner of the BJP. According to Gehlot, when he was young he had witnessed how Jan Sangh cadres were spreading misinformation about the Bhakra dam which was inaugurated by former PM Jawaharlal Nehru, spreading rumours that once electricity is removed from water, the water will become useless. He had said, \u201cI remember, during childhood there was the Jan Sangh. When the Bhakra dam was built, Jan Sangh cadres used to preach that \u2018Pandit Nehru has lost it. He is building a dam, on which he will construct a hydro power plant.
