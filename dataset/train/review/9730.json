["\u201cJoe Biden confuses President Trump with George Bush,\u201d says an October 25, 2020 Facebook post from Trump\u2019s campaign.", "The post includes a video of Biden speaking alongside his wife Jill at the start of\u00a0a fundraiser.", "\u201cWhat kinda country we\u2019re gonna be. Four more years of George, uh, George, uh, he uh, gonna find ourselves in a position where if, uh, Trump gets elected, uh, we\u2019re gonna be, uh, we\u2019re gonna be in a different world,\u201d Biden says in the clip.", "Trump\u2019s campaign has sought to portray Biden -- who has a history of misspeaking -- as sleepy and generally mentally unfit to hold the office of US president, and the claim that he was confused about who he was running against fits into that narrative.", "The claim also appears on Facebook here, here and here", "The full video of the event -- the \u201cI Will Vote\u201d concert -- shows that the Democratic candidate was responding to a question from actor George Lopez, who asked why someone who is undecided or thinking about not voting should vote, and vote for Biden.", "\u201cThis is the most consequential election in a long, long, long time. And the character of the country in my view is literally on the ballot,\u201d Biden responded, before going into the remarks in the clip.", "While Biden says \u201cGeorge,\u201d he does not mention Bush, the name of the president who preceded Barack Obama, and quickly refers to the potential impact of Trump being elected -- a clear sign he knows who he is running against.", "In addition to the claim about Biden confusing Trump with Bush, the president and his team have openly spread digitally altered images during the 2020 race.", "AFP Fact check has previously debunked manipulated videos of Biden that Trump has spread on social media, as well as an ad from his campaign that featured doctored images of his Democratic rival.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
