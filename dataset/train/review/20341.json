In 2013, benefits were $433.6 million less than in 2011.", "So across the two years where state funding was cut by nearly $800 million, school districts saved nearly $900 million in benefits. And that savings would be higher if you assume costs would have continued to rise from the 2011 levels (likely about 4.3 percent per year, according to the study).", "Another important factor: The Evers ad does not say it is referring to a funding change made more than five years ago in a single budget.", "Thus, viewers might assume school spending is $800 million less today than when Walker began.

That gap was more than $1 billion at one point but now is down to $183.6 million.", "Our rating", "In the ad, Evers claims Walker cut $800 million from schools.
