["About this rating", "In February 2020, readers asked us about the accuracy of reports that the actor and Oscar-winning director Clint Eastwood had resiled from his previous support for U.S. President Donald Trump and instead expressed support for the election of former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who is running in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.", "On Feb. 22, Fox News published an article with the headline: \"Clint Eastwood Backs Mike Bloomberg, Wishes Trump Would Be 'More Genteel' in Office.\" That piece reported that:", "\"Clint Eastwood is breaking his silence over the 2020 presidential hopeful he believes is best fit for office. The 89-year-old discussed the #MeToo movement, career highlights and dished on his political views in a revealing interview with the Wall Street Journal, and it turns out Mike Bloomberg has the actor's support. 'The best thing we could do is just get Mike Bloomberg in there,' Eastwood told the outlet.\"", "Similarly, CNN wrote that:", "Actor and director Clint Eastwood, a longtime supporter of Republican candidates, appeared to back Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg for president and criticized President Donald Trump's behavior in office in an interview published in The Wall Street Journal Friday. \"The best thing we could do is just get Mike Bloomberg in there,\" the Hollywood conservative said of the former New York mayor, according to the Journal. Eastwood told the newspaper that he approves of \"certain things\" that Trump has done as President, without going into further detail. He said, however, that he wishes Trump would behave \"in a more genteel way, without tweeting and calling people names,\" the Journal reported.", "Similar reports were published by USA Today, Newsweek, the Daily Beast and WBMA.", "Those articles accurately reported a statement attributed to Eastwood in a Wall Street Journal interview published on Feb. 21, 2020. The following is the relevant section of that article:", "As for the domestic political scene, Mr. Eastwood seems disheartened. \u201cThe politics has gotten so ornery,\u201d he says, hunching his shoulders in resignation. He approves of \u201ccertain things that Trump\u2019s done\u201d but wishes the president would act \u201cin a more genteel way, without tweeting and calling people names. I would personally like for him to not bring himself to that level.\u201d As he drives me back to my hotel, he expresses an affinity for another former mayor: \u201cThe best thing we could do is just get Mike Bloomberg in there\u201d [Emphasis added].", "To say that the \"best thing we could do\" would be to elect a particular candidate is, without doubt, an expression of support and preference for that candidate's election as president. Eastwood did not merely say he would find Bloomberg's election tolerable, he presented it as the best possible outcome. As such, the news articles highlighted above accurately reported what the director had said.", "Eastwood may, in the future, modify or add nuance to those remarks, or he might retract or reinforce them. However, his expression of support in the February 2020 interview for Bloomberg's election was undeniable.", "It was also relatively significant. Eastwood, who described himself as a libertarian in the Journal interview, expressed a preference for Trump's election in 2016 over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, although he added that that choice was \"tough.\" He was a prominent critic of former President Barack Obama and took part in the Republican National Convention in 2012.", "Although Bloomberg's policies place him to the ideological right of some of his Democratic primary rivals, and he was in the past elected as New York mayor on Republican and Independent platforms, he is still running as a Democrat in 2020. Eastwood's expression of a preference for a Democratic candidate, over the Republican president he supported four years earlier, was a significant shift by a public figure who is particularly widely admired among right-leaning Americans.", "Roberto, Melissa.\u00a0 \"Clint Eastwood Backs Mike Bloomberg, Wishes Trump Would Be 'More Genteel' in Office.\"\r\n\u00a0 Fox News.\u00a0 22 February 2020.", "Stracqualursi, Veronica.\u00a0 \"Actor Clint Eastwood Shows Support for Michael Bloomberg and Criticizes Trump's Behavior.\"\r\n\u00a0 CNN.\u00a0 22 February 2020.", "Yasharoff, Hannah.\u00a0 \"Clint Eastwood on 2020 Election: 'The Best Thing We Could Do Is Just Get Mike Bloomberg in There.'\"\r\n\u00a0 USA Today.\u00a0 23 February 2020.", "Crowley, James.\u00a0 \"Clint Eastwood Says He Wished Trump Behaved 'In a More Genteel Way,' Supports Mike Bloomberg.\"\r\n\u00a0 Newsweek.\u00a0 22 February 2020.", "Arciga, Julia.\u00a0 \"Clint Eastwood: Mike Bloomberg in Office Is 'the Best Thing We Could Do.'\"\r\n\u00a0 The Daily Beast.\u00a0 22 February 2020.", "Jackson, Danielle.\u00a0 \"Clint Eastwood Backs Michael Bloomberg for President, Criticizes Trump.\"\r\n\u00a0 Sinclair Broadcast Group/WBMA.\u00a0 23 February 2020.", "Varadarajan, Tunku.\u00a0 \"A Hollywood Legend Talks Politics.\"\r\n\u00a0 The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 21 February 2020.", "Hainey, Michael.\u00a0 \"Clint and Scott Eastwood: No Holds Barred in Their First Interview Together.\"\r\n\u00a0 Esquire.\u00a0 3 August 2016.", "Kasprak, Alex.\u00a0 \"Did Clint Eastwood Say Obama Was the 'Biggest Fraud Ever Perpetrated on the American People'?\"\r\n\u00a0 Snopes.com.\u00a0 10 November 2018.", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
