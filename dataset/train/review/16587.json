["Ahead of the Delhi assembly elections on February 8, a 26-second video has gone viral which shows a man on wheelchair accepting a blanket. After introducing himself and thanking the organiser for distributing blankets to differently-abled persons, he is seen as getting up from the wheelchair and walking away. This video has been labelled as an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) propaganda video with the insinuation that the event was stage-managed and those receiving blankets were masquerading as differently-abled persons.", "On January 30, @ugtunga, a Twitter-user, posted the viral video and said, \u201cMagic blanket from AAP.
