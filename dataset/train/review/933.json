["About this rating", "In December 2017, USA Today published a searing column from its editorial board concluding that Donald Trump was not suited to be president of the United States, a piece that included the following passage:", "And as is the case with all of Trump's digital provocations, the president's words were deliberate. He pours the gasoline of sexist language and lights the match gleefully knowing how it will burst into flame in a country reeling from the #MeToo moment.", "A president who would all but call Sen.

Talk about a wolf in sheepskin.\u201c", "The view that Michelle Obama \"isn't fit to clean Melania Trump's toilet\" seems out of line with Julia Roberts's known political views. She appeared at a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump's main political opponent, during the 2016 election, and she helped raise money for Barack Obama's re-election in 2012.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
