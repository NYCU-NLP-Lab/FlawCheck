Those small fissures are what allows the trapped gas or oil to flow out of the rock they were trapped in.", "The practice, which is used to access resources in the eastern, western and southwestern areas of the country, is the reason that America is able to tap into oil reserves beneath the soil,\u00a0 according to the American Petroleum Institute.", "Although Wisconsin isn\u2019t home to the oil or natural gas that is accessed by fracking, it is home to several sand mines, which produce the specific type of sand needed during the fracking process.
