A few hours later, Trump hit back on Twitter, saying the place Lewis represents is \"crime infested.\"", "As many have noted, Lewis has had a long record of action, including dozens of arrests dozens for protesting segregation, enduring violence at the hands of state troopers and leading the fight for racial justice in the 1960s.", "But is Trump right that Lewis\u2019 district today isn\u2019t doing so hot?", "A transition team spokesman referred us to the district\u2019s unemployment, poverty and crime rates.
