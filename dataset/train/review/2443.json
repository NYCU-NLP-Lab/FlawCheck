It would be like arguing Texas is the highest-crime state because it has the most prison inmates. The latter may be true, but only because Texas has one of the highest populations. Comparing it to other states requires examining the number of inmates relative to the population (in which case Texas is not first).", "That\u2019s where the per capita rate comes in \u2014 which is the vaccination metric used by the CDC and referenced by Kleefisch.", "Cudaback also said Wisconsin\u2019s ability to administer vaccines is limited by its large long-term care population. Vaccines are made available to states based on population, but states are required to store enough doses for everyone in long-term care before any doses can be administered to other groups.
