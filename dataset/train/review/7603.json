(Getty)", "After years of promoting the theory that President Barack Obama was born in a foreign country -- one that has been consistently debunked by fact-checkers -- Donald Trump reversed course on Sept. 16, 2016, and said Obama was born in the United States.", "\"President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period,\" Trump said while briefly addressing the subject at the end of a campaign event at his newly built hotel in Washington.", "We\u2019ve separately ruled this a Full Flop. But Trump\u2019s other remarks on the so-called \"birther\" controversy have inspired fact-checks of their own.", "Trump prefaced his statement about Obama\u2019s birthplace by saying, \"Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean.\"", "We rated the first part of that claim\u00a0that \"Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy\" False.", "Here, we\u2019ll fact-check the assertion that Trump \"finished it.\"", "We didn\u2019t hear back from the Trump campaign, but the evening before Trump\u2019s announcement in Washington, Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser with the campaign, sent out a news release saying in part, \"In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised.\"", "So it appears that the campaign\u2019s argument is that Trump pushed for Obama to release the long form of his Hawaii birth certificate on April 27, 2011, several years after the birther controversy bubbled up. Previously, a shorter version of the document had been available, but skeptics had been calling for the full document to be released.", "Trump himself had made this case as early as Aug. 22, 2013, when he tweeted, \"Why are people upset w/ me over Pres Obama\u2019s birth certificate? I got him to release it, or whatever it was, when nobody else could!\"", "But for Trump\u2019s argument to hold water, we see two conditions that have to be met. First, did Trump \"finish\" advocating for the birther viewpoint once Obama released the long-form birth certificate? And second, did Obama\u2019s release of the long-form certificate \"finish\" the idea among American voters that Obama was born outside the United States?", "In both cases, the answer is no.", "Trump\u2019s continued\u00a0birther tweets", "Slate has produced a comprehensive index to the tweets by Trump -- all made after Obama\u2019s document release in 2011 -- in which the real-estate magnate either openly advocated birtherism or promoted skepticism about the official story of Obama\u2019s birth.", "The list includes about three dozen examples between November 2011 and November 2014.

Gallup asked whether respondents would say Obama was \"probably or definitely born in another country\" and found that the number dropped from 24 percent before the release in April 2011 to 13 percent after the release in May 2011.

Trump didn\u2019t \"finish\" fanning the flames of birther conspiracies once Obama released his long-form birth certificate in April 2011 -- he kept tweeting about it for at least another three and a half years.
