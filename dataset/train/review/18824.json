(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the claim about Coulter is accurate.", "Coulter made the statement several times, notably on The View and on Twitter in 2015.", "The particular quote in the meme comes from Coulter\u2019s 2015 appearance on The View where she discussed her book \"\u00a1Adios, America! The Left's plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole.\"", "As The View panel and Coulter discussed Coulter\u2019s anti-immigration views, guest host Ana Navarro asks Coulter if she\u2019s Native American.", "Coulter responds, \"Why, yes I am. I am a settler. I am descended from settlers \u2014 not from immigrants.\"", "\"I\u2019m not living in Cherokee nation; I did not immigrate to Cherokee nation,\" Coulter continued. \"We\u2019re living in America, which was created by settlers, not immigrants.\"", "Following the interview, genealogist Megan Smolenyak took a look at Coulter\u2019s family tree.
