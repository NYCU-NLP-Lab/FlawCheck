["President Barack Obama accused the \"gun lobby and its allies\" of lying about a bipartisan background check proposal that failed Wednesday in the Senate.", "From the Rose Garden, he charged:", "\"They claimed that it would create some sort of \u2018big brother\u2019 gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn't matter.\"", "The background check amendment, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was a compromise intended to replace stricter language in Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013.", "Did it, in fact, outlaw any gun registry?", "\u2018A path to a national gun registry\u2019", "The government requires background checks for gun sales by licensed firearms dealers \u2014 but not for sales between folks who aren\u2019t in the business of selling guns.", "Manchin and Toomey\u2019s amendment expanded the background check requirement to sales at gun shows and those advertised in publications and on the Web. But it didn\u2019t go as far as the original bill, which required background checks for all gun transfers with limited exceptions.", "That compromise wasn\u2019t enough to attract the 60-vote supermajority required to pass the amendment.

That personal information is then run through the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

An Arizona gun group spokesman told us the federal government would illegally collect background check information submitted to the FBI. Sarah Palin, arguing against the Toomey-Manchin amendment, said it \"creates a path to a national gun registry\" since dealers store background check forms and the bill didn\u2019t explicitly ban copying them, storing them in various locations (rather than centrally), or keeping a list of them.", "She didn\u2019t mention that existing federal law \u2014 referenced by the bill \u2014 already prohibits \"any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions.\"", "Our ruling", "Obama said opponents of compromise gun legislation \"claimed that it would create some sort of \u2018big brother\u2019 gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text.\" The Manchin-Toomey amendment referenced a registry ban already in federal law, then expanded it, prohibiting seizure of records, forbidding the attorney general from consolidating or centralizing records, and providing for fines and imprisonment for anyone who did consolidate or centralize records.
