In short, Democrats occupying the Oval Office tend to have a little better luck.", "Experts we spoke with largely held the same views.", "Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel said the statistics, from GDP to the unemployment rate, are striking, but noted that the president does not have \"all that control.\"", "\"That doesn\u2019t prove what the cause is,\" Frankel said.", "Christian Weller, a public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, did his own math on the GDP data since 1947.", "He found that the economy, through the last quarter of 2015 and after inflation, grew 3.8 percent under Democrats and 2.4 percent under Republicans.", "For President Barack Obama, the growth rate in his first term was 1.8 percent.
