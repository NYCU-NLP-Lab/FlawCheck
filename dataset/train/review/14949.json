["By Angelo Fichera and Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on October 15, 2020", "A viral conspiracy theory spread across social media baselessly claims former Vice President Joe Biden \u201chad SEAL Team 6 killed\u201d as part of a cover-up after a purportedly failed assassination of Osama bin Laden. President Donald Trump shared the unfounded theory on Twitter.", "A baseless conspiracy theory peddled at a recent conservative political conference migrated to social media, spreading the outrageous claim that former Vice President Joe Biden allowed the killing of Navy SEALs as part of a massive scandal.", "The unfounded theory has traveled across platforms, getting assistance on Twitter from President Donald Trump.", "\u201cHiden Biden and Obama may have had SEAL Team 6 killed! EXPLOSIVE: CIA Whistleblower Exposes Biden\u2019s Alleged Role with the Deaths of SEAL Team- Claims to have Documented Proof. RETWEET!!!\u201d read a tweet amplified by the president.", "The tweet linked to a story on a conservative commentary site about a supposed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who claims that former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was not actually killed in May 2011, and that the Obama administration had to pay Iran billions of dollars \u2014 and kill off Navy SEALs \u2014 as part of a cover-up. The underlying theory to this false narrative of a botched bin Laden raid intertwines several real events: an attack on U.S. military members in 2011, the Benghazi terrorist attacks in 2012 and the Iran nuclear agreement in 2015.", "Trump\u2019s retweet itself became a part of the narrative for online conspiracy theorists, who viewed it as confirmatory. One popular post relayed that Trump \u201cconfirms\u201d the \u201cintel\u201d that Biden \u201cdirectly participated in a plot to have #SEALTeam6 MURDERED, then arranged a massive cash deal as part of a cover up.\u201d Another said, \u201cTrump KNOWS.\u201d", "In reality, neither Trump nor his administration has publicly offered any evidence supporting the wild tale behind the viral posts.", "We reached out to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign to ask what evidence there is to support such a theory, and we were referred to the White House for comment. The White House did not answer our inquiry.", "The conspiracy theory was first aired during an American Priority conference, \u201cAMP Fest,\u201d held at Trump National Doral in Florida on Oct. 8-11, during a presentation by Nick Noe, a Trump supporter and Air Force veteran, and Charles Woods, the father of a former Navy SEAL killed in the Benghazi attacks.", "The presentation featured a video of Noe and Woods with Alan Harrow Parrot. Parrot has described himself as a falconer who has worked in the Middle East; he has previously claimed he tried to convey the whereabouts of bin Laden to the Bush administration.", "The claims made at AMP Fest were then pushed on social media by Anna Khait, a real estate agent and former \u201cSurvivor\u201d contestant who has written for the conservative website the Epoch Times. In a viral YouTube video whose description hawks\u00a0doomsday preparation\u00a0supplies, she suggests that the U.S. should \u201chang them\u201d when referring to former Obama administration officials she accuses of \u201ctreason.\u201d The video has been viewed nearly 3 million times.", "In May 2011, the U.S. announced it had assassinated bin Laden. SEAL Team 6 was later revealed to be the unit responsible for the mission.", "In the video played at AMP Fest, however, Parrot claims he has \u201cdocuments\u201d to prove that the SEALs had not actually killed bin Laden during the 2011 raid \u2014 and that the Obama administration paid $152 billion to Iran to cover it up.", "When we reached Parrot by phone, he said that he would provide us with a document he described as \u201ca Rosetta Stone of dates, facts.\u201d Instead, he sent a link to a DropBox\u00a0file with a seven-page paper dated Oct. 13, 2020, that largely repeats the unsubstantiated claims made in the video. It also included a recording purported to be a phone call with a lobbyist and a former congressman that included a discussion of rumors that bin Laden was in Iran.", "Although the dubious websites promoting his claims call him a \u201cCIA whistleblower,\u201d Parrot told us, \u201cI\u2019ve never been employed by the CIA, I do not work for the CIA.\u201d In fact, he said, \u201cI have never been hired by any agency anywhere.\u201d He blamed \u201cthe media\u201d for getting that wrong.", "In the video, Parrot suggests that Iran was secretly holding bin Laden prior to the raid so that Obama could execute a \u201ctrophy kill\u201d before his 2012 reelection campaign. Parrot claims Iran agreed to place bin Laden in the Pakistan compound and did so, but replaced him with a \u201cdouble\u201d before the SEALs executed their raid.", "\u201cThey killed Osama bin Laden\u2019s double,\u201d Parrot claims without any evidence. \u201cOne of the wives went running towards them before he shot him and said, don\u2019t shoot, he\u2019s a double.\u201d", "Robert O\u2019Neill \u2014 the former Navy SEAL who says he fired the shot that killed bin Laden \u2014 wrote on Twitter in response to the claims: \u201cVery brave men said goodby to their kids to go kill Osama bin Laden. We were given the order by President Obama. It was not a body double. Thank you Mr. President.\u201d", "Parrot\u2019s claim that Iran extorted the Obama administration for \u201c$152 billion\u201d over bin Laden is similarly unsubstantiated.", "He declined to explain that claim any further during our phone interview with him. But the claim appears to be based on a combination of two frequently misunderstood deals involving the U.S. and Iran.", "First, as we\u2019ve written before, the 2015 deal to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program resulted in unfreezing Iranian assets that were held mostly in foreign banks. Six countries and the European Union signed onto the agreement \u2014 it wasn\u2019t between the U.S. and Iran, alone. The U.S. did not send $150 billion in cash to Iran.", "Also, it\u2019s unclear how much money was freed up in the deal. A high-end estimate put the total worth of the Iranian assets at $150 billion. But the U.S. Treasury Department estimates the total was about $50 billion in \u201cusable liquid assets,\u201d according to 2015 testimony from Adam Szubin, acting under secretary of treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence. Most claims about the deal cite the high-end estimate, though, and often mischaracterize other aspects.", "The following year, the U.S. paid $1.7 billion to Iran as repayment of $400 million for military equipment that Iran paid for in the 1970s, but never received, plus interest.", "Three months after the raid that killed bin Laden, Taliban fighters shot down\u00a0a Chinook helicopter carrying 30 U.S. service members, including 15 members\u00a0of SEAL Team 6, who were on a mission to capture a Taliban leader in Afghanistan. The episode is often\u00a0referred to as \u201cExtortion 17,\u201d the call sign for the helicopter transporting the troops, and it has been the subject of previous conspiracy theories.", "Parrot references this event in the video, claiming, \u201cBiden paid with the blood of SEAL Team 6 when he had them killed.\u201d", "Noe asks in the video: \u201cThat means that SEAL Team 6 was shot down on purpose after the trophy kill to ensure that no dead man can tell no tales?\u201d", "\u201cYou are correct,\u201d Parrot says.", "Noe also said during the AMP Fest conference that, \u201cI don\u2019t know if any of you are familiar with the fact that SEAL team 6, after they killed bin Laden, almost all of them were killed very shortly after.\u201d", "But O\u2019Neill, the former SEAL (who has written a book telling his story about killing bin Laden), said none of the members who took part in the bin Laden mission died in Extortion 17.", "\u201cEvery SEAL from the UBL Mission is alive while you are reading this,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.", "SEAL Team 6 had an estimated 250 to 300 operators at the time, according to the Washington Post.", "Another former SEAL Team 6 member has written a book about the events and said he also shot bin Laden during the raid.", "There was a subsequent military investigation into Extortion 17, which found that the helicopter \u201cwas shot down with a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fired by a Taliban fighter as the helicopter neared its landing zone.\u201d", "Garry Reid, who was principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low intensity conflict, told Congress in 2014: \u201cWe do not believe Extortion 17 was the victim of a pre-planned enemy ambush, nor do we believe the enemy had advance knowledge of our flight route and landing zone location.\u201d", "On Sept. 11, 2012, terrorists in Libya attacked a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, killing four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya John Christopher Stevens. Two former Navy SEALs who were acting as security consultants \u2014 Charles Woods\u2019 son, Tyrone, and Glen Doherty \u2014 were among those killed. (Charles Woods said in the video that his son was no longer a SEAL at the time of the bin Laden raid.)", "After suggesting that Extortion 17 was planned by U.S. leaders to cover up a botched bin Laden raid, Noe asserts in the video that the helicopter was shot down using a missile from the CIA \u2014 and that the Benghazi attacks the following year was part of an effort to then cover that up. \u201cI assume that part of the plan for [then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton] was to eliminate everyone there at the Benghazi compound,\u201d he says.", "We found no evidence to back up those claims.", "When we asked Noe in a phone interview what documents he could provide to support them, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do the report for you.\u201d He then said he would respond to a follow-up email requesting more information, but he hasn\u2019t.", "The Benghazi attacks have been immensely scrutinized through several investigations \u2014 including a two-year probe by the Republican-led House Select Committee on Benghazi, which issued a final report in 2016. That report heavy criticized the Obama administration, including for insufficient security at the compound and its response to the attacks, but it does not tie the attacks to Extortion 17.", "It also offers nothing suggesting the attacks were orchestrated by the administration as part of a cover-up linked to the bin Laden assassination.", "We asked former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, who led the select committee\u2019s investigation, about that and he told us that he hadn\u2019t heard anything about the theory connecting the two.", "\u201cEverything the Committee found, for which there was an evidentiary basis, was included in our Select Committee report,\u201d Gowdy said in an email. \u201cI have never heard of either of the \u2018theories\u2019 you referenced, not one word from any witness, including the survivors of the attacks.\u201d", "In our phone interview with Noe, he said that he has now turned over documents regarding his findings to a member of Congress. He declined to tell us who that is.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
