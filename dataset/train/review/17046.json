Activists and lawmakers in the United Kingdom want to revamp the corporate tax law there, too. They argue, it wouldn\u2019t just benefit British taxpayers, but it also would help some of the poorest nations. Thanks to treaties in the United Kingdom they say, multinational companies do a dandy job of avoiding taxes on their operations in developing countries.", "This makes it even harder for these nations to meet the basic needs of their people.", "ActionAid UK, an international anti-poverty group, drove home the point with a tweet that said \"Malawi has just 300 doctors for 16 million people.\"", "For the record, the tweet appears to slightly undercount the population of Malawi -- a country surrounded by Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique. The World Bank estimated the nation's population at 16.7 million in 2014. The CIA World Factbook estimates a 2015 population nearing 18 million.", "The heart of this claim, however, is the number of doctors in the country.", "That\u2019s worthy of a deeper look.", "The doctor tally", "We contacted ActionAid UK but did not hear back. The most likely source behind the group\u2019s statement is the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Health Observatory.

(This includes some foreign doctors, and excludes physicians who applied solely on a temporary basis.)", "But that\u2019s at least a little bit off. Some of the names have been on the list for over 20 years. While those people might still be practicing in Malawi, there\u2019s no guarantee that they are and research shows that after about five years of working in the country, some doctors decide to leave, or shift into work that doesn\u2019t involve treating patients.", "Still, Adamson Mulla, a professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Malawi, told us while the list has its flaws, it\u2019s more accurate than ActionAid UK\u2019s estimate.", "\"The wisdom that there are 300 doctors in Malawi looks silly,\" Mulla said.", "Now whether the number is 300 or closer to 600, the count pales relative to the country\u2019s 16.7 million people.", "But the claim further ignores trained medical professionals who are not doctors.", "Malawi\u2019s clinical officers and medical assistants", "Helen de Pinho, an assistant professor of public health at Columbia University, has studied Malawi\u2019s health care system.

Clinical officers have at least four years of training in internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology and surgery.", "\"They are able to do basic and emergency surgery including caesarean sections, and in rural districts, \u00a0perform over 95 percent of the c-sections,\" de Pinho said. \"The clinical officers really are the backbone of the clinical services, especially in the more rural district hospitals.\"", "The Medical Council rolls show 925 clinical officers.
