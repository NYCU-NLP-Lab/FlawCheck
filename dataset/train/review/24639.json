Terminus is little more than a marker next to the southern entrance of Underground Atlanta (and a particularly distasteful safe haven for \"The Walking Dead\" fans).", "With two more communities on the edges of the city debating whether to join Atlanta, one city councilwoman was quoted in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution story talking about what recent annexations meant for the city.", "\"You brought in a mayor with the last annexation,\" District 11 Councilwoman Keisha Lance Bottoms said of Mayor Kasim Reed, referring to the 2006 annexation of what is now known as southwest Atlanta.", "Is that right, that growing Atlanta\u2019s borders created the opportunity for Reed, a former state senator, to become Atlanta\u2019s 59th mayor?

That south Fulton community, along with the DeKalb County sections of the historic Druid Hills community, is now weighing whether to join Atlanta.", "If there is another round of annexations, it will be the first changing of the city\u2019s borders since 2007, when Atlanta absorbed three Southside subdivisions.", "Bottoms, though, said she was referring to the much larger 2006 annexation that brought in about 2,000 residents from then-newly developed subdivisions along Cascade Road as it passes south and west out of the city.", "The councilwoman herself has lived in that area, also known as Midwest Cascade, since the mid-1990s. She was active in her subdivision\u2019s homeowners association when the community was part of unincorporated Fulton County. The annexation paved the way for her to run for the council, where she has served since 2010.", "Reed was sworn in that same year. PolitiFact Georgia recently ruled Mostly True that Reed\u2019s first term was marked by keeping campaign promises such as a major pension overhaul and hiring more police officers.", "\"We both lived in the same area, in two different neighborhoods,\" Bottoms said. \"Annexation meant there was an opportunity for people who had lived there to run for city office and get involved.\"", "Reed has said he supports annexing Druid Hills from DeKalb County and Sandtown in south Fulton, if those residents seek to join the city.", "But that is not because the former state senator \u2013 who represented pieces of unincorporated Fulton and Atlanta during his legislative tenure \u2013 was exactly the beneficiary of annexation the way that Bottoms described.", "Reed lived in Loch Lochman Estates during the 2006 annexation. That subdivision is literally down the street from what became Atlanta \u2013 but it was not included in the expansion. Today, it remains part of the unincorporated county.", "But Reed\u2019s spokeswoman said that annexation did prompt him to move to Midwest Cascade, where he still lives.", "\"He moved, but he is in the same neighborhood,\" spokeswoman Anne Torres said. \"So the councilwoman is right to say that annexation did bring him in.\"", "So where does that leave us?", "We won\u2019t quibble with Bottoms\u2019 reference to the last annexation, considering the small size of the 2007 additions.", "She is not quite right on her claim that the larger 2006 annexation included Reed\u2019s subdivision, which opened the door to his candidacy.", "The mayor\u2019s office said, though, that the move did push him to a different house in the same neighborhood so he could be a city resident.
