["On Jan. 20,\u00a0Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th's president of the United States. As many Americans celebrated, QAnon conspiracy theorists faced disappointment. The prediction that Donald Trump would\u00a0use his presidency to reveal a cabal of \"deep state\"\u00a0pedophiles had proved false.", "Since then, conspiracy theorists\u00a0have searched for signs that the QAnon conspiracy theory could still\u00a0ring true. Believers are promoting\u00a0several false claims that the inauguration ceremony was prerecorded and illegitimate.", "Conspiracy theorists, like\u00a0Chris Geo and Gage Nelson, are using their online following to\u00a0push\u00a0theories that Biden\u2019s inauguration was fake. Believers argue Trump will prove Biden\u2019s presidency to be illegitimate in a\u00a0\"great awakening\" on March 4.", "More: What is QAnon?", "Geo is a far-right conspiracy theorist with a YouTube channel called Beyond The Veil. It has 6,000 followers.", "More:Fact check: Viral letter to Joe Biden is misattributed to rocker Ted Nugent", "Geo dismissed the election results as a \"successful coup\"\u00a0and promoted false claims that Trump had actually won the election, referencing the inauguration\u2019s low turnout as evidence the Trump was the more popular candidate. USA TODAY has previously rated both of these claims false.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be that conspiracy theory guy going, \u2018Hey, this is gonna happen on this day. That is gonna happen on that day\u2019 and then it does happen, but then again, I don\u2019t want to be that blind person that sees all these anomalies and doesn\u2019t at least say something about it,\u201d said Geo.", "In Geo's responses to USA TODAY he\u00a0called the situation a \"testament to how the public has lost faith in mainstream media\" and urged his viewers to draw their own conclusions from the information he presented.", "Nelson hosts a far-right, QAnon-related podcast called America Divided, which has nearly 24,000 followers on Facebook.", "In a statement, Nelson told USA TODAY he stood by \"everything that (he) said in the video and pray(s) to God that it's true!\"", "\"Many patriots including myself, believe that something just wasn't right about the 'Biden Inauguration',\" he wrote. \"Very prominent people in the conservative movement, for example, Lin Wood, Mike Lindell, and Sidney Powell believe that something more is going on here.\"", "More:Fact check: Josh Hawley 'Spineless Traitor' book cover is satire", "Biden\u2019s inauguration was live and legal. Americans tuned in and watched the president and Vice President Kamala Harris take office. Inauguration Day festivities were broadcast and streamed from many outlets, including ABC, CNBC, Fox News, PBS, CNN, C-SPAN and Biden\u2019s Inaugural Committee website among others.", "While this year\u2019s inauguration crowd was smaller than\u00a0traditional inaugurations, there were still many witnesses. Lawmakers, former presidents, service members, performers and members of the press were all present at the ceremony. That included a number of USA TODAY reporters and photographers.", "In a video posted to Facebook on Jan. 21, Geo described\u00a0\u201cinconsistencies and anomalies\u201d that he said\u00a0raised questions about the authenticity of Biden\u2019s inauguration. This list included claims that\u00a0the weather in Washington that day did not match the weather in inaugurations videos, that Biden replaced an Oval Office painting of President Andrew Jackson with a bust of Cesar Chavez and that YouTube removed the inauguration video from the official White House channel to remove dislikes. All of these claims are false.", "More:Fact check: Not likely that COVID-19 vaccine was cause of Hank Aaron's death", "Geo also claimed that Trump\u2019s Jan. 6 video message to rioters and his Jan. 20 goodbye speech could have been\u00a0deep fakes and that\u00a0a shorter body-double replaced Hilary Clinton at the inauguration. He provided\u00a0no evidence for either of these claims.", "Video of the inauguration shows the weather was sunny and guests were dressed for the cold. When Biden walked out on to the Capitol steps, it was lightly snowing.", "Weather archives show\u00a0this was consistent with the cold and partially cloudy climate the capital experienced that day.", "Biden did remove a controversial painting of President Andrew Jackson, but he did not replace it with a bust of Cesar Chavez. Biden replaced the painting with a portrait of Benjamin Franklin. Biden\u2019s team placed\u00a0a bust of Chavez, the Mexican-American civil rights activist and labor leader, behind the president's desk.", "The White House official YouTube channel posted a video of the inauguration that is still up. There is no evidence the video was ever taken down to remove dislikes. As of Jan. 27, it had more than 71,000 dislikes, 14,000 likes and nearly a million views.", "Archived web pages of the posted video show no record the video was ever removed from the channel.", "Geo also referenced claims that Harris\u00a0didn\u2019t take the oath of office on a Bible, claiming the leather-bound book she placed her hand on \u201ccould be anything. Who knows what that book is?\u201d", "USA TODAY fact-checked that claim and found Harris was placing her hand on two Bibles.", "In his video for the \"America Divided Podcast,\" Nelson speculated that the inauguration was \u201cone giant Hollywood movie,\u201d emphasizing baseless claims as evidence.", "He referenced social media posts by Lin Wood, a pro-Trump lawyer known for his online perpetuation of QAnon dogma.", "More:Fact check: Facebook configuration change caused users to be logged out", "Nelson floated several false claims that\u00a0he said supported the larger theory that the ceremony was prerecorded, including that the ceremony went smoothly without a rehearsal, that guests visible in some frames were not in others and that Tom Hanks possibly hosted the\u00a0\"Celebrating America\" concert from a green screen.", "The claim that Biden\u2019s inaugural committee did not have a rehearsal is false. Although the Jan. 18 rehearsal was briefly locked down and evacuated due to a fire at a nearby encampment of homeless people, the rehearsal continued after the interruption.", "The guests Nelson highlights as a disappearing and reappearing anomaly are not as he claims. Those guests are Biden\u2019s granddaughters Naomi and Natalie Biden\u00a0and Secret Service agent David Cho. The Biden granddaughters and Cho stood behind Biden\u00a0while he took the oath of office and did not move.\u00a0They were not visible at certain points due to varied camera angles.", "There is no evidence the \u201cCelebrating America\u201d concert was filmed in front of a green screen rather than at the Lincoln Memorial. The National Parks Service closed the National Mall \u201cin response to credible threats to visitors and park resources\u201d during the \u201cset up and execution of inaugural events.\"", "Footage and images of the events and performances show Hanks, as well as performers, Biden and Harris, from multiple\u00a0angles\u00a0in and around the memorial. There is no evidence to suggest any of the performances set at the Lincoln Memorial were filmed in front\u00a0of a green screen.", "Nelson also referenced a video of National Guard members turning\u00a0away from Biden\u2019s motorcade as evidence that the military knows Biden is not the real commander-in-chief.", "USA TODAY has previously debunked this video and found that it depicted members protecting Biden\u2019s motorcade, not snubbing his presidency.", "Both Geo and Nelson mention several other false claims as evidence. USA TODAY has also found none of these claims to be true.", "More:Fact check: 'The Simpsons' similarities to Kamala Harris at inauguration are a coincidence", "Both men referenced claims that sources received video of the inauguration before it occurred. Nelson shared a clip of a Jan. 21 YouTube video with QAnon conspiracy theorists Simon Parkes and Charlie Ward. In the video, Ward\u00a0claims he received the inauguration footage 10 hours\u00a0before it took place.", "Ward did not offer any proof that he ever received that video. Geo offered no source.", "More:Fact check: Meme with images of Biden, Trump inaugurations draws false comparison", "They also referenced claims that the inauguration happened earlier than traditionally planned, which the Constitution specifies as noon on Jan. 20.", "Biden was\u00a0sworn in by 11:49 a.m. EST, just minutes ahead of the scheduled time.", "Similarly, at Trump's 2017 inauguration, he was scheduled to be sworn in \"around noon,\" showing the oath of office's timing\u00a0is not followed to the minute.", "Geo added that he could not see Biden take the oath of office on camera even after reviewing parts of the footage he might have missed. Biden did take the oath of office several minutes before noon. It was widely documented on television networks covering the ceremony.", "Both Nelson and Geo pointed to images of a man standing\u00a0behind Biden during the ceremony. They incorrectly assumed him to be Chinese and label him a\u00a0Communist.", "The man\u00a0is Secret Service agent David Cho, a Korean American leading Biden\u2019s security detail. Cho was second-in-command during Trump\u2019s administration.", "More:Fact check: Meme of fake email perpetuates conspiracy theory", "They both claim there are irregularities within the Oval Office, where Biden was photographed on Inauguration Day. Nelson goes as far as to argue the Oval Office pictured in Biden\u2019s photos might be a movie set owned by Castle Rock Entertainment.", "There is no evidence to suggest Biden was photographed from a set rather than the real Oval Office.", "The president made a very public entrance into the White House Jan. 20, as is customary, and posed for photos at the Resolute Desk soon after.\u00a0Members of the media photographed Biden as he signed a series of executive orders from the desk.", "Nelson pointed to a car, visible outside the window, to speculate that a car would likely not be parked on the grass of the White House lawn. This is incorrect. The Oval Office is in the West Wing of the White House and overlooks the South Lawn and its circular driveway. A vehicle could have been parked there.", "Geo speculated that Time magazine had photoshopped Biden into the Oval Office for its Feb. 1\u00a0cover image. Time's cover is not a photo, but an illustration of Biden standing in the Oval Office by artist Tim O\u2019Brien.", "Karen Douglas, a professor of social psychology at the University of Kent who researches conspiracy theories, told USA TODAY that false theories\u00a0like this emerge from uncertainty and confusion.", "\"This is likely for some citizens who do not understand the outcome of the election and the conspiracy theory allows them to believe that it was in some way flawed,\" she wrote in an email to USA TODAY.", "Douglas stressed that conspiracy\u00a0theories \"can fuel existing conflicts\" and in extreme cases motivate dangerous political action. She cited the Jan. 6 instance where\u00a0a mob of Trump supporters breached the Capitol building in a deadly riot\u00a0as a prime example of the dangers such theories could pose.", "USA TODAY rates the claim\u00a0that President Joe Biden's inauguration was fake and illegitimate as FALSE because it is not supported by our research. None of the evidence for the claim offered by online conspiracy theorists proved true or supports the claim. Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20 in an official ceremony that was\u00a0well-documented.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
