["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on October 13, 2020", "Coronavirus task force member Dr. Scott Atlas and Sen. Rand Paul have misleadingly suggested that much of the U.S. population has immunity to the coronavirus due to previous exposure to similar viruses. But scientists say any possible protection is theoretical \u2014 and can\u2019t be relied upon to control the pandemic.", "Paul, who is a Republican from Kentucky, broached the idea of preexisting immunity to the coronavirus during a Senate hearing on Sept. 23.", "In a heated exchange with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Paul argued that the reason why New York\u2019s outbreak is now largely under control is because of community, or herd, immunity \u2014 and not because the population followed public health guidelines.", "Fauci, Sept. 23: Right now, if you look at what\u2019s going on right now, the things that are going on in New York to get their test positivity 1% or less is because they are looking at the guidelines that we have put together from the task force of the four or five things of masks, social distancing, outdoors more than indoors, avoiding crowds and washing hands.", "Paul: Or they\u2019ve developed enough community immunity that they\u2019re no longer having the pandemic because they have enough immunity in New York City to actually stop it.", "Fauci: I challenge that, senator. \u2026 You were not listening to what the director of the CDC said, that in New York, it\u2019s about 22%. If you believe 22% is herd immunity, I believe you\u2019re alone in that.", "Paul: There\u2019s also the preexisting immunity of those who have cross-reactivity, which is about a third of the public in many estimates \u2026 which would actually get you to about two-thirds.", "Fauci: I\u2019d like to talk to you about that also because there was a study that recently came out that preexisting immunity to coronaviruses that are common cold do not cross-react with the COVID-19.", "It\u2019s unclear which study Fauci was thinking of \u2014 NIAID\u2019s press office did not respond to our inquiry \u2014 but Paul\u2019s office told us he was referencing research on\u00a0immune cells known as\u00a0T cells from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology.", "As we\u2019ll explain, there are studies showing that some people have T cells that can recognize SARS-CoV-2, or the novel coronavirus. But there\u2019s no reason to think those cells would contribute to herd immunity, which occurs when enough of the population is immune to prevent spread of the disease.", "Scientists have generally found that people\u00a0do not harbor cross-reactive antibodies that can actually prevent infection with the coronavirus and that would be meaningful for herd immunity.", "Although scientists are still debating what the herd immunity threshold is, most epidemiologists estimate that between 40% to 70% of a population would need to be vaccinated or have prior exposure to the virus for an outbreak to begin to die out.", "Later that day, Atlas, the newest member of the coronavirus task force and a senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, also brought up preexisting immunity in a press briefing at the White House.", "When asked about Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield\u2019s testimony, in which he said preliminary CDC antibody testing results showed that \u201cmore than 90% of the population remains susceptible\u201d to COVID-19, Atlas said Redfield had \u201cmisstated\u201d the findings.", "Atlas, Sept. 23: The data on the susceptible that he was talking about was his surveillance data that showed that roughly 9% of the country has antibodies. But when you look at the CDC data state by state, much of that data is old. Some of it goes back to March or April, before many of these states had the cases. That\u2019s point number one.", "Point number two is that the immunity to the infection is not solely determined by the percent of people who have antibodies. If you look at the research \u2014 and there\u2019s been about 24 papers at least on the immunity from T-cells \u2014 that\u2019s a different type of immunity than antibodies. And without being boring, the reality is that \u2014 according to the papers from Sweden, Singapore and elsewhere \u2014 there is cross-immunity, highly likely from other infections, and there is also T-cell immunity. And the combination of those makes the antibodies a small fraction of the people that have immunity.", "So the answer is no, it is not 90% of people that are susceptible to the infection.", "A neuroradiologist who researches health policy, Atlas wasn\u2019t trained as an immunologist, infectious disease specialist or epidemiologist. He has reportedly backed a \u201cherd immunity\u201d approach to the pandemic, although he denies embracing such a strategy.", "Both Redfield and Fauci have expressed concerns about Atlas and the accuracy of the information he imparts to the president and the public, although Atlas maintains that he is following the science.", "In a phone call on a commercial airline, Redfield was overheard saying, \u201cEverything he says is false,\u201d according to an NBC News report. A federal official similarly told CNN that the CDC head was worried that Atlas was providing Trump with misleading information.", "When asked in a Sept. 28 CNN interview whether Atlas was misleading the president, Fauci replied, \u201cWell, yeah, I\u2019m concerned that sometimes things are said that are really taken either out of context or actually incorrect.\u201d", "Paul and Atlas reference studies that suggest a good chunk of people have T cells in their bodies that \u201ccross-react\u201d with SARS-CoV-2, even though they\u2019ve never been exposed to the virus before.", "These studies do indeed exist \u2014 but both men inaccurately conclude that people with cross-reactive T cells will be protected from becoming infected with the virus, when that\u2019s almost certainly not the case.", "A paper published in May by researchers at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in the journal Cell, for example, found that about half of\u00a0the 11 tested blood samples from unexposed donors contained T cells that could recognize SARS-CoV-2.", "All of the control volunteers had donated blood between 2015 and 2018, so it wasn\u2019t possible for them to have developed those T cells as a result of an infection with the novel coronavirus. But all of them did have antibodies to at least one of two human common cold coronaviruses, suggesting that these were so-called memory T cells generated as a result of past cold infections.", "A follow-up study published in the journal Science by many of the same scientists further supported the idea that the responding T cells were primarily memory cells, present in the body because of past human cold coronavirus infections.", "Other studies have found similar results, typically finding between 20% and 50% of the samples from people who were never exposed to the coronavirus nevertheless have T cells that can recognize the pathogen.", "But immunologists don\u2019t yet know what it means for a person to have these preexisting T cells.", "Shane Crotty, a professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology and an author of the Cell and Science papers, explained in an Aug. 11 Twitter thread\u00a0that T cells might be helpful to some people but are unlikely to contribute to herd immunity.", "\u201cWe SPECULATE that it is conceivable that these T cells may potentially reduce COVID-19 disease severity, based on things we know about flu and T cells,\u201d he said, emphasizing that there was no data to support this, as it is only a hypothesis, but it was important to keep investigating to find out.", "\u201c[E]ven if our most optimistic speculations about crossreactive T cell memory were found to be correct, it would mean that just as many people would get infected with SARS-CoV-2, but fewer would become severely ill and die from COVID-19,\u201d he added. \u201cT cells generally don\u2019t completely prevent infections, they limit disease (make it shorter and/or less serious).\u201d", "Crotty also responded on Twitter to Atlas\u2019 Sept. 23 comments at the White House, noting that \u201cseveral major aspects\u201d of what he said \u201care wrong.\u201d", "\u201cThere is no direct evidence that pre-existing T cell immunity affects COVID-19 infections,\u201d he said, noting that he and other researchers \u201chave proven that such T cells exist, but neither we nor anyone else have shown that the pre-existing T cells make COVID-19 better, worse, or no difference.\u201d", "\u201c[W]e only SPECULATE that they may impact COVID-19 disease,\u201d he added. \u201cEven IF such a pre-existing T cell immunity exists, it would almost certainly not affect herd immunity.\u201d", "Previously, Crotty\u2019s institution also batted down claims about being close to COVID-19 herd immunity. \u201cWhile many people have T cells that can recognize #SARSCOV2,\u201d the La Jolla Institute wrote in a tweet, \u201cthis does not mean they are immune or can\u2019t pass on the disease.\u201d", "Other experts agree.", "\u201cThere is evidence that people vary in the amount of T cell immunity that they have to SARS-CoV-2 and that this plausibly reflects exposure to other betacoronaviruses over the life course,\u201d said Harvard epidemiologist Bill Hanage in a press call, referring to the sub-group of coronaviruses to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs.", "\u201cHowever, the nature of the immune system is such that it\u2019s by no means obvious what this actually means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could lead to more severe illness, it can lead to milder illness, and so on and so forth.\u201d", "Indeed, while the preliminary evidence does not suggest that the cross-reactive T cells are harmful in this case, it is a possibility. Crotty and his La Jolla colleague Alessandro Sette explained in a scientific review that preexisting immunity can sometimes be detrimental, either by making the immune response weaker than it otherwise would have been, or by having the immune system enhance disease.", "\u201cAny appeal to existing immunity,\u201d Hanage added, \u201chas to handle the fact that even in places \u2026 where we\u2019re still doing relatively large amounts of physical distancing and mask use, infection proceeds at a sort of steady pace, which does indicate that if you\u2019d provide the opportunity for it to transmit more, it will.\u201d", "\u201cAny reliance upon existing immunity from other betacoronaviruses, unfortunately, is wishful thinking,\u201d he said.", "Crotty and Sette also teamed up with public health scientists from Harvard to think through the ramifications of preexisting T cell immunity for the COVID-19 pandemic. Writing in Nature Reviews Immunology on Oct. 6, the group outlined several scenarios for how cross-reactive T cells might function in individuals and at a population level.", "In the most plausible scenarios, the T cells help reduce severity of COVID-19, and in some cases might reduce the spread of the virus, although there is also a chance of increasing spread if the reduced symptoms made the infection harder to identify. But, as the authors write, potential for reduced transmission is already accounted for in models of disease spread since it\u2019s based on real-world data. And again, and because this type of immunity doesn\u2019t prevent infection, it is \u201cnot expected to \u2018supplement\u2019 herd immunity.\u201d", "The researchers did examine a scenario in which herd immunity would be affected, but explain that it is \u201chighly unlikely\u201d and would be immunologically \u201cunprecedented.\u201d In this scenario, the preexisting T cells in the upper respiratory tract would have to quickly block viral replication of the virus, eliminating all the infected cells within a day. This is the closest T cell immunity could get to the \u201csterilizing immunity\u201d of neutralizing antibodies, which can intervene before any cells are infected.", "All the evidence, however, indicates not only that this has never happened before in humans, but also that it doesn\u2019t appear to be happening with COVID-19. This kind of T cell \u201cblitz\u201d has been reported only in animal models with other diseases and with a different type of T cell than what most people have from past coronavirus infections.", "Such a T cell response also has not been observed in past experiments with the cold coronaviruses, the authors write, \u201cmaking it implausible\u201d that cross-reactive T cells alone could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, the epidemiology also fails to fit with such a scenario, as outbreaks on ships report high levels of viral spread.", "\u201cIn sum,\u201d the authors write of the plausible scenarios, \u201cthe discovery of cross-reactive T cells should not substantially change projections of disease dynamics in populations or, specifically, of the proportion of the population who will become infected before transmission wanes.\u201d", "Atlas\u2019 other claim was that Redfield was wrong when he said 90% of the American public remains susceptible to the coronavirus.\u00a0While there are always caveats to the data, there is no reason to think that Redfield\u2019s estimate, which stems from a CDC seroprevalence study, is wildly off. Such studies estimate how much of the population has developed antibodies using antibody tests.", "In fact, another study published in the journal The Lancet two days after Redfield\u2019s testimony also backs a similar figure. That study, performed by researchers at Stanford, found that 9% of people from a nationwide survey of dialysis patients had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.", "Atlas said that one reason the estimate of susceptible people was so high is that the data was old \u2014 from March or April. But other CDC data, which are derived from commercial lab surveys, indicate that about 6% of the American population has antibodies to the coronavirus as of early August. And the Stanford study also used more recent data, from July.", "As the Stanford authors explain in their article, their estimate based on dialysis patients might overestimate the number of people in the general population exposed to the virus, since many dialysis patients are minorities. Or, it could underestimate the total, perhaps because the dialysis patients are less likely to be working and may be more protected than others. But it\u2019s in line with other seroprevalence surveys, which have concluded that the vast majority of people have not been infected and are unlikely to be immune.", "\u201cIn fact, even if the seroprevalence estimates derived from the US dialysis population overestimated true seroprevalence in the overall US adult population, our data nonetheless support that fewer than 10% of the US population has seroconverted as of July, 2020, and herd immunity remains out of reach,\u201d the authors wrote.", "Although Atlas argues the percentage of susceptible people should be much lower because of T cell immunity, as we\u2019ve already established, T cell immunity is unlikely to contribute to herd immunity and should not be counted toward the total unless new evidence arises suggesting that it does play a role.", "Dr. Julie Parsonnet, an infectious disease specialist and co-author of the Stanford antibody study, told us that the overall consensus is that 9%, with or without T cells contributing, is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to represent herd immunity.", "She emphasized that the virus can be brought under control without reaching herd immunity, but that involves using the public health strategies that have been shown to work. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need T cells in New Zealand or Taiwan,\u201d she said.", "Former CDC chief Dr. Tom Frieden also objected to the idea that far more Americans are already immune. \u201cOnly at most 1 in 7 Americans have been infected with Covid. That means 6 in 7 are likely still vulnerable,\u201d he said in a Sept. 30 tweet. \u201cThe US is nowhere close to herd immunity and anyone suggesting otherwise doesn\u2019t know enough about epidemiology and public health.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
