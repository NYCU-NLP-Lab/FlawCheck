["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks with the Monitor editorial board on Tuesday, Dec. 8, 2015. (ELIZABETH FRANTZ / Monitor staff)", "Hillary Clinton is bullish on clean energy as an economic opportunity for the United States. In a meeting last month with the Concord Monitor\u2019s editorial board, she held out the burgeoning production of wind turbines in Iowa as evidence of the country\u2019s potential future as the \"clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\"", "And what\u2019s more, the fall of fossil fuels in favor of renewables is already happening, she said.", "\"We now have more jobs in solar than we do in oil,\" the former Democratic secretary of state told the newspaper on Dec. 8, 2015.", "We\u2019ve heard that the renewable energy market has been heating up. And sure, some of our neighbors are putting up solar panels, and these shrunken gas prices can\u2019t be good for the oil industry. But could the total number of jobs in the field of solar power truly have surpassed the long-established and machinery-heavy oil industry?", "PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to have a look at the numbers.", "Labor statistics", "Clinton\u2019s campaign cited two sources: the federal government\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics and The Solar Foundation.", "First, we\u2019ll shine some light on the state of America\u2019s solar industry. The Solar Foundation estimated last year that there were roughly 174,000 people who spend at least half their working hours \"on solar-related work,\" a term that goes undefined in the nonprofit\u2019s 67-page annual report. It notes that 90 percent or more of those workers spent 100 percent of their time on \"solar-related work.\"", "Of the total, 97,000 are employed by installation companies, 32,000 are in manufacturing, 20,000 are in sales and distribution, 15,000 are in project development and 9,000 are classified as \"other,\" including research and development firms, nonprofits, government agencies and academic researchers.", "A Bureau of Labor Statistics economist, Caila Pinkleton, pointed by email to one specific solar-related current employment statistic.", "The Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed 5,170 solar photovoltaic installers employed in May 2014, a small fraction of the 97,000 people that The Solar Foundation said are employed by installation companies, of which the vast majority (92 percent) were installing photovoltaics.", "So there\u2019s some discrepancy in the total number of jobs. The Solar Foundation, which describes on its website that its mission \"is to increase understanding of solar energy through strategic research and education that transforms markets,\" didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking clarification.", "But the Bureau of Labor Statistics left open the possibility that the total number of jobs could be higher, noting that some solar thermal installers are classified under \"plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters\" and some solar photovoltaic electricians are listed under \"electricians.\"", "What\u2019s clear, according to the Solar Foundation\u2019s numbers, is that the industry is growing quickly: from 93,502 in 2010 to 173,807 in 2014. The nonprofit recently released its updated census for this year, which showed 208,859 solar workers as of November 2015, only slightly below the 210,600 projection from a year earlier.", "Meanwhile, the oil and gas industries have been falling in employment, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. While Clinton specifically mentioned the oil industry, not gas, her campaign only furnished data combining the two industries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn\u2019t keep individual data for each.", "Clinton\u2019s campaign referenced total employment in oil and gas extraction in December 2015, which was 185,000, compared with the 209,000 solar workers that The Solar Foundation reported in November 2015.", "If that was the whole story, she\u2019d be right. But just as the solar industry has installers, manufacturers, salespeople and researchers, so does the oil and gas industry.", "Besides oil and gas extraction, there\u2019s also support activities for oil and gas operations: 266,000 jobs. Oil and gas pipeline production: 124,000 jobs. Mining and oil and gas field machinery: 73,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "You might even want to include the 912,000 people who work at gas stations.", "We aren\u2019t going to be that pedantic. But the American Petroleum Institute is. It found that in 2007 the oil and natural gas industry directly provided 2.1 million jobs. Including the indirect impacts, API claims the industry supports more than 9 million American jobs.", "While this type of study is undoubtedly commissioned to promote the industry, a critic could say the same of The Solar Foundation\u2019s work.", "Using only Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers, and discounting gas station employees, we\u2019re still left with about 648,000 jobs in oil and gas spread over extraction, support activities, pipeline production and field machinery, compared to 210,000 for solar.", "In other words, for Clinton\u2019s claim to be true, two out of three Americans employed by the oil and gas industries would have to be working solely with gas. Even then \u2013 comparing conservative Bureau of Labor Statistics data against generous figures from The Solar Foundation \u2013 oil would come out slightly ahead.", "Our ruling", "Clinton said \"we now have more jobs in solar than we do in oil.\" But the numbers don\u2019t support that claim.", "For the oil industry, she didn\u2019t look at the whole picture. And self-reported calculations by both the solar and oil and gas industry aren\u2019t close. Oil and gas reports 10 times more jobs.", "Independent data from the federal government also shows more jobs in oil and gas compared to solar.", "Maybe someday Clinton\u2019s claim will be true, but for now we rate it False.", "Interview, Hillary Clinton, Dec. 8, 2015.", "The Solar Foundation, \"National Solar Jobs Census 2014,\" January 2015, accessed Jan. 25, 2016.", "Email, Caila Pinkleton, Bureau of Labor Statistics economist, Jan. 15, 2016.", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, \"Occupational Employment and Wages: Solar Photovoltaic Installers,\" May 2014, accessed Jan. 25, 2016.", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, \"Employed : Mining and logging - Oil and gas extraction,\" December 2015, accessed Jan. 25, 2016.", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, \"Employed : Mining and logging - Support activities for oil and gas operations,\" November 2015, accessed Jan. 25, 2016.", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, \"Employed : Mining and logging - Oil and gas pipeline construction,\" November 2015, accessed Jan. 25, 2016.", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, \"Employed : Mining and logging - Mining and oil and gas field machinery,\" November 2015, accessed Jan. 25, 2016.", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, \"Industries at a glance: Gasoline stations,\" December 2015, accessed Jan. 25, 2016.", "American Petroleum Institute, \"The economic impacts of the oil and natural gas industry on the U.S. economy: employment, labor income and value added,\" Sept. 8, 2009, accessed Jan 25, 2016.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
