Is freshman Hurd short of time?", "Resignation letter", "Gallego\u2019s campaign spokesman, Anthony Gutierrez, responded to us by email by pointing out a March 2015 entry in the Congressional Record showing that Hurd, a former CIA officer, asked to be removed from the committee in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner.", "Hurd\u2019s letter, dated March 16, 2015, said:", "\"I write today to resign from the House Small Business Committee.

Hurd also serves on the oversight panel\u2019s National Security Subcommittee.", "An online search led us to a web page created by the House clerk, dated Feb. 10, 2015, listing each member\u2019s committee assignments. That list showed Hurd as a member of the small business panel plus the two others. Counting Hurd, six Texas members of the House were assigned to three committees each; the other 30 Texans had one or two assignments.

The panel\u2019s Jan. 21, 2015, announcement listed Hurd among 14 committee members. According to the committee's calendar, the panel subsequently met three times before Hurd resigned.", "Hurd appreciated the appointment, Robinson told us, but given his other assignments and desire to travel back and forth to the vast 23rd Congressional District, he decided \"being in another committee meeting in D.C. was not going to be helpful.\" Hurd, Robinson said, would rather focus on small businesses in his district than \"listen to a bunch of bureaucrats\" in hearings.", "Chairman Chabot: 'Procedural glitch'", "By email, Teehan provided a statement she described as obtained by Hurd\u2019s office about March 18, 2015, from Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, who chairs the small business panel.

Lamar Smith\u2019s description of Hurd\u2019s appointment to the small business panel as \"a small administrative matter that has now been corrected.\" Smith, R-San Antonio, serves on the House Republican Steering Committee, which Teehan described as responsible for Republican committee assignments.", "Glitch? Administrative error? We left messages for aides to Chabot and Smith seeking elaboration while wondering how this might pertain to Hurd\u2019s departure from the committee. We didn\u2019t hear back.", "Next, we filled in Gallego\u2019s adviser, Gutierrez, who pointed out by email that House committee assignments, including Hurd\u2019s appointment to the small business committee, were entered into the Congressional Record on Jan. 13, 2015--eight days before the mentioned press release came out and about two months before Hurd submitted his letter to leave the committee.", "Our ruling", "Gallego said Hurd recently \"quit his post on the House Committee on Small Business saying that he was unable to find the time to serve.\"", "Hurd, who separately had two other committee assignments, quit the small-business panel stressing his desire to focus on security-related subcommittee assignments.", "Gallego\u2019s statement, leaving the impression Hurd said he lacked time to serve, left out important details.
