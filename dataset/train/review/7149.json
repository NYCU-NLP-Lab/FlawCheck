DO YOU SUPPORT THIS?\u201d", "That headline is completely unrelated to the story that follows, which was taken from a 2014 post that Horner wrote for a self-described satirical website called National Report.", "Horner\u2019s story was about \u201cswatting,\u201d a prank done by calling in a phony threat that results in a SWAT team descending on the house of the target. Swatting does happen and can have serious consequences. But Horner\u2019s 2014 satirical story claimed that \u201c15-year-old Paul Horner\u201d was \u201cconvicted of domestic terrorism\u201d and sentenced to \u201c25 years to life\u201d for a \u201charmless prank.\u201d Although none of that was true, the story was picked up by at least one technology news website before it was uncovered as a hoax.", "Now, parts of Horner\u2019s false story have been posted under the new, unrelated headline about a Muslim refugee.", "The websites that posted the new headline use photos from legitimate news reports that have nothing to do with a sexual assault. Multiple versions feature the photo of a 17-year-old boy crying as he was sentenced in 2014 for beating his girlfriend\u2019s toddler to death. Others feature a photo of a SWAT team searching for one of the Boston Marathon bombers in 2013. And some versions include both photos.", "Even though both the old story and the new, incendiary headline are false, the latest versions have recently been shared more than 7,000 times on Facebook, and some of the site\u2019s users took the headline seriously.
