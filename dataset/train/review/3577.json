["That their government used to group Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as wildlife is a prevalent claim in Australia, one that\u2019s been frequently repeated\u00a0in recent years online as well as by Australian politicians and celebrities.", "Upon becoming the first Aboriginal person elected to the New South Wales Parliament in 2003, Linda Burney said: \u201cFor the first 10 years of my life, like all Indigenous people at the time, I was not a citizen of this country. We existed under the Flora and Fauna Act of New South Wales.\u201d", "In his 2015 research on the \u201cFlora and Fauna Act\u201d claim, Samuel Brynand of the University of Canberra traced the claim\u2019s recent popularity to Burney\u2019s comments.", "In June, a post on the Facebook page Lost in History made a similar claim about the \u201cFlora and Fauna Act\u201d, which was shared 15,000 times online. When asked for evidence supporting its post, Lost in History provided a link containing disproved information.", "There is no record of an Australian Flora and Fauna Act involving its Indigenous population.", "Claims surrounding this purported legislation are untrue, said Helen Irving, a professor of Australian constitutional law at the University of Sydney.", "\u201cThis is a myth that frustrates me constantly, since, apart from being simply wrong, it confuses and misrepresents so much about the law, and about history,\u201d she said in an email.", "The myth is rooted in the 1967 Referendum. Amid a push for civil rights akin to the movement transpiring around the same time in the United States, Australians overwhelming approved changes to their constitution. These technical modifications allowed Australia\u2019s federal government to pass specific laws for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens.", "Irving pointed out the Australian Parliament wouldn\u2019t have had the power to enact a Flora and Fauna Act before the referendum, which supposedly erased the act.", "The 1967 referendum did expand how Indigenous citizens were counted in the national census, but Brynand, in his research, said Aboriginal people had been counted since the country\u2019s first census in 1911.", "The Flora and Fauna Act myth touches on a long, true history of discrimination that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people experienced at the hands of the Australian government.", "From the late\u00a018th to early 20th centuries, white Australian colonists \u2013 with government support \u2013\u00a0killed thousands of Indigenous people. Last year, a special report from The Guardian identified 270 massacres around the country over a 140-year period.", "Disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians persist today, with\u00a0non-Indigenous Australians having better literacy rates, job prospects, and life expectancies. The government\u2019s Close the Gap Campaign looks to narrow these divides, but some still say the country\u2019s laws don\u2019t go far enough to shield Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from discrimination.", "The Flora and Fauna Act might be false, but the sentiments behind the myth hit at frustrations many Australians still feel.", "\u201cMy personal sense is that (the myth) is popular because it provides a simplified way of expressing long-standing and deep-seated (and justified) grievances about the historical treatment of the Aboriginal people,\u201d Irving said.", "Still, Irving believes the myth undercuts the experiences of Indigenous people and ultimately serves more hard than good.", "\u201cThe truth of discrimination against Aboriginal Australians is bad enough, without exaggerating what happened,\u201d she said.", "There is no evidence of a Flora and Fauna Act under Australian law that classified its Aboriginal population as plants and animals. While the claim speaks to frustrations many Australians harbor around Indigenous equality, we rate this claim FALSE because it is unfounded by law and concluded false by multiple scholars.", "Brian Gordon is a North Carolina statewide reporter for the USA Today Network.
