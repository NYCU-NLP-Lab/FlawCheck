["Richmond City Councilwoman Kim Gray recently announced she\u2019ll run for mayor this year, promising to be stricter on spending than incumbent Levar Stoney.", "Gray has been a constant critic of Stoney, accusing him of being more interested in higher office and grandiose plans than solving Richmond\u2019s core problems. She led a charge that defeated Stoney\u2019s signature proposal to replace the Richmond Coliseum and has opposed the mayor\u2019s efforts to increase taxes on meals and real estate.", "During a March 3 radio interview on WRVA, Gray said Richmond doesn\u2019t need higher taxes, it needs greater government efficiency - especially in its school system.", "Host John Reid asked what she would do differently than Stoney about schools. Gray said she\u2019d look for savings in the school system\u2019s central office.", "\"I would lose some of the top-heavy weight,\" said Gray, a former Richmond School Board member. \"We\u2019re paying people exorbitant salaries, higher than the average across the entire Commonwealth. Even Fairfax County doesn\u2019t pay the kind of salaries that Richmond is paying right now.\"", "Fairfax is one of the wealthiest counties in the nation and has a high cost of living. We fact-checked Gray\u2019s claim that it pays school administrators less than Richmond.", "Gray told us she was referring to the salaries of Richmond Superintendent Jason Kamras, who was hired in 2018, and his top five administrators. She said she was under the impression they were paid more than their Fairfax counterparts, but didn\u2019t have proof. So, under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, we requested the top 10 salaries paid by Richmond and Fairfax public schools.", "Here\u2019s what we found:", "As a general rule, salaries are about 20% higher in Fairfax for comparable jobs.", "Fairfax pays nine administrators more than $200,000 a year, compared to one in Richmond.", "Richmond Superintendent Kamras has a $250,000 salary; Fairfax Superintendent Scott Brayband is paid $311,526.", "The five people on Kamras\u2019 leadership team in Richmond are paid between $175,250 and $180,547. The seven people on Brayband\u2019s leadership team in Fairfax are paid between $202,478 and $224,447.", "As we\u2019ve mentioned, it\u2019s far more expensive to live in Fairfax than Richmond, largely because of housing costs. Salary.com says Fairfax County\u2019s cost of living is 61% higher than Richmond\u2019s; Payscale.com says it\u2019s 50% higher. Those costs exceed the 20% salary bump the Fairfax school administrators have over their Richmond counterparts.", "In other words, the Richmond salaries have more purchasing power.", "Our ruling", "Gray, in complaining about what she sees as the high pay of top Richmond school officials, said, \"even Fairfax doesn\u2019t pay the kind of salaries Richmond is paying.\"", "That suggests Richmond administrators are taking home bigger checks than their Fairfax counterparts. That\u2019s what Gray told us she thought, and it\u2019s wrong. Actually, they\u2019re taking home 20 percent less pay.", "If Gray, in the future, wants to compare the pay of school administrators adjusted for cost of living, she should specify that.", "But as for the comment she made, it\u2019s False.", "Kim Gray, Comments on Newsradio WRVA, March 3, 2020 (5:32 mark).", "Interview with Gray, March 3, 2020.", "Richmond Public Schools, Email on top 10 salaries for 2019-2020 school year, March 9, 2019.", "Fairfax County Public Schools, Email on top 10 salaries for 2019-2020 school year, March 11, 2020.", "Richmond Public Schools, \"Superintendent Kamras announces new leadership team.\"", "Fox Business, \"The 20 wealthiest counties in the U.S\u2026,\" Dec. 18, 2019.", "Payscale.com, Cost-of-living calculator, accessed March 23, 2020.", "Salary.com, Cost-of-living calculator, accessed March 23, 2020.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
