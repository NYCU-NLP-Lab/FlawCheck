This was not the first time fluoride had ever been added to toothpaste, but it was at this time that \u201cfluoride became the standard and ADA-accepted toothpaste additive for the prevention of tooth decay,\u201d according to the Smithsonian Institution.", "In the UK today the main fluoride chemicals found in toothpaste are sodium fluoride, sodium mono-fluorophosphate and stannous fluoride. The maximum amount of fluoride allowed in toothpaste before it is classed as medicine under UK and EU law is equal to 1,500 parts per million, or about 0.15% fluoride.", "\u201cFluoride CALCIFIES the pineal gland, otherwise known as the third eye which literally has rods and cones, just like your other eyes!\u201d", "The pineal gland is located in the brain and is part of the endocrine system (which produces hormones in your body).

Again, the fluoride in that is present in much stronger concentrations than the fluoride found in tap water for example.

The usual strength of fluoride in a normal tube of toothpaste is between 1,000 and 1,500 parts per million, according to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (the \u201cleading journal and database for systematic reviews in health care\u201d). If someone was using regular over-the-counter toothpaste available for adults in the UK this would mean they\u2019d consume between roughly one quarter and one third of a milligram (mg) of fluoride every time they brushed their teeth.", "In the UK drinking water that is deliberately fluoridated (rather than water where fluoride occurs naturally) must not exceed 1.5mg per litre. That\u2019s 1.5 parts per million. So in the UK you would need to brush your teeth four to six times a day (with a pea-sized amount, and swallow all that toothpaste) to consume the same amount of fluoride as in a litre of tap water (if it was fluoridated to the maximum amount.)", "There is no recommended maximum amount of fluoride that should be consumed by adults per day in the UK. In the USA this upper maximum is 10mg.
