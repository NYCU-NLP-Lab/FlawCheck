["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 20, 2019", "Facebook posts distort the number of Somali refugees who have resettled in Minnesota to advance an unsupported claim about a freshman congresswoman\u2019s electoral victory.", "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s family fled from her native Somalia and sought refuge in Kenya before resettling in the U.S., according to the\u00a0biography\u00a0on her campaign website. They settled in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1997.", "Over two decades later, Omar clinched her seat representing Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District, making history as the first Somali American, as well as one of the first two Muslim women, to serve in Congress.", "Now, a popular meme on social media uses erroneous information to try to tie her victory to an unfounded claim that former President Barack Obama\u2019s refugee policies were part of a \u201cplanned\u201d effort to get her elected.", "\u201cObama resettled 70,000 SOMALIAN REFUGEES in MINNESOTA,\u201d the meme reads. \u201cNo wonder ILHAN OMAR was elected. IT WAS PLANNED.\u201d", "That number is wrong. In fact, it\u2019s larger than the total number of Somali refugees resettled throughout the entire U.S. under Obama.", "From the day Obama took office \u2014 Jan. 20, 2009 \u2014 to the last full day of his presidency \u2014 Jan. 19, 2017 \u2014 there were 54,514 Somali refugees that arrived in the U.S., according\u00a0to the State Department\u2019s Refugee Processing Center. Of those, 6,320 went to Minnesota.", "Moreover,\u00a0the Minnesota Department of Health reports\u00a0that between 1979 and 2017, there were a total of 23,915 refugees who arrived in Minnesota from Somalia.", "Some refugees who resettle in one state may move to another; Minnesota\u00a0received a reported 3,740 \u201csecondary arrivals\u201d from other states between 2010 to 2016. And\u00a0Minnesota\u2019s Health\u00a0Department\u00a0notes that \u201cthere is no systematic way to identify all secondary refugees migrating to Minnesota,\u201d so that number doesn\u2019t account for movements not reported to the state.", "The exact size of the Somali population in Minnesota is hard to pin down. U.S. Census Bureau data provide some insight: The 2013-2017 American Community Survey five-year estimate\u00a0shows 52,333 people in Minnesota who cited full or partial Somali ancestry. The Census Bureau\u2019s\u00a0one-year estimate for 2017, however, pegs that figure higher \u2014 at an estimated 69,479 people (though the one-year estimate has a higher margin of error than the five-year estimate).", "The Census website also does provide some information by congressional district. We know that the 5th\u00a0District has 58,225 residents of Subsaharan African ancestry, according to the 2017 one-year estimate, but there\u2019s no breakdown provided on how many are from Somalia.", "Either way, both the Somali population estimates for the entire state \u2014 and the Subsaharan African population in the 5th\u00a0District \u2014 are all still\u00a0well below the 267,703\u00a0total\u00a0votes Omar\u00a0received in her district when she was elected in November with about 78 percent of the vote.", "Lastly, it\u2019s worth noting that refugees become eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship \u2014 a prerequisite for voting \u2014 only after they have lived in the country for five years.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cCumulative Arrivals, 1979-2017.\u201d Refugee Health Program, Minnesota Department of Health.
