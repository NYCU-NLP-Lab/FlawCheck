(AP)", "The World Bank created a list of exports of COVID-19 testing equipment, drawing from an older list of existing diagnostic testing equipment.", "Some equipment now used for COVID-19 testing existed prior to 2019 and was marked as being available before that year.\u00a0 But COVID-19 tests did not exist in 2018.", "A popular Facebook post erroneously cites a list of medical exports as evidence that coronavirus tests existed prior to the pandemic.", "A Sept. 8 post shows a screenshot of a database from an online portal maintained by the World Bank.

The rumor appears to have originated on 4chan, a fringe internet platform.", "We\u2019ve previously fact-checked misinformation that suggests the coronavirus was planned or manipulated, but we wanted to look into this list of exports.

It allows users to search for things like the top products exported by certain countries.", "The table shown in the Facebook post lists the top exporters of \"instruments used in clinical laboratories for in vitro diagnosis\" and \"colorimetric end tidal CO2 detectors,\" which is the scientific name for a carbon dioxide detector. CO2 detectors help doctors monitor intubated patients.", "Both of those things existed prior to the coronavirus pandemic. So why was the table previously billed as a list of \"COVID-19 Diagnostic Test\" exporters?", "It has to do with guidance from the World Health Organization and a related database.", "In April, the WHO and the World Customs Organization classified CO2 detectors and diagnostic testing equipment, along with hand sanitizer and surgical masks, as critical to fighting COVID-19. Both received the same WCO code \u2014\u00a0\"902780\" in the Facebook post. COVID-19 test kits were assigned two different codes.", "The WHO gave some products less technical, coronavirus-related descriptions to make them easier to track.
