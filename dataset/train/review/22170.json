(AP/Seth Wenig)", "UPDATE, Nov. 7, 2019: New York Attorney General Letitia James on Nov. 7, 2019, announced that the New York Supreme Court ordered President Donald J. Trump to pay $2 million in damages \"for improperly using charitable assets to intervene in the 2016 presidential primaries and further his own political interests.\"", "As part of the settlement, other stipulations in the lawsuit were resolved, including one related to the Trump family\u2019s involvement with charities. The settlement required mandatory training for the three elder Trump children and imposed restrictions on Donald J. Trump should he join another charity as director.", "Any charity for which Trump serves as a director must have a majority of independent directors (meaning no one in his inner-circle). Also, it must engage counsel with expertise in New York not-for-profit law. And it has to use the services of an accounting firm to monitor and audit the organization\u2019s grants and expenses. If Trump starts a new charity, that charity must also comply with those requirements and report to the New York Attorney General for five years. The settlement includes a \"total ban on any self-dealing,\" as the lawsuit had charged that Trump repeatedly used his foundation's money for his own personal, business, and political interests.", "The settlement, however, does not ban the Trump family from operating a charity in New York, as this original Facebook post claimed. Our ruling on this statement remains unchanged.", "What follows is the original post:", "A pending lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his three eldest children seeks to prevent them from temporarily being involved in charities in New York.

Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric F. Trump \u2014 and against the Donald J. Trump Foundation. The lawsuit claimed that for more than a decade, the foundation persistently violated state and federal laws related to charities in the state of New York. Trump founded the foundation and served as its president; his three eldest children were on the board of directors.", "\"This pattern of illegal conduct by the foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law,\" the lawsuit said.", "As a result, the lawsuit sought to dissolve the foundation and to temporarily prohibit the Trumps from future service in New York not-for-profit or charitable organizations. Specifically, the lawsuit wants to ban Trump\u2019s involvement for ten years and the three Trump children for one year. The Trump children\u2019s ban would be subject to suspension if they undergo training on related fiduciary duties.", "The Donald J. Trump Foundation in December 2018 agreed to dissolve.

But that case is still pending.", "The lawsuit relates to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, not to a kids cancer charity. The lawsuit alleges that Trump used charitable assets to pay off legal obligations of entities he controlled, to promote his hotels, to buy personal items, and to support his presidential election campaign.", "Trump\u2019s son, Eric, led a foundation that raised money for kids with cancer, and that foundation has come under scrutiny over its own handling of funds.
