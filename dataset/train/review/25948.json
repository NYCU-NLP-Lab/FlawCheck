Jay Inslee on climate change, Swalwell is distinguishing himself from his many opponents in the Democratic primary by focusing on one issue.", "After announcing his candidacy on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" Swalwell held a campaign rally in his hometown of Dublin, Calif. During the speech, he said:", "\"In 2017, Republicans took control of the House, the Senate, and the presidency.

They called it House Joint Resolution 40.\"", "The fourth-term congressman accurately described the Republican-sponsored law, but it wasn\u2019t the first to pass that year.", "H.J. Res. 40 undid a Social Security Administration rule requiring the agency to report certain disabled applicants to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.", "Federal law stipulates that anyone \"who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution\" cannot own a gun.
