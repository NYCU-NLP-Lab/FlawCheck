["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on October 20, 2017", "President Donald Trump has claimed that under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies have \u201ctaken advantage of this country\u201d and \u201cmade a fortune,\u201d which he \u201cstopped\u201d by ending payments for cost-sharing subsidies on the ACA marketplaces. That\u2019s misleading, at best, for several reasons.", "On Oct. 12, the Trump administration announced it was \u201cimmediately\u201d cutting off payments to insurers for cost-sharing subsidies available through the ACA marketplaces.\u00a0As we have explained before,\u00a0while the government payments go to the insurance companies, the money reduces the out-of-pocket insurance costs for low-income individuals.", "These cost-sharing subsidies are separate from the premium tax credits available under the ACA that lower the cost of premiums for those earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. The cost-sharing subsidies are for those who earn between 100 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty level, and the subsidies reduce the amount policyholders have to spend on\u00a0deductibles, copays and coinsurance. The tax credit and subsidy are only available for\u00a0policies purchased on the ACA marketplaces, such as HealthCare.gov.", "Under the ACA, the insurance companies are required to sell policies with these lower out-of-pocket costs to those who qualify, based on income. The government then sends the subsidy payments to the insurers, reimbursing them for the cost of the discounted coverage.", "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimated\u00a0in January that the cost-sharing subsidies would total $10 billion in fiscal 2018, which began Oct. 1. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0said\u00a0that 57 percent of the 10.3 million people who had paid for ACA marketplace plans early this year had received cost-sharing subsidies.", "The president has cast his decision to cut off the subsidies as one that hurts insurance companies, calling the payments \u201cbailouts\u201d \u2014 a claim we\u2019ve fact-checked before. He has gone on to say that companies have made a \u201cfortune\u201d because of the Affordable Care Act.", "Before a cabinet meeting on Oct. 16, Trump described the cost-sharing subsidies as a \u201cgift\u201d to insurance companies. \u201cTake a look at where their stock was when Obamacare was originally approved and what it is today,\u201d he said.", "\u201cAnd the gravy train ended the day I knocked out the insurance companies\u2019 money, which was last week,\u201d he went on to say. \u201cHundreds of millions of dollars a month handed to the insurance companies for very little reason, believe me.\u00a0\u2026 I want the money to go to poor people that need it.\u201d", "On Oct. 18, he tweeted about\u00a0Sen. Lamar Alexander and his bipartisan work with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray to craft legislation that would continue the cost-sharing subsidies for two years, among other measures. He claimed insurers have \u201cmade a fortune w/O\u2019Care.\u201d", "I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care.", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017", "The Washington Post Fact Checker highlighted another comment Trump made to a reporter from E.W. Scripps on Oct. 17. The president cited\u00a0numbers for increased stock prices of Anthem, Humana, Aetna and Cigna \u201cfrom the beginning of Obamacare,\u201d and then said: \u201cThe insurance companies have absolutely taken advantage of this country and our people. And I stopped it by stopping the CSRs,\u201d meaning \u201ccost-sharing reductions.\u201d", "Trump earned four Pinocchios from the Fact Checker. We\u2019ll take a look as well at whether insurers have \u201cmade a fortune\u201d and what the cost-sharing subsidies might have to do with that.", "Health insurance companies are indeed profitable. As we said, A.M. Best, a firm that provides analysis and credit ratings of the insurance industry, issued a report this summer saying that the health insurance industry\u2019s net income increased by 46 percent from 2015 to 2016. The industry made $13.1 billion.", "But that wasn\u2019t because of the ACA marketplaces, where the cost-sharing subsidies apply. Insurers largely made their increased profits on Medicare Advantage plans.", "A.M. Best said in its report that an overall underwriting loss in the commercial segment was \u201cprimarily\u201d due to the individual market and the ACA marketplaces \u2014 and that was due to \u201csevere adverse selection,\u201d or a risk pool that wasn\u2019t balanced between healthy and high-cost individuals.", "A.M. Best, June 14, 2017, report: The commercial business reported an overall underwriting loss of $893 million, but this was a marked improvement over the $2.1 billion underwriting loss reported in 2015. The negative results were due primarily to the individual segment\u2014in particular, to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchange products\u2014owing to severe adverse selection and the inability to effectively manage risk pools. The improvement in the segment\u2019s financial results followed very high rate increases, the modification of plan designs (including a reduction in the number of plans available with out-of-network benefits), and more effective medical management.", "CNN Money reported that Doniella Pliss, an associate director for A.M. Best, said that Obamacare \u201cis not eating into profits to the degree that it did in the prior year.\u201d But insurers still lost \u201cmillions and millions\u201d in that area in 2016.", "Pliss said that \u201cit doesn\u2019t contradict the fact that they did very well in other lines of business.\u201d", "The ACA also limits how much profit insurers can earn on premiums, under what\u2019s called the\u00a0medical loss ratio, or MLR, provision. The health care law requires that at least 80 percent of premiums be spent on medical claims and quality improvement, with the other 20 percent for profits, salaries, marketing and overhead (it\u2019s an 85/15 split for large group, or large employer, plans).", "Health insurers are required to file yearly reports with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on their profitability, and if they don\u2019t meet the MLR standards, they have to issue rebates to consumers. Consumers on the individual market were owed\u00a0$107 million in rebates in 2015 and $238 million in 2014.", "The National Association of Insurance Commissioners sent us data showing that insurers reported an underwriting loss of\u00a0$4.7 billion in 2016 on the individual market, which would include plans sold on and off the ACA marketplaces.", "That\u2019s the same figure in a report from the consultancy group Oliver Wyman, which also cited losses for insurers on the individual market of $6 billion in 2015 and $3.6 billion in 2014.", "So, instead of making \u201ca fortune w/O\u2019Care,\u201d the insurance companies overall lost money on it.", "Several insurers have cited those losses as the reason for withdrawing from ACA marketplaces. In fact, Trump has tweeted about it.", "In February, he noted \u201cHumana to pull out in 2018,\u201d and in May, he claimed, \u201cOcare is on its last legs and that insurance companies are fleeing for their lives.\u201d In August 2016, he linked to a news report on Aetna planning to leave most of its ACA marketplaces. \u201cAnother health insurer is pulling back due to \u2018persistent financial losses on #Obamacare plans,'\u201d he said.", "Another health insurer is pulling back due to 'persistent financial losses on #Obamacare plans.' Only the beginning! https://t.co/YqfaEvg8c3", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2016", "Yet now, the president claims that those same insurers are doing well with the ACA.", "Trump told E.W. Scripps reporter Mike Sacks that Aetna, Humana, Anthem and Cigna have seen big gains in their stock prices under the ACA. \u201cThe insurance companies have absolutely taken advantage of this country and our people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I stopped it by stopping the CSRs.\u201d", "But Aetna pulled out of many ACA marketplaces this year and announced that it won\u2019t participate in any of them in 2018. Humana, too, announced early this year that it would exit the marketplaces, as Trump accurately tweeted at the time.", "Anthem is still participating but has reduced the states or counties in which it offers ACA plans. The insurer has\u00a0cited uncertainty over the future of cost-sharing subsidies as one reason for some of its market exits. Cigna pulled out of Maryland but still offers ACA plans in six states.", "To be sure, insurance companies have done better in some states than others, and some companies are succeeding where others have withdrawn.", "\u201cThe marketplaces are generally performing well,\u201d\u00a0Mario Molina, CEO of insurer Molina Healthcare, said on a 2016 company conference call. And\u00a0the CEO of Centene said a year ago that it expected to continue to earn profits on its ACA policies in 2017, according to\u00a0USA Today.", "But overall, the industry has not \u201cmade a fortune\u201d on Obamacare plans, as Trump claimed, and the withdrawal of the cost-sharing subsidies won\u2019t \u201cend the gravy train.\u201d", "The National Association of Insurance Commissioners said that insurers would lose more than $1 billion in payments owed for 2017 due to the elimination of the cost-sharing subsidies. But for 2018, many insurers submitted higher premium increases because they were uncertain whether the Trump administration would continue the subsidies. And Congressional Quarterly reported on Oct. 16 that the administration is allowing some insurers that didn\u2019t account for that development to resubmit higher rates.", "\u201cInsurers\u00a0in the vast majority of states on the federal exchange submitted rates for the upcoming plan year assuming that CSR payments would not be made, so no rate adjustment is needed,\u201d Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said in a statement, CQ reported. \u201cCMS\u00a0is working on a case-by-case basis with those states where regulators explicitly required\u00a0insurers\u00a0to assume CSR payments would be made.\u201d", "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the average premium for the second-lowest cost silver plan would rise 20 percent in 2018 if the subsidies were ended. NAIC projected a slightly lower figure, saying that premiums would go up \u201cby an additional 12-15 percent in 2018.\u201d", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
