["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on March 5, 2021", "In a 2010 TED Talk focused on developing new technologies to drastically reduce carbon dioxide emissions, Bill Gates briefly mentioned reducing the rate of population growth. A conspiratorial video circulating on Facebook misleadingly edits Gates\u2019 talk to suggest his \u201cwish\u201d was to depopulate the planet through vaccines.", "A Facebook video viewed more than 100,000 times is using a deceptively edited clip of Bill Gates to accuse the Microsoft co-founder of advocating for a nefarious plan to depopulate the world through vaccines.", "The video \u2014 captioned, \u201cTake a look at this #DepopulationAgenda\u201d \u2014 employs a computer-generated voiceover that suggests Gates and other high-profile philanthropists want to remove some portion of the global population. The same video\u00a0was uploaded to YouTube in April 2020, as misinformation relating to Gates swirled on social media.", "The Facebook version includes ominous music and is presented as a meme, adding an apocalyptic image of a syringe in front of a pile of skulls to further imply a deadly plan is afoot. The narration tells viewers it will use quotes directly from \u201cBill Gates himself so that later no one will accuse me of allegedly distorting his words.\u201d But then it does just that.", "The video misleadingly edits Gates\u2019 2010 TED Talk \u2014 \u201cInnovating to zero!\u201d \u2014 which focused on the need to zero out carbon dioxide emissions through new approaches to energy production in order to fight climate change. Ignoring Gates\u2019 theme of energy innovation, the video misleadingly portrays the speech as evidence of a purported \u201cdepopulation\u201d agenda that involves COVID-19 and the global vaccination efforts of Gates, the World Health Organization and pharmaceutical companies.", "Before showing parts of Gates\u2019 2010 talk, the video presents part of a 2009 story in the Guardian that reported that Gates and other billionaire philanthropists had met and discussed overpopulation as a serious issue facing the world. But\u00a0that was only one topic discussed. The video ignores that the group reportedly discussed a range of other issues, too \u2014 including education, government reform and the economic crisis at that time.", "It\u2019s also worth noting \u2014 since the Facebook video doesn\u2019t \u2014 that the same Guardian story also reported that a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation vaccination project \u2014 Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance \u2014 was estimated at the time \u201cto have prevented 3.4 million deaths in just eight years.\u201d", "After its selective use of the Guardian article, the video then goes on to show a clip from Gates\u2019 2010 TED Talk as he was discussing the amount of carbon dioxide produced each year around the world.", "Bill Gates, \u201cInnovating to zero!\u201d: \u2026over 26 billion tons. For each American, it\u2019s about 20 tons. For people in poor countries, it\u2019s less than one ton. It\u2019s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. And somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. It\u2019s been constantly going up. It\u2019s only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all, so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to zero.", "This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication.\u00a0So you\u2019ve got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero,\u00a0and that\u2019s going to be based on the number of people,\u00a0the services each person is using on average,\u00a0the energy, on average, for each service,\u00a0and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.\u00a0So let\u2019s look at each one of these,\u00a0and see how we can get this down to zero.\u00a0Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.", "That\u2019s back from high school algebra.\u00a0But let\u2019s take a look.", "First, we\u2019ve got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That\u2019s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15%. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3.", "That portion of Gates\u2019 talk has spawned a false narrative that has persisted over the years that argues Gates was calling for the killing of millions of people by using vaccines \u2014 a narrative that the Facebook video again revisits.", "It\u2019s clear, however, that Gates was referring once again to his belief that improving health and reducing child deaths, including through vaccines, can have the effect of limiting future population growth \u2014 which he has talked about many other times.", "In 2012, he again spoke about the need in underdeveloped countries to provide family planning services and better health care to decrease child mortality in order to deal with overpopulation. Similarly, in 2018, Melinda Gates, his wife and co-founder of the couple\u2019s foundation, said: \u201cWhen more children live past the age of 5, and when mothers can decide if and when to have children, population sizes don\u2019t go up. They go down. Parents have fewer children when they\u2019re confident those children will survive into adulthood.\u201d", "Bill Gates went on in his full, unedited TED Talk to spend most of his time focusing on the need to drastically reduce carbon dioxide emissions through innovation in energy production. For example, he spoke about one venture he backs that aims to create more efficient nuclear energy by using the waste created by current nuclear reactors.", "But the video on Facebook cuts all of that \u2014 nearly 13 minutes in total \u2014 and moves directly from Gates briefly referencing the prospect of limiting population growth rate to his saying it\u2019s his \u201cwish\u201d for such a technology. It provides no context for viewers to understand what hoped-for technology he was referencing.", "The edited video picks up his talk here:", "Bill Gates, \u201cInnovating to zero!\u201d: So this is a wish. It\u2019s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years \u2014 I could pick who\u2019s president, I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love, or I could pick that this thing that\u2019s half the cost with no CO2 gets invented \u2014 this is the wish I would pick. This is the one with the greatest impact. If we don\u2019t get this wish, the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible, between the US and China, between poor countries and rich, and most of all, the lives of those two billion will be far worse.", "\u201cSo what have we heard from Bill?\u201d the video voiceover says. \u201cGlobal warming \u2014 which is supposedly caused by anthropogenic carbon emission \u2014 and to reset it, you need to slightly reduce the world\u2019s population.\u201d", "As we said, Gates briefly suggested that health care and vaccines could reduce the rate at which the population grows \u2014 but he didn\u2019t propose killing off humans, as the video implies. His focus in the Ted Talk was on reducing carbon dioxide emissions by transforming the energy sector \u2014 something this misleading video leaves on the cutting-room floor.", "The full TED Talk can be seen here:", "The Facebook video continues by showing a 2011 clip of Gates speaking with CNN\u2019s Sanjay Gupta about his pledge to spend $10 billion over a decade on vaccination efforts. He said in the interview that by reducing the number of children who die every year through vaccines, \u201cthe benefits there are in terms of reducing sickness, reducing the population growth, it really allows society a chance to take care of itself.\u201d", "The video presents a loop of Gates saying the words, \u201creducing the population growth,\u201d and then asks: \u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "Except, as we said, Gates has been transparent about his belief that improved health and vaccines could reduce population growth.", "The video\u00a0concludes by sowing doubt about the global response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.", "It presents a lengthy video clip of Gates in 2015 discussing the need for pandemic preparedness \u2014 followed by details of Gates\u2019 significant contributions\u00a0to WHO and\u00a0his foundation\u2019s participation in a 2019 preparedness exercise involving a coronavirus \u2014 to baselessly insinuate that Gates, WHO and the pharmaceutical industry are behind a global effort to kill people.", "As we\u2019ve explained before, such preparedness exercises have been held for many years. And some experts had warned of the potential for coronaviruses (which are a family of viruses) to trigger a pandemic at least 20 years before the 2019 outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.", "But the video ignores all of that context, instead feeding viewers a narrative that is heavy on innuendo and lacking in evidence.", "See more of our SciCheck work to learn about COVID-19 and vaccines.", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The foundation has no control over our editorial decisions, and the views expressed in our articles do not necessarily reflect the views of the foundation.
