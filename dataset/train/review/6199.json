["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on January 10, 2018", "Vice President Mike Pence touted the latest jobs report as proof that \u201cmanufacturing is roaring back.\u201d The previous administration made a similar claim, but experts then and now said it\u2019s premature to declare a manufacturing renaissance.", "The economy added 196,000 manufacturing jobs last year \u2014 the most in any year since 2014,\u00a0when the economy added 208,000 manufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the manufacturing sector has yet to fully recover from the Great Recession.", "As of December 2017, there were 12.5 million manufacturing jobs \u2013 1.2 million fewer than there were in December 2007, when the recession started, BLS data show. At last year\u2019s growth rate, it would take until nearly 2023 just to recover the jobs lost during the recession.", "Pence made his remarks in an interview with the conservative radio show host Dana Loesch.\u00a0\u201cLook at the jobs numbers that were just released last week \u2014 manufacturing is roaring back,\u201d he said.", "The employment figures released on Jan. 5 showed an increase of 25,000 manufacturing jobs in December. That resulted, as we said, in a net gain for the year of 196,000 jobs. That was much better than in 2016, when the economy lost 16,000 manufacturing jobs. But it was not as good as 2011 or 2014, when the economy added a little more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs in each of those years.", "Pence\u2019s declaration of a manufacturing comeback reminded us of when his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, boasted in 2012 that\u00a0\u201cmanufacturing is back\u201d after a few years of job growth.", "But, as we wrote at the time, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation dismissed such talk as premature.\u00a0Rob Atkinson, founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, tells us it is still premature.", "Atkinson, co-author of a 2015 report called \u201cThe Myth of America\u2019s Manufacturing Renaissance: The Real State of U.S. Manufacturing,\u201d said that being 1.2 million short of the pre-recession jobs level is just one indication that manufacturing is not back.", "\u201cEven more telling,\u201d Atkinson told us, \u201cthe U.S. is producing less manufacturing output in the second quarter of 2017 than it did in the last quarter of 2007,\u201d when the recession started.", "\u201cAlmost 10 years and NO growth in real output. This is not roaring back, or even back,\u201d Atkinson, citing Bureau of Economic Analysis data, told us in an email.", "He also pointed us to the latest data on labor productivity, which is measured by the amount of manufacturing goods produced (output) per hour of labor.", "\u201cManufacturing sector labor productivity fell 4.4 percent in the third quarter of 2017, as output decreased 1.1 percent and hours worked increased 3.5 percent,\u201d the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in a Dec. 6 press release. \u201cThis was the largest quarterly decline in manufacturing sector productivity since the fourth quarter of 2008 (-5.4 percent).\u201d", "Manufacturing labor productivity is an important indicator of\u00a0\u201cincreased potential national income,\u201d BLS says. But it has declined in 18 of the 39 quarters since the recession started, according to BLS.", "\u201cWhen you look at manufacturing labor productivity stats over the last 3 years, they are abysmal,\u201d Atkinson told us. \u201cShocking low if not negative in some quarters. Job creation with negative productivity cannot be the goal.\u201d", "Economics professor Gordon Hanson,\u00a0director of the\u00a0Center on Global Transformation at the University of California San Diego,\u00a0noted that the U.S. economy lost almost 6 million manufacturing jobs from January 2001 to February 2010, the low point for manufacturing jobs during the recession. There were 17.1 million manufacturing jobs in January 2001, but only 11.5 million by February 2010, according to the BLS.", "\u201cSince 2010, job loss has abated and there has been modest recovery,\u201d Hanson told us. \u201cVP Pence is correct to say that manufacturing job growth is strong relative to what it has been this century. But \u2018roaring back\u2019 is a bit of an exaggeration as the sector, job wise, has fallen so far.\u201d", "As support for the vice president\u2019s claim about manufacturing \u201croaring back,\u201d the White House\u00a0cited \u201cthe overall increase\u201d in the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, or PMI, which is\u00a0based on surveys of manufacturing firms by the Institute for Supply Management.", "The ISM\u2019s PMI was 59.7 percent for the manufacturing sector in December. ISM says anything above 50 percent indicates a growing sector, and the figure has been above that level for 16 consecutive months.", "But the index \u2014 which has\u00a0risen and fallen\u00a0with regularity over the decades \u2014 just shows that the manufacturing sector is currently growing, and not contracting. It still has a long way to go before the number of jobs is back to pre-recession levels.", "\u201cNo one is arguing that manufacturing is not expanding. But when looked at since 2007 it is not expanded,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cBottom line is we will know if the recovery in U.S. manufacturing is real, not from what a sample of purchasing managers say they intend to do but from measures of real value added output.\u201d", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
