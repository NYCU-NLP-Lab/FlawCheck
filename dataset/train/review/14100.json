But it overstated in describing why Evers, the state schools superintendent, didn\u2019t revoke the teacher\u2019s license and what he did to make a change in state law. We rated the group\u2019s two-part claim as Half True.", "Now we\u2019re evaluating the other ad, by a group called A Stronger Wisconsin, which is backed by the Democratic Governors Association.", "This ad also makes a two-part claim and, while partially accurate, it also has some overstatement problems.", "Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc.", "The ad is about the case of Andy Harris, a middle-school science teacher in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. He was fired in 2010 for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker.", "Harris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he should have been given a suspension rather than be fired because other employees were given lesser punishments for \"doing the same or similar types of things.\"", "The arbitrator also determined that Harris\u2019 behavior, given that students were not present when he viewed the images, did not endanger any students as defined by state law at the time.", "The law at the time was crucial in Evers\u2019 decision not to try to revoke Harris\u2019 license after the arbitrator gave Harris his job back.", "All our fact checks in the governor\u2019s race.", "The TV spot by A Stronger Wisconsin begins with images and criticism of Republican Gov. Scott Walker, whom Evers will face in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election. Then the narrator says:", "\"When two judges said it was illegal to fire a teacher for inappropriate conduct, Tony Evers worked with Republicans and Democrats and changed the law.\"", "However, words on the screen went further on that second part, declaring: \"Evers got the law changed.\"", "So, let\u2019s look at both parts of the claim.", "State GOP: Says Tony Evers \"allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students.\" Mostly False.", "The first part of the claim, as stated by the narrator and shown on the screen, is \"two judges said it was illegal\" to fire the teacher. A footnote on the screen cites one of our fact checks.", "Two courts did uphold the arbitrator\u2019s decision to overturn the firing. But the ad\u2019s phrasing overstates what the judges found and it isn\u2019t what we said.", "A circuit court judge, and a three-judge state appeals court panel, upheld the arbitrator's ruling to give Harris his job back \u00a0\u2014 concluding the arbitrator was within her rights to do so. But they didn\u2019t conclude that firing the teacher was illegal.", "State GOP: Says Tony Evers \"didn't revoke the license of a teacher caught spreading pornography and commenting on the bodies of middle-school girls.\" Half True.", "The Harris case led to a change in state law so that now, the law explicitly says that if a teacher views pornography at school, even if students aren\u2019t present, the teacher can be fired.", "The ad, meanwhile, gives mixed messages on the new law. The narrator says Evers \"worked with\" lawmakers and changed the law, but the words on the screen say \"Evers got the law changed.\"", "A group of Republicans introduced the bill and the author of the bill downplayed the role of Evers\u2019 department. But officials in Evers\u2019 department discussed the legislation with the author as the bill was being drafted and testified at hearings in favor of it.", "So, Evers was involved \u00a0\u2014 as the narrator says in the ad \u00a0\u2014 but was not the leading force, as the words on the screen claim.", "A Stronger Wisconsin says: \"When two judges said it was illegal to fire a teacher\" who viewed pornography at school, \"Tony Evers worked with Republicans and Democrats and changed the law.\"", "Judges ruled that an arbitrator was within her rights to overturn the firing, but they did not conclude that the firing was illegal.", "Meanwhile, Evers supported the change in state law, but was not the leading force.", "For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.", "YouTube, A Stronger Wisconsin TV ad, Aug. 20, 2018", "Email, A Stronger Wisconsin spokeswoman Melissa Miller, Sept. 6, 2018", "Email, Wisconsin Republican Party spokesman Alec Zimmerman, Sept. 7, 2018", "PolitiFact Wisconsin, \"Hitting back, group defends Dem governor candidate Tony Evers in handling of teacher porn case,\" Aug. 29, 2018", "PolitiFact Wisconsin, \"Yes, but: Explaining GOP's attack on governor candidate Tony Evers on not revoking teacher's license,\" Aug. 6, 2018", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Tony Evers and Scott Walker are fighting over a teacher who looked at porn at school \u2014 here's the rest of the story,\" Aug. 22, 2018", "Email, University of Wisconsin law professor and arbitration expert Jason Yackee, Sept 8, 2018", "Interview, Madison arbitration lawyer Jaya Sharma, Sept. 10, 2018", "Email, Marquette University Law school professor and Dispute Resolution Program director Andrea Kupfer Schneider, Sept. 10, 2018", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
