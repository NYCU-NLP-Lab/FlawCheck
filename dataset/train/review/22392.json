This goes back to the 14th Amendment.", "Once Trump raised the issue, other GOP contenders followed suit, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. On Aug. 17, 2015, Jindal tweeted, \"We need to end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants.\"", "This prompted the liberal group Occupy Democrats to post a meme on its Facebook page with this message:", "\" \u2018We have to end birthright citizenship to stop anchor babies,\u2019 says Republican Bobby Jindal whose noncitizen parents arrived in the U.S. four months before he was born and used his birthright citizenship to become Americans, making him an anchor baby.\"", "The part we\u2019re fact-checking is the claim that Jindal\u2019s parents gained citizenship through him.", "People define \"anchor baby\" in different ways.

His tweet didn\u2019t mention \"anchor babies.\" The closest he came to saying those words was during an interview with Fox News where, on being pressed by the host, Jindal said, \"I\u2019m happy to use the phrase,\" but he still didn\u2019t actually use it.", "However, regarding Jindal\u2019s personal timeline, the post is accurate.
