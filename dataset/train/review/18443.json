["By Robert Farley", "Posted on October 13, 2016", "Donald Trump wrongly labeled the debates \u201crigged\u201d because the Commission on Presidential Debates\u2019 \u201chead guy used to work for Bill Clinton.\u201d The nonpartisan debate commission is co-chaired by a former Clinton aide and a former Republican National Committee chairman.", "\u201cAnd by the way, you know that so-called Commission on Presidential Debates, the head guy used to work for Bill Clinton,\u201d Trump said during a speech in Ocala, Florida, on Oct. 12. \u201cDid you know that? I just found that out. The head guy worked for Bill Clinton. What a rigged deal this is. But here\u2019s the story. I have no respect for that group by the way, I have none. It sounds good. Presidential commission, give me a break.\u201d", "Let\u2019s keep this short.", "The Commission on Presidential Debates \u2014 which has sponsored all of the presidential debates since 1988 \u2014 has two co-chairmen. One of them is Michael D. McCurry, a former press secretary for Bill Clinton. But the other co-chair is Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who was chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1983 to 1989.", "CPD was co-founded in 1987 by Fahrenkopf and Paul Kirk Jr., then chairman of the Democratic National Committee. McCurry succeeded Kirk as co-chairman of CPD in 2009.", "Since 1989, when both Kirk and Fahrenkopf ended their terms as chair of the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee, respectively, \u201cno sitting officer of either major party has had any affiliation with the CPD and the major parties have no role whatsoever in running CPD or setting its policies,\u201d according to the CPD website.", "The commission\u2019s board of directors is comprised of Democrats and Republicans (Republicans include former Sens. John Danforth and Olympia Snowe and former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels), business executives and media personalities.", "We should note that several media publications misreported Trump\u2019s comments in Ocala, reporting that he said, \u201cI have no respect for that group [CPD], by the way, I\u2019m done.\u201d The media outlets then speculated about whether Trump was saying that he would not participate in the final debate. As we noted above, Trump did not say he was \u201cdone,\u201d he said he had \u201cno respect\u201d for CPD, adding \u201cI have none.\u201d A spokesman for Trump confirmed he would be participating in the final debate in Las Vegas on Oct. 19.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4371668c-964f-4ca4-ad65-a9d4fac888fe", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
