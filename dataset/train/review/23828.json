["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on July 6, 2018", "President Donald Trump got his election history wrong when he said that Ronald Reagan lost Wisconsin, and that before his 2016 win, no GOP presidential candidate had won the state since Dwight Eisenhower in 1952.", "Trump is forgetting that President Eisenhower won Wisconsin again in 1956, and that Richard Nixon was the winner there in 1960, 1968 and 1972. They were followed by Reagan, who won the state in 1980 and 1984.", "In fact, during his speech at a campaign rally in Montana, Trump claimed incorrectly that Wisconsin was the only state that Reagan lost in his second election.", "Trump, July 5: But think of Wisconsin. Reagan had his big win. He won every state except one, the great state of Wisconsin. I won Wisconsin. First time \u2014 first time since Dwight Eisenhower in 1952.", "And this wasn\u2019t the first time that Trump made the blunder. He said something similar during a speech\u00a0in Wisconsin last week.", "Trump, June 28: You know, I just realized the other day, they told me \u2014 when we won the state of Wisconsin, it hadn\u2019t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. Did you know that? And I won Wisconsin. And I like Wisconsin a lot, but we won Wisconsin. And Ronald Reagan \u2014 remember, Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win.", "It\u2019s true that Reagan only lost one state during the 1984 election \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t Wisconsin. Reagan lost Minnesota to Democrat Walter Mondale, who was born in Minnesota and represented the state in the U.S. Senate.", "Before Reagan\u2019s wins in 1980 and\u00a01984, Nixon, another California Republican, carried Wisconsin in 1968 and 1972. Nixon also won there in 1960, though Democrat John F. Kennedy became president.", "That means Trump\u2019s win in 2016 made him the third Republican to carry Wisconsin since Eisenhower did it in 1952 and again in 1956.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
