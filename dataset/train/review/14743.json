Why wouldn't I be?,\" Trump said on July 1. \"I went to the Wharton School of Finance, I was a great student. ... I go out, I make a tremendous fortune. I write a book called The Art of the Deal, the No. 1 selling business book of all time, at least I think, but I\u2019m pretty sure it is. And certainly a big monster, the No. 1 bestseller. I do The Apprentice, a tremendous success, one of the most successful shows.\"", "We were curious about Trump\u2019s literary credentials. Did he pen the top-selling business book of all time?", "The Art of the Deal, a memoir that offers readers 11 steps for business success, was a smash when first published in November 1987. Trump hosted a celebrity-filled launch party, landed on the covers of magazines and toured the late night talk show circuit to promote and discuss the book.", "\"The momentum around the book was tremendous,\" wrote journalist Timothy L. O\u2019Brien in a biography of the mogul. \"The voice that sprang from the pages was entirely original, seemingly candid, relentlessly boastful and refreshingly unafraid to take swipes, settle scores, and opine with an I-am-what-I-am gusto. The Art of the Deal was a tour of the business world according to Mister Id, and readers ate it up.\"", "It spent 51 weeks on the\u00a0New York Times' bestseller list and, according to some reports, sold 1 million copies.

Trump\u2019s book can certainly be shelved in the business section, as it\u2019s both a memoir by a business executive and offers business advice.

While the book was very successful, it comes nowhere near claiming the title of top seller.
