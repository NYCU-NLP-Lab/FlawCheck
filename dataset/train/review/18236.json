["The claim has been viewed hundreds of times after\u00a0it was published on Instagram\u00a0here\u00a0by the Australian Vaccination-risks Network on July 2, 2020.", "The post's lengthy caption\u00a0opens with: \u201cGardasil is Murder! The Australian Government\u2019s Cancer data show the dramatic rise in cervical cancer in young girls vaccinated with Gardasil.\u201d It adds that\u00a0\u201ctens of thousands of girls globally\u201d have blamed Gardasil for their autoimmune diseases.", "According to Australia\u2019s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), a division within the Department of Health,\u00a0Gardasil is a vaccine that\u00a0\"protects young women from the strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) that cause 70% of cervical cancers.\u201d", "In 2007, the vaccine was introduced to Australia\u2019s National Immunisation Program, which offers\u00a0free immunisations to people throughout\u00a0the country, and was used\u00a0specifically for girls aged\u00a012 and 13. It is\u00a0also used in\u00a0HPV vaccination programmes in the UK and US.", "Similar claims have also been shared on Facebook here, here and here; on Twitter here and here; and on Instagram here.", "The\u00a0claims, however, are false.", "Australian government graphic", "The chart featured in the misleading post claims to show \u201ccervical cancer age-specific rates by sex and age group, 2019\u201d and a \u201ccancer epidemic in Gardasil girls\u201d. The post attributes the claim to a government website.", "The link in the misleading post is a legitimate URL\u00a0that leads to the website of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), where the graphic was indeed published under \u201cCancer data in Australia\u201d.", "However, the graphic does not reflect real-life scenarios, as the AIHW warned on its website. It was actually created using projected estimates for 2019, not actual data.", "Below is a screenshot comparison between the graphic in the misleading post (L) and the one published on the AIHW website:", "AIHW spokesperson Justin Harvey\u00a0told AFP via email that drawing conclusions based on comparing single years is \u201cnot recommended\u201d because the small amount of annual cases means fluctuations can occur. \u201cA rate could be higher or lower in one year than in another year due to chance alone\u201d.", "Harvey added that trends in cervical cancer incidence rates for the mentioned age groups \u201cdo not describe an \u2018epidemic\u2019 of cervical cancer among young women in Australia\u201d.", "Dr. David Wrede, a surgical gynaecologist with the Royal Women\u2019s Hospital in Melbourne, told AFP Gardasil is \u201csafe and effective\u201d, and that cervical cancer is most common among women aged between 35 and 50, and those over 70, as illustrated by the AIHW chart. A similar curve was presented by incidence figures in the several years preceding 2019 in Australia, as well as the UK, US and the Netherlands.", "Gardasil and cervical cancer", "\u201cVaccination with Gardasil is most effective when given to females before they are likely to be exposed to HPV. Four out of five people will be exposed to HPV during their lifetime and exposure to HPV from a single lifetime partner can still be enough to result in an infection that can lead to cervical cancer,\u201d Australia\u2019s TGA states here.", "\u201cNo deaths directly linked to the vaccine have been reported in Australia, the USA or Europe,\u201d the TGA\u00a0added.", "The same conculsion\u00a0was echoed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s \u201cHPV Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness Data\u201d page, as well as this fact sheet from Australia\u2019s National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance.", "While deaths following the injection of HPV vaccines were previously noted, reports from Australia\u2019s Department of Health and the University of Adelaide both said there was no relationship between \u201cany serious adverse event and HPV vaccination\u201d.", "Gardasil and autoimmune diseases", "The claim that \u201ctens of thousands of girls globally\u201d blame Gardasil for \u201ctheir catastrophic autoimmune diseases\u201d has previously circulated online.", "The claim was made, for instance,\u00a0in a retracted report by Canadian newspaper The Toronto Star;\u00a0a debunked video by American politician Robert F. Kennedy, who advocates against mandatory vaccinations;\u00a0and this article by British newspaper The Daily Mail that alleged tens of thousands of teenage girls had fallen ill with \u201cdebilitating illnesses after routing HPV cervical cancer jab\u201d.", "Those claims, however, were refuted by multiple scientific studies that found no correlation between HPV vaccination and the prevalence of autoimmune diseases, such as this one and this one published in peer-reviewed medical journals the BMJ and the Journal of Internal Medicine.", "\u201cHundreds of millions of doses of this vaccine have been given. There is no evidence to support increased autoimmune disease or neurological disease. None,\u201d Dr. Wrede told AFP.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
