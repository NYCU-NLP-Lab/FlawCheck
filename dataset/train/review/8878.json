It would put more money in people\u2019s pockets than giving them $1,000 a month.", "Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would eventually put more than $1,000 a month in some pockets, but Yang\u2019s so-called \u201cFreedom Dividend\u201d would pay \u201c$1,000 per month, or $12,000 per year, to all U.S. citizens over the age of 18 \u2026 no questions asked.\u201d", "Booker is a cosponsor of \u201cRaise the Wage Act,\u201d which would increase the minimum wage to $15, but not until six years after enactment.

As we have written, it is a matter of debate among economists and tax experts as to whether her plan would raise as much as she expects.", "One of Warren\u2019s challengers at the debate, Yang, noted that several European countries have repealed their wealth taxes \u201cbecause it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they\u2019d projected.\u201d That\u2019s backed up in a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But the report also argues that a wealth tax is likely needed to close the wealth inequality gap, and it outlines a number of proposed improvements to make a wealth tax more effective than those in Europe. Warren\u2019s plan incorporates many of those suggestions.", "Under Warren\u2019s plan, households would pay an annual 2% tax on all assets \u2014 net worth \u2014 above $50 million, and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion. During the debate, Warren highlighted some of the things that tax could bankroll.", "Warren: And right now in America, the top 0.1 percent have so much wealth \u2014 understand this \u2014 that if we put a 2 cent tax on their 50 millionth and first dollar, and on every dollar after that, we would have enough money to provide universal child care for every baby in this country, age zero to 5, universal pre-K for every child, raise the wages of every child care worker and preschool teacher in America, provide for universal tuition-free college, put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities \u2026 and cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it.", "Warren estimates her wealth tax would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years, based on an analysis by University of California, Berkeley economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez, who study wealth inequality.", "When we wrote about Warren\u2019s plan back in June in our story \u201cFacts on Warren\u2019s Wealth Tax Plan,\u201d we noted that several prominent economists and tax experts cast doubt on Warren\u2019s estimate of the revenue the tax would generate, warning that wealthy people would find ways to avoid the tax.", "Yang noted that that was one of the reasons several European countries scrapped their wealth tax plans.", "Yang: And a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is that it\u2019s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they\u2019d projected. If we can\u2019t learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countries\u2019 mistakes.", "Indeed, while as many as a dozen countries in Europe had a wealth tax in the early 1990s, that number has dropped to three as of 2018, according to an OECD report. (In 2018, France replaced its net wealth tax with a new real estate wealth tax.)", "\u201cDecisions to repeal net wealth taxes have often been justified by efficiency and administrative concerns and by the observation that net wealth taxes have frequently failed to meet their redistributive goals,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThe revenues collected from net wealth taxes have also, with a few exceptions, been very low.\u201d", "However, the report \u201calso argues that capital income taxes alone will most likely not be enough to address wealth inequality and suggests the need to complement capital income taxes with a form of wealth taxation.\u201d", "The report makes several recommendations to bolster the effectiveness of a wealth tax \u2014 lessons learned from the European examples. Warren\u2019s plan has attempted to incorporate many of those suggestions.", "For example, the OECD report recommends a wealth tax only be levied on the very wealthy, that the rate should be low, exemptions and reliefs should be limited (to prevent those subject to the tax from moving assets into exempted categories), and that payments should be allowed in installments for those \u201cfacing liquidity constraints.\u201d All of those are part of Warren\u2019s plan.", "Under the Warren plan, those with liquidity issues would be able to defer tax payments, with interest, for up to five years. And to guard against wealthy Americans simply moving out of the country to avoid the wealth tax, Warren\u2019s plan would assess a one-time 40% \u201cexit tax\u201d on the net worth above $50 million for those who renounce their citizenship.", "We take no position on whether those provisions in the Warren plan would address the lower-than-expected revenues generated by some European countries that tried a wealth tax, but we simply note that there is significant disagreement among economists and tax experts.", "As he has done in past debates, Biden repeatedly criticized the Medicare for All proposal as a budget buster, saying it would increase federal spending by $30 trillion over 10 years. But Biden ignored that nearly all health care spending by businesses, local governments and individuals would go away.", "At one point, Biden said: \u201cThe plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.\u201d He turned to the issue later in the debate, saying something similar: \u201cIt costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That\u2019s over $3 trillion \u2014 it\u2019s more than the entire federal budget.\u201d", "We should start out by saying that $30 trillion over 10 years is not \u201cmore than the entire federal budget.\u201d In its August report on long-term budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office estimates federal outlays will be $57.8 trillion over 10 years, from 2020 to 2029.", "Also, as\u00a0we\u2019ve explained\u00a0before, we don\u2019t know how much Medicare for All would cost, since many details are yet to be determined. But two estimates, one by the\u00a0Urban Institute\u00a0and another by the\u00a0Mercatus Center\u00a0at George Mason University, said the federal government cost would be $32 trillion or $32.6 trillion over 10 years.", "The government would have to raise taxes or fees, or cut other spending, to cover the costs. But Biden ignores the fact that current health care spending by private insurers, employers, individuals and states would shift to the federal government.", "In relating the severity of the opioid epidemic, Yang and Steyer gave inaccurate figures for the number of overdose deaths from opioids.", "\u201cI think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that America\u2019s had \u2014 72,000 people died of opioid overdoses last year,\u201d Steyer said in response to a moderator\u2019s question about how he would address the opioid epidemic.", "Steyer\u2019s statistic, however, is for 2017, and applies to deaths from overdoses from any drug, not just those from opioids. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s website, there were 70,237 deaths from any drug in 2017, with 47,600, or 67.8%, involving opioids.", "For 2018, provisional CDC data suggest that overdose deaths fell, to 68,618 deaths from any drug. The agency estimates that 47,625 deaths, or 69%, were opioid-related.", "The 72,000 number that Steyer used is well known because it was widely reported as a provisional 2017 figure from the CDC in August 2018 (the final data, which we report above, differs slightly, and is limited to U.S. residents).", "Yang made a similar error when he claimed that Purdue Pharma was responsible for eight deaths per hour.", "Yang: There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio. And for some reason, the federal government thought that was appropriate. They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money, until you realize that company made $30 billion. They got a 2% fine, and they killed tens of thousands of Americans, eight an hour.", "We contacted the Yang campaign to find out the source of the eight deaths an hour claim, and we were directed to a Vox news article reporting on the initial 2017 estimate of 72,000 overdose deaths, which noted that the death toll was equivalent to nearly 200 per day. The campaign then spelled out the math, explaining that 200 divided by 24 hours was 8.33.", "The math checks out, but as with Steyer, those eight deaths per hour were not due just to opioids. Rather, opioids were involved in about 5\u00a0deaths per hour\u00a0in\u00a02017.", "Yang\u2019s other error is to ascribe all of the overdose deaths to Purdue Pharma. While Purdue Pharma, as the maker of OxyContin, is arguably responsible for many opioid-related deaths, the company isn\u2019t responsible for all of them.", "Sanders stated that \u201c500,000 people\u201d are \u201cgoing bankrupt\u201d because \u201cthey came down with cancer.\u201d As we wrote in September, Sanders is referencing a March 2019 editorial article in the American Journal of Public Health.\u00a0Of the 910 respondents who declared bankruptcy between 2013 and 2016, 66.5% said medical expenses or medical problems either \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery much\u201d contributed to their bankruptcies. This percentage translates to just under half a million bankruptcies when applied to the 750,489 non-business bankruptcies filed from 2015-2019.", "Medical issues weren\u2019t the sole reason for some of those bankruptcies. Also, the survey did not ask about specific medical conditions, so there\u2019s no evidence those bankruptcies happened only because of medical expenses related to cancer or any other disease.", "Sanders repeated another claim he has made in previous debates, saying that \u201c87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured.\u201d As we\u2019ve written before, this figure comes from a Commonwealth Fund study and includes 19.3 million who were insured when they were surveyed but had a gap in coverage in the previous year.", "\u201cOf the 194 million U.S. adults ages 19 to 64 in 2018, an estimated 87 million, or 45 percent, were inadequately insured,\u201d the study said.
