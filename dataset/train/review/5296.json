["About this rating", "In January 2016, a\u00a0wildly popular six-second video that shows\u00a0a \"weather reporter\" knocked aside by a fish became enormously popular not long after\u00a0it was uploaded, garnering\u00a0millions of views and shares.  The video's caption read, \"When you're trying to vlog and get hit by a fish\":", "The woman in the video was Aimee Bannister, who isn't actually a weather reporter: She's part of the Welsh travel and adventure vlogging duo that goes by \"Craig & Aimee,\" with a\u00a0site\u00a0called \"Kinging-It.\"", "It's not clear whether\u00a0people shared the video because they believed it was real, or simply because they thought watching someone get hit in the face with a fish is very funny. The incident was given further attention when it was reported with pun-filled gusto by British news media. However, this elegant bit of slapstick was not real.", "First of all, the circulated version of the video was only six seconds long, and Bannister has yet to release it in its entirety or comment on the matter in detail (other than to say that she's fine). \u00a0Second, the pictured fish was clearly already dead rather than alive and wriggling and appeared to have been gutted:", "Third,\u00a0the wave came down at Aimee from behind her, while the fish seemingly flew out of nowhere (looking as though someone had tossed it at her head) from a position in front of her. \u00a0So while a woman in Wales really did get hit in the face with a fish, it doesn't appear that the incident was anything but staged. \u00a0One might call it a bit fishy.", "Brooke Binkowski is a former editor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
