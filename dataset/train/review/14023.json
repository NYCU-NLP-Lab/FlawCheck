If you were waiting for Congress\u2019s Pippi Socialiststockings to do something that isn\u2019t stupid, today is not your day. With an excited flurry of fanfare, the youngest member of Congress at 23 offered up bill 6566 to submit for review, which states that: \u201cThe practice of openly carrying a weapon or firearm on one\u2019s person in common view of the public shall be made an illegal act within the United States and subject to fine or imprisonment.\u201d", "Ocasio-Cortez offered up no such bill. H.R. 6556, authored by U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Connecticut, is actually the\"Agent Orange Exposure Fairness Act\" and has nothing to do with firearms. The measure is related to services offered to military veterans who have been exposed to Agent Orange. Courtney introduced the bill in 2018, but it has not been enacted.", "The Daily World story is not real news but was instead offered up by a website that produces content described as satirical in nature.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
