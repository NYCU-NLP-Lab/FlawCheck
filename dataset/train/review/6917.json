There is no evidence to suggest that Biden disclosed the names of the SEALs or their family members to the terrorist organization.", "The claim appears to have originated shortly after Biden announced his 2020 bid for president in late April 2019. It appears to be rooted in a May 3 address he gave about the military operation that led to bin Laden\u2019s death.", "The operation played out in the early hours of May 2, 2011, at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.", "Nine hours behind in Washington D.C., it was still May 1. President Obama confirmed that bin Laden had been killed in a televised address to the country that evening and said no Americans were harmed in the raid.

He did not, however, say the specific unit or call out any members by name.", "\"Let me briefly acknowledge tonight\u2019s distinguished honorees,\" Biden said before praising U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis: \"Admiral Jim Stavridis is the real deal; he could tell you more about and understands the incredible, the phenomenal, the just almost unbelievable capacity of his Navy SEALs and what they did last\u00a0Sunday.\"", "He later continued, \"Folks, I\u2019d be remiss also if I didn\u2019t say an extra word about the incredible events, extraordinary events this past Sunday.
