["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on April 17, 2019", "An old meme from Ben Carson\u2019s days as a Republican candidate for president is circulating again. But there\u2019s still no evidence that he said, \u201cMy mother raised me with no help from the government.\u201d", "In November 2015, Ben Carson briefly led the polls for candidates seeking the Republican nomination for president.", "Now that he\u2019s the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a meme from his days as a candidate is circulating again on Facebook.\u00a0The meme claims that on Nov. 7, 2015, Carson said: \u201cMy mother raised me with no help from the government. We had food stamps and welfare and Section 8 housing, but we made it on our own.\u201d", "Many of those posting it now are doing so in defense of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, adding the observation: \u201cAnd conservatives want to laugh at AOC?\u201d", "Carson wrote in his 1990 autobiography, Gifted Hands, that his family relied on government assistance, specifically food stamps, for a time when he was growing up. But there is no evidence in the public record that Carson said what the meme claims.", "Nov. 7, 2015, was a Saturday; Carson sent one tweet that day, but it was about donations to his campaign. The only extensive comments we found him making were in an interview taped that night for a segment that aired on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d the next morning. In that interview, Carson answered questions about his claims of being a violent teen and being offered admission to West Point. He did not talk about food stamps and public housing, as the meme claims.", "Actually, an early version of the Carson meme included the web address of a now-defunct Facebook page that described its content as political \u201csatire and parody.\u201d That indicates the meme was never meant to be taken seriously in the first place.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Polls \u2014 2016 Republican Presidential Nomination.
