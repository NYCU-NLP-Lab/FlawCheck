["By Robert Farley", "Posted on March 2, 2021", "President Joe Biden boasts that the U.S. is on pace to be the first country in the world to vaccinate 100 million people. That\u2019s true, but per capita the U.S. is not tops in the world in vaccinations.", "Israel has administered about four times as many doses per 100 people as the U.S., and the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom have also administered significantly more doses per capita than the U.S., according to Our World in Data.", "Speaking at an event on Feb. 25 commemorating the 50 millionth COVID-19 vaccine shot, Biden noted that the U.S. is ahead of schedule to deliver on his promise of administering 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office.", "As we have written, the U.S. was already virtually at the pace Biden set as his goal \u2014 1 million shots per day \u2014 before he took any action as president. It has risen since then. The seven-day average daily number of people vaccinated was 1.4 million on Feb. 24, 47% higher than on Jan. 20, when Biden was inaugurated, according to  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s COVID Data Tracker. According to preliminary numbers from the CDC, the U.S. had administered more than 78 million vaccine doses by March 1, with more than 57 million of them coming since Biden took office.", "\u201cAnd the more people get vaccinated, the faster we\u2019re going to beat this pandemic,\u201d Biden said from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. \u201cThat\u2019s why one of my first goals in office when I \u2014 just before I was sworn in, I indicated that my goal was to get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in people\u2019s arms in my first 100 days as president. At first, critics said that goal was too ambitious; no one could do that. And then they said it was too small. But the bottom line, though, is that America will be the first country \u2014 perhaps the only one \u2014 to get that done.\u201d", "In remarks at a Federal Emergency Management Agency COVID-19 vaccination facility in Houston the following day, Biden again boasted that the U.S. was \u201cahead of schedule\u201d to meet his 100 million shots in 100 days goal.", "\u201cAnd because of the people behind me and others, America \u2026 is going to be the first in the country \u2014 perhaps the first in the world \u2014 to get that done,\u201d Biden said.", "The implication, of course, is that the U.S. \u2014 the third most populous\u00a0country \u2014 is leading the world in vaccine distribution. And in raw numbers, that\u2019s accurate, according to the University of Oxford-based project Our World in Data.", "But that\u2019s not true per capita.", "Looking at the total COVID-19 vaccination doses administered per capita for countries with a population of at least 1 million, Israel leads the world, with 94.9 doses per 100 people as of March 1. Second is the UAE at 60.9 doses per 100 people, and the United Kingdom is third at 31.1 doses per 100 people. By this measure, the U.S. ranks fourth at 23.2 doses per 100 people. This represents people who have gotten at least one dose of vaccine. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines \u2014 the only vaccines that had been administered at that time \u2014 require two doses to be most effective.", "The United States\u2019 seven-day average for daily vaccine doses administered per 100 people also ranked fourth on March 1.", "Nor is the U.S. tops when looking at the percentage of a country\u2019s population that has gotten at least one dose of a vaccine. According to a New York Times\u00a0project, \u201cTracking Coronavirus Vaccinations Around the World,\u201d Israel (54%), the United Kingdom (30.5%), Bahrain (19%) and Chile (19%) all have vaccinated a larger percentage of their population than the U.S. (15%).", "Biden\u2019s boast about the raw number of vaccinations in the U.S. leading the world reminds us of former President Donald Trump\u2019s frequent claims that the U.S. led the world in testing for the coronavirus. But as is the case with Biden here, Trump was citing raw numbers for a relatively populous U.S. as opposed to the per-capita figure.", "Editor\u2019s Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
