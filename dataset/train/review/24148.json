The ad drew widespread backlash and derision at the time, and the account later deleted the post and apologized.", "Because a KFC-related entity did create the fried chicken black power fist artwork in August 2020, but because the image of the viral tweet is fake, we rank the claim \"Mostly False.\"", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
