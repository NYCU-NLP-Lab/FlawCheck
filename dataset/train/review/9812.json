["By Lori Robertson, Rem Rieder, Eugene Kiely and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on October 27, 2020", "In the swing state of Pennsylvania, President Donald Trump repeatedly rattled off false and misleading claims about ballots and voting in arguing to his supporters \u201cthe only way we can lose, in my opinion, is massive fraud.\u201d", "On Oct. 26, Trump spoke in Allentown, Martinsburg and Lititz, Pennsylvania. Trump narrowly\u00a0won\u00a0the state in 2016, and its 20 electoral votes\u00a0were crucial for his victory.", "The 2020 election is the first time Pennsylvanians can vote by mail without a specific reason, thanks to legislation signed by Gov. Tom Wolf in late October 2019. As of Oct. 27, 1.85 million mail-in ballots have been cast in the state, according to the U.S. Elections Project run by Michael McDonald, a professor of political science at the University of Florida.", "In 2018, just 186,664 mail-in votes were tallied,\u00a0according to the Election Assistance Commission.", "Because of the surge of mail-in ballots, and a state law that prevents election officials from counting the ballots until Election Day, experts caution that the winner in Pennsylvania may not be known on election night.", "Republicans in Pennsylvania have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rehear a case on the deadline in the state for accepting mail-in ballots. The high court, by a 4-4 vote, upheld the state Supreme Court ruling that ballots mailed by Election Day (or presumed to have been mailed by Election Day) could be counted if they arrived by 5 p.m. on Nov. 6, three days after Election Day.", "Trump has made false statements about that case, too.", "Trump falsely\u00a0claimed in Allentown that Republican Mitt Romney got no votes or almost no votes in Philadelphia when he ran against President Barack Obama in 2012.", "Trump, Oct. 26: That\u2019s why Romney got almost zero. When Romney in Philadelphia, remember he got almost zero votes. How did he get zero votes in a city?", "In fact, Romney\u00a0received\u00a096,467 votes in the city, about 14% of the total cast. That\u2019s not a large percentage, but Philadelphia is a heavily Democratic city.", "That\u2019s similar to how Romney fared in Chicago, where he got nearly 15% of the total vote and zero votes in 43 precincts. Romney did even worse in Detroit, where he got only 2.1% of that city\u2019s vote.", "Four years ago, before he was elected, Trump made related claims questioning how some precincts could have \u201cpractically nobody voting for the Republican,\u201d suggesting it was evidence of \u201crigged\u201d elections.", "What is true is that there were 50 divisions in the city where Romney received no votes. The city had 1,687 divisions at the time, according to the\u00a0Philadelphia Inquirer. As we\u00a0wrote,\u00a0it was originally thought to be 59 divisions, but it was later discovered that votes had in fact been cast for Romney in nine of the divisions.", "While that may be surprising, Joe DeFelice, who was head of election day operations for the Pennsylvania Republican Party that day, said there was no indication of vote fraud. He\u00a0told\u00a0the\u00a0Inquirer\u00a0it is \u201calmost impossible\u201d to remove votes from a Philadelphia voting machine.", "So what happened? DeFelice said most of the divisions were in heavily Black neighborhoods in West and North Philadelphia.", "\u201cIt was a presidential election,\u201d DeFelice said. \u201cYou had a rich, white Republican running against a black Democrat.\u201d", "As he has said of other states\u00a0headed by Democratic governors, such as\u00a0Nevada, Trump falsely\u00a0claimed\u00a0that the Democratic governor in Pennsylvania is responsible for counting mail-in ballots.", "Trump, Oct. 26:\u00a0But the problem is how is he going to be the one when he tries to play games with sites that counts ballots, right? He counts ballots. It\u2019s the governor.", "Wrong. Under\u00a0Pennsylvania law, the county boards of elections have the power among other things to \u201cselect and equip\u201d polling places, to certify poll watchers, to investigate allegations of fraud and irregularities, and to count ballots and certify the results. The governor has no authority to count ballots.", "Trump made two false claims about a lawsuit concerning poll watchers in Philadelphia.", "Trump, Oct. 26: Did you see where they fought us because they didn\u2019t want poll watchers. They took us to court and we had a bad decision. \u2026 This judge \u2026 he said no you can\u2019t have poll watchers. So he\u2019s saying we can\u2019t even watch as they count the ballots. But we\u2019re going to appeal it and we\u2019ll end up winning.", "First, it was the Trump campaign that filed the lawsuit in early October \u2014 not officials in Pennsylvania. After being denied access in September, the Trump campaign sued the Philadelphia County Board of Elections in order to have its campaign representatives be able to observe what was happening at new election satellite offices across the city. At those offices, individuals are able to register to vote, apply for and receive a mail-in ballot, and, if they choose to do so, complete the ballot and return it on site.", "Second, Judge Gary Glazer didn\u2019t rule that the campaign couldn\u2019t have poll watchers at actual polling locations where votes are counted. He sided with local officials who said that the Trump campaign didn\u2019t have a right under the law to send its representatives to the election board\u2019s satellite offices because votes are not counted at those locations.", "As Glazer explained: \u201cThe only activities occurring at the satellite offices are voter registration, application for mail-in ballots by individual voters, provision of mail-in ballots to individual voters, private completion of mail-in ballots by individual voters, and delivery by individual voters of their own mail-in ballots. No canvassing, re-canvassing, opening, counting, recounting, computation, or recording of ballots, votes, or voting machines is occurring at the satellite offices.\u201d", "Thus, he concluded, \u201cGiven their scope, timing, and purpose, the satellite offices do not constitute polling places where watchers have a right to be present under the Election Code.\u201d", "A Pennsylvania appeals court upheld Glazer\u2019s ruling on Oct. 23.", "In Allentown, Trump continued his attacks on mail-in ballots, telling the crowd there was evidence of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d across the country, mentioning \u201cthousands of ballots.\u201d But the one example he cited wasn\u2019t an instance of fraud, and it involved nine ballots.", "Trump, Oct. 26: It\u2019s the only way we can lose, in my opinion, is massive fraud. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Because all over the country, you\u2019re seeing it. Thousands and thousands of ballots. How about the military ballots that were thrown into a garbage can \u2014 with the name Trump on it?", "In Lititz, Trump also claimed that \u201cthey throw away ballots if it has the name Trump on it, boom.\u201d", "As we\u2019ve written before, in September,\u00a0nine military ballots \u2014 seven known to be cast for Trump, the Justice Department said \u2014 were found in the trash in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, about an hour\u2019s drive northwest of Allentown. State and county officials have since said the ballots were discarded in error.", "Jonathan Marks, the state deputy secretary for elections, told the\u00a0Times Leader of Wilkes-Barre that paper military and overseas ballots sometimes are mailed in envelopes that are not clearly marked as ballots.", "\u201cSo it sounds like it was confusion,\u201d Marks said.", "A Sept. 25 statement by County Manager C. David Pedri said the incident involved a temporary contract worker who \u201cincorrectly discarded\u201d the material, which was discovered by the county elections director on Sept. 16, two days after the unnamed contract employee began work in the office. The employee was subsequently fired, and all trash from the employee\u2019s short time in the office was secured and searched.", "\u201cWhile the actions of this individual has cast a concern, the above statement shows that the system of checks and balances set forth in Pennsylvania elections works,\u201d Pedri said. \u201cAn error was made, a public servant discovered it and reported it to law enforcement at the local, State and Federal level who took over to ensure the integrity of the system in place. The Luzerne County voters should be assured that the election will move forward with transparency and integrity.\u201d", "G. Terry Madonna, a public affairs professor at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, told us \u201cthere are no serious studies\u201d that show widespread voter fraud. \u201cYou can\u2019t rule out that there will be mistakes by election officials, but it is not the same thing as fraud,\u201d he said.", "In Martinsburg, Trump\u00a0repeated\u00a0his false claim that Nevada voters are not required to sign their mail ballots and, if they do sign them, the signatures don\u2019t have to be verified.", "Trump, Oct. 26:\u00a0You know, they want to have a thing in Nevada where you don\u2019t have to prove signature, minor things like that. Right?", "As we have\u00a0written before, Nevada law requires mail ballots to include valid voter signatures, which must be verified by election officials.", "Trump is distorting the facts about a\u00a0law\u00a0signed\u00a0in August by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak expanding mail voting in the state. The law did spell out in more detail than previous laws the procedures for dealing with suspect signatures and provisions for allowing voters to verify them. But it did not change the signature requirement.", "To counter such false information, the office of\u00a0Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, an elected Republican, posted\u00a0a\u00a0fact sheet\u00a0on its website dealing with \u201cFacts vs. Myths\u201d about the 2020 general election.", "\u201cWhile the bill did include language detailing how signature verification must be performed, the bill simply put into law the procedure that was already being followed for signature verification,\u201d the fact sheet states. \u201cThe bill did not \u2018water down\u2019 or weaken the signature verification process.\u201d", "In Lititz, Trump made an apparent reference to an issue in Los Angeles County where about 2,100 voters accidentally received mail-in ballots that were missing the presidential race entirely. But Trump claimed the ballots were missing \u201cone little thing, the name Trump\u201d and referred to \u201c25,000\u201d ballots.", "Trump, Oct. 26: They printed ballots, some ballots, I think 25,000, were printed for certain states. It was missing one little thing, the name Trump. So a lot of bad things happened.", "The president has made false claims about the L.A. County issue before, including in an Oct. 20 rally in Pennsylvania.", "On Oct. 5, about 2,100 absentee ballots without the presidential race included were mailed, the\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u00a0reported. The next day, the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk\u2019s office\u00a0said that the \u201cprinting error\u201d affected \u201cone precinct in Woodland Hills,\u201d and had been corrected. \u201cReplacement ballots were mailed to ALL impacted voters today after reaching out last night through email and robocalls to inform them of the issue.\u201d", "We couldn\u2019t find any information about an issue involved \u201c25,000\u201d ballots. We\u2019ve reached out to the Trump campaign about that and haven\u2019t yet received a response.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0Swing State Watch\u00a0is an occasional series about false and misleading political messages in key states that will help decide the 2020 presidential election.", "Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
