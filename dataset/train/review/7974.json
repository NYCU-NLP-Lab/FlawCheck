["About this rating", "On Jan. 15, 2021, the website Mediaite published an article positing that CNN anchor Don Lemon\u2019s remarks that voters of incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump were on the same side as Nazis, the Klan, and the violent mob that stormed the Capitol, was an indictment of more than 74 million Americans.", "In that article, the writer Tommy Christopher described Lemon as \u201copenly Black.\u201d", "Don Lemon\u2019s Remarks About Trump Voters and The Klan and Nazis Are a Slap in the Face to 74 Million Americans", "CNN anchor Don Lemon sparked intense reaction this week with remarks about people who voted for President Donald Trump in which he indicted them as \u201con the same side\u201d as Nazis, the Klan, and violent insurrectionists. Those remarks are a slap in the face to the 74 million Americans who voted for Trump.", "I don\u2019t want to sugarcoat this, what Don Lemon said is extremely disturbing. Colleague Chris Cuomo was trying to argue \u2014 devil\u2019s advocate-style \u2014 that not all Trump voters should be lumped in with the racist insurrectionists who attacked the Capitol last week.", "\u201cNow what you hear is, well, you can\u2019t say that everybody who voted for Trump is like the people who went into the capitol. Response,\u201d Cuomo said.", "Lemon \u2014 who is openly Black \u2014 responded by telling Cuomo that \u201cif you are on that side you need to think about the side you\u2019re on. I\u2019m never on the side of the Klan. I am never \u2014 principled people, conservative or liberal never on the Klan side, principled people, conservative or liberal, never on the Nazi side.\u201d", "The writer continued later in the article:", "But that\u2019s not the most important question in determining whether Lemon should apologize. Something can be true and still be messed up to say.", "That\u2019s the reason I mentioned that Don Lemon is openly Black because that fact adds to the sting of an already painful statement \u2014 pain that was evident not just in the response from these two prominent Republicans, but also in Cuomo\u2019s devil\u2019s advocacy, and in his attempt the following night to separate Trump voters from the Capitol insurrectionists.", "An editor\u2019s note below the article stated, \u201cThe author\u2019s use of the phrase 'openly Black' was satirical. You can read a full explanation of the reference here.\u201d", "Lemon and Chris Cuomo reacted to the story on-air, cracking up at the use of the phrase, with Lemon calling it \u201cbrilliant.\u201d", "In a follow-up article the author expanded on his use of the phrase \u201copenly black\u201d:", "The first part of the column was written in the satirical voice of someone criticizing Lemon for his remarks, only to later flip around in support of Lemon. And in that column, I referred to Mr. Lemon as \u201copenly Black,\u201d a joke that I\u2019ve used many times before as a way to mock white reactionaries who treat other people\u2019s immutable identities as though they were deliberate attempts to offend, and to cut through the thin subtexts they often use.", "Ironically, I was inspired to use the bit by a conservative website that would incessantly I.D. media figures like Don Lemon as \u201copenly gay\u201d in a derogatory manner, but I can\u2019t claim credit for the premise. Stephen Colbert also used it as part of his Colbert Report character\u2019s absurd lexicon of phrases, and as I was reminded when the joke blew up on social media yesterday, the legendary George Carlin riffed on the phrase as well.", "For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
