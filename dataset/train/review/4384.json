The effort followed Democrats' winning a majority of seats in the New York legislature in the 2018 midterm elections, giving that party control of the governor's office and both chambers of the legislature for the first time in a decade.", "Those lawmakers approved the state's own version of the DREAM (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors) Act in a vote that followed party lines. Although the name of the New York law echoes a federal bill that has languished in the U.S. Congress in one version or another since 2001, New York's DREAM Act doesn't provide a path to citizenship.

We have repeatedly passed the DREAM Act because we know it is economically misguided and morally unjust to deprive students educated in our very own public schools of the tools they need to be successful.\"", "\"For the vast majority of students, the pursuit of higher education would be impossible without access to financial aid,\" said Assemblymember Deborah J. Glick, chair of the Higher Education Committee. \"Our public primary and secondary schools are required by law to educate our children and prepare them for college, regardless of residence or immigration status. That investment is squandered when higher education is placed out of reach, and it is a huge disservice to students and all New Yorkers.\"", "In order to qualify for assistance, undocumented students must meet the following requirements:", "New York governor Andrew Cuomo anticipated the assistance program would cost $27 million (0.015%) of the state's $175 billion overall budget.", "New York joined two other states who recently enacted similar legislation that allows undocumented students to qualify for financial aid. In 2017 and 2018 respectively, California and New Jersey launched their own in-state versions of the DREAM Act. In May 2018. NJ.com reports:", "College students who are unauthorized immigrants in the state are already allowed to pay for their Garden State college classes at in-state rates. Former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, gave thousands of students who grew up in New Jersey but are in the country illegally that ability in 2013.", "Now, Gov.
