Officials said the rapid DNA tests, administered through cheek swabs, were done on a voluntary basis.

Using such methods, agents detected more than 1,000 instances of fraudulent families attempting to cross the Southern Border from October 2018 through April of this year, according to the Washington Post.", "During a three-day pilot operation from May 8-10, DNA testing revealed a portion of the groups caught crossing the border illegally had lied about being related.

That\u2019s a rate of 19%.", "The June ICE statement also said the agency would extend the pilot program by 120 days, and expand it to five additional border locations beginning later that month.
