Turns out we had to pull out the red pen.", "We asked the White House to defend Obama's claim, and received no response. His claim that eighth grade math students\u00a0in the United States are in ninth place internationally almost certainly comes from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, a periodic comparison of math and science achievement carried out since 1995 by research institutions and government agencies worldwide.", "The\n\nmost recent study\n\n, published in 2007, did indeed show U.S. eighth graders in ninth place behind five East Asian countries and Hungary, England and Russia.", "But it was misleading to say they had \"fallen\" to ninth place. In 1995, they\n\ncame in 28th\n\n. In 1999, they\n\nmoved up to 19th\n\n. In 2003, they climbed\n\nto 15th\n\n.
