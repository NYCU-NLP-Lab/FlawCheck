Although adjustments have to be made for factors such as enrollment growth, school systems would need about $747 million to be fully funded, based on the extra money put into education this year on Deal\u2019s recommendation.", "The campaign does the same thing with its math for Georgia\u2019s cost to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
