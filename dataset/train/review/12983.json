Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah.

If NGOs choose to stop doing abortions, they can remain eligible for federal grant money. The choice has been up to the NGO \u2013 either change business practices or forego funding from the United States.\"", "On the surface of it, Grothman seems to be correct.", "But there is more to it than that.", "Reagan-era Roots", "The program in question has been part of federal policy off and on for decades, with the policy frequently shifting between presidents.", "When originally announced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984 it was dubbed the \"Mexico City Policy\" after the site of a United Nations conference on global population. Critics called it the \"global gag rule.\"", "\"What the policy does is it requires foreign NGOs that receive U.S. government health assistance to certify that they are not using U.S. funds or any other funds to do several things,\" said Emily Maistrellis, a senior program officer for the Program on Global Health Justice and Governance within Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health. \"One is provide abortion as a method of family planning. Another is to counsel and refer women to an abortion in a context where abortions are legal.\"", "Organizations also can\u2019t advocate or lobby for the continued legality or push for the legality of abortion in their country. (The policy does not apply to cases of rape, incest or if childbirth endangers the mother\u2019s life.)", "President Bill Clinton revoked the policy in 1993, claiming it undermined efforts to promote safe family planning abroad. President George W. Bush reinstated it. Then President Barack Obama rescinded it.", "In 2017, President Donald Trump reinstated it -- but went further. He expanded it under a new name: Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance.", "The original version applied to funding for family planning programs.", "\"The policy in its expanded version is applied to any global health funding,\" Maistrellis said. \"It\u2019s expanded in terms of dollar amount. It\u2019s expanded in terms of areas of health and the potential (foreign) NGOs that will be affected.\"", "Barriers to funding abortions", "So, had the House Democrats been successful with their measure, and undid the new policy, would it mean U.S. aid money could then go to fund abortions?", "No.", "Before the Mexico City Policy, there was a budget amendment enacted in 1973 that states \"no foreign assistance funds may be used to pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.\"", "The so-called \"Helms Amendment\" was named for the late U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-North Carolina.", "That remains in place and, according to Maistrellis, is \"scrupulously applied\" by federal agencies.", "If that\u2019s the case, why has the Mexico City Policy been put in place and undone so many times over the years?", "That relates to a wrinkle in how it applies.", "Before the Mexico City Policy, U.S. aid recipients could use non-U.S. funds to engage in abortion-related activities, but had to keep it separate from U.S. aid money. So, when the policy is not in effect, countries that pursue abortion-related activities can still get U.S. family planning money. They just can\u2019t mix the two pots together.", "When the policy is in place, if foreign NGOs want to receive any family planning funds from the U.S., they cannot use any other funding for abortion-related activities.", "Meanwhile, under Trump\u2019s expanded policy, any U.S. health funding -- not just family-planning related money -- is affected in this way.", "That\u2019s the policy in place today.", "Our rating", "Grothman claimed a provision in a bill backed by House Democrats would \"allow the billions of dollars of aid we send to other countries to be used for abortions.\"", "Part of the language in the bill would have extended a long-running back-and-forth on the Mexico City policy.
