The trouble is \u2013 because of marijuana, couples who engage in sex while high seem to use condoms a lot more than couples that do it normally. And that means no babies. But, there\u2019s even a more worrisome side effect: pot also leads to couples going for abortions; once normal, they must become aware of their foolishness and then come to a decision that they don\u2019t want a baby.
