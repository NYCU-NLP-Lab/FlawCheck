["As reported by AFP, Clicks Pharmacy came under fire in early September\u00a0after running an online promotion for shampoo brand TRESemm\u00e9 that depicted black hair as \u201cdry & damaged\u201d and \u201cfrizzy & dull\u201d, and blonde hair as \u201cnormal\u201d.", "Shortly after the promotion was\u00a0launched, the alleged Dis-Chem ad appeared online on September 7, 2020.", "\u201cShop Now at Dis-Chem Online. You\u2019re Just a Few Clicks Away,\u201d reads the superimposed text on an image of a smiling black woman with natural hair. Designed to look like an advert, the picture features Dis-Chem's logo in the top-left corner.", "The purported ad has been shared more than 2,000 times on Facebook, including here, here, and here, and in hundreds of tweets. It was seen by many as an opportunistic response by Dis-Chem to a controversy which had engulfed rival company Clicks a few days earlier, starting on September 4, 2020.", "Opinion was divided among those who saw it as insensitive and those who found it funny.", "AFP Fact Check traced the earliest reference of the alleged advert to this archived tweet, but the account has since been deleted.", "Dis-Chem spent days responding to hundreds of tweets\u00a0with a standard denial that read: \u201cHi there, this ad was not published by Dis-Chem Pharmacies.\u201d", "Hi there, this ad was not published by Dis-Chem Pharmacies.", "Lynne Blignaut, who manages the social media and community engagement team for Dis-Chem, told AFP Fact Check that the \u201cdistasteful\u201d advert did not come from the company.", "\u201cOur content is created by an agency and is approved weeks in advance. If you take one look at our social media pages you\u2019ll know that it\u2019s not real,\u201d she said.", "Blignaut noted that the Dis-Chem logo used in the picture is not high-resolution and that the advert is not in line with the company\u2019s font or general corporate identity.", "She added that the purported advert, which was only seen on social media, also doesn\u2019t appear on Dis-Chem\u2019s website\u00a0or official Twitter, Facebook or Instagram accounts.", "A reverse image search shows that the photo of the woman in the yellow dress has been available online as a free stock image since at least December 2018.", "The furore stemmed from these images used in a Clicks online promotion and led to hashtags like #RacismMustFall and #BlackHairIsNormal, with black women posting images of their afros on Twitter.", "mhmmm idk hey... pic.twitter.com/a1VgxThTBh", "Protests were staged outside Clicks Pharmacy stores countrywide, forcing them to close on September 9, 2020 as some demonstrations turned violent.", "Multinational goods supplier Unilever, which owns\u00a0TRESemm\u00e9 South Africa, issued a\u00a0statement apologising\u00a0for using images that \u201cpromote racist stereotypes about hair\u201d in the marketing campaign. Despite this, a growing list of retailers have since pulled the hair products brand from their shelves.", "Leaders from political party Economic Freedom Fighters, which organised the protests, met with Unilever executives on September 10, 2020, when it was agreed that Unilever would remove all TRESemm\u00e9 products from retail stores for 10 days \u201cas a demonstration of remorse\u201d.", "Joint Statement of The EFF And Unilever On The Tresemme-SA Racist Image pic.twitter.com/IWxr93TSka", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
