["By Robert Farley", "Posted on January 30, 2019", "President Donald Trump wrongly claims that \u201c58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote.\u201d This latest voter fraud misinformation from the president is based on the state\u2019s efforts to match driver\u2019s license and state ID card applications from noncitizens to voter registration rolls.", "However, the Texas director of elections warns the lists provided to county elections officials represent \u201cWEAK matches\u201d (the capitalization and emphasis is the state\u2019s) and does not account for the possibility that many people on the list may have simply become naturalized citizens after having obtained a driver\u2019s license.", "History tells us to be wary of these numbers. In Florida, when officials similarly matched driver\u2019s license and voter registration data in 2012 in an attempt to remove noncitizens from voter rolls, an initial list of more than 180,000 names was ultimately whittled down to less than 100.", "Nevertheless, Trump, who has long warned \u2014 without evidence \u2014 about widespread voter fraud, claimed via Twitter that Texas had found evidence that tens of thousands of noncitizens have voted illegally in U.S. elections. Trump claimed Texas\u2019 discovery was \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d and that \u201cvoter fraud is rampant\u201d around the country. It \u201cMust be stopped,\u201d he wrote, with \u201cStrong voter ID!\u201d", "58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote. These numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. All over the country, especially in California, voter fraud is rampant. Must be stopped. Strong voter ID! @foxandfriends", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2019", "The president\u2019s tweet came after Keith Ingram, the state\u2019s director of elections,\u00a0released an advisory on Jan. 25 explaining that since March 2018 his office has been compiling data from the state\u2019s Department of Public Safety on applications for driver\u2019s licenses or Personal Identification Cards in which the applicants supplied a green card or work visa indicating they were noncitizens. The elections office, which is in the secretary of state\u2019s office, then matched that list against the voter registration rolls.", "A press release issued by Texas Secretary of State David Whitley announced that about 95,000 people identified by DPS records as noncitizens matched voter registration records in Texas, and that approximately 58,000 of them have voted in one or more elections between 1996 and 2018. The secretary recommended counties send notices to those on the list seeking proof of citizenship in order for the individuals to keep their voter registrations. The press release notes that voting in an election when one is knowingly ineligible \u2014 and noncitizens are ineligible to vote in Texas and federal elections \u2014 is a second-degree felony in Texas.", "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton shared those findings in a tweet (retweeted by Trump) beginning \u201cVOTER FRAUD ALERT.\u201d", "But none of those on the lists have been confirmed as noncitizen voters, and experts told us it is likely that further investigation will reveal that the vast majority are not.", "Chris Davis, the head of the Texas Association of Elections Administrators, told us it is \u201ccertainly possible\u201d that there may be matching errors in the state-generated lists or that many or even most of those on the lists could be people who were noncitizens in the country legally when they applied for driver\u2019s licenses and became naturalized citizens between the time they got the licenses and when they registered to vote. Davis said the vetting of the lists has \u201conly just begun\u201d and that he hopes it ultimately \u201cwill shed light on how many voters registered to vote legally.\u201d", "Zen\u00e9n Jaimes P\u00e9rez, advocacy and communications director for the Texas Civil Rights Project, said matching those lists is not evidence that these people were not eligible to vote \u2014 as the president claimed \u2014 and that many likely became citizens after getting a driver\u2019s license.", "\u201cThe full picture has not been presented,\u201d P\u00e9rez told us in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dangerous to claim all of those people registered to vote illegally.\u201d", "According to the Department of Homeland Security, nearly 180,000 people became naturalized citizens in Texas in the three years from 2015 to 2017.", "The League of Women Voters boasted in 2016 that it had attended hundreds of naturalization ceremonies nationwide and had helped more than 50 percent of these new citizens to register to vote. In Houston alone, the League of Women Voters said it had attended about 11 naturalization ceremonies a year and that the League had helped more that 90,000 new Harris County citizens complete their registration forms.", "It\u2019s not a stretch, then, to think that many of the matches identified by the secretary of state\u2019s office were legal immigrants who obtained driver\u2019s licenses or state IDs \u2014 which is allowed \u2014 and then sometime later became naturalized citizens. At that point, these new citizens would be eligible to vote, and the Department of Public Safety data would not necessary reflect that.", "\u201cThey are using old, outdated information to make really stark assumptions,\u201d Loyola Law School Professor Justin Levitt, an expert in election fraud, told us.", "In addition to failing to account for people gaining citizenship after obtaining a driver\u2019s license, the data are likely to contain matching errors, Levitt said. In his advisory, the state elections director acknowledges, \u201cAll records submitted through this process will need to be treated as WEAK matches\u201d and counties should further investigate as they see fit.", "\u201cThat means they aren\u2019t sure that people matched from one list to the other one are the same people,\u201d Levitt said,", "When similar matching exercises have been done in other states, he said, numerous matching errors were uncovered.", "At best, the information provided by the state is a list of potential noncitizen voters. But given the uncertainty of the data, Levitt said, \u201cIt is wildly irresponsible to announce the potential scope at the outset when it is almost certainly inflated.\u201d", "Inevitably, Levitt said, once lists like the one created by Texas are scrutinized, the amount of voter fraud discovered amounts to a small fraction of the original list. That\u2019s what happened in Florida in 2012.", "Much like the recent headlines in Texas, an Associated Press story from Florida in May 2012 ran under the headline \u201c2012 Election: Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens.\u201d But that alarming figure turned out to be wildly inflated.", "Just as Texas did recently, Florida officials, at the behest of then-Republican Gov. Rick Scott, culled a list of noncitizens from a state database of driver\u2019s licenses and matched those names against the state\u2019s voting rolls. That resulted in a list of about 180,000 Florida residents registered to vote who the state said might not be citizens.", "But that number fell apart under scrutiny. As in Texas, the driver\u2019s license database didn\u2019t include when legal residents later became citizens. The list sparked a 2012 lawsuit. Two of the plaintiffs, Karla Arcia, a Nicaraguan immigrant, and Melande Antoine, who is a Haitian American, found themselves on the list even though both are naturalized citizens who were eligible to vote in the 2012 elections.", "As the updated Associated Press story explains, the initial list of about 180,000 names was later reduced to about 2,600 (which turned out to include a World War II Army veteran). That list was later pared to 207 when checked against a federal database. County elections supervisors found errors in that list too, and when PolitiFact Florida in 2013 asked the division of elections for data, it provided a list of just 85 \u201cnoncitizens\u201d ultimately removed from voter rolls. (It was unclear how many of those people may have actually voted illegally.)", "\u201cIt was sloppy, it was slapdash and it was inaccurate,\u201d said Polk County Supervisor of Elections Lori Edwards in 2013 of the original list of 180,000 names.", "We recently wrote about all this when Donald Trump Jr. plucked the sensational AP headline from the history bin, and tweeted it with the comment, \u201cAmazing, but not shocking at all anymore. Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens.\u201d But as we wrote, readers only needed to click on the link in Trump Jr.\u2019s tweet to debunk this whopper. An editor\u2019s note atop the story explains that the initial list of 180,000 names was ultimately whittled to 207, and that an \u201cAug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.\u201d", "Levitt said he expects to see the same pattern in Texas.", "\u201cTo be clear, there are probably a few people who were in fact noncitizens when they registered to vote,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all.\u201d", "But he doubts many of those people actually voted. When a legal permanent resident applies to become a naturalized citizen, it is standard practice, Levitt said, to check the candidates against voter registration and voter lists. In other words, he said, you\u2019re likely to get caught if you have voted illegally. And the consequences are severe. In addition to torpedoing the citizenship application, he said, such candidates would face a penalty of up to five years in jail and a $10,000 fine. That\u2019s a lot of disincentive for a single vote.", "Among those noncitizens who are on the voter rolls, he suspects most of them got on there by mistake; people who didn\u2019t know that as noncitizens they shouldn\u2019t be registered.", "\u201cBut it\u2019s hard to believe that number approaches anywhere near 95,000, or that the number who voted is anywhere close to 58,000,\u201d Levitt said.", "It may take months for counties to sort through the lists. According to the Texas Tribune, only one Texas county, Galveston, indicated that it would immediately begin sending letters requesting proof of citizenship to people on the list provided by the secretary of state\u2019s office. Most of the large counties contacted by the Texas Tribune indicated \u201cthey were still parsing through thousands of records and deciding how best to verify the citizenship status of those flagged by the state.\u201d Some expressed concerns about the quality of the state data.", "In Harris County, officials said they would do their own research before sending out letters demanding proof of citizenship. For example, they will try to match the names against lists of recently naturalized residents in the county.", "\u201cWe are going to proceed very carefully,\u201d Douglas Ray, a special assistant county attorney in Harris who specializes in election issues, told the Houston Chronicle. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure we don\u2019t improperly disenfranchise anyone.\u201d", "Meanwhile, lawyers with 13 civil rights groups in the state have sent letters to county officials and the secretary of state warning that \u201cany actions taken based on this list are likely to violate federal law.\u201d", "This is, of course, not the first time Trump has made claims about widespread voter fraud. But as we have written on numerous occasions, he has failed to provide any proof. Several months into his presidency, Trump created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity\u00a0\u2014 which was to examine \u201cfraudulent voting,\u201d among other issues. The commission was\u00a0dissolved\u00a0just months after it was created, and there has been no evidence to date of widespread fraud.", "In the past, the president has cited a disputed study about noncitizen voting, which we wrote about\u00a0here. Numerous voting experts, however,\u00a0say that voter fraud is exceedingly rare, especially in-person voter fraud.", "That doesn\u2019t mean there have been no cases of noncitizens voting illegally. Last year, a 39-year-old Texas woman was sentenced to eight years in prison for voting illegally as a legal permanent resident (but not a citizen). As we wrote previously, a 2015 report from the conservative Heritage Foundation documented fewer than a dozen individual cases of noncitizens convicted of\u00a0registering or actually voting since 2000.", "As for Trump\u2019s call for \u201cStrong Voter ID,\u201d Texas already has a voter ID law that requires most to present a photo ID at the polls (there are exceptions). According to the Texas Tribune, Texas lawmakers are considering bringing up a proposal this legislative session to require some proof of citizenship in order to register to vote, though the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected similar efforts in the past.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
