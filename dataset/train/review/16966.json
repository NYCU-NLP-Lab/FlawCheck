Tony Evers laid out his case for isolation measures in Wisconsin.", "He said striking down the order would \"cripple our ability to respond to the pandemic.\" Places without such measures, he said, have yielded \"reports of doctors rationing ventilators and having to choose which patients will live or die\" and \"reports of needing refrigeration trucks for the deceased.\"", "And he made a bold claim about the impact his shelter-in-place order has had in Wisconsin.", "\"It's working,\" Evers wrote in an April 21, 2020, Facebook post. \"We have flattened the curve here in Wisconsin and have prevented the death of at least 300 Wisconsinites, and perhaps as many as 1,400 lives.\"", "Disease experts have been clear that social distancing can save lives, but is Evers right about saving at least 300 lives?", "We checked it out.", "We\u2019ll start out with the obvious: There\u2019s no way for Evers to know this for sure.
