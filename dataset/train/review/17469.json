["As expected, this election season's\u00a0candidates for president and vice president faced intense scrutiny and criticism over their histories\u00a0and track records regarding policy, partisanship and agendas.", "When\u00a0now President-elect\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0selected\u00a0Kamala Harris to be his running mate in August, the decision excited some and disappointed others, both inside and outside of the Democratic Party.", "Harris' track record as a prosecutor, which had given her the reputation of \"top cop\"\u00a0earlier in her career, doesn't sit well with the more progressive members of the Democratic Party, especially following the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.", "On the other hand,\u00a0moderates and conservatives, including President Donald Trump,\u00a0have used the independent GovTrack.us's ranking of Harris as the \"most politically left compared to all senators,\" against her.", "Among the criticisms of\u00a0Harris on social media\u00a0is a\u00a0YouTube\u00a0video from March 2019 that recently recirculated.\u00a0Init, the host of a conservative Christian channel\u00a0denounces\u00a0Harris for comments she made about decriminalizing sex work\u00a0during an interview with The Root\u00a0earlier that year.", "Pastor James Pittman,\u00a0the host of the channel \"For Such A\u00a0Time As This,\" said\u00a0Harris\u00a0wants to legalize prostitution,\u00a0condemns her comments about sex work\u00a0and questions the existence of her \"moral clarity.\"", "More:Fact check: Kamala Harris proposed extended school days in 2019 bill", "In a February 2019\u00a0interview with The Root, Harris was asked, \"Do you think that sex work ought to be decriminalized?\"", "She responded:\u00a0\"I think so, I do. I think that we have to understand though that it is not as simple as that. ... But when you\u2019re talking about consenting adults, I think that\u00a0yes we should really consider that we can\u2019t criminalize consensual behavior as long as no one is being harmed.\"", "The most important thing to note from Harris' response is that, despite its nuances,\u00a0decriminalization is not the same thing as legalization.", "Decriminalization is the reduction of criminal penalties when someone commits an illegal act, while legalization means that there are no longer legal prohibitions on the act, meaning it would now be legal.", "In the Root interview, Harris did not say she wanted to legalize sex work\u00a0or prostitution. She did say she wants to decriminalize it, meaning those who participate in sex work would face lesser punishments than they do now. Harris has not laid out specific policies on that.", "She also noted that there is an \"ecosystem\" of sex work that includes people who profit off of the harm or exploitation of others. Those people, according to Harris, should not be exempt from criminal prosecution.", "More:Fact check: Claim that Kamala Harris' current press secretary works for Twitter is false", "After the YouTube video went viral, Snopes fact checked the claims\u00a0and Pittman responded.", "In the\u00a0video \"The fact checkers need to be fact checked,\" Pittman acknowledged the difference between legalization and decriminalization while\u00a0defending\u00a0his claim that\u00a0Harris\u00a0wants to legalize prostitution.", "\"If you want to decriminalize something and remove all penalties ...\u00a0that in essence \u2014\u00a0you may call it decriminalization \u2014\u00a0that is the legalization of prostitution,\" Pittman said.", "Pittman criticized Snopes for its fact check\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which\u00a0rated the claim as\u00a0a \"mixture,\" meaning it\u00a0has elements of truth and falsity \u2014\u00a0because they don't know what Harris' policies would be.", "\"From what (Harris)\u00a0is saying, I surmise, it seems like to me, I'm not 100% sure just 99.99% sure, she wants to remove all penalties,\" Pittman said.", "More:Vice President-elect Kamala Harris: A look at her political career", "In a second video following the Snopes analysis, Pittman further explained and doubled down on his claim.", "Despite previously acknowledging the difference between legalization and decriminalization, in this\u00a0video, Pittman said that only in \"bizzaro world\" does decriminalization not mean the same thing as legalization.", "\"If you remove something from criminal prosecution, you don't even get a ticket for it, then that act is equal in the eyes of the law to me getting in my car and driving to the store and back,\" he said.", "PSA: Get these in your inbox: We're fact checking the news and sending it to your inbox.

Vice President-elect Kamala Harris did not say that sex work, specifically prostitution, should be legalized.", "What Harris said is that she believes sex work\u00a0should be decriminalized, which means participants would face lesser consequences for the act, but legal prohibitions would still exist. Additionally, Harris added that she believes those who profit from harming or exploiting others through sex work should still face criminal prosecution.", "Despite Pittman's claims, there is a difference between legalization and decriminalization. That difference may be more nuanced in some situations than it is in others, but the two are not fully synonymous.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
