["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on December 4, 2020 | Updated on August 1, 2023", "The Trump campaign is falsely claiming that surveillance camera footage captured election workers in Georgia adding thousands of illegal ballots that were brought into an Atlanta facility in suspicious \u201csuitcases\u201d on election night.", "The campaign\u00a0presented the video to Georgia state lawmakers on Dec. 3. President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, wrote on Twitter the same day: \u201cThe video tape doesn\u2019t lie. Fulton County Democrats stole the election. It\u2019s now beyond doubt.\u201d Trump himself later\u00a0amplified\u00a0the claim at a rally in Georgia on Dec. 5.", "But state officials told us that the full video shows the supposed \u201csuitcases\u201d were actually standard containers used to secure ballots, and that the ballots in question were opened and prepared for counting earlier in the night in full view of observers. They said the campaign presented limited, selective parts of the footage.", "That\u2019s based on their review of the day\u2019s video footage in full. Also, even though observers from the parties and press left the room before vote counting resumed, officials said, a state election board monitor and investigator from the secretary of state\u2019s office both returned to watch the counting until its completion.", "Left unclear, though, are the exact facts surrounding a purported \u201cannouncement\u201d to workers in the room that Republican observers claim prompted them to leave, as we\u2019ll explain.", "The video in question \u2014 which has been widely shared across social media \u2014 was presented to Georgia state legislators during the Dec. 3 hearing by a lawyer named Jacki Pick, who said she was volunteering for Trump\u2019s legal team. Pick is listed as a lawyer by the State Bar of Texas, but she appears to work primarily as a conservative podcast\u00a0host. She and her husband,\u00a0Doug\u00a0Deason, are major Republican\u00a0donors.", "Pick said\u00a0Trump\u2019s legal team received the video the night before and that it shows observers and the press leaving a room at Atlanta\u2019s State Farm Arena, which was used to count absentee and military ballots, shortly before 11 p.m. She claimed that, according to witnesses, a woman had told the observers and press that \u201cwe\u2019re going to stop counting, everyone go home.\u201d", "She pointed out that many of the elections workers had left for the night in the video, but four workers are seen in the video staying behind to continue counting.", "\u201cOnce everyone is gone, coast is clear, they are going to pull ballots out from underneath a table \u2013 watch this table,\u201d she said at the hearing. \u201cI saw four suitcases come out from underneath the table.\u201d The video shows the counting continued until nearly 1 a.m., she said.", "But the supposed \u201csuitcases\u201d were typical ballot containers used to secure ballots, Georgia\u2019s Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs told us in a phone interview. Likewise, Matthew Mashburn, the state Senate\u2019s appointee to the state election board, told us the video showed \u201cstandard secure containers that are ubiquitous in tabulation in Georgia.\u201d", "And Gabriel Sterling, the state\u2019s voting system implementation manager, said that the full video showed that the containers were carrying ballots that were opened and processed earlier in the night. They weren\u2019t suspicious ballots brought surreptitiously into the building, or ballots that were opened in secret.", "\u201cThey were put in there about an hour earlier,\u201d Sterling, a Republican, said by phone. He said of the Trump campaign: \u201cThey watched the same video tape.\u201d", "Sterling also said he saw no anomalies in the vote data that suggested any kind of mass voter fraud, as has been alleged. \u201cThese are just regular elections workers\u201d doing their job, he said.", "While state law allows for observers to watch the vote counting, Sterling said, it was not illegal for the vote counting to resume when the observers left. He said his office was working on making the video footage from the arena public so that voters could see the footage with more context.", "What is clear from our interviews with state officials is that, at some point, the elections workers did evidently plan to stop counting votes.", "Fulton County Elections Director Rick Barron also made that clear during a\u00a0special, virtual public meeting on Dec. 4. He said that \u201ccertain staff that were on the cutting stations, that were on the flattening stations, that were extracting from the inner envelopes, those staff left as work completed.\u201d", "\u201cI found out sometime, I think a little after 10:30 [p.m.], that they were gonna cease operations and I told them not to do that,\u201d he said. He added that at \u201cabout 11:15 [p.m.], they were fully scanning again.\u201d", "Pick\u00a0claimed\u00a0that witnesses said that a woman came \u201cout to announce, \u2018we\u2019re going to stop counting, everyone go home,'\u201d\u00a0saying the Republican observers were \u201cforced to leave.\u201d But Barron said that \u201cno announcement was ever made to leave, for anyone to leave.\u201d", "Affidavits\u00a0from two Republican field organizers referenced by Pick do not claim that they or the media were ever directly told or forced to leave. Instead, the observers say that they left after a woman \u2014 who they believed was a supervisor \u2014 \u201cyelled\u201d to workers in the room to cease operations and return the next day. The affidavits say that much of the room, except for a few employees, had cleared out.", "\u201cWe have launched an investigation into why the monitors from the political parties left before scanning ended,\u201d the secretary of state\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cWhile it was their right to leave early, we want to make certain they were not misled into thinking scanning had stopped for the night when it had not. Nothing we have learned from the independent monitor or our investigation have suggested any improper ballots were scanned.\u201d", "Sterling said in our Dec. 4 interview with him that it did not appear there was any official announcement made to the observers or press, but there\u2019s no audio to prove that one way or another.", "On Dec. 5, Frances Watson, the chief investigator for the secretary of state\u2019s office, said in an\u00a0affidavit\u00a0that after reviewing the video and conducting interviews, her investigators found \u201cthat observers and media were not asked to leave\u201d but \u201csimply left\u201d after they saw workers, whose job was to open the ballots, leave. She said the investigation remains open.", "Also, there\u2019s no evidence that a \u201cwater main break\u201d inside the arena earlier that day had anything to do with the observers and press leaving, as some have claimed.", "One of Trump\u2019s sons, Eric Trump, wrote  on Facebook that \u201cRepublican observers were cleared out of State Farm Arena due to a \u2018water main break\u2019, but 4 people stayed behind, rolled out suitcases of ballots, & continue to count ballots in private from around 1030PM until 1AM.\u201d", "But the water leak occurred at 6:07 a.m. on Election Day, according to the arena, and it was fixed within two hours \u2014 meaning it occurred long before the episode in question.", "During the legislative hearing, Pick maintained that the votes counted in the room after observers left could have been enough to change the presidential election results in Georgia.", "Pick theorized that the machines in the room could have totaled \u201c18,000 ballots.\u201d (Biden won the state by less than 12,000 votes.)", "But that\u2019s wrong, according to the state election board monitor who was in the room as they counted.", "The monitor \u2014 who agreed to be interviewed on the condition of not being named due to death threats faced by election workers \u2014 told us he was in the room until about 8:15 p.m., when he left, and returned at 11:52 p.m.", "Fuchs, the deputy secretary of state, told us the monitor was not required to be there at all times, but she instructed him to return after hearing from news outlets that the county was going to cease counting for the night.", "The monitor arrived at 11:52 p.m. \u2014 after the observers left shortly before 11 p.m. \u2014 and stayed until the counting ceased at 12:43 a.m.", "Between 8:15 p.m. and 12:43 a.m., the change in total ballots went from 89,381 ballots to 99,133 ballots \u2014 so a difference of 9,752 votes \u2014 he said. And, again, that\u2019s over the course of more than four hours, not just the time after observers and media left.", "The footage is not the first to spark claims of fraud in Georgia. We also wrote about a video showing an election worker conducting an ordinary part of the recount process in Gwinnett County that prompted false claims. The videos have been part of a surge of falsehoods aimed at undermining the results of the 2020 election, as we\u2019ve reported.", "Saranac Hale Spencer contributed to this report.", "Update, Dec. 7: We made updates to this story to reflect new information \u2014 including the affidavits from the Republican field organizers and statements from the chief investigator for the secretary of state\u2019s office \u2014 pertaining to why the observers and media left the room in State Farm Arena.", "Update, Aug. 1, 2023: On June 20, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office released an investigative report concluding that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of any fraud regarding the claim that \u201csuitcases\u201d of illegal ballots were counted on election night. Investigators from the FBI, Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the secretary of state\u2019s office interviewed Fulton County election workers and reviewed \u201cthe entire unedited security video footage of the events in question\u201d in response to a complaint referred by a state senator and specifically naming two election night workers in the video, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss.", "\u201cThere was no evidence of any type of fraud as alleged. \u2026 All allegations made against Freeman and Moss were unsubstantiated and found to have no merit,\u201d the report, dated March 7, concluded.", "In congressional testimony, the two women described how they had been harassed and received death threats after members of the Trump campaign and others pushed false claims that they had engaged in voter fraud. Freeman and Moss filed a defamation suit against One America News Network and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani.", "OANN settled the suit in May. A July 25 court filing by Giuliani said he \u201cdoes not contest\u201d that statements he made about the women were false, but he argues the statements were \u201cconstitutionally protected\u201d speech. A political adviser to Giuliani told news organizations that Giuliani \u201cdid not acknowledge that the statements were false but did not contest it in order to move on to the portion of the case that will permit a motion to dismiss.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
