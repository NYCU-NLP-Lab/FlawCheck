Bryan Hughes of Mineola had slanderously charged Simpson with supporting licenses for illegal immigrants without delivering the factual goods. The two are competing for a chance to succeed Kevin Eltife of Tyler representing the Senate's\u00a0District 1.", "Simpson said:\u00a0\"I have always opposed driver\u2019s licenses for illegal aliens.\"", "Hughes disputed that in a Dec. 1, 2015,\u00a0press release\u00a0stating Simpson \"actually voted for driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.\"", "Is that right?", "Some perspective: The Texas Department of Public Safety began requiring license applicants to produce government-issued documents affirming their legal residency status in 2008, and lawmakers voted to require as much in a 2011 special session. Before 2008, according to a July 2011 Texas Tribune\u00a0news story, no proof of legal residency was required to obtain a Texas license or state identification card.", "Mindful that Hughes said Simpson, a third-term legislator, voted for giving driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants, we reviewed Simpson\u2019s legislative record.", "We ultimately found no direct votes by Simpson on licenses for immigrants. In contrast, he joined most House members in voting for the 2011 mandate that the state request proof of legal residency from driver\u2019s license applicants, arguably a sign he wasn\u2019t champing to ease the way for unauthorized residents to get licensed. Still, his vote on a 2013 House proposal leaves room for speculation about his consistency.", "2011", "In summer 2011, lawmakers moved to require the DPS to seek proof of legal residency from applicants for driver\u2019s licenses by placing\u00a0an amendment on a fiscal matters measure. At the time, the move was pitched as bringing Texas into compliance with the federal REAL ID Act, which says applicants for a driver's license must prove legal residency if they want to use the identification to get through airport security. See the agency's explanation of the requirement here.", "And on June 9, 2011, nearly every House member (including Simpson) approved the amendment to\u00a0Senate Bill 1. House video reveals no debate of the matter after Rep. Charles Geren, R-Fort Worth, told colleagues\u00a0the amendment\u00a0\"addresses an issue of people getting Texas driver\u2019s licenses that don\u2019t live in Texas and it also allows the department to issue a license only for the length of time that a person is entitled to be here.\"\u00a0According to the House Journal, eight members, Simpson not among them, asked to be recorded voting against the amendment.", "Records show too Simpson voting against the overall fiscal matters proposal several times; those votes occurred on\u00a0June 9,\u00a0June 10\u00a0and\u00a0June 28, 2011. By email, Simpsons told us he opposed the measure \"due to its accounting gimmicks\u2014namely, the deferment of Foundation School Program payments and the speed-up of tax payments\u2014and its misplaced priorities, not because of the license provision, which I supported.\" He provided a copy of a\u00a0May 2012 letter\u00a0to House constituents stating that he \"voted for the amendment to add documentation requirements for driver's licenses\" but against SB 1 because it extended inequitable school funding, sped tax collections and used \"smoke and mirrors\" to balance the state budget.", "So, there are no votes by Simpson in favor of driver\u2019s licenses for immigrants.", "But there does appear to be fodder for speculation about Simpson\u2019s consistent opposition.", "2013", "In 2013, Simpson voted against successful House efforts effectively killing proposals that related to more residents possibly getting driving permits. We don\u2019t know of an independent way of telling if those votes signaled a position on driver\u2019s licenses.", "But on May 20, 2013, Simpson edged a step farther by voting in favor of one of the failed amendments, the\u00a0Texas House Journal\u00a0shows. An amendment to Senate Bill 1729 by Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, said that under the legislation, which generally authorized a pilot project enabling a few counties to update or renew driver\u2019s licenses, a license should include \"any Texas resident driver\u2019s permit authorized by law.\"", "And what did that mean? In debate, opponents said Cook\u2019s language related to unauthorized residents getting a driver\u2019s permit. Similarly, Simpson and Hughes\u2019 campaign each nudged, conservative advocacy groups characterized the amendment as opening driver\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants. In a\u00a0scorecard of the 2013 Legislature, for instance, the Young Conservatives of Texas said Cook\u2019s amendment \"would have allowed for illegal immigrants to receive driver\u2019s licenses.\"", "We didn\u2019t reach that conclusion. By email, Simpson told us Cook\u2019s amendment \"in no way authorized illegal aliens to receive driver\u2019s licenses.\" Asked why he voted for it, Simpson said: \"I voted yes to the amendment because it would only include licenses or permits already\" authorized by law.", "In the House debate, Cook didn\u2019t dispute that his proposal might legalize more drivers; he also stressed that another change in law would be needed for the envisioned driving permits to become a reality. And while his proposal drew 72 votes, with 67 members voting no, it still died because Cook offered the proposal during final consideration of SB 1729; at that stage, 100 House votes were needed to amend legislation.", "A few days earlier, on May 17, 2013, Cook rolled out a longer amendment to SB 1729. He described the longer proposal--which was shortly derailed on a parliamentary point of order--as identical to a committee-approved version of\u00a0House Bill 3206\u00a0by Rep. Roberto Alonzo, D-Dallas.", "Alonzo\u2019s unsuccessful plan called for state-issued driving permits for residents who lack proof of legal residency, also requiring recipients to obtain auto insurance. Under the proposal, every applicant would have to submit to fingerprinting and clear a criminal background check.", "Before his proposal was felled, Cook told House members the permits wouldn\u2019t look like driver\u2019s licenses and couldn\u2019t be used as IDs to board planes or vote. \"We have a growing population of non-citizens driving every day to school, to church, to work, all without insurance,\" Cook said, posing risks to all residents.", "The same month, Hughes\u2019 campaign pointed out, Simpson was on the losing end of an 87-60 House vote setting aside Alonzo\u2019s amendment to another\u00a0House measure\u00a0authorizing the state to let public schools and driving schools give the driving test required to get a license. Before that May 21, 2013, action, Alonzo told House colleagues that under his amendment, schools could give driving tests to individuals who obtained resident driving permits, provided such permits were legalized. \"Texas has a problem,\" Alonzo said, with people driving without auto insurance or a driver\u2019s permit.", "By phone, Alonzo told us he favors giving undocumented individuals an opportunity to legally drive in Texas and his 2013 proposal\u2019s described permits could have nudged the state toward fulfilling that goal though, he said, it didn\u2019t provide for full-fledged licenses.", "Our ruling", "Hughes said Simpson \"voted for driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.\"", "No such vote occurred. In the clearest vote we could find, Simpson voted to make it harder, not easier, to obtain licenses when, in 2011, he joined nearly every House member in approving a new mandate that applicants for driver\u2019s licenses be required to document their legal residency.", "But we did find an element of truth to Hughes\u2019 statement. Simpson voted in 2013 for an unsuccessful proposal that could generously be interpreted as foreseeing a path to individuals living here without authorization getting resident driving permits, though significantly such permits as sought by Alonzo and others didn\u2019t (and don\u2019t) exist.", "We rate this claim Mostly False.", "MOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.", "Click here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "Email, Jordan Berry, Bryan Hughes campaign, Dec. 10, 2015", "Entry\u00a0showing record votes related to Senate Bill 1729 and\u00a0Senate Bill 1705, Texas House Journal, May 20-21, 2013", "Legislation,\u00a0House Bill 3206\u00a0and\u00a0analysis,\u00a0House Bill 1705, 2013 Legislature, Texas Legislative Council (accessed Dec. 2, 2015)", "News stories,\u00a0Austin American-Statesman, \u00a0\"Austin police chief, key legislators want special driver\u2019s permits for undocumented immigrants,\"\u00a0updated March 25, 2013;\u00a0\"House chairman unveils plan to allow illegal immigrants to drive legally in Texas,\"\u00a0posted online April 17, 2013", "News story,\u00a0\"Battle looming over immigrant driver permits,\"\u00a0San Antonio Express-News, updated April 30, 2013", "News story,\u00a0\" Proof of Legal Status Now Required for State IDs,\"\u00a0Texas Tribune, July 7, 2011", "Presentation,\u00a0\"A Sobering and Beautiful Week on the Rio Grande,\"\u00a0David Simpson, June 30-July 6, 2014 (web link received by email from Luke Macias, xx, David Simpson Texas Senate campaign, Dec. 1, 2015)", "Telephone interview, Luke Macias, general consultant, David Simpson Texas Senate campaign, Dec. 2, 2015", "Telephone interview and\u00a0emails, David Simpson, Dec. 9-10, 2015", "Letter to constituents\u00a0from David Simpson, May 23, 2012 (received by email from Simpson Dec. 9, 2015)", "Fiscal note\u00a0and\u00a0authors, House Bill 17, 2011 Texas Legislature, Legislative Budget Board, April 19, 2011", "Text\u00a0of House Bill 1857, 2011 Texas Legislature, Texas Legislative Council", "Website searchable for bills authored by Simpson,\u00a0\"House members,\"\u00a0Texas Legislature Online, Texas Legislative Council (accessed Dec. 3, 2015)", "Telephone interview, Roberto Alonzo, Dec. 10, 2015", "Press release,\u00a0\"DESPITE DENIALS, SIMPSON VOTED FOR \u00a0DRIVERS LICENCES FOR ILLEGAL IMMMIGRANTS,\"\u00a0Bryan Hughes for Texas Senate campaign, Dec. 1, 2015", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
