["In a tweet promoting its new attack ad, a conservative super PAC\u00a0 claims: \"Joe Biden says he supports sex changes for kids.\"", "The 30-second spot by the American Principles Project doesn\u2019t go quite as far as the tweet, but strongly suggests that Biden endorses sex changes for kids.", "Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, has stated opposition to discrimination against transgender people, not support for sex changes for children.", "In what appears to be a medical operating room, a voiceover says: \"Sex changes for kids?\" and the same words on the screen. \"Most Americans say that\u2019s going way too far, but not Joe Biden,\" the narrator says.", "Then the ad shows a clip of Biden saying, with his words also shown on the screen: \"An 8-year-old child decides, I want to be transgender; that\u2019s what I think I\u2019d like to be.\"", "The ad ends with the narrator saying: \"If Joe Biden is willing to endorse sex changes for second-graders, what won\u2019t he support?\"", "The clip is from an Oct. 15 town hall in Pennsylvania that aired on ABC. Biden answered a question from Mieke Haeck, who said she has an 8-year-old daughter who is transgender.", "Biden does not state that he supports sex changes for children. He states opposition to transgender discrimination.", "Haeck: \"The Trump administration has attacked the rights of transgender people, banning them from military service, weakening non-discrimination protections, and even removing the word transgender from some government websites. How will you, as president, reverse this dangerous and discriminatory agenda and ensure that the lives and rights of LGBTQ people are protected under U.S. law?\"", "Biden: \"I will flat out just change the law. Eliminate those executive orders, number one. ... My dad was a high school-educated, well-read man who was a really decent guy. And I was being dropped off to get an application in the center of our city, Wilmington, Delaware, the corporate capital of the world at the time. And these two men \u2014\u00a0 I\u2019m getting out to get an application to be a lifeguard in the African-American community, because there was a big swimming pool complex.", "\"And these two men, well-dressed, leaned up and hugged one another and kissed one another. I\u2019m getting out of the car at the light, and I turned to my dad. My dad looked at me. He said, \u2018Joey, it\u2019s simple. They love each other.\u2019 The idea that an 8-year-old child or a 10-year-old child decides, \u2018You know, I decided I want to be transgender. That\u2019s what I think I\u2019d like to be. It\u2019d make my life a lot easier.\u2019 There should be zero discrimination. And what\u2019s happening is too many transgender women of color are being murdered. They\u2019re being murdered. I think it\u2019s up to, now, 17. Don\u2019t hold me to that number, but it\u2019s higher now?\"", "Haeck: \"Yeah.\"", "Biden: \"And that\u2019s just this year. And so I promise you, there is no reason to suggest that there should be any right denied your daughter, or daughters, whichever, one or two.\"", "Haeck: \"One.\"", "Biden: \"One. Your daughter, that your other daughter has a right to be and do. None. Zero. And by the way, my son Beau, who passed away, was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. He was the guy who got the first transgender law passed in the state of Delaware. And because of a young man who became a woman, who worked for him in the attorney general's office.\"", "American Principles Project spokesman Paul Dupont argued to PolitiFact that \"implied in the assertion that there should be zero discrimination\" is that children should \"have access to any medical treatments that will facilitate\" a sex change. But Biden made no such statement.", "Dupont also cited Biden\u2019s support of the federal Equality Act. But that measure would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, education and public accommodations.", "On his campaign website, Biden criticizes the Trump administration\u2019s decision to block the ability of transgender individuals to openly serve in the military.
