["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on August 9, 2018", "The estimated second quarter gross domestic product growth rate of 4.1 percent is not \u201crecord\u201d or \u201cclose-to-record GDP,\u201d as President Donald Trump recently claimed.", "The actual record is four times higher and occurred back in 1950.", "The Trump administration has been touting the second quarter number since it was announced July 27 by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Trump continued to do so when listing his administration\u2019s \u201ceconomic accomplishments\u201d before a dinner with executives from some of the country\u2019s top businesses.", "Trump, Aug. 7: I\u2019d like to take this opportunity also to briefly highlight some of the administration\u2019s key economic accomplishments. As you know, we\u2019re doing record and close-to-record GDP. Nobody thought we\u2019d be anywhere above, even close to 2. And we\u2019re at 4.1, and I think we\u2019re going much higher.", "But one quarter of 4.1 percent real growth \u2014 after accounting for inflation \u2014 is neither a record nor close to one.", "In fact, there were four quarters of higher growth during just the Obama administration, including one quarter of 5.1 percent growth in 2014.", "The actual record is 16.7 percent real GDP growth in the first quarter of 1950, according to the BEA\u2019s seasonally and inflation-adjusted data.", "The White House didn\u2019t explain what Trump meant when he said the U.S. is \u201cdoing record and close-to-record GDP.\u201d", "Even if the president was thinking of the average growth during the first six months of 2018, that also would not be in the ballpark. This year\u2019s average for the first two quarters is nearly 3.2 percent. In 1950, it was almost 14.8 percent.", "The\u00a0economy grew by 2.2 percent\u00a0in Trump\u2019s first year in office, according to the revised, official BEA estimate for 2017.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
