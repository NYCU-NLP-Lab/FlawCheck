Scott Walker touts as a major achievement.", "When asked what he would do about the state\u2019s struggling middle class, Pade referenced his tax background and said as governor he wants to put together a bipartisan group to reform the state\u2019s tax code.", "He also said this: \"Scott Walker touts his tax cuts. Unfortunately Wisconsin\u2019s still one of the highest-taxed states in the country.\"", "Is he right about Wisconsin\u2019s tax status?", "The evidence", "When we asked Pade\u2019s campaign to provide backup for the statement, spokeswoman Kate Cooney pointed us to a study by\u00a0Wallethub, a personal finance website, that ranked Wisconsin as 46th in effective tax rate (Number 1 being the lowest).", "\"We do acknowledge that other measurements of taxation have shown a lowered trend over time beginning before Governor Walker took office, but those studies are not as comprehensive in their data sets,\" said Cooney. \"We have also pointed out the tax burden as a percentage of income in Wisconsin is often lower on the most wealthiest income brackets than those with lower income.\"", "A spokesman for Walker\u2019s campaign declined to offer any evidence on the issue, so we checked with a variety of experts and other rankings.", "Since Pade\u2019s statement referred to taxes in general, we\u2019ll start with what experts said about the overall tax burden.", "Tamarine Cornelius, a research analyst at the Wisconsin Budget Project: She said the state ranks somewhere in the middle when looking at state and local taxes -- 20th when measured on a per-state resident basis in 2015 and 21st when measured as a share of personal income.", "\"Measured either way, state and local taxes in Wisconsin are actually\u00a0below the national average,\" she said, noting that when fees are included it drops Wisconsin\u2019s rank even further.", "\"In Wisconsin, residents pay lower fees than residents in many other states,\" she said.", "Tax Foundation: A 2018 report from the\u00a0Tax Foundation, an independent tax policy nonprofit, also shows Wisconsin in the middle of the pack with a rank of 18 for state tax collections per capita for 2016.", "Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute: \"It looks like it\u2019s a stretch to say Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the country,\" he said.
