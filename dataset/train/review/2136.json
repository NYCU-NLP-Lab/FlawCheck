["About this rating", "In January 2018, click-seeking web site YourNewsWire.com fabricated an inflammatory Dolly Parton quote -- a sure-fire way to attract attention. According to the web site, the actress and country music star blamed California's recent natural disasters on the city's \"embracing Satan\":", "\u201cCalifornia just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,\u201d the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton\u2019s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.", "\u201cPestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don\u2019t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can\u2019t even see what is right in front of their eyes.\u201d", "\u201cFirst they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.", "\u201cThen they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!\u201c", "[...]", "\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.\u201d", "The web site likely targeted Parton because of news this week that the dinner show attraction\"Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede\" had stripped the word \"Dixie\" from its title to avoid glorifying the antebellum South. The show will now be known as \"Dolly Parton's Stampede.\" The news angered a portion of the public (mainly those upset over the removal of confederate monuments), providing Your News Wire with another opportunity to stir the pot.", "The quote Your News Wire reported does not appear in any genuine news publication. The web site doesn't provide any video or audio recording to prove that Parton actually spoke these words. This fictional quote also stands in stark contrasts to Parton's previous comments and actions following natural disasters.", "After fires ravaged Tennessee in November 2016, for instance, the country icon established the My People Fund\u00a0 to aid the recovery effort. She said at the time:", "I know the money helps but most of all I want people to know we will always provide you a shoulder to lean on.\"", "The success of the \"My People Fund\" inspired Parton to lend a hand to other disaster victims. After a series of hurricanes battered the United States in 2017, she donated books and money to One America Appeal for Hurricane Relief.", "Nor does the quote square with Parton's previously-stated religious beliefs. In a 2015 Reuters interview, she spoke about the need for tolerance:", "\u201cWe don\u2019t try to shove anything down anybody\u2019s throat. We are very open,\u201d says Parton, who is well known for her support of the LGBT community. \u201cSo many of my businesspeople and my best friends are different faiths, and I work with them, live with them, love them. The gays and lesbians, they come to our parks. I think people just know I\u2019m a very open and accepting person.", "\u201cAnd in any religion we\u2019re supposed to be that\u2014we\u2019re supposed to be kind...we\u2019re not supposed to pass judgment. Our Bible says, \u2018Judge not, lest ye be judged,\u2019 and I believe in all those kinds of things.\u201d", "Flanagan, Andrew. \u00a0 \"Dolly Parton Provides Fire Victims 'Shoulder To Lean On.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NPR. \u00a0 8 May 2017.", "USA Today. \u00a0 \"Dolly Parton Donates Money, Books to 2017 Hurricane Victims.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 18 October 2017.", "Alcorn, Jonathan.\u00a0\u00a0\"Dolly Parton Talks About Her 'Judge Not, Lest Ye Be Judged' Philosophy.\"\u00a0\u00a0Newsweek.\u00a0 28 August 2015.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
