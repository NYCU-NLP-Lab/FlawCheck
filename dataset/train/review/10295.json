But the basis for their claims \u2014 a news story \u2014 says the Pentagon may use \u201cleftover\u201d funds in those accounts due to lower-than-expected recruits and fewer early retirements.", "An\u00a0Associated Press story said the Army missed a recruiting goal by 6,500 enlistees, and there were fewer take-ups of an early retirement incentive. The Pentagon wants to move $1 billion from those funds to provide some of the money for the wall under President Donald Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration.", "Congress has voted to block that emergency declaration, but Trump is expected to veto the joint resolution.", "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer brought up the military accounts at a media availability on March 12, saying the president\u2019s declaration \u201cwould take money away from the military, the brave men and women in uniform, to pay for this wall including military construction and maybe even military pay and pensions. Outrageous.\u201d", "His office pointed us to the\u00a0March 7 AP story, which other congressional Democrats have tweeted, adding their own twists on the news.", "Sen. Patty Murray said, \u201cThe idea of the president cutting our country\u2019s military pay and pensions to pay for his wall is wrong,\u201d while Sen. Brian Schatz referred to the potential diversion of funds as a \u201craid.\u201d Sen.

But we\u2019d expect members of Congress to at least read the lead paragraph of the story before tweeting claims about \u201ccutting\u201d and \u201craiding\u201d pay and pensions.", "The AP\u2019s lead paragraph makes clear this is about \u201cleftover funds.\u201d", "AP, March 7 story:\u00a0The Pentagon is planning to tap $1 billion in leftover funds from military pay and pension accounts to help President Donald Trump pay for his long-sought border wall, a top Senate Democrat said Thursday.", "That top Democrat is Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Defense. He referred to moving the funds as a \u201ccut\u201d \u2014 \u201cImagine the Democrats making that proposal \u2014 that for whatever our project is, we\u2019re going to cut military pay and pensions.\u201d But he also said the leftover funds were, in effect, \u201csavings.\u201d", "\u201cThis is pay that would have gone to Army recruits that we can\u2019t recruit,\u201d Durbin said, according to the AP. \u201cSo there\u2019s a \u2018savings\u2019 because we can\u2019t recruit. The other part was they offered a voluntary change in military pensions, and they overestimated how many people would sign up for it.\u201d", "Todd Harrison, director for defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told us it was not true that what the Pentagon had proposed would cut military pay or pensions. \u201cIt\u2019s leftover money,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThe Army is going to have leftover money in its personnel account because it didn\u2019t meet its recruiting goals.\u201d", "As for the pension money, Harrison said the Defense Department sets aside money every year to contribute to pension accounts. But when there are fewer service members than expected, because the Army didn\u2019t meet its goal, the department doesn\u2019t need to contribute as much to pension funds. \u201cIt absolutely would not affect anyone\u2019s current pension,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cWhen money gets paid out of the pension fund, it\u2019s set by a formula in law.\u201d That money has to be paid.", "Schumer said \u201cmaybe even\u201d pay and pension money would be taken, but the money appropriated to those accounts has to be spent on obligations for this year. The leftover money can\u2019t be rolled over to be used for pay and pension expenses incurred next year.", "We asked Patrick Newton, press secretary for\u00a0the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, about the rules regarding this appropriation. He explained that funds Congress appropriated for a Department of Defense personnel or operations and maintenance account are only available for one year.\u00a0Once the fiscal year is up, the unused funds are \u201cexpired.\u201d At that point, they could still be used to \u201ccover obligations created during the initial timeframe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey cannot be used for new contracts or obligations.\u201d", "\u201cBasically \u2013 it can only be spent on expenses incurred during the one-year initial timeframe,\u201d he said.\u00a0After five years, the expired funds become \u201ccanceled\u201d and can\u2019t be used at all.", "We asked Durbin\u2019s office whether any service members wouldn\u2019t get pay or pension money if the Pentagon moved this money. A spokesperson didn\u2019t directly answer the question, saying: \u201cSenator Durbin believes that when the Department of Defense has excess funds that it should be prioritized for real Department of Defense needs, such as making repairs to Camp Lejeune, Tyndall Air Force Base, or desperately needed Navy ship repairs.\u201d", "Durbin\u2019s spokesperson also said that Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told several lawmakers he intended to transfer this money and \u201cthat he will not stand by the standard process of letting the defense oversight committees review his reprogramming proposal.\u201d Otherwise, \u201cthe Defense Department has not provided Congress with specific information on its plan.\u201d", "Harrison, at CSIS, said what normally happens is Congress would identify this leftover money when it\u2019s debating the fiscal 2020 budget, and Congress would rescind it and use it for other spending. The Defense Department can reprogram the money now \u2014 move it to another account for another purpose \u2014 but that would require congressional approval, he said.", "The armed services and defense appropriation subcommittees in both chambers of Congress have to approve it, and Harrison said there\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen on the House side.", "But a March 8 article in Military Times quoted a Republican and Democratic member of the House Armed Services Committee saying they were concerned not with the accounts from which the money would be moved, but rather the Defense Department not seeking congressional approval for that reprogramming.\u00a0\u201cNot following the practice that has been followed by decades will affect the relationship between the legislative branch and executive branch,\u201d Military Times quoted Republican Rep. Mac Thornberry, ranking member of the committee, as saying.", "The White House has said the emergency declaration would enable the use of $8 billion for the border wall, including $3.6 billion from military construction and $2.5 billion from defense counter-drug activities and other reprogramming. Lawmakers questioned Shanahan about which construction projects could be delayed or canceled to provide funding for the wall at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on March 14. Shanahan didn\u2019t offer specifics, other than to say \u201cno projects scheduled to be obligated in this fiscal year\u201d would be canceled. Funds could have been appropriated, however, but not awarded in a contract this year.", "As for the leftover funds in the pay and pension accounts, the acting Pentagon press secretary told Military Times that\u00a0\u201cno decision has been made\u201d on using that money for the wall, but the publication reported he \u201cdid not dispute reports that the idea was discussed.\u201d We contacted the Defense Department press office but did not receive responses to our questions.", "Even if the department does end up moving the money to fund the wall, it would not be \u201ccutting\u201d or \u201craiding\u201d military pay and pensions.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
