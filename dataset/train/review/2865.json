People cannot, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can\u2019t even mention the words \u2018radical Islamic terrorism.\u2019 There\u2019s something going on. It\u2019s inconceivable. There\u2019s something going on.\u201d", "Trump refused to explain what he meant. \u201cI\u2019ll let people figure that out for themselves,\u201d he told radio talk show host Howie Carr in an interview on June 13.", "When the Washington Post ran an article headlined \u201cDonald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting\u201d (which was later changed to say, \u201cDonald Trump seems to connect President Obama to Orlando shooting\u201c), Trump\u00a0said he was banning the Post from covering his events. But now he claims he was \u201cright\u201d about the implication.", "Trump then tied Clinton, the Democratic presumed presidential nominee,\u00a0to the claim in a Facebook post on June 15: \u201cHillary Clinton received a classified intelligence report stating that the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State.\u201d\u00a0He again linked to a\u00a0June 14 Breitbart report, which\u00a0makes that allegation, too.\u00a0But the government memo it cites doesn\u2019t\u00a0support that claim.", "The\u00a0August 2012 Defense Intelligence Agency memo, which was posted online by the group Judicial Watch last year, says it is an \u201cinformation report, not finally evaluated intelligence.\u201d It describes \u201cthe general situation\u201d in Syria:", "DIA memo, August 2012: A.

The West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support the opposition; while Russia, China, and Iran support the regime.", "The memo goes on to say,\u00a0\u201cAQI supported the Syrian opposition from the beginning.\u201d", "So, the U.S. and al Qaeda in Iraq both opposed the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. But\u00a0concluding that that means the U.S. supported AQI is false logic.

The administration\u2019s concern was having those weapons fall into the wrong hands. In 2014, former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said the administration should have armed rebels sooner \u2014 a position Hillary Clinton has also taken. By October 2015, the administration abandoned a program to train and equip a new rebel force to fight the Islamic State,\u00a0and said instead it would provide equipment to other existing groups.", "Tabler, who lived in the Middle East for 14 years, co-founded an English-language magazine in Syria and authored the 2011 book\u00a0\u201cIn the Lion\u2019s Den:\u00a0An Eyewitness Account of Washington\u2019s Battle with Syria,\u201d\u00a0said the argument linking the administration to the Islamic State seemed to come from the idea that U.S. policy led to the creation of the Islamic State, but the U.S. supported the non-jihadist opposition.", "\u201cThe reason for the growth of terror groups in Syria is due to the breakdown of the Assad regime (which controls now only 1/3 of Syrian territory) due to its response to the Syrian uprising,\u201d Tabler said. \u201cThe US supported the non-jihadist opposition, not Jihadists like AQ\u2019s Jebhat al-Nusra.\u201d", "In fact, al-Nusra (or the Nusra Front) was designated a foreign terrorist group by the Obama administration in December 2011.

Ford has criticized the administration\u2019s policy in Syria.", "As for this memo going to Clinton when she was secretary of state, Cammack said the fact that it lists \u201cRUEHC/SECSTATE WASHINGTON DC\u201d as a recipient \u2014 something Breitbart noted \u2014 is \u201cmeaningless.\u201d The memo likely would have been read by \u201cworker bees,\u201d and potentially incorporated into a briefing for the secretary.", "Indeed, State Department spokesman John Kirby told the Washington Post Fact Checker that \u201c[a]ll reports that come to Washington have that address\u201d and that \u201cit\u00a0does not indicate it was sent to the secretary of state or the secretary\u2019s office.\u201d", "Cammack said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that any American president would be accused of supporting a\u00a0terrorist group bent on destroying the U.S.", "We agree.
