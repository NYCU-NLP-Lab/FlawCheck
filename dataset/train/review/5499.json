["About this rating", "On or around 22 March 2016, a rumor began circulating on social media\u00a0that popular poll-cruncher and statistician Nate Silver had predicted that Vermont senator Bernie Sanders would sweep eight upcoming primaries and thereby snatch the Democratic presidential nomination away from Hillary Clinton.  For example, one 21 March 2016 blog post maintained Silver had expressed that \"Bernie Sanders is likely to win all of the upcoming 8 states\":", "According to polling expert Nate Silver, Bernie Sanders is likely to win all of the upcoming 8 states in the race to become the Democratic nominee. Silver boasts a long record of accurate predictions which includes successfully calling the outcomes in 49 of the 50 states in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, for example. As a result of that particular achievement, he was named one of The World's 100 Most Influential People by Time in 2009.", "Using his new method of predicting, Silver would have been able to predict the Michigan caucus far more accurately, as he explains, \"Our demographic 'retrodiction' for Michigan still has Clinton winning, but only barely \u2014 by 3 percentage points, compared with the actual 2-point win for Sanders. Especially under the Democrats' proportional allocation method, that's a pretty minor difference.\" The difference is even more minor when you incorporate the fact that most polling companies, in the run-up to Michigan, had Sanders losing to Clinton by almost 20%.", "That claim was suspect due to its source (various blogs) and its difference from\u00a0the way Silver generally presents\u00a0his analyses, which is to eschew making sweeping declarations and expressing future events as outright certainties in favor of explicating trends and probabilities. The post reproduced above linked to a 15 March 2016 post\u00a0that\u00a0Silver published on his\u00a0FiveThirtyEight blog, published on the day of the Ohio Democratic primary (which Bernie Sanders lost\u00a0by 42.7% to Hillary Clinton's 56.5%,) In that post, Silver projected that Hillary Clinton was running ahead of Sanders in Arizona's 22 March 2015 primary but pegged the subsequent seven (not eight) states as potential Sanders wins:", "That post from Silver\u00a0didn't\u00a0claim that Sanders would sweep eight states following the primaries of\u00a015 March 2016, nor did it\u00a0say that\u00a0Sanders would definitively \u2014 or even probably \u2014 seize the Democratic nomination. The closest Silver came to saying anything like that was this portion of his post:", "Our demographic \"retrodiction\" for Michigan still has Clinton winning, but only barely \u2014 by 3 percentage points, compared with the actual 2-point win for Sanders. Especially under the Democrats' proportional allocation method, that's a pretty minor difference. The model's retrodictions in Vermont and Arkansas are also pretty far off, as you can see, but that makes sense given potential home-state effects for Sanders and Clinton in those states.", "Aside from straight reporting of the Democrats Abroad primary (won by Sanders with 69% of the vote) on 21 March 2016, Silver's most recent Twitter mentions of Sanders again predicted neither a multi-state sweep nor a lock\u00a0on the Democratic nomination:", "Silver lining for Sanders tonight: seems to be making progress among black voters. https://t.co/21odfhRGip", "\u2014 Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) March 16, 2016", "On average between 5 states voting tonight, just 17% of Dems were late deciders. Split evenly between Sanders & HRC. https://t.co/iQfLtzq2e0 \u2014 Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) March 16, 2016", "After the 15 March 2016 FiveThirtyEight posting,\u00a0Silver tweeted:", "Guys I think it's gonna be Clinton. https://t.co/I8rgYFGjMk \u2014 Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) March 16, 2016", "We contacted Silver to determine whether he made the prediction attributed to him in any other medium or context but have not yet received a response.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
