Then he made a claim about Wisconsin, saying:", "This is designed to be a middle-class tax cut. I think the people who are concerned the most are some of the big businesses; that's where we hear most of the complaints about. But this is a middle-class tax cut, no two ways about it. I just ran the numbers of Wisconsin.
