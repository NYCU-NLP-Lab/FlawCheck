(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "Initial Norwegian reports on Jan. 15 indicated that 23 people had died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines. By Jan. 18, the number of deaths had increased to 33, out of about 48,000 vaccinated. Though the Facebook post says people died \"within hours\" of receiving the vaccine, Norwegian authorities said only that 23 deaths occurred within six days of vaccination, and published reports do not indicate the time frame for the remaining 10 deaths.", "The Norwegian government said the country\u2019s vaccination program is initially targeting the most vulnerable \u2014 the elderly and those in nursing homes \u2014 and \"a high proportion\" of the latter were very frail or terminally ill and already very near the end of their lives.", "As a result, health authorities said, \"It is expected that deaths close to the time of vaccination may occur.\"", "There\u2019s no proof that the COVID-19 vaccines caused the deaths, the Norwegian Medicines Agency said. Norway\u2019s strong \"reporting culture\" for vaccine adverse reactions means that \"health care professionals have a low threshold for reporting possible adverse reactions, even when the causal relationships appear very unclear,\" a government report said.", "An average of 45 people die each day in Norwegian nursing homes and similar institutions, according to the Norwegian Medicines Agency. Therefore, \"it is not a given that this represents any excess mortality or that there is a causal connection,\" Camilla Stoltenberg, head of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said at a press conference on Jan. 18.", "The COVID-19 vaccines were developed quickly but rely on scientific research that is decades old, and they underwent a rigorous review process, PolitiFact has reported.

Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, a member of the U.S. federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said in December that the likelihood of nursing home patients dying from other causes shortly after vaccination could erode public confidence in the safety of the vaccines. She said that\u2019s why she voted against prioritizing residents of long-term care facilities for vaccines.", "However, residents and staff of long-term care facilities in the U.S. are among the most vulnerable when it comes to COVID-19. They represent 40% of COVID-19 deaths nationwide, though they make up less than 1% of the U.S. population. Other members of the advisory committee voted to include nursing home residents in the earliest phase.", "Of the 33 Norwegians who died after receiving the vaccine, 13 of their cases have been completely assessed by health authorities. The 13 people were all older than 80, with some older than 90, and were considered severely frail, which was defined as having serious heart failure, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and similar conditions.", "As of Jan. 18, Norway had vaccinated more than 48,000 people, the majority of whom were nursing home residents. The 33 fatalities represent fewer than 1 out of 1,000 of those who were vaccinated, Steinar Madsen, the medical director of Norwegian Medicines Agency, told Bloomberg.", "For some of the frailest patients, though, \"the possibility that relatively mild side effects of the vaccine could have serious consequences cannot be ruled out,\" health officials said. Common vaccine reactions \u2014 including fever, nausea and diarrhea \u2014 could have contributed to some of the deaths in the 13 cases for which investigations have been completed.", "\"There is a possibility that these common adverse reactions, that are not dangerous in fitter, younger patients and are not unusual with vaccines, may aggravate underlying disease in the elderly,\" Madsen told the medical journal BMJ. \"We are not alarmed or worried about this, because these are very rare occurrences and they occurred in very frail patients with very serious disease.\"", "The risks of the COVID-19 vaccine for much older people are not as well understood, because a limited number of people 85 and older participated in the large clinical trials. Madsen said Norwegian officials are now recommending careful medical evaluation of the very frail before deciding whether vaccination is appropriate.", "A Facebook post says, \"23 people die\u00a0within hours of taking the COVID vaccine. ...
