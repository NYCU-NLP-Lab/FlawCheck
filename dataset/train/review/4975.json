["By Robert Farley and Lori Robertson", "Posted on November 13, 2018", "With votes continuing to be counted in very close elections in Florida, Georgia and Arizona, President Donald Trump and some other Republicans have been crying foul, making false and misleading claims of supposed election fraud perpetrated by Democrats in an attempt to \u201csteal\u201d the elections.", "There is no evidence of\u00a0an organized effort by Democrats to \u201csteal\u201d elections,\u00a0and the ballot counting is proceeding in due course.\u00a0It often takes more than a week for counties around the country to count mail-in, absentee and provisional ballots. What\u2019s unusual is that these ballots could tilt the results one way or the other. And in Florida, a mandatory recount has already been triggered in the elections for U.S. Senate and for governor.", "Nonetheless, the president and other Republicans have been muddying the national dialogue and spinning the facts:", "In his claims, the president has alleged the Florida vote count has been \u201cmassively infected\u201d with \u201clarge numbers of new ballots\u201d showing up \u201cout of nowhere\u201d while other ballots are \u201cmissing or forged.\u201d And he has claimed election officials are suspiciously \u201cfinding votes in Florida and Georgia\u201d after the election. But there is no evidence of any of that.", "In Florida, where Trump has focused much of his ire and Gov. Scott warned \u201cthere may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward Counties,\u201d election officials say there has been no evidence to date of any criminal tampering with election results.", "On Nov. 12, a\u00a0spokeswoman for the Florida Department of State, which supervises elections,\u00a0reiterated\u00a0that it was overseeing the certification of election results and to date had seen \u201cno evidence of criminal activity.\u201d The department is headed by Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Republican appointed by Scott. And despite Scott and State Attorney General Pam Bondi urging the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to look into potential voter fraud,\u00a0FDLE says\u00a0so far it hasn\u2019t seen anything to investigate.", "That doesn\u2019t mean there haven\u2019t been some problematic election issues in Florida. For example,\u00a0CNN reported\u00a0that a North Florida county hit by Hurricane Michael allowed about 150 ballots to be submitted by fax and email, contrary to Florida Department of State guidelines. And it is possible that some incidents involving fraud may come to light, such as a person with a felony conviction voting even though their voting rights have not been restored, said\u00a0Lorraine Minnite, a professor at Rutgers University and author of \u201cThe Myth of Voter Fraud.\u00a0But Minnite said that she is not aware of evidence of any kind of voter fraud in Florida, Georgia or Arizona.", "During an emergency hearing on Nov. 12,\u00a0Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter\u00a0said he had seen no evidence of illegal activity in the vote-counting in Broward County, and he urged both sides to \u201cramp down the rhetoric.\u201d", "\u201cEverything the lawyers are saying out there at the elections office is being beamed out across the country,\u201d Tuter said. \u201cWe should be careful what we say. These words mean things these days.\u201d", "Trump says that the races in Florida for Senate and governor were \u201cwon\u201d on election night by the Republican candidates, Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, respectively, and now the Democrats are trying to go back and \u201cSTEAL two big elections.\u201d But the president simply got out in front of the final tallies, which won\u2019t ultimately be known until all of the absentee and provisional ballots are counted.", "And, because the races are so close, an automatic recount also has been triggered.", "\u201cRick Scott \u2026 won by a comfortable margin,\u201d Trump told reporters on Nov. 9. \u201cHe easily won, but every hour it seems to be going down.\u201d", "Trump echoed those sentiments on Twitter.", "Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him \u201cback into play.\u201d Bill Nelson conceded Election \u2013 now he\u2019s back in play!? This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018", "Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018", "Asked on\u00a0ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d\u00a0on Nov. 11 if the president had any evidence that Democrats are trying to \u201csteal\u201d the elections, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said, \u201cWell the evidence is that Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis have won. In fact, Andrew Gillum conceded on the night of the election, now we\u2019re going backwards.\u201d (Gillum\u00a0withdrew\u00a0his concession a day earlier on Nov. 10.)", "But election night results are always preliminary, and provisional and absentee ballots take more time to process. When elections aren\u2019t particularly close, the public doesn\u2019t notice that it usually takes more than a week to certify election results.", "\u201cThe count is never final on election night \u2013 each state has a deadline for certifying the election, and counties (and in some states, towns) are crossing i\u2019s and dotting t\u2019s until then,\u201d Loyola Law School Professor Justin Levitt, an expert in election fraud, told us via email.", "\u201cMore generally, what is happening in these three states\u00a0[Florida, Georgia and Arizona] is that various elections for Senator and Governor were really close, and so a lot of attention has focused on absentee ballots and particularly provisional ballots, and on checking the tallies of ballots from election night,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cBut that same process is going on in elections all across the country: election officials are assessing absentee and provisional ballots to see whether they were properly cast by eligible, properly registered voters each voting once, and double-checking the tallies of regular ballots cast at the polls.\u201d", "Never mind that some networks will project the winner of a close race, as some did for DeSantis on election night.", "\u201cWhen the networks \u2018call\u2019 the election on election night, what they\u2019re doing is assessing the likelihood of a final result based on exit polls and early tallies from polling places (and from absentee ballots that the jurisdiction may have already counted), and making statistical assessments of the likelihood that once all ballots are cast, the person who won could have actually lost,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cBut election results are never instantaneous, and every single one of the network\u2019s announcements is a preliminary estimate. \u2026 [T]he results from election night for some of the races were really close \u2026 and so crossing each \u201ct\u201d and dotting each \u201cI\u201d may matter a lot in who wins. But the process that\u2019s going on in Florida and Georgia and Arizona is pretty much the same thing that\u2019s happening even for races where the result is more certain, all across the country.\u201d", "Lorraine Minnite, at Rutgers University, said most people probably pay little attention to election administration, such as the \u201coften intricate rules that govern election procedures, including ballot counting.\u201d", "\u201cIn addition, most elections are not tight nail-biters,\u201d Minnite told us via email. \u201cI can understand why the average citizen might be confused about why the elections in Georgia, Florida and Arizona have not yet been decided. But, no one should worry yet \u2013 close elections take longer to count, and all ballots must be accounted for.\u201d", "At this point she said she has seen no evidence of election fraud.", "Trump has repeatedly referred to election officials suspiciously \u201cfinding\u201d votes for Democrats. But there is no evidence to date that vote counts have been influenced by anything other than legally cast ballots. Indeed, most of the changing vote totals have been due to officials tallying mail-in, provisional and absentee ballots not counted on Election Day.", "Trump told reporters\u00a0on Nov. 9 that in Florida, \u201call of a sudden, they\u2019re finding votes out of nowhere.\u201d In Arizona, he said, \u201call of a sudden, out of the wilderness, they find a lot of votes.\u201d And, Trump said, \u201cDo you notice, the votes never go the other way [in Republicans favor]?\u201d", "Trump raised similar concerns about \u201cfound\u201d votes on Twitter:", "You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia \u2013 but the Election was on Tuesday? Let\u2019s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018", "Rick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they \u201cfound\u201d many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. \u201cThe Broward Effect.\u201d How come they never find Republican votes?", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018", "In the case of Arizona, it simply takes longer to count ballots because about 75 percent of Arizona voters cast ballots by mail. Although Republican Senate candidate Martha McSally appeared to be winning the race on election night, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema pulled ahead by about 2,000 votes after Maricopa County released the results of 120,000 outstanding ballots available two days after the election. By Nov. 12, Sinema\u2019s lead had grown to more than 32,000 votes, CNN reported. That night, the Associated Press projected Sinema as the winner of the race, and McSally called Sinema to concede the race.", "In Florida, the vote differentials have changed as counties began to submit tallies from provisional and absentee ballots.", "\u201cThe election officials aren\u2019t finding votes \u2013 they\u2019re counting votes that were not cast as regular ballots on election day,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cThe ballots were already there: they\u2019re revealing for whom those ballots were cast. That\u2019s a whole lot different from \u2018finding\u2019 new votes.\u201d", "In fact, it is possible that not all ballots have even arrived.\u00a0The state accepts ballots from military and overseas voters until Nov. 16, provided they are postmarked Nov. 6.", "The president is also wrong to say election officials have not been \u201cfinding\u201d Republican votes as well.", "\u201cThere are many tens of thousands of ballots being evaluated, some of which reveal votes for Republicans, some of which reveal votes for Democrats, some of which reveal votes for both (for different offices), some of which reveal votes for neither,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cThe reports in the press generally only give the net differential margin, and in this case the Democratic candidates have been narrowing the margin as more votes are counted. But that does not mean that only votes for Democrats have been counted. In reality, there have been many votes for Republicans counted since the election as well.\u201d", "In Florida, a teacher at Miramar Elementary School in Broward County said she came across a box labelled \u201cProvisional Ballot Box.\u201d Republican Sen. Marco Rubio retweeted a report of what he called the \u201cleft behind\u201d box and criticized Broward County officials for \u201capparently\u201d misplacing ballots. \u201cJust let that sink in for a moment,\u201d Rubio tweeted.\u00a0But county election officials say the boxes at the school contained no ballots \u2014 just election supplies.", "Election experts say mismatched signatures on mail-in and provisional ballots, compared with voter registration documents, are actually fairly common, and aren\u2019t necessarily evidence of fraud. Rather, handwriting can change over time, so a legal voter could be deemed to have a mismatched signature from when he or she registered to vote years before.", "But in a tweet, Trump said reports that \u201cSIGNATURES DON\u2019T MATCH\u201d on some ballots in Arizona meant there had been \u201celectoral corruption\u201d and\u00a0may be grounds to consider a new election.", "Just out \u2014 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON\u2019T MATCH. Electoral corruption \u2013 Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018", "And on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Nov. 11, Scott alleged his Democratic opponent has \u201cgone to court to say that fraudulent ballots, fraudulent ballots that were not properly delivered, sign, whatever should have \u2014 should be counted, OK? Senator Nelson is clearly trying to find \u2014 to try and commit fraud to try to win this election. That\u2019s all this is.\u201d", "States have different procedures to check if the signatures on absentee and provisional ballots match the signatures the voters gave when registering to vote, and what to do about it if they don\u2019t.", "A lawsuit filed by the Nelson campaign against the Florida secretary of state argues that tens of thousands of Floridians who voted via provisional ballot are at risk of disenfranchisement due to a \u201cstandardless signature matching process.\u201d The suit seeks to prevent the state from rejecting ballots with mismatched signatures. It is scheduled to be heard this week.", "According to the suit, the state\u2019s \u201centirely standardless, inconsistent, and unreliable signature matching process\u201d has \u201ca disparate impact on People of Color and young, first time voters, violates the prohibition against undue burdens on the right to vote \u2026 and subjects Florida voters to disparate treatment and inconsistent standards in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause.\u201d", "According to a 2016 survey by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1 percent of absentee ballots nationally were rejected in the 2016 election, and \u201cnon-matching signature\u201d was the top reason (27.5 percent). See Table 1.", "\u201cIt is not unusual to find signatures that don\u2019t match,\u201d Minnite said. \u201cHandwriting can change over time, and a voter who has been registered at the same address for many years who votes irregularly may find him or herself in a situation where the elections office asks for an updated signature.\u201d", "States have different procedures to check signatures on ballots. Some states have automated systems that do initial screens of signatures, followed by a human review of rejected ballots due to mismatches. In some states, Minnite said, if a signature on a mail ballot doesn\u2019t match, the voter may be contacted to come into the election office to provide an updated signature.", "In Arizona, only a handful of counties allowed voters to verify their signatures after the election, and a legal battle between Democrats and Republicans resulted in a settlement that will allow all Arizona counties to verify ballot signatures until 5 p.m. on Nov. 14.", "In Florida, it\u2019s misleading for Scott to call ballots with mismatched signatures \u201cfraudulent ballots.\u201d Indeed, former Florida Rep. Patrick Murphy tweeted on Nov. 9 that he discovered his absentee ballot wasn\u2019t counted in Palm Beach County \u201cdue to \u2018invalid signature\u2019 match.\u201d", "\u201cPeople\u2019s signatures change over time, and in different situations,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cYour signature on a supermarket checkout machine is probably not the same signature as on the deed to a house.\u201d", "It\u2019s also important to note, Levitt said, that \u201cthe signatures on provisional and absentee ballots are all evaluated before anyone knows who the ballot is cast for: the signature is on the outside of an envelope, and the ballot is on the inside, and you can\u2019t tell who the votes were cast for looking at the outside of the envelope. So the decisions on counting or not counting provisional or absentee ballots are made independent of the identity of the voter\u2019s preferred candidates.\u201d", "On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Scott claimed, \u201cSen. Nelson\u2019s lawyer said that a noncitizen should have the right to vote.\u201d\u00a0But that\u2019s not clear from the evidence.", "In a brief exchange during a canvassing board meeting, a lawyer representing Nelson objected after a provisional ballot was disqualified because the voter was deemed to be \u201cnot a citizen.\u201d", "The Nelson campaign\u2019s lead recount attorney later said the lawyer was \u201cnot authorized to make such an objection\u201d and that \u201cnoncitizens cannot vote in U.S. elections.\u201d", "Scott\u2019s claim came during an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Nov. 11.\u00a0Host Chris Wallace asked him, \u201cYou\u2019re accusing Bill Nelson of trying to commit fraud?\u201d", "Scott responded, \u201cHis lawyer said that a noncitizen should vote.\u201d", "Fox News,\u00a0Daily Caller and The Blaze all obtained a transcript of a Palm Beach County Canvassing Board proceeding on Nov. 9 when officials were reviewing provisional ballots. According to the transcript, provided by a court reporter hired by the Palm Beach County GOP, when one provisional ballot was discarded, Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher explained, \u201cNot a U.S. citizen; not counted.\u201d The transcript states that lawyer Jack Scarola responded, \u201cObjection Nelson.\u201d", "No explanation was provided for the objection, and the ballot was quickly disallowed after a 2-1 vote in which Bucher and\u00a0Judge August Bonavita voted not to count it. We could not reach Scarola to determine why he objected, or if he was attempting to argue the person was misidentified as a noncitizen. It is a leap from that brief exchange to claim the attorney \u201csaid that a noncitizen should have the right to vote.\u201d", "As the stories note, Marc Elias, recount attorney for the Nelson campaign, later issued a statement saying, \u201cThe lawyer who was present was not someone we had authorized to make such an objection. Noncitizens cannot vote in U.S. elections.\u201d", "The president suggested that\u00a0Fusion GPS, a research firm that hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to investigate Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, had something to do with the vote counting in Florida. It doesn\u2019t.", "The tenuous connection is that the attorney for Nelson\u2019s campaign in Florida, Elias, also represented the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016, when he hired Fusion GPS to research Trump.", "Trump made the claim during remarks to reporters before he departed for Europe on Nov. 9.", "Trump, Nov. 9:\u00a0And Rick Scott, who won by \u2014 you know, it was close, but he won by a comfortable margin \u2014 every couple of hours it goes down a little bit.

And I guess I hear they were somehow involved or worked with the GPS Fusion people, who have committed \u2014 I mean, if you look at what they\u2019ve done, you look at the dishonesty.", "During his remarks, a reporter asked if Trump had any evidence of fraud. The president responded: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, you tell me. It\u2019s always the Democrats. It\u2019s always GPS Fusion. It\u2019s always crooked stuff.\u201d", "Fusion GPS was\u00a0founded by former\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reporters\u00a0Glenn R.

It alleged the Kremlin has compromising information on Trump.", "It\u2019s no surprise that Nelson would want to hire Elias during the recount. Elias\u2019 bio says \u201che is a preeminent counselor in the areas of federal and state campaign finance law \u2026 as well as recounts and election contests.
