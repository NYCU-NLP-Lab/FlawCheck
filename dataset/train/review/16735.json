Once you're registered, if you try to change your payment information on Trump's site, you will see no option to remove your credit card \u2014 only \"update\" it. Then, when you click on \"update card,\" you see a page that allows you to alter your payment information \u2014 but you cannot completely delete your credit card. You are forced to replace it with another valid card: Invalid numbers are rejected.", "One responder to the original tweet then objected to that claim, stating it was impossible to set up a recurring $1 donation:", ".@JDiamond1 You can't set up a $1.00 recurring amt.\nWhat else about this story is BS?@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/kB4TalWOSE", "\u2014 ValerieNoFux (@OPFergVal) August 7, 2016", "However, it appears that it is possible to enter any amount as a recurring donation:", "Mic confirmed that if a putative donor set up an account, then it would be possible for that person to cancel a recurring donation made via Trump's web site:", "It turns out that there is a way to delete your card from the Trump campaign's system, but it seems you must have first registered an account and created a password: If you did not do so, there is no clear way to cancel your payment.", "Assuming you did create an account and have logged in, to stop your payment you must click the small gray question mark icon in the upper right corner of the donations page.", "Then you will see [a separate] screen. In order to delete your card, you must click \"manage.\"", "Then will you be redirected to the website of the Trump campaign's vendor.

First, notify the vendor. Next, tell your bank about your request at least three business days before the money is scheduled to be transferred. Your notice to the bank may be oral, but the institution may require you to provide a written follow-up within 14 days to ensure that no additional payments are made. If you fail to provide a written follow-up, the bank is no longer responsible for stopping future payments.", "Stopping an automatic, recurring payment on a credit card is different. Start by putting in your request with the vendor. But if the vendor continues to charge your credit card, contact your card issuer. You'll have 60 days to dispute the charge, starting when the card issuer sends you the statement with the charges.", "While it appears to be atypically difficult to cancel a recurring donation to the Trump campaign, it is certainly not impossible, as individuals who create an account can do so via the web interface.
