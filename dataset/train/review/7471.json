["Last week, after Time magazine announced its annual\u00a0\"Person of the Year,\" images of the magazine's cover flooded social media.", "Some of the covers\u00a0posted to Facebook featured three individuals: President-elect Joe Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and Chinese President Xi Jinping, along with the text \"Xi Jinping, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris \u2013 Changing America's Story.\"", "One of the images \u2013 posted by The Committee to Defend the President, a page\u00a0that favors\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2013 had\u00a0over\u00a01,000 shares before the post was deleted.\u00a0We Are TRUMP Nation\u00a0also posted a photo of the cover with\u00a0the caption,\u00a0\"Time's Persons of the Year, we're screwed.\"", "The pages have not responded to requests from USA TODAY for comment.", "Time magazine awarded the title of 2020 \"Person of the Year\" to just two of the three individuals on those covers \u2013 Biden and Harris, not Xi.", "Time Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal explained that\u00a0the duo received the accolade \"for changing the American story, for showing that the forces of empathy are greater than the furies of division, (and)\u00a0for sharing a vision of healing in a grieving world.\"", "Time displays all of its published covers in \"The Vault.\" The most recent cover \u2013 slated for Dec. 21 \u2013 features Biden and Harris.", "The posts that show Biden, Harris and\u00a0Xi on the cover appear to be a photoshopped version of the actual magazine cover. On the real cover, photos of Biden and Harris in profile overlap each other. On the altered cover,\u00a0Xi is awkwardly slotted between the two.", "A number of other imperfections on the cover also suggest\u00a0that it is fake.\u00a0Unlike Biden and Harris, the profile of\u00a0Xi lacks a neck or torso, and there is a faint red outline on part of his face and hair.", "Fake covers targeting the magazine have previously appeared online\u00a0\u2013 including another cover that showed\u00a0\"The Medical Workers\" as the 2020 \"Person of the Year.\"", "In 2017, the longtime\u00a0trend even prompted Time to publish a\u00a0guide on the subject of spotting fake covers. It includes\u00a0tips on how to examine the logo, the border, the image and the typography for clues about a cover's veracity.", "Indeed, a close inspection of the\u00a0typography on the fake cover\u00a0featuring Xi reveals that his name\u00a0is a slightly different font than Biden and Harris.", "Based on our research, the claim that\u00a0Biden, Harris and Xi appear on Time magazine's cover as Person of the Year is an ALTERED image. Only Biden and Harris received the accolade and a spot on the magazine's actual cover. Posts that show Biden, Harris and\u00a0Xi on the cover are photoshopped.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
