Some of those users include \u2013 Norwegian diplomat Erik Solheim, Indian sports journalist Mohandas Menon, president of Gzeromedia and Eurasia Group Ian Bremmer and Ziya Mera senior resident fellow at The Centre for Historical Analysis and Conflict Research.", "The map was created by one Arpan Srivastava eight years ago. He alerted the same in a reply to SM Hoaxslayer on Twitter. If one notices carefully, the map shows Andra Pradesh and Telangana as one state. They were separated in 2014.", "Thanks @SMHoaxSlayer. Actually, this image was created by me using MS paint, for a Quora answer 8 years ago : https://t.co/P0hOICcdZD. Back when I used to have too much time on my hand. I am flattered that ppl think that American CEOs spend their time doing this kind of shit. \ud83d\ude02", "\u2014 Arpan Srivastava (@appysrivastava) April 15, 2020", "Srivastava also attached a link to the map he had posted on Quora on November 26, 2012.", "The map has been floating online since.

However, unlike Madhav\u2019s post, this text points out how the Prime Minister is managing a country where different states have a population equal to countries across the globe.

The report only compared the populations of the various countries with Indian states to illustrate the challenge at hand for the Indian government and how \u2018well\u2019 they have responded. TV9 Bharatvarsh only concentrated on the population of Indian states which is equal to countries across the globe. The channel praised PM Modi without comparing other important data points such as compensation for the unemployed or tests per million conducted in those other nations.", "Therefore, an 8-year-old map which merely compares the population of Indian states with countries around the world has been used to praise PM Modi for tackling coronavirus in such a highly populated country. However, other factors such as the number of tests conducted, relief measures or unemployment benefits have not been considered.", "Update: Arpan Srivastava\u2019s post and the fact that the map shows Andhra and Telangana as one state have been added to the fact-check.", "Donate Now", "\ud83d\ude4f Blessed to have worked as a fact-checking journalist from November 2019 to February 2023.", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
