President Donald Trump\u2019s son Eric Trump shared such claims in a tweet.", "But there\u2019s no evidence of anything like that. Instead, a video shows a photographer entering the convention hall in the wee hours for news coverage of the workers counting ballots.

He is not a democrat operative, he is a photographer at @wxyzdetroit.
