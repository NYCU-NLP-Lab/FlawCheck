["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on August 15, 2018", "Q: Were there \u201cmajor signs of voter fraud\u201d in Ohio\u2019s congressional special election?", "A: No. The Ohio Secretary of State\u2019s office says there have been no reports of voter fraud.", "Recently there has been a report that a district in Ohio (district 12?)\u00a0where 170 \u201cregistered voters\u201d were showing as being 116 years old.\u00a0 I have only been able to find this on sites such as Breitbart, Fellowship of the Mind, The Federalist Papers, Red State,\u00a0so I seriously doubt the veracity of these numbers.\u00a0 Can you determine if this is accurate?", "A special election for a congressional seat in Ohio is too close to call and some unreliable websites have filled the void with misinformation.", "Since the Aug. 7 election, Republican Troy Balderson has maintained a slight edge over Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor, but the Ohio secretary of state won\u2019t have a complete count of all of the provisional and absentee ballots until Aug. 24.", "In the meantime, some partisan websites have suggested that voter fraud is the culprit for the close election. One such story claimed that Balderson\u2019s slim lead \u201cjust goes to show that voter fraud can have a huge impact on all kinds of elections in our country.\u201d", "That story\u2019s headline said: \u201cRed Alert: Major Signs of Voter Fraud Uncovered In Ohio.\u201d", "But that\u2019s not true. There have been no \u201cmajor signs of voter fraud\u201d in Ohio.", "In fact, the Ohio Secretary of State\u2019s office has not received any reports of voter fraud following the Aug. 7 election, spokesman Sam Rossi told FactCheck.org in a phone interview.", "Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican who was elected to office in 2010, issued a statement a week after the election to dispel those rumors. He said, in part:", "Husted statement, Aug. 13:\u00a0First, I can assure all voters who participated in last Tuesday\u2019s election that all eligible ballots will be counted \u2013 no exceptions. It is also important to keep in mind that the results provided on Tuesday are unofficial and the official results will not be available until county boards of elections complete the official canvass, which must be done by August 24.", "As to concerns of potential voter fraud, my office has done a lot to clean up the voter rolls. During my tenure, we have removed more than 680,000 deceased voters, reconciled nearly two million duplicate registrations, and now have complete information on over 90 percent of voters \u2013 up from just 20 percent when I took office in 2011. As I have always said, while voter fraud exists, it is rare and we hold those who commit it accountable.", "The bogus story borrowed heavily from a Breitbart article written by Eric Eggers, who works at the conservative Government Accountability Institute think tank, and recently published a book called, \u201cFraud: How the Left Plans to Steal the Next Election.\u201d", "In the only example he offers of alleged voter fraud, Eggers writes that there are 170 voters registered in Ohio\u2019s 12th Congressional District who are over 116 years old. That\u2019s wrong.", "According to the most recent version of the roll for that district, there are 161 registered voters who have a birthdate listed as Jan. 1, 1800 or Jan. 1, 1900. But those dates are just place holders for voters who registered before birthdates became a required part of the registration process in 1974. They are not their real birthdates.", "Ohio actually has a system for purging inactive voters from the rolls \u2014 so people who have moved, or have died, are taken off the rolls. If a person doesn\u2019t vote for four consecutive years after failing to return a confirmation of address postcard sent by the state, his or her name is removed from the list of eligible voters. That system was just upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in June.", "Although we couldn\u2019t talk to everyone registered in the 12th District who was listed as being born in 1800 or 1900, we did talk to some of them and can confirm that they are living, breathing, eligible voters.", "Charles Hacker, of Mansfield, Ohio, is one of them. He registered to vote in 1973, according to the voter roll, and his birthdate is listed as Jan. 1, 1800. But he was actually born in 1944, he told FactCheck.org in a phone interview. He\u2019s 74 years old.", "Similarly, Karen Morris, also of Mansfield, registered to vote in 1972, according to the roll. Her birthdate is also listed as Jan 1, 1800, but she was actually born in 1946.", "\u201cWe\u2019re both dedicated voters,\u201d her husband, Larry Morris, told us in a phone interview. In fact, when they went to vote in the special election on Aug. 7, he said, one of the election officials told his wife, \u201cYou look awful young for having an 1800 birthday.\u201d His wife had been unaware of the place holder date and changed it at that point. \u201cI hope they get it straight now,\u201d he said.", "So, those voters that Eggers questioned may well live in that district \u2014 Charles Hacker and Karen Morris do. And they\u2019re much younger than 116.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.", "\u201cRed Alert: Major Signs of Voter Fraud Uncovered In Ohio.\u201d Fbnewscycle.com. 9 Aug 2018.", "Husted, Jon.

Congressional District 12 voter files. 11 Aug 2018.", "Husted V. Philip Randolph Institute. No. 16-980.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
