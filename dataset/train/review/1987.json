And he mentioned one group in particular.", "\"I think I have tremendous support from women,\" Trump said in a Nov. 3, 2016, speech in Jacksonville, Fla. \"Tremendous support.\"", "We wondered what the polls tell us about female sentiment toward the Republican candidate. Trump has garnered headlines for video of him boasting about groping women, and more than 10 women have said Trump forced himself on them.", "Here\u2019s a scan of the latest polling results.", "The CBS News/New York Times poll from Nov. 3, 2016 found 50 percent of women back Clinton and 36 percent support Trump.", "In a new poll from ABC News/Washington Post, Clinton gets 52 percent of the women compared to 41 percent for Trump.", "The Los Angeles Times/USC poll finds women favor Clinton by an 8-point margin, 49 percent to 41 percent.", "The Investor\u2019s Business Daily/TIPP election tracker also gives Clinton an edge among women by 51 percent to 38 percent.
