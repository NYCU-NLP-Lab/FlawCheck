["About this rating", "A photograph circulating on social media in mid-October 2019 was falsely characterized by some as portraying U.S. President Donald Trump's children \u2014 Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric \u2014 alongside Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. The latter were arrested on charges that they schemed to illegally funnel foreign cash into Trump's election campaign.\n\nThe two men standing between Ivanka and Eric Trump are not Parnas and Fruman. The picture shows the Trumps, who ran a real estate empire before Donald Trump became president, standing with people associated with their business enterprise in Florida. The man standing immediately to Ivanka's left is real estate developer Michael Dezer. The man on Dezer's left (and Eric's right) is Michael Babel, according to historian Yuri Felshtinsky, while the woman in the photograph standing on Ivanka's right was Florida realtor Elena Baronoff, who died in 2015 from cancer. Neither Parnas nor Fruman are in the shot. (Donald Trump Jr., is pictured to the far right in the photograph).", "Parnas and Fruman were arrested on Oct. 9, 2019, at Dulles International Airport, where they had planned to board planes with one-way tickets out of the United States. The above meme appears to be a low-effort attempt to create the visual impression of close ties between the men and the Trumps, although actual photographs and reports do exist of interactions between Parnas, Fruman, and members of the Trump family, including Donald Trump himself.", "Fruman, Parnas, Trump and Giuliani.
