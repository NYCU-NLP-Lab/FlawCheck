All over the country, especially in California, voter fraud is rampant. Must be stopped.

It's possible in some cases, for example, that someone obtained a\u00a0driver\u2019s license before earning their citizenship.", "The whittling\u00a0process that is just starting across Texas has played out in other states that mounted similar voter roll purges based on\u00a0driver\u2019s license data, said Justin Levitt, a Loyola law school professor and expert on voter registration.", "\"Percentages are infinitesimal of the original eye-popping headline,\" Levitt said.", "For nearly a year, the Texas Secretary of State and the Texas Department of Public Safety have been trying to identify noncitizen voters.

Of those, 58,000 people voted in elections back to 1996, said Sam Taylor, a spokesman for the secretary of State.", "But the same advisory that is the source of those numbers urged caution in interpreting them, using all capital letters to describe the similar records as \"WEAK matches.\" The announcement didn\u2019t say 58,000 noncitizens definitely voted.", "Despite the warning, the numbers inspired some overhyped reactions, including from the Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican who tweeted a \"voter fraud alert.\"", "County officials can\u2019t cancel a voter\u2019s registration based on the information provided so far. The advisory states that if registrars have reason to believe a voter is not eligible, they should send a letter to the voters asking for proof of citizenship within 30 days. After that point, election officials can cancel the person\u2019s registration.", "Voting rights advocates raised a key concern about the data: driver\u2019s license data may not reflect a person\u2019s current citizenship status.", "\"Indeed, between 52,000-63,000 are naturalized every year in Texas,\" Texas Civil Rights Project spokesman Zen\u00e9n Jaimes P\u00e9rez told PolitiFact.", "We asked the Secretary of State\u2019s office if it\u2019s possible that some of the people in the 58,000 or 95,000 groups have since become citizens.", "\"That\u2019s up to the county voter registrars and/or the Attorney General\u2019s office to determine,\" Taylor responded.", "On Jan. 28, county election officials across Texas were starting the process of examining the information from the state.

The search was rife with errors, turning up the name of \u00a0a Brooklyn-born World War II veteran as a noncitizen voter. The state initially identified 182,000 people but ended the purge after removing just 85 names.", "Before we issue our ruling, a quick word about\u00a0Trump's call\u00a0for \"strong voter ID.\" Texas already has among the strictest voter ID laws in the country. The original 2011 law required voters to show a government-issued ID such as a driver\u2019s license or passport. After a court found that the law had a discriminatory effect, the state passed a new law that allowed voters to provide other forms of ID, and it survived a federal appellate test in 2018.", "Trump said, \"58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote.\"", "Trump omits that even the Texas Secretary of State has expressed caution in these numbers, calling the match in records \"WEAK\" and outlining a process county elections officials can undergo to check the flagged voters.", "At this point, we don\u2019t know how many on the list culled over 22 years of data will be proven to be noncitizens who cast ballots \u2014 some may have gotten their citizenship after their driver\u2019s license and voted legally.", "Because he inaccurately characterized the early stage of what Texas actually reported, we rate this claim False.", "President Donald Trump, Tweet, Jan. 27, 2019", "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Tweet, Jan. 25, 2019", "Texas Secretary of State, Election Advisory No. 2019-02 and press release, Jan. 25, 2019", "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Press release, Jan. 25, 2019", "Texas Tribune, Twitter thread, Jan. 25, 2019", "Texas Tribune, \"Texas officials flag tens of thousands of voters for citizenship checks,\" Jan. 25, 2019", "Texas ACLU, Tweet, Jan. 26, 2019", "U.S. District Attorney\u2019s Office, Press release, Aug. 24, 2018", "New York Times, \"Trump's Statistics About Undocumented Immigrants Are Questioned by Experts,\" Jan. 28, 2019", "Austin American-Statesman, \"Texas officials target voter rolls for cases of noncitizen voting,\" Jan. 25, 2019", "Houston Chronicle, \"Harris County pushes back against state\u2019s call for voter purge,\" Jan. 28, 2019", "Fort Worth Star-Telegram, \"58,000 non-U.S. citizens may have voted in at least one election here, election official says,\" Jan. 25, 2019", "New York Times, \"Texas\u2019 Voter ID Law Does Not Discriminate and Can Stand, Appeals Panel Rules,\" April 27, 2019", "Snopes, \"Did Texas Discover 58,000 Cases of Voter Fraud by Non-Citizens?\" Jan. 27, 2019", "PolitiFact, \"Donald Trump Jr. tweets misleading 2012 headline about Florida noncitizen voters,\" Nov. 13, 2018", "PolitiFact, \"Donald Trump says there's 'substantial evidence of voter fraud.'
