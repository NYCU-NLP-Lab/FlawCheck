["By Robert Farley", "Posted on February 14, 2020", "Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg misleadingly stated that he \u201ccut\u201d the police practice of stop-and-frisk \u2014 a policy that he \u201cinherited\u201d \u2014 by \u201c95%\u201d by the time he left office as mayor of New York. There were nearly twice as many stops in his last year as mayor compared with the year before he took office.", "It\u2019s true that the number of recorded stops declined steadily over the last two years of Bloomberg\u2019s 12 years in office. But Bloomberg\u2019s statistic ignores the dramatic rise in such stops in earlier years under his watch. He also fails to mention that the decline in later years came amid public backlash about the policy and mounting pressure from a class-action lawsuit.", "In Bloomberg\u2019s first 10 years in office, the number of stop-and-frisk actions increased nearly 600% from what he \u201cinherited,\u201d reaching a peak of nearly 686,000 stops in 2011. There were about 192,000 documented stops in 2013.", "Bloomberg gets to his figure of a 95% cut by cherry-picking the quarterly high point of 203,500 stops in the first quarter of 2012 and comparing that with the 12,485 stops in the last quarter of 2013 \u2014 a decline that would not have been possible without the numbers ballooning earlier in Bloomberg\u2019s tenure.", "Bloomberg continued to defend the stop-and-frisk practice throughout his term as mayor \u2014 and after \u2014 maintaining that the policy led to a decrease in crime, a justification he now acknowledges was wrong.", "Days before announcing his candidacy for president in November, Bloomberg said that he \u201cshould have acted sooner, and acted faster to cut the stops,\u201d and he apologized for not doing that.", "The issue of Bloomberg\u2019s controversial use of stop-and-frisk as mayor of New York resurfaced in the national media after journalist Benjamin Dixon posted an audio clip of Bloomberg defending the stop-and-frisk policy during an address in 2015 at the Aspen Institute. Bloomberg contended the policy was responsible for lower murder rates. (Bloomberg now acknowledges that \u201ccrime continued to come down as we reduced stops.\u201d)", "Bloomberg, Feb. 5, 2015: Ninety-five percent of murders, murderers and murder victims, fit one M.O. You can just take a description, Xerox it, and pass it out to all the cops. They are male minorities, 16 to 25. That\u2019s true in New York, that\u2019s true in virtually every city (inaudible). And that\u2019s where the real crime is. You\u2019ve got to get the guns out of the hands of people that are getting killed. \u2026 You want to spend the money on a lot of cops in the streets. Put those cops where the crime is, which means in minority neighborhoods. So, one of the unintended consequences is people say, \u201cOh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s true. Why? Because we put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. Yes, that\u2019s true. Why do we do it? Because that\u2019s where all the crime is. \u2026\u00a0 And the way you get the guns out of the kids\u2019 hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them. And then they start, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to get caught,\u201d so they don\u2019t bring the gun. They still have a gun, but they leave it at home.", "(The audio posted by Dixon edited out some of Bloomberg\u2019s comments. You can hear full Bloomberg\u2019s answer here.)", "Trump, who has a long history of supporting stop-and-frisk policies, tweeted (and then deleted) a link to Dixon\u2019s tweet, along with his own commentary, \u201cWOW, BLOOMBERG IS A TOTAL RACIST!\u201d", "Responding to Trump\u2019s tweet, Bloomberg issued a statement saying, in part, \u201cI inherited the police practice of stop-and-frisk, and as part of our effort to stop gun violence it was overused. By the time I left office, I cut it back by 95%, but I should\u2019ve done it faster and sooner. I regret that and I have apologized \u2014 and I have taken responsibility for taking too long to understand the impact it had on Black and Latino communities.\u201d", "It\u2019s true, as Bloomberg said, that he inherited the controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a get-tough-on-crime tactic of stopping people for suspicious activity that was begun under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. According to data revealed by the state attorney general\u2019s office as part of an investigation into the city\u2019s policy, there were a little fewer than 100,000 recorded stops in 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office.", "In the ensuing years under Bloomberg, the number of reported stops increased dramatically year after year, peaking at nearly 686,000 in 2011, based on New York Police Department quarterly reports compiled by the ACLU of New York. From then on, the number of recorded stops began a steady decline. There were nearly 192,000 stops in 2013, Bloomberg\u2019s final year as mayor. But even in that year, the data show steady declines in each quarter.", "As we explained, Bloomberg is using quarterly numbers, comparing the first quarter of 2012 with the fourth quarter of 2013, which shows a 94% decrease.", "Under Bloomberg\u2019s successor, Bill di Blasio \u2014 who ran for mayor on a platform opposing the stop-and-frisk policy \u2014 the number of such stops continued to decline dramatically, to nearly 46,000 in di Blasio\u2019s first year in office in 2014 and about 11,000 in 2018.", "Bloomberg has attributed the decline that started in 2012 to better training, although he consistently defended the stop-and-frisk program at the time and insisted it reduced violent crime. A day after a federal judge granted class-action status to a lawsuit brought by people who had been stopped, the police department in May 2012 announced new training and supervision designed to address concerns about racial profiling in the application of stop-and-frisk.", "The decline also came amid growing public outrage about the stop-and-frisk program. In April 2013, a survey conducted by Quinnipiac University found 51% of New York City voters disapproved of the stop-and-frisk policy and two-thirds supported a plan to create an inspector general to monitor the police department, a proposal that Bloomberg opposed.", "Perhaps the biggest blow to the stop-and-frisk program came on Aug. 12, 2013, when U.S. District Court Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled that the city police department violated the U.S. Constitution in the way that it carried out its stop-and-frisk program, calling it \u201ca form of racial profiling\u201d of young black and Hispanic men. In her opinion, Scheindlin wrote that she was \u201cnot ordering an end to the practice of stop and frisk\u201d and that the practice could continue if the city complied with court-ordered remedies to make sure that the program did not violate the Constitution.", "The police union and Bloomberg aggressively opposed the lawsuit. In a press conference on the day of the ruling, Bloomberg called the \u201cstop-question-frisk\u201d policy \u201ca vital deterrent\u201d and credited the policy with playing an important part in helping to make New York City \u201cthe safest big city in America,\u201d and for leading to \u201cfewer guns, fewer shootings and fewer homicides.\u201d Bloomberg attacked the judge as biased and vowed to appeal her ruling. (Di Blasio later declined to pursue the appeal.)", "Less than two weeks later, New York\u2019s City Council passed two bills designed to provide oversight of the police department\u2019s stop-and-frisk policy \u2014 one to create an independent inspector general to monitor the police department and another to make it easier for people to sue the police department over racial profiling. Bloomberg vetoed both bills, but the council overrode those vetoes.", "Even after he left office, Bloomberg continued to defend the stop-and-frisk policy. As recently as January 2019, Bloomberg insisted the policy had led to a decline in the city\u2019s murder rate, though the number of murders continued to dip even as the stop-and-frisk policy was phased out.", "In a fact-check article about whether stop-and-frisk reduced crime in New York City, John MacDonald, a professor of criminology and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that academic research concluded \u201cNYPD\u2019s deployment of extra police to high crime neighborhoods contributed far more to the crime reduction than the use of stop, question, and frisk.\u201d", "\u201cThe additional use of stop, question, and frisk made almost no difference,\u201d MacDonald wrote. \u201cThe stops only had a detectable impact on crime when the stops were based on probable cause, and these kinds of stops were very rare.\u201d", "In a speech on Nov. 17, just days before announcing his candidacy, Bloomberg acknowledged that \u201cfar too many innocent people were being stopped,\u201d that it eroded trust from the black and Latino communities and that \u201ccrime did not go back up\u201d when the policy was scaled. He concluded, \u201cWe could and should have acted sooner, and acted faster to cut the stops. I wish we had. And I\u2019m sorry that we didn\u2019t.\u201d", "Bloomberg, Nov. 17: Over time, I\u2019ve come to understand something that I long struggled to admit to myself. I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong. I didn\u2019t understand that back then the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities. I was totally focused on saving lives, but as we know, good intentions aren\u2019t good enough. Now, hindsight is 20/20, but as crime continued to come down as we reduced stops, and has continued to come down during the next administration, to his credit, I now see that we could and should have acted sooner, and acted faster to cut the stops. I wish we had. And I\u2019m sorry that we didn\u2019t.", "Bloomberg said that \u201cin 2012, in my third term, we began putting more safeguards in place. And we began scaling back the numbers of stops.\u201d The numbers corroborate that, but Darius Charney, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the class-action case about the stop-and-frisk policy, said it is more likely the decline in documented stops came because of a shift in the public tide against the policy and the fact that it was facing legal challenge in the courts and push-back from the City Council.", "Bloomberg may portray the change as coming as a result of realizing the error of his ways, Charney said, but that \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem consistent with the way he was behaving publicly.\u201d Bloomberg, he noted, was \u201caggressive and defiant\u201d in defending the policy. He fought the class-action lawsuit and sought to appeal the ruling. He vetoed City Council efforts to rein in the program. And he made numerous statements in support of stop-and-frisk.", "No matter the reason for the decline in stops, though, Bloomberg\u2019s explanation that he \u201cinherited the police practice of stop-and-frisk\u201d and \u201ccut it back by 95%,\u201d may leave the mistaken impression that he cut the program by that amount from what he inherited. In fact, the practice greatly expanded under his watch \u2014 and with his encouragement \u2014 and then contracted from that height during his last two years in office.", "In addition to Trump\u2019s since-deleted tweet forwarding the audio clip and branding Bloomberg a \u201cracist,\u201d Trump also retweeted a post from Van Jones, a CNN commentator and former adviser to President Barack Obama, saying on CNN, \u201cI think Bloomberg has a problem because of what he did. You know, stop-and-frisk \u2026 it was a horror show to be black or Latino in New York City for years, because you were constantly being stopped and harassed by the police whether you were doing anything wrong or not. And Bloomberg defended it until 20 minutes ago.\u201d", "Readers can make of Bloomberg\u2019s comments what they will, but Trump has also long expressed support for stop-and-frisk policies. As recently as Oct. 8, 2018, Trump recommended that Chicago \u201cstrongly consider stop-and-frisk. It works and it was meant for problems like Chicago. It was meant for it.\u201d", "In a radio interview with Geraldo Rivera on Feb. 13 (starting around the 22:10 mark), Trump drew a distinction between the way the policy was applied by Giuliani and Bloomberg. According to Trump, Giuliani used the practice \u201csparingly,\u201d \u201cgingerly\u201d and \u201creally brilliantly.\u201d Bloomberg, he said, \u201ccame in and he multiplied it times 10.\u201d", "\u201cIf you were a black person walking down the street, you were going to be stopped and frisked under Bloomberg,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why they had a revolution in New York, because of what he did.\u201d", "\u201cHe took Rudy\u2019s stop and frisk, which was done very gingerly, very smartly, you know, a very smart job, and he made it so vicious and so violent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd honestly, if you were a black person, you\u2019d be stopped two, three times a day.\u201d", "But when Bloomberg was in office, Trump\u2019s tweets about stop-and-frisk don\u2019t reflect reservations about how the mayor was applying the policy. In July and August 2013, around the time of the class-action lawsuit ruling, Trump tweeted repeatedly in support of the policy and the way it was being applied, and he warned that ending the policy would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d and that crime would rise.", "During the first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton in September 2016, Trump praised stop-and-frisk. He also criticized the judge and her ruling in the New York City case, and he criticized di Blasio for not moving forward with an appeal.", "Trump credited the policy \u2014 which he said was begun by Giuliani and \u201ccontinued on by Mayor Bloomberg\u201d \u2014 for bringing New York\u2019s crime rate \u201cway down.\u201d", "When Clinton noted that crime, including murder, continued to drop, even as di Blasio phased out stop-and-frisk, Trump said Clinton was \u201cwrong.\u201d At the time, we wrote that both were right, because murders went down in di Blasio\u2019s first year in office, but then ticked back up in 2015. In the ensuing two years, however, the number of murders again dropped. The number of murders in New York City in 2017, 2018 and 2019 were all lower than the best year under Bloomberg, and well below the numbers under Giuliani.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
