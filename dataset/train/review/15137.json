For example, a representative Facebook post asserted:", "As it turns out, these rumors are not driven by reality but by a company with a history of politically charged health misinformation selling a bogus \u201cnatural health\u201d supplement. The claims made on Facebook mirror the claims made by an entity that calls itself the \u201cInstitute for Natural Healing\u201d in a thinly sourced advertisement:", "Let me describe how dire the current situation is\u2014because the Government is staying tight-lipped. It\u2019s known as the \u201cMexican Blood Flu\u201d or its scientific name\u2026 XDR-T. And you wouldn\u2019t wish the symptoms (internal bleeding, coughing up blood, seizures and even suffocation) on your worst enemy.", "For years it was seen as a \u201cthird world problem,\u201d killing scores of people in the world\u2019s poorest countries\u2026 And a major outbreak within the U.S. was considered unthinkable. But here\u2019s the horrifying truth they don\u2019t want you to know\u2026 a U.S. outbreak has already begun. And officials have no idea how to contain it.", "The first case was discovered in McAllen, Texas near the Mexican border. An illegal alien was detained by the U.S. Border Patrol suffering from a scorching fever and coughing up blood.", "The Institute for Natural Healing is a subsidiary of a publishing company known as Agora, Inc., which has a lengthy history of using misleading tactics and politically charged language to get people to purchase supplements, ebooks, or stock tips. Snopes has previously debunked Agora content that suggested Hillary Clinton was hiding a cure for cancer, and an Agora advertisement for a 74-dollar eBook explaining how to protect yourself from an alleged \u201cKlebsi plague\u201d set to ravage America.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), MDR-TB \u201cis resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF), while XDR-TB is \u201cresistant to INH and RIF, any fluoroquinolone, and at least three of the injectable second-line anti-TB drugs.\u201d Agora often uses made-up names for commonly known conditions or \u201ccures\u201d to make it harder for potential buyers of supplements or ebooks to research them on their own.", "\u201cMexican blood flu\u201d is another made-up name, and it\u2019s also a poorly chosen one from a truth standpoint. The McAllen, Texas, incident referenced in the Institute for Natural Healing's advertisement took place in 2013 and concerned a Nepalese man who had traveled through South Asia, Brazil, and Mexico before crossing illegally into Texas, as reported by the Wall Street Journal:", "In medical isolation in South Texas, 100 miles or so from Mexico's border, is a man who embodies one of U.S. health officials' greatest worries: He is the first person to cross and be held in detention while infected with one of the most severe types of drug-resistant tuberculosis known today ...", "The Nepalese man detained at the U.S. border carries a particularly deadly strain\u2014XDR, \"extensively drug-resistant\" TB. His TB is resistant to at least eight of the 15 or so standard drugs, according to a U.S. government description of the case reviewed by the Journal. His XDR strain has been seen only once before in the U.S., in another patient of Nepalese origin, according to the government description.", "The assertion that \u201ca U.S. outbreak has already begun\u201d is similarly incorrect: following the McCarren incident, the United States reported zero XDR-TB cases in 2014 and 2015. In 2016, one case was reported in the entire United States. In 2017, the most recent year for which CDC data is available, two cases were reported.
