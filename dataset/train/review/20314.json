["By Brooks Jackson", "Posted on February 14, 2018", "White House press aides are claiming President Donald Trump\u2019s budget contains trillions in \u201cdeficit reduction,\u201d when it\u00a0actually calls for larger deficits for the next several years and would add $7 trillion to the national debt over 10 years.", "Let\u2019s start with what the president actually proposed. Page 117 of the White House budget released Feb. 12 contains the \u201cBudget Totals\u201d summary, including the proposed annual deficits (which we have highlighted). It shows a deficit growing from $665 billion last fiscal year to $873 billion in the current fiscal year (which began Oct. 1), and from there to $984 billion next fiscal year, and $987 billion the year after. It shows a total of just under $7.1 trillion in cumulative annual deficits over 10 years.", "Many news accounts focused on that red ink. The New York Times said the Trump budget\u2019s \u201cballooning federal deficit \u2026 illustrates how far Republicans have strayed from their longtime embrace of balanced budgets.\u201d The Los Angeles Times said the budget \u201cforecasts a decade of mounting debt.\u201d The Washington Post said the budget acknowledged that Trump\u2019s tax cut and his spending increases \u201care putting severe pressure on the government\u2019s debt.\u201d", "Pushing back against such coverage, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in her briefing Feb. 13: \u201c[T]his budget reduced the deficit by $3 trillion, which is one of the largest in history.\u201d\u00a0Her deputy,\u00a0Raj Shah, told Fox News that day that Trump\u2019s budget \u201chas serious deficit reduction.\u201d He said, \u201cIt has over $3 trillion in deficit reduction, which is the largest deficit reduction of a budget, in terms of a 10-year outlay, that we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d", "Sanders and Shah were referring to a collection of proposed \u201cmajor savings and reforms\u201d that are part of Trump\u2019s proposed budget, including proposed cuts in food-stamp benefits and cuts in \u201cwasteful spending\u201d under Medicare. The Office of Management and Budget projects that these would \u2014 if enacted \u2014 reduce federal spending by $3.6 trillion over 10 years, below what would occur under current law. Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, briefing reporters Feb. 12, said this was \u201cthe second largest proposed reduction in spending ever, second only to last year\u2019s budget.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that if those proposed \u201csavings\u201d are not enacted, future deficits would be even larger than projected in the Trump budget document.\u00a0But\u00a0it\u2019s misleading \u2014 if not downright dishonest \u2014 to speak of \u201cdeficit reduction\u201d in a budget that calls for growing deficits for years before any reduction occurs. Under the Trump budget, deficits wouldn\u2019t fall below last year\u2019s level until 2025.", "And make no mistake, that\u2019s an optimistic view. Other budget experts predict much larger shortfalls. The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated Feb. 9 that the deficit for fiscal year 2019 would hit nearly $1.2 trillion as a result of the Trump tax cut and the Bipartisan Budget Act that Trump signed that day, ending a brief government shutdown.", "The Trump budget projects annual deficits won\u2019t quite hit $1 trillion, and will begin declining in fiscal year 2021. That is, if economic growth picks up and hits 3 percent or better for the next seven years, as the budget assumes, and if all of Trump\u2019s \u201csavings and reforms\u201d are enacted.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
