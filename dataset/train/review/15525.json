In November, the winner will face independent challenger Angela Nicole Walker, who is running as a Socialist candidate.", "In a July 27, 2014 interview on Upfront with Mike Gousha, which airs on WISN-TV, Clarke declared: \"I\u2019ve either balanced every budget or we\u2019ve turned back a surplus.\"", "A great talking point.", "But is Clarke right?", "To be sure, the county is required to balance the overall budget every year. So, to evaluate Clarke\u2019s claim, we are looking at what happened specifically within the Office of the Sheriff's budget. And we\u2019re looking at the final numbers for the year, which reflect actual spending.", "According to County Comptroller Scott Manske, it is expected that each department lives within the amount it is allocated. Most of the money comes from the property tax levy, though there are other sources of revenue, such as fees and grants.", "Clarke did not respond to our request for backup, so we turned to County Auditor Jerome Heer.

A $942,666 difference between budgeted and actual revenues contributed to the deficit for that year.", "2013: The auditor\u2019s office has yet to determine final surplus and deficit figures because year-end adjustments are still \"firming up,\" Heer said.", "In any case, Heer said he believes the office's final deficit will be between $162,000 and $217,000.", "Another factor to consider is Clarke\u2019s temporary control over the House of Correction, inheriting a $5 million deficit on overtime pay when he took it over in January 2009.
