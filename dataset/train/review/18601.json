You\u2019d never guess that from the tone of an ad posted to Craigslist in Tulsa with the title: \"Actors needed June 20.\"", "\"Excited and enthusiastic MINORITY actors and actresses needed to hold signs at event in Tulsa,\" reads the ad that was shared on Facebook. \"Send headshot/resume for early consideration. *This may be applied towards community service if necessary (in lieu of payment).\"", "The ad doesn\u2019t mention Trump, but it includes a map marking the BOK Center in Tulsa, where the rally will be held.", "\"Trump is beneath contempt,\" the Facebook post says.", "It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The New York Daily News reported the phone number connected to the listing belonged to a recent high school graduate who told a local TV station that he wasn\u2019t behind the ad.", "In 2018, yet another ad sought paid attendees for a Trump rally in Pennsylvania. Snopes then reported that the ad wasn\u2019t affiliated with Trump but with \"a man who appeared to have connections to left-leaning activist groups.\"", "The latest Craigslist ad seems to follow the blueprint of its forefathers: unaffiliated with the Trump campaign and designed to make it seem like he\u2019s soliciting people of color to publicly support him in exchange for a paycheck.
