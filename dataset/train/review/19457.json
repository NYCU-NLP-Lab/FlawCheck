["Union Home Minister Amit Shah recently spoke at a public function, where he claimed that former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh went on more foreign trips than PM Narendra Modi did, in five years.", "As is evident from the above video posted on BJP\u2019s YouTube channel, Mr Shah said that when the numbers were compared for the foreign visits of the two Prime Ministers, it emerged that in five years, PM Narendra Modi had travelled abroad less than his predecessor.", "His exact words, which can be heard from 0:07 minutes, are, \u201c\u0905\u092d\u0940 \u0905\u092d\u0940 \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u0915\u0947 \u090f\u0915 \u0928\u0947\u0924\u093e \u092c\u094b\u0932\u0924\u0947 \u0925\u0947 , \u0915\u093f \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940\u091c\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u0947\u0936\u094b \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0918\u0941\u092e\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 , \u092e\u0948\u0902\u0928\u0947 \u092c\u094b\u0932\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0902\u091a \u0915\u0930\u093e , \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u0928\u092e\u094b\u0939\u0928\u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0947 5 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u0914\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940\u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0947 5 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u095b\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u094c\u0928 \u0917\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0916\u094b \u092d\u093e\u0908, \u0924\u094b \u092e\u093e\u0932\u0942\u092e \u092a\u095c\u093e \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940\u091c\u0940 \u0915\u092e \u0917\u090f \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0914\u0930 \u092e\u0928\u092e\u094b\u0939\u0928 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939 \u095b\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e \u0917\u090f \u0939\u0948\u0902\u0964 \u0924\u094b \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092e\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u0935\u093e\u0932 \u0909\u0920\u093e \u0915\u093f \u0926\u0940\u0916\u0924\u093e \u0924\u094b \u0910\u0938\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u093f \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940\u091c\u0940 \u095b\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e \u0917\u090f \u0939\u0948\u0902 , \u0910\u0938\u093e \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0939\u0941\u0906 ?\u201d", "Translation: Just now a Congress leader said that Modiji keeps travelling abroad, so I said lets probe this, in 5 years of Manmohanji\u2019s rule and 5 years of Modiji\u2019s rule, who went abroad more, then we found out that Manmohan Singh had had more foreign trips than Modiji. So I pondered, why is it so that it seems Modiji has travelled abroad far more frequently?", "Amit Shah then stressed that PM Modi\u2019s international visits garnered much attention owing to his popularity, as opposed to Dr Singh\u2019s supposedly nondescript tours abroad. Congress and BJP have sparred over PM Modi\u2019s foreign visits on several occasions. The most recent instance is the Congress party\u2019s dig at the Prime Minister on World Tourism Day (September 27), tweeting a collage of his photographs clicked before the PM boarded his plane.", "Amit Shah\u2019s claim is, simply put, false. The numbers do not tally with the Home Minister\u2019s narrative. Information about international visits undertaken by the Prime Minister is readily available on the website of the PMO. Alt News compared three sets of numbers.", "1. Total number of international visits", "2. Number of countries visited", "3. Number of days spent abroad as part of these visits", "The data states that from 2014, after PM Modi assumed office, till the end of his first term in 2019, the Prime Minister had visited abroad 49 times. PM Modi\u2019s first international visit was to Bhutan in June 2014. His last international visit in his first term was to South Korea in February 2019.", "On the other hand, former PM Manmohan Singh had 35 foreign trips in his first term (2004-2009), 14 fewer than PM Narendra Modi. This information is available in the PMO archives. Manmohan Singh\u2019s first foreign visit as Prime Minister was to Thailand in July 2004. His final international visit in his first term was to the UK for the G-20 summit, in March-April 2009. If we consider Dr Singh\u2019s second term (2009-2014), the number of visits stood at 38, a marginal increase from the previous term.", "In the period from 2004 to 2009, former PM Dr Manmohan Singh, in the course of his 35 foreign trips, had visited 28 countries. Dr Singh, in his second term (2009-2014), visited 35 nations, taking his overall tally to 63 countries over two terms and ten years. If multiple visits are counted, this number stands at 96. In contrast, PM Modi has visited 59 countries from 2014 to 2019 in the course of his 49 international trips. Here too, Narendra Modi outscores Dr Manmohan Singh, whether we consider the first or the second term for the latter.", "From 2004 to 2009, Dr Manmohan Singh spent 147 days abroad during his 35 international visits. The figure stood slightly higher from 2009 to 2014, at 158 days. Here too, PM Modi takes the lead in numbers, having spent 186 days out of India from 2014 to 2019. This information too is available on the website of PMO and PMO Archives.\u2019", "The three sets of numbers are presented in a tabular format below.", "Source: PMO, PMO Archives", "In conclusion, it may be stated that Home Minister Amit Shah\u2019s claim is false. A perusal of the publicly available information reveals that PM Narendra Modi had more foreign visits in the first term than former PM Dr Manmohan Singh. PM Modi also visited more countries and spent more number of days abroad as compared to the former PM. Earlier in 2017, Amit Shah had stated something similar\u2013 PM Modi had visited fewer nations than Dr Singh in his three years (then) as Prime Minister. This statement was fact-checked by The Hindu, which found it to be untrue.", "Donate Now", "Arjun Sidharth is a writer with Alt News.
