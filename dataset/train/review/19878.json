["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "There\u2019s a meaty political campaign going on across the nation with slimy accusations being hurled -- and it has nothing to do with the race for the White House.\n\nIt began in earnest April 2, when the governor and lieutenant governor of Iowa sent letters to their colleagues in other states to fight against what they said are media misperceptions about a form of ground beef maliciously maligned as \"pink slime.\"\n\nGeorgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black quickly joined the effort to defend this form of beef, holding a news conference two days afterward.\n\n\"Lean, finely textured beef is the proper name, and it is a safe, widely used product,\" Black told reporters.\n\nOfficials in Kansas and Texas have begun their own public relations campaigns in support of the beef that is a cash cow, pardon the pun, in those states. So, too, has U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor. Proponents say beef prices would rise with less meat on the market.\n\nAlthough the Department of Agriculture maintains the meat is safe, the federal agency announced in March that it would give schools more beef choices in the wake of public concerns about children eating \"pink slime.\" McDonald\u2019s and some major grocery stores have said they will no longer sell the meat. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver last year showed how the meat is made to horrify a studio audience.\n\n\"Everything about this process is about no respect for food or people or children,\" he said.\n\nSo is it really safe?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s explain how it is made. The meat is taken from slaughterhouse trimmings with high fat content that are more susceptible to contamination because the meat is often close to the hide, which is highly exposed to fecal matter. The trimmings are warmed to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit \u00a0in equipment that looks like a large, high-speed mixing bowl that spins these trimmings to separate meat from the fat that has been liquefied. Ammonium hydroxide is mixed in to destroy bacteria and E. coli that could make someone ill if a raw product is not cooked thoroughly. It is then mixed with regular ground beef. The federal government has approved the practice for slightly more than a decade.\n\nThe use of this meat gained national attention in recent months when a blogger who writes about kids\u2019 food began an online petition to urge federal officials to remove it from school cafeterias.\n\nIt may sound disgusting to know that beef contains ammonia, but the companies that produce the beef and experts say ammonia hydroxide is used in other foods such as cheese and chocolate to reduce acidity and kill bacteria.\n\nThe beef is produced by a handful of companies nationwide. Federal officials inspect the process daily.\n\nBecause this type of beef is not mentioned in packaging, there\u2019s been little discussion about it or its safety. The New York Times, however, reported in late 2009 that E. coli was detected three times and salmonella 48 times, including back-to-back incidents in August in which two 27,000-pound batches were found to be contaminated. The meat in question, produced by the nation\u2019s largest distributor of the product, Beef Products Inc., was caught before reaching lunchroom trays. BPI told the Times it found E. coli in what was described as a low 0.06 percent of samples that year.\n\nThe Times also reported that from 2005 to 2009, BPI had a rate of 36 positive results for salmonella per 1,000 tests, compared with a rate of nine positive results per 1,000 tests for the other suppliers, according to statistics from the program. BPI said its testing regime was more likely to detect contamination.\n\nSome federal officials were concerned that the beef hadn\u2019t been studied enough before it was approved. The Times reported that one federal microbiologist, Gerald Zirnstein, called the processed beef \"pink slime\" in a 2002 email to colleagues.\n\nA University of Arkansas student did a study of the beef last year. The student, Courtney Moon, found the beef held up better than regular ground beef.\n\n\"I was surprised,\" Jason Apple, a meat science professor at the school, said in a news release sent by the university. \"I just assumed the lean beef trim would negatively impact the quality of the burgers, but it actually made them better in this study.\"\n\nResearchers at other colleges have come forward in recent days offering similar conclusions.\n\nWe were curious whether this beef was sold in other parts of the globe. A Canadian government health spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that the country does not allow ammonia to be used in ground beef during production nor does it allow such food to be sold there. Ammonium hydroxide would be considered a food additive and require a safety evaluation, the official said.\n\n\"Only if a safety evaluation identified no safety concerns would the requested use be considered for approval,\" Olivia Caron, a media relations official for Health Canada, said via email.\n\nInterestingly, Caron used \"pink slime\" in the subject line of her email.\n\nSeveral food safety experts we interviewed were well-versed on the beef treating process and didn\u2019t have what one of them called \"the ick factor\" that many Americans are feeling about it. For the most part, they consider it safe to eat. The main problem, they said, was the lack of information about the beef provided by manufacturers and the federal government, particularly at a time when Americans want fewer chemicals and preservatives in their food.\n\n\"Right now, we\u2019re in a situation where you don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s why people are so infuriated,\" said Michael Batz, executive director of the Food Safety Research Consortium. \"The lack of disclosure and the lack of transparency is very troubling.\"\n\nThe USDA recently gave meat processors and supermarkets the option to put labels on ground beef packages identifying it as \"lean finely textured beef.\"\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nIt is correct that the meat is called lean, finely textured beef and it has been widely used in fast-food restaurants and school cafeterias, and is sold in stores. But is it safe?\n\nThe federal government says it\u2019s safe. So do some state officials. Some research has concluded it is safe. Still, there are reasons for concern, such as those listed in the 2009 New York Times report. We also find it interesting that our neighbor to the north, Canada, has not permitted the beef to be sold there.\n\nWith those caveats, we rate Black\u2019s entire statement that the beef is safe as Mostly True.", "Georgia Agriculture Department news release, April 4, 2012", "ABC News, \"Where You Can Get \u2018Pink Slime,\u2019 \" March 9, 2012", "Beef Magazine fact sheet,", "Beef Products Inc. information about ammonia hydroxide", "Email from Olivia Caron, spokeswoman, Health Canada, April 5, 2012\n\nFood Safety News, \"What\u2019s Wrong With Pink Slime,\" March 12, 2012", "Telephone interview with Chris Waldrop, director, Food Policy Institute, April 4, 2012\n\nTelephone interview with Michael Batz, executive director, Food Safety Research Consortium, April 4, 2012\n\nTelephone interview with Mike Doyle, director, University of Georgia Center for Food Safety, April 5, 2012\n\nThe New York Times, \"Safety of Beef Processing Method is Questioned,\" Dec. 30, 2009", "The New York Times, \"The Pink Menace\" April 3, 2012", "University of Arkansas news release on lean, finely textured beef, March 21, 2012", "USDA blog, \"Setting the Record Straight on Beef,\" March 22, 2012", "USDA news release on school lunch choices, March 15, 2012", "YouTube video, \"Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution: Pink Slime - 70% of America's Beef is Treated with Ammonia,\" April 12, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
