I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point. And by the way, I\u2019m hoping for it. Because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy. So please, bring on the recession. Sorry if that hurts people, but it\u2019s either root for a recession or you lose your democracy.", "On one level, Maher's remarks do ring \"cruel and callous\" (as CNN commentator Dean Obeidallah put it), especially coming from a wealthy entertainer who, unlike most Americans, has the resources to shield himself from a serious economic downturn.", "But it's an oversimplification to claim that Maher is rooting for a recession just because he hates Trump, or wants to see him take the blame for Americans' suffering. For one thing, Maher clearly thinks the recession he is prepared to root for is inevitable (\"I feel like the bottom has to fall out,\" he said). For another, he believes Trump's overall agenda threatens democracy itself (\"... it's either root for a recession or you lose your democracy\").", "Agree with him or not, Maher was making a larger point not dissimilar to the one conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh made in 2009 when he said \"I hope Obama fails.\"", "Never mind that one of Obama's first tasks as president would be trying to repair the already-damaged economy and prevent the United States from sinking deeper into recession. Like Maher's, Limbaugh's overriding concern was defeating the new president's overall agenda, which \u2014 again like Maher \u2014 he characterized as a threat to the country.", "\"I know what his politics are,\" Limbaugh said. \"I know what his plans are, as he has stated them.
