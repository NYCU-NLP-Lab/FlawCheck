["\u201cTrump now leads in Pennsylvania by 700,000 votes with 74% cast. It is a lie that it is too close to call. That is cheating,\u201d Giuliani tweeted just before 4:00 am Washington, DC time (0900 GMT) on November 4, 2020.", "His comments, shared more than 20,000 times, were also posted by others on Facebook including here and here, as well as on Instagram here.", "At 1:02 pm, about nine hours after Giuliani\u2019s initial tweet, state data showed Trump with 2,939,656 votes while Biden had 2,493,307. A difference of 446,349, far lower than the figure which Giuliani had initially cited.", "Shortly after AFP accessed the above data Giuliani inaccurately tweeted \u201c@realDonaldTrump up by 550,000 with 75% counted.\u201d Giuliani alleged \u201cmassive cheating\u201d and said he was headed to Philadelphia with his legal team.", "State data accessed at 1:07 pm by AFP showed that officials had counted almost 57 percent of the nearly 2.6 million mail-in ballots that had been cast and entered into the system as of November 3. That still left 1,120,321 to be tallied.", "The latest data can be found here through a dashboard which Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar referred to at a press conference with Governor Tom Wolf on the morning of November 4.", "Still more ballots will be arriving and counted later, under a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which Republicans unsuccessfully sought to have reviewed by the Supreme Court of the United States before the election.", "Ballots postmarked on or before Election Day and received in the state up until 5:00 pm on November 6 will still be valid, under that ruling.", "\u201cBallots can be received and counted all the way up until Friday,\u201d state Attorney General Josh Shapiro said, before the Trump campaign announced a lawsuit later on November 4 in a bid to halt the count.", "A \u201clarge fraction\u201d of those votes still to be counted were cast by registered Democrats, Michael Hagen, an associate professor of political science at Temple University in Philadelphia, told AFP by email.", "There are enough, he said, \u201cthat it might be possible for Biden to catch and pass Trump\u2019s vote total. That\u2019s what is creating the uncertainty that falls under the general heading of \u2018Too close to call.\u2019\u201d", "Two days later on November 6 Biden did overtake Trump, according to unofficial statewide returns as counting continued.", "It is not only Democratic strongholds that are still counting, either, said Hagen.", "\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing suggests that election officials all over the state are working very hard to count all the votes that have arrived as soon as possible,\u201d said Hagen, who specializes in US politics and elections.", "State officials repeatedly stressed the integrity of their counting process.", "\u201cThe most important thing is that we have accurate results,\u201d Wolf told the morning press conference, \u201ceven if that takes a little longer than we're used to.\u201d", "Americans turned to mail-in ballots in unprecedented numbers for this election as a safer alternative to heading to polling stations during the pandemic.
