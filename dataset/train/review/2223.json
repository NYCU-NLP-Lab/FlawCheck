Crist declined, saying he\u2019d rather save the time for a question from a college student. Jolly used the time to bring up Crist\u2019s proposal to restore chain gangs to Florida while Crist served as a Republican in the state Senate in the 1990s.", "Jolly painted a vivid picture of Crist traveling to Alabama in 1995 with Florida\u2019s first African-American corrections secretary to inspect a chain gang in operation.", "\"You stood there, over three African-American prisoners in, chains, on their knees on the side of the road. Saying that it was a great sight,\" Jolly said to Crist.", "Jolly closed by asking, \"Did you ever hesitate, or did you just see political opportunity in that moment to be a Republican tough on crime?\"", "Crist said \"it was beneath\" Jolly to suggest it had something to do with race, and the state needed to be tough given how bad violent crime was in Florida at the time.", "\"In the mid 1990s, in our state, we were No. 1 in violent crime in America,\" \u00a0Crist said.", "\"The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds,\" Crist added.", "In a separate fact-check, we examined Jolly\u2019s story about Crist\u2019s visit to Alabama.
