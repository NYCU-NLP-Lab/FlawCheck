There were about 3,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. when Clarke tweeted, compared to an estimated 36 million to 51 million flu illnesses this season.", "Knowledge and research \u2014 Scientists know much more about the flu, such as details on how it is transmitted, the range of symptoms and treatment. Such details on coronavirus remain a point of debate.", "All this to say, the CDC and other health officials have made it clear coronavirus presents a litany of risks the standard flu does not.

Treatment approaches are not as well established.
