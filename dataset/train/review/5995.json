["About this rating", "In June 2017, in the wake of allegations that California basketball team the Golden State Warriors refused to visit the White House after winning the NBA championship, a story appeared to show an angry response from White House advisor Kellyanne Conway.", "According to USPOLN.com, Conway told \"WYSP radio\" that the Warriors' decision not to meet with President Donald Trump was \"a disrespectful act,\" and one that carries legal implications:", "One could almost say it\u2019s a rule. As a matter of fact, you know something? I\u2019m just going to go out there and say it: it\u2019s a law. And though I know it\u2019s not really a law, I\u2019m going to make sure to make it one. Because, it\u2019s not about who the president is; the guy\u2019s in there only temporarily. It\u2019s about the structure, the space, the history within it and, ultimately, the honor of being inside a place where so many decisions took place; decisions that shaped the world as we know it. Ugh, I\u2019m getting goosebumps just thinking about it. I can\u2019t even begin to describe how I felt when I visited it for the first time. The Warriors don\u2019t realize it yet, but they\u2019re looking at this all wrong. That\u2019s exactly why I plan to do everything in my power to make sure Golden State is prohibited from winning the championship, formally speaking, unless they agree to come and celebrate in the White House.", "The interview is completely fictional.

Head coach Steve Kerr \u2014 who has called Trump a \"blowhard\" \u2014 reiterated that statement in a 21 June 2017 interview with an actual podcast host, journalist Tim Kawakami:", "The biggest thing for me is it\u2019s about the players. This is a visit that\u2019s about the team. We have not met about it because we haven\u2019t been invited.", "But I would want to make sure the players gave this really a lot of thought. Everybody knows I\u2019ve been a very outspoken critic of Trump\u2019s and as a result maybe we won\u2019t get the invitation.", "I do think it is very important to consider a potential invitation because I think it could have really positive ramifications if we did go. And it\u2019s a different way to look at it.", "While Kerr has not ruled out turning down a potential invitation, star guard Stephen Curry has said that he would do so.
