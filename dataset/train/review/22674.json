["About this rating", "On 8 December 2016, the boycott hashtag #DumpStarWars was widely circulated on social media. This hashtag trended for a number of reasons, including at least one rumor that an anti-Trump scene had been added to the film Star Wars: Rogue One", "This claim could be traced to Jack Posobiec, the self-described special projects director of \"Citizens for Trump,\" who generated the (completely false) rumor that the new Star Wars film was altered to add an anti-Trump scene:", "Posobiec either pulled this rumor out of thin air, or her misinterpreted two unconnected events: scheduled reshoots on the film and \"controversial\" tweets from two of the film's writers.", "Star Wars: Rogue One did undergo some reshoots not long before its official release. This additional last-minute work is common for a major studio film and had nothing to do with politics. Director Gareth Edwards explained the reason in an interview with the Los Angeles Times:", "We\u2019d always planned to do a pickup shoot but we needed a lot of time to figure out all this material and get the best out of it. So that pushed the entire schedule in a big way. Then Disney saw the film and reacted really well and they said, \u201cWhatever you need, we\u2019re going to support you.\u201d Our visual-effects shot count went from 600 to nearly 1,700, so suddenly we could do absolutely anything we wanted. To design 1,000 visual effects shots should take a year, so it was all hands to the pump and we never came up for air really until about a week ago.", "It would be beautiful if you write a story, you shoot exactly that, you edit it and it\u2019s a hit. But art \u2014 or good art \u2014 doesn\u2019t work like that. It\u2019s a process, and you experiment and react and improve. And if I make more films, which I hope to, I want to make them like that as well, where it\u2019s organic and it\u2019s not predetermined.", "Screenwriters for the film did make some political comments on their Twitter feeds:", "Writers for the film also upset members of the \"alt-right\" when they said that the Empire was a \"white supremacist organization\" \u00a0that was \"opposed by a multicultural group led by brave women.\"", "While the screenwriters' statements on social media were offered as reasons for a Star Wars boycott, claims that the writers added a specific \"anti-Trump\" message to the film during reshoots were completely unfounded. A representative for Disney told The Wrap that the rumor was completely untrue, and Weitz called Prosbiec out for spreading lies about the film:", "When Esquire reached out to Posobiec, he admitted that he hadn't even seen the film: \"I haven't seen the movie yet, but if the writers are so virulently anti-Trump, I would be surprised to not find that bias embedded in the film.\"", "Nickalls, Sammy. \u00a0 \"Now Trump Supporters Are Boycotting Star Wars Based on No Evidence.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Esquire. \u00a0 8 December 2016.", "Owen, Phil. \u00a0 \"#DumpStarWars: No, \u2018Rogue One\u2019 Writers Did Not Change Ending to Be About Trump.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Wrap. \u00a0 8 December 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
