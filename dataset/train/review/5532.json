Trump hasn\u2019t said he would end Social Security payments, but he has made comments that many have interpreted as him wanting to eliminate the payroll tax entirely.", "On Aug. 8, Trump issued a memo that directed the Treasury secretary to defer the withholding of the payroll tax on wages paid between Sept. 1 and Dec. 31.
