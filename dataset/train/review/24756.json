That would not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses who would still have to ask the Cabinet to restore their rights, a process which is currently slow and cumbersome.", "In Florida, about 1.7 million felons have lost their right to vote.", "Bee portrayed some of those felonies as not so serious.", "\"In Florida felonies can be things like buying weed, tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap,\" Bee said. \"So basically spring break.\"", "Bee\u2019s big point: Felons in Florida aren\u2019t just axe murderers.", "We will fact-check if the crimes Bee cited are felonies.
