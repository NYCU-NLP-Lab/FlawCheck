Jeff Flake as \"weak on crime & border!\" on Twitter. A pro-Trump super PAC is spending $20,000 on Ward, who has cribbed the president\u2019s style in her campaign to \"make Arizona great again.\" The physician served two terms in the Arizona state Senate and lost a 2016 challenge for Sen. John McCain\u2019s seat.", "The McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund is stepping up for Flake with a 77-second video that knocked Ward as \"Chemtrail Kelli\" four times.", "\"Ward wasted your tax dollars for a town hall on chemtrail conspiracy theories,\" the attack ad posted Aug. 22, 2017, says. \"Sponsoring chemtrail legislation? \u2018I\u2019m open, I introduce legislation for constituents all the time.\u2019 About another chemtrail town hall? \u2018I\u2019ll do it again.

But the ad ignores her record of saying she does not believe in the theory.", "In the conspiracy world, chemtrails are chemical or biological agents dispersed by aircrafts as part of a government plot to control the weather and human behavior. But scientists generally agree that the cloud-like formations that linger in an aircraft\u2019s trail are basically condensation marks.", "In June 2014, Ward invited constituents of her state Senate district to a small, informational seminar on chemtrails by two Arizona Department of Environmental Quality staffers in Kingman, Ariz. Some audience members then provided testimony and asked questions of the staffers and Ward.", "\"The town hall was conducted in response to constituent concerns, and experts were brought in to directly refute those concerns,\" Ward\u2019s spokeswoman Jennifer Lawrence said.", "The ad plucked quotes that made Ward seem like a conspiracy theorist herself. The full quote from her closing remarks at the town hall about being \"open\" to sponsoring legislation to investigate chemtrails is more nuanced.", "\"With this particular issue I think it\u2019s going to be very difficult because, unless you get away from the chemtrail issue that you all are so passionate about, talking about our environmental quality I think can go further in terms of making sure that there aren\u2019t any public health issues that are out there with our water, our soil, or our air,\" Ward said.", "Ward has repeatedly said she doesn\u2019t subscribe to this belief.", "\"I don\u2019t believe in the chemtrail theory,\" she told Politico in 2015.", "She explained in a 2016 radio interview that she considers it her duty as an elected official to respond to her constituents.", "The attack ad singled out a snippet of the interview of Ward.\u00a0\"About another chemtrail town hall?\" the video asks. \"I\u2019ll do it again. Of course I\u2019ll do it again.\"", "Again, a later part of the interview talks about the need to listen to constituents.", "\"People say, well, would you do it again? Of course I'll do it again because that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do when you\u2019re elected,\" Ward said. \"You\u2019re supposed to listen to the people and you\u2019re supposed to get them the information that they need to feel confident that they live in a safe environment.\"", "A Senate Leadership Fund ad said Ward\u00a0hosted a town hall on chemtrails and was willing to sponsor legislation on it.", "Calling Ward \"Chemtrail Kelli\" repeatedly and saying she has her \"head in the clouds with crazy ideas\" wrongly suggests she believes in the conspiracy theory.", "Ward did host a town hall on chemtrails, but she has not expressed belief in chemtrails.
