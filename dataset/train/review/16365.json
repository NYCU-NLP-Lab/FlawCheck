["About this rating", "On 28 August 2018, the President of the United States used Twitter to accuse the search engine Google of rigging its results in order to highlight the \"left-wing fake news media\" while shunning conservative outlets and favorable reporting about himself:", "....results on \u201cTrump News\u201d are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous.

Finally, the article included two alleged quotes from Google's (fictional) CFO, each of which was accompanied by a hyperlink. While genuine news sites would have used these links to direct readers back to an authoritative source for the quotes, the links included in this junk news directed readers to a \"surprise\" GIF and an article about incestual family trees:", "Unsurprisingly, neither of those \"source\" links contained a quote from Google's CFO.", "Google's CFO did not admit that the search engine was rigging results against Donald Trump. In fact, a genuine statement from Riva Sciuto, a spokesperson for the company, explained that Google's search results are not bent to any political ideology:", "\u201cWhen users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds,\" said Riva Sciuto, a Google spokesperson.", "\"Search is not used to set a political agenda, and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology,\" Sciuto said. \"We continually work to improve Google Search, and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.\"", "Gilmer, Marcus. \u00a0 \"Trump's Anti-Google Tweets Show That He Doesn't Know How the Internet Works.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Mashable. \u00a0 28 August 2018.", "Fritze, John. \u00a0 \"Trump Aide Says President Weighing Regulations on Google Search Engine That He Considers 'Rigged.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 USA Today. \u00a0 28 August 2018.", "Farrow, Janet. \u00a0 \"Google Exec Admits They Rig Search Results Against Trump.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Trumpbetrayed.us. \u00a0 28 August 2018.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
