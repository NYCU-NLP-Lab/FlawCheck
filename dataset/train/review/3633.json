Other fact-checkers have found another post misidentifying a woman wearing a pink crocheted hat during the 2017 Women\u2019s March on Washington as Karlan. Now a Dec. 5 Facebook post claims to show a photo of \"Pamela Karlan when Hillary lost.\"", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But the person in the image is actually Janna DeVylder, who was photographed at an election party in Australia that year.", "The Des Moines Register reported in January 2017 that DeVylder grew up in Iowa and was living and working in Sydney when Clinton lost to Trump. She had voted absentee for Clinton. The picture of her watching election results quickly became a meme, and she was derided online as the \"poster child for the mentally insane Hillary snowflakes.\"", "We rate this Facebook post False.", "Facebook post, Dec. 5, 2019", "PolitiFact, No, viral photo of woman on costume is not law professor Pamela Karlan, Dec. 13, 2019", "AP News, Photo does not show professor who testified in impeachment hearing, Dec. 6, 2019", "FactCheck.org, Viral photos don\u2019t show impeachment expert, Dec. 11, 2019", "News.com.au, The \u2018crying\u2019 Hillary supporter who became a meme, Jan. 16, 2017", "The Des Moines Register, How a \u2018crying liberal\u2019 became global meme for those gloating over Trump win, Jan. 15, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
