["The disturbing clip shows a body falling from the top of a building. The man filming the scene sounds shocked and is heard\u00a0invoking Jesus\u2019s name in English. The camera follows the fall all the way to the ground and captures the sound of screams coming from the building.", "Posts on Facebook (archived here, here, here, and here) claim that the video and subsequent screenshots show the \u201csuicide of a Cameroonian\u201d in Sydney. They allege that\u00a0the victim --\u00a0described as an engineer called Martin Kenfack --\u00a0jumped after discovering that his wife was \u201cpregnant\u201d with \u201ctwins\u201d from an extramarital affair.", "The\u00a0images, some accompanied by a photo of the supposed victim, have been shared on Facebook more than 150 times and generated hundreds of comments since January 31, 2021.", "Similar posts also circulated in French (here, here and here) and were shared more than 1,700 times in total. AFP Fact Check debunked these\u00a0here.", "However, the claim is false. The video was not filmed in Sydney, but Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, in\u00a0January 2021.", "By running a reverse image search on Google using a screenshot from the video, AFP Fact Check found articles from local media (here, here and here) in Azeri, Azerbaijan's official language, as well as a story from national press agency\u00a0APA.", "According to APA, the event happened on January 24, 2021, in the central\u00a0Narimanov neighbourhood. \u201cGurbanova Sevda Shikar, born in 1991, jumped from the 18th floor of the building where she lived\", the wire story reads.", "Several Facebook posts in Azeri also talked about the incident (archived here, here and here), and an AFP journalist based in Baku recalled seeing them on social media at the end of January. Several details from the video and photos confirm that the episode did not occur in Australia.", "First, there is an Azerbaijani flag hanging on one of the balconies.", "In addition, the license plate visible in the video (a red rectangle) does not correspond to plates in any Australian states. However, it does look very similar to the ones in Azerbaijan.", "The image of the man falsely identified as the victim was stolen from an engineer living in France\u00a0with no relation to the tragedy. The man, based in the southern city of\u00a0Montpellier, is indeed called Martin Kenfack\u00a0but\u00a0has nothing to do with the claims in the social media posts.", "By searching the name \u201cMartin Kenfack\u201d on Google, AFP Fact Check found Kenfack\u2019s LinkedIn profile, which features the stolen photo used in the Facebook posts.", "Contacted by AFP Fact Check on February 2, the French-Cameroonian engineer explained that \"apart from the photo and the name, there is nothing true in this story\u201d. He said he learned about the\u00a0hoax when his family in Cameroon called him on February 1, \"completely panicked\".", "Although he does not know why his photo ended up in these publications, he assumes that his name -- which is \"typically Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9\" (the largest ethnic group in Cameroon) -- was chosen to \"make Cameroonians talk\" on social media.", "Notably, these false posts name the wife of the victim as \"Ngo Cl\u00e9mence\", which is \"a name from the Bassa ethnic group,\" Kenfack told AFP Fact Check.", "\"Cameroon is a country with a lot of ethnic groups and that makes people talk a lot: people might say to themselves 'I can\u2019t believe that this happened to a Bamileke ...',\" Kenfack said.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
