["As President Donald Trump unfoundedly calls into question the legitimacy of the election, misinformation about why some states haven\u2019t been called in his favor is spreading online. A Facebook post by the page \"Diamond and Silk,\" run by conservative commentators Lynette Diamond Hardaway and Rochelle Silk Richardson, claims fraud is underway.", "\u201cSo they want us to believe that the same states that Republican Senators won are too close to call for the Republican President? Fraud!\u201d the post reads.", "The page did not respond to USA TODAY\u2019s request for comment.", "More:Fact check: That spike in the Wisconsin vote tally was expected and legitimate, not fraud", "According to the Associated Press, which is widely regarded as the primary source of election calls, there are five states that have not yet been called as of late Wednesday night: Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Alaska. Only three of those five had U.S. Senate races this year, and Republicans haven\u2019t won all those seats yet. Plus, the hold up on those five seats has nothing to do with partisan divide. Here\u2019s a breakdown of each state left.", "There is no U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania this year, and of the state\u2019s two presently sitting senators, one is a Republican and the other is a Democrat. Pennsylvania is typically regarded as a battleground state, but it voted blue for six presidencies prior to Trump\u2019s 2016 win, according to Ballotpedia.", "Pennsylvania can\u2019t yet be called because there are still more votes left to be counted, the York Daily Record reported Thursday. The reason it\u2019s taking so long is that Pennsylvania state law says ballot counting can not begin before 7 a.m. on Election Day. Election officials asked to start earlier, but the Republican-controlled Legislature wouldn\u2019t allow it.", "President Donald Trump was leading in the state Wednesday, holding 50.9% of the vote to Biden\u2019s 47.9%, with 89% of ballots counted, according to AP. On Wednesday, Trump prematurely and falsely said he had already won the state.", "But mail-in votes are expected to favor Biden because more Democrats voted that way \u2013 and those ballots come largely from counties won by 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, USA TODAY reported. AP uses similar reasoning to describe why it has not called the race.", "Georgia has both a regular and special U.S. Senate election this year.", "In the regular election, Republican David Perdue is leading in the polls, holding 50.2% of the vote to Democrat Jon Ossoff\u2019s 47.5%, with 97% of votes reported, according to AP. That race has not yet been called.", "In the special election, a runoff will take place between the two top finishers \u2014 Democrat Raphael Warnock, holding 32.5% of the vote, and Republican Kelly Loeffler, holding 26.1% of the vote \u2014 because neither candidate won a majority of votes, according to AP.", "Georgia can\u2019t yet be called because an estimated 4% of the vote still remains to be counted as of Wednesday night, many of those are mailed ballots from the Atlanta metro region, which leans Democratic, according to AP. Plus, results from Fulton County, where Atlanta is located, were delayed after a water pipe burst at the State Farm Arena, where absentee mail ballots were being held. No ballots or machinery were damaged, county spokesperson Regina Waller told NBC News.", "There is no Nevada U.S. Senate race this year, and both sitting senators are Democrats,\u00a0according to Ballotpedia.", "The state hasn\u2019t been called yet because roughly 25% of votes have not been reported, according to AP. Biden has a slim lead over Trump with 49.3% of the vote to Trump\u2019s 48.7%, amounting to about 8,000 votes. \u00a0Under Nevada state law, ballots can still be accepted so long as they were postmarked by Nov. 3. Additional results are expected Thursday, Las Vegas\u2019 8 News Now reported.", "North Carolina has a U.S. Senate race this year, and Republican Thom Tillis is ahead, with 48.7% of the vote to Democrat challenger Cal Cunningham\u2019s 46.9%. Independent challengers have amassed about 4.3% of the vote, with 93% of votes reported. AP has not called the race.", "The winner of North Carolina\u2019s presidential contest hasn\u2019t been called because \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 it\u2019s too early. With 94% of ballots counted, Trump is ahead, with 50.1% of the vote to Biden\u2019s 48.7%. There are still under 200,000 mail-in-ballots to count, and if they were postmarked by Nov. 3, state election officials have until Nov. 12 to count them, according to AP.", "There is a U.S. Senate race in Alaska this year, and Republican Dan Sullivan appears to be winning it easily. But just like the presidential contest in the state, AP hasn\u2019t called it. That\u2019s because just 50% of ballots have been counted.", "While Alaska will almost undoubtedly go Trump, the state won\u2019t start counting absentee ballots until Nov. 10 \u2013 a week after Election Day. It\u2019s the last state in the country to begin to count absentee ballots, according to Alaska Public Media.", "While the results in states left in play in this election aren\u2019t being held up due to partisan divide, a Pew Research Center analysis published in September suggests \u201cmismatched\u201d voting in states, where the state votes primarily one way for Senate races and another for presidential races, is becoming less common.", "According to the analysis, 122 of 139 regular and special Senate elections were won by candidates who belonged to or were aligned with the party that won that state\u2019s most recent presidential race.", "More:Fact check: Arizona election departments confirm Sharpies can be used on ballots", "There are a number of states that have not yet been called for either presidential candidate, but that\u2019s mostly due to unreported votes. None of those states had elected new Republican senators at the time the post was made, though some races appear as if they may eventually; other states still left do not have U.S. Senate races this year. A Pew Research Center study suggests\u00a0that the sentiment behind the post \u2013 that Republican Senate seats should follow a Republican president\u2019s election in the state \u2013 may have some merit.
