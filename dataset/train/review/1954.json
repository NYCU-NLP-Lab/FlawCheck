["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on March 12, 2020", "Posts are circulating false and misleading tips on social media \u2014 in some cases wrongly attributed to Stanford University\u00a0\u2014 about how people can monitor and avoid the coronavirus.", "As the U.S. and countries around the world work to address the pandemic spread of COVID-19, posts disseminated by tens of thousands on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are feeding misinformation to people about how to avoid and self-test for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.", "The posts provide\u00a0a series of supposed\u00a0tips about the virus, such as wrongly instructing people to hold their breath to gauge whether they\u2019ve been infected and falsely suggesting that water consumption can kill the virus. Similar claims were promoted in a text-based image posted on the Instagram account of actress Debra Messing, which has since been deleted. They were also shared widely in screenshots on Twitter.", "The posts in some cases cite \u201cTaiwan experts\u201d or \u201cJapanese doctors,\u201d and many begin by falsely sourcing the text to \u201cSTANFORD HOSPITAL BOARD.\u201d Stanford Health Care has debunked that attribution.", "We consulted Krys Johnson, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Temple University, who called the posts \u201cdeeply troubling because they make incorrect and dangerous claims.\u201d She recommended people consult the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the World Health Organization, before spreading purported health advice.", "Here are some of the claims from the posts, and why they\u2019re inaccurate:", "Claim: \u201cTake a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection.\u201d\n\nFacts: There\u2019s no evidence to suggest this is a valid test for COVID-19. What\u2019s more: \u201cWe know that people infected with coronavirus show symptoms within 14 days and that this virus can lead to severe complications,\u201d Johnson told us via email, \u201cbut those are acute respiratory distress (not being able to breathe) and septic shock (the virus infecting your bloodstream), not fibrosis, as mentioned here.\u201d", "The CDC recommends seeking medical advice by phone if you develop the main symptoms of COVID-19 \u2014 fever, cough and shortness of breath \u2014 and have been in contact with someone who has the disease, or have recently traveled to an area experiencing a spread of the virus.", "Claim: \u201cIf you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold \u2026 Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.\u201d", "Facts: While the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are \u201cfever, tiredness, and dry cough,\u201d according to WHO, some patients do have \u201caches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.\u201d Some who are infected don\u2019t show any symptoms. Also, a WHO report said that, based on an examination of more than 55,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 33% had sputum (phlegm) production.", "Claim: \u201cEveryone should ensure your mouth & throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus.\u201d", "Facts: The WHO has shot down this theory, saying that, \u201c[w]hile staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection.\u201d", "Likewise, Johnson said that the \u201cmoistness of your mouth and throat have nothing to do with the likelihood that you will develop disease, and simply drinking water to \u2018rinse\u2019 your digestive track will not prevent you from being infected or from getting sick.\u201d Water consumption, she added, \u201chas no bearing on the virus getting into your airways and lungs; if you breathe in an infected person\u2019s respiratory droplets, the virus will travel through your airways.\u201d", "CDC officials recommend people clean their hands often, for at least 20 seconds \u2014 or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol as an alternative \u2014 and avoid touching their faces and mouths. They also suggest social distancing, which can help curb the spread of the virus.", "Claim: \u201cThis new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees.\u201d", "Facts: What, exactly, these posts are referencing is unclear. The CDC has said it\u2019s \u201cnot yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19.\u201d We\u2019ve previously written about how it\u2019s unknown whether warming weather will help temper the outbreak.", "The WHO has said there is \u201cno reason to believe that this virus would behave differently in different temperatures.\u201d Johnson noted that Italy \u201chas a particularly mild winter and they have had widespread transmission of COVID-19, so it is unlikely that the outside temperature will affect this disease.\u201d", "More than 125,000 people across the globe have been infected by the coronavirus, leading to more than 4,700 deaths.\u00a0We\u2019ve reported on many falsehoods and misleading statements about the new coronavirus.
