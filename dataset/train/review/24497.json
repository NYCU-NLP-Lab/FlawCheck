Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, told Fox News that Obama\u2019s plan \u2014 which proposes steps such as closing background check loopholes and banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines \u2014 is \"not going to solve the problem.\"\n\n\"Washington, D.C. had some of the strictest gun laws in the country,\" Rubio told host Brian Kilmeade on Jan. 17, 2013. \"And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed.\"\n\nWe wanted to know: Did violence leap after the nation\u2019s capital cracked down on guns?\n\n Unprotected citizens\n\nIn 1976, the District of Columbia required all guns to be registered, banned new handguns and required guns at home to be stored unloaded and disassembled or locked up.\n\nThe law\u2019s handgun ban was invalidated by federal courts in 2007, a decision reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 2008. But for three decades, the nation\u2019s capital had some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country.\n\nWe\u2019ll note that the president isn\u2019t proposing D.C.\u2019s gun laws \u2014 indeed, the Supreme Court took that off the table \u2014 so it\u2019s a comparison of questionable value. But we were curious whether Rubio was correct to say that Washington\u2019s handgun ban was followed by violence.\n\nWhy would violence climb after such a ban? Rubio\u2019s office declined to explain, but a Jan. 15, 2013, opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal by journalist and attorney Jeffrey Scott Shapiro makes a similar argument:", "Shapiro\u2019s homicide numbers match the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting statistics. But when we looked at related data, it was quickly apparent he chose statistics that told a simple story \u2014 pass ban, violent crime soars \u2014 that was in reality much more complicated.\n\nWe reached out to Shapiro to ask for research to support his conclusion, but didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nViolent crime rates in the District of Columbia from 1976 look like a rockin\u2019 roller coaster, dipping slightly after the ban\u2019s passage, climbing steadily until the early \u201880s, diving again through the late \u201880s, then climbing a steep mountain until the early \u201890s.\n\nThen violent crime, as in the rest of the country, fell steeply, settling into a slower cruise downward since the start of the new century.\n\n(It\u2019s still much more violent in the District than the rest of the nation, with 1,330 violent crimes per 100,000 people compared with 363 per 100,000 for the entire country in 2010.)\n\nBut Shapiro cited the annual homicide number for 1993 \u2014 the height of violent crime in the four decades we\u2019re examining \u2014 then later says:", "He fails to mention that drop started in 1994.\n\n Weapon-choice theory\n\nBut back to Rubio. In his Fox News interview, he didn\u2019t claim the gun ban caused the crime rate to rise. But he does say that the gun laws are \"not going to solve the problem,\" citing D.C.\u2019s experience as an example.\n\nWe know that violent crime didn\u2019t simply \"skyrocket\" in the District after the handgun ban passed in 1976. It took a rocky path with peaks in 1981 and 1993, and has generally fallen since then.\n\nA similar trend echoed across the United States. That suggests a wide range of factors at work, not merely D.C.\u2019s gun laws.\n\nSome experts who study violence, such as Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University, say the early \u201880s peak and fall can largely be attributed to the baby boomer generation entering their teens and 20s and then growing up. (People tend to be more law abiding as they age.) The later U.S. peak, Blumstein said, came with crack cocaine and President Ronald Reagan\u2019s war on drugs.\n\nAnd the fall in violent crime since then? Theories include the passage of Roe vs. Wade and a reduction in environmental lead. Blumstein argues an important part of the explanation was the decline in the demand for crack as people saw its effects in older friends and relatives, \"and aggressive actions by police in taking the guns off the street.\"\n\nAh, so, back to gun laws. What, if any, role did they play in violent crime in the District of Columbia?\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of fresh research on the subject, since Congress put a chill on government-funded firearms research starting in the late \u201890s. (Something that the president\u2019s recent executive actions seek to reverse.)\n\nBut Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine, pointed us to a 1991 study in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\"Sen. Rubio couldn't be more wrong,\" he told PolitiFact.\n\nThe study, conducted by a research group at the University of Maryland and University at Albany, examined suicides and homicides in the District of Columbia compared with nearby cities from 1968 to 1987. They found that the adoption of the gun-licensing law \"coincided with an abrupt decline\" in gun-related deaths not found just across the border. Nor were there increases in homicides or suicides that didn\u2019t use guns.\n\n\"Our data suggest that restrictions on access to guns in the District of Columbia prevented an average of 47 deaths each year after the law was implemented,\" the authors concluded.\n\nDespite widely circulated Internet criticism to the contrary, researchers did consider the effects of population changes, including age and population size. They got similar results.\n\nHow did the laws help? The researchers argued the data supported something called the weapon-choice theory. When people don\u2019t have easy access to guns, some will use a less deadly form of force. So even if the number of assaults and suicide attempts stays the same, with fewer guns, deaths drop.\n\nThe researchers argued their results showed it was reasonable to assume that even with violent crime rising, restrictions on gun access had \"a preventive effect.\"\n\nIn other words, even if \"violence skyrocketed,\" as Rubio said, that\u2019s not direct evidence that D.C.\u2019s gun laws failed to help. Of course, they also didn\u2019t fully \"solve the problem.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nRubio, expressing his disappointment in Obama\u2019s recent actions to prevent gun violence, argued they wouldn\u2019t solve the problem. \"Washington, D.C. had some of the strictest gun laws in the country,\" he said. \"And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed.\"\n\nCrime statistics don\u2019t support Rubio\u2019s simple story. Rather than skyrocket, violent crime rose and fell, rose and fell. Other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws. And one peer-reviewed study about gun laws\u2019 role in violent crime through 1987 showed they reduced homicides and suicides.\n\nRubio\u2019s statement is partially accurate \u2014 in some years, violent crime in the District of Columbia did rise even with a handgun ban in place \u2014 but leaves out important details and context.
