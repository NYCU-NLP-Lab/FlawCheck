["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Don\u2019t fall for social posts with the headline \"NEW Starbucks CEO Has Admitted She Doesnt Like White People.\" They are not true.", "For one thing, the executive mentioned in one post, Rosalind Brewer, is the chief operating officer and group president of Starbucks, not the CEO. But the bigger flaw is in its mischaracterization of something Brewer said in 2015, when she worked for another company. In a CNN interview, she expressed a desire for diversity in the workplace and corporate leadership; she never said anything to suggest she has a problem with white people.", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "At the time of the CNN interview, Brewer was CEO of Sam\u2019s Club.", "The interview was primarily about how Sam\u2019s Club employees were affected by various state and city decisions to raise the minimum wage. Near the end of the interview CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow shifted the conversation.", "She pointed out that Brewer, as a black woman, was in a unique position as a minority in a corporate executive role. Harlow then asked Brewer whose responsibility it is to make the decisions that increase representation for women like Brewer in corporate leadership positions.", "\"It starts with the top of many companies. It has to start with top leadership,\" Brewer said. \"I can tell you that even with myself, I have to live it also. My executive team is very diverse, and I make that a priority. I demand it of my team and within the structure.\"", "Brewer acknowledged that sometimes she considers it her responsibility to use her platform to encourage her partners to think about diversity in hiring. She said she also demands diversity considerations in the hiring process and talks to her suppliers about diversity as well. Then, she brought up one incident in particular.", "\"Just today, we met with a supplier, and the entire other side of the table was all Caucasian males,\" Brewer said in the interview. \"I decided not to talk about it directly with his folks in the room, because there were actually no females, like, levels down. So I\u2019m going to have to place a call to him.\"", "Brewer did not say she disliked white people in general, or anyone at all. Neither did she identify the supplier in question, other than mentioning which day the meeting occurred.", "The post also erroneously says Brewer succeeded Howard Schultz as CEO in 2017.", "In September 2017, Starbucks named Brewer its group president and chief operating officer. Kevin Johnson is Starbucks president and CEO, and he has been since April 2017.", "The Facebook post claims that Starbucks\u2019 CEO has \"admitted\" to disliking white people, basing its claim on a CNN interview with Brewer.", "In the interview cited, Brewer talks about how she encourages hiring women and minorities for executive roles. She does not say anything about disliking white people. And in reality, she is the chief operating officer, not CEO.", "We rate this post False.", "Daily Political News, \"NEW Starbucks CEO Has Admitted She Doesnt Like White People,\" Dec. 22, 2019", "CNN Money, \"Sam's Club CEO: Wages will keep rising,\" accessed Feb. 18, 2020", "Snopes, \"Did Starbucks\u2019 Exec Rosalind Brewer Say She Dislikes White People?\" Oct. 14, 2019", "Washington Post, \"Sam\u2019s Club CEO called \u2018racist\u2019 for remarks on diversity,\" Dec. 15, 2015", "Starbucks Stories and News, \"Executive Team: Kevin Johnson,\" accessed Feb. 18, 2020", "Starbucks Stories and News, \"Executive Team: Rosalind (Roz) Brewer,\" accessed Feb. 18, 2020", "Starbucks Stories and News, \"Starbucks Names Rosalind Brewer Group President and Chief Operating Officer,\" Sept. 6, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
