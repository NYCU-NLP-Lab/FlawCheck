["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on July 23, 2020", "The Committee to Defend the President has been running a six-second Facebook ad targeting older voters in North Carolina that takes former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s words out of context to brand him as a KKK sympathizer who twice used the \u201cN-word.\u201d", "The Committee to Defend the President is a political group supporting President Donald Trump. It has also produced two longer versions that contain more claims \u2014 including that Biden \u201cpartnered with segregationists.\u201d As a senator, Biden did work with lawmakers who were segregationists, including on measures in the 1970s that opposed busing as a method to integrate schools.", "Biden\u2019s comments last year about working with segregationists being a sign of \u201ccivility\u201d became a point of contention with competitors in the Democratic primary.", "The committee has been promoting the ads to Facebook users in the swing state of North Carolina, according to Facebook advertising data. The state, which has the 10th highest number of electoral votes, voted for Obama in 2008, then for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 and Trump in 2016. Polls show that Biden is slightly ahead of Trump in the state.", "Most of the group\u2019s Facebook spending on the series of ads has been put behind the six-second ad, which began running July 15. As of July 22, the group was estimated to have paid at least $7,700 to run\u00a0the\u00a0ad on the platform, primarily targeting users 55 and older; it had accrued more than 400,000 impressions. The group also has spent about $66,000 airing a 30-second version of the ad in North Carolina in the Raleigh-Durham market, according to Advertising Analytics.", "While the ad\u2019s voiceover says that Biden \u201cpraised KKK members\u201d \u2014 plural \u2014 on-screen text specifically says that Biden \u201cpraised KKK member Robert Byrd,\u201d citing a July 3, 2010, story from the BBC about a memorial service for the late Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia.", "When we asked the committee for evidence for each of its claims, it noted only Biden\u2019s remarks about Byrd.", "The BBC article recounted how Biden, who was vice president at the time, and others \u2014 including Obama \u2014 spoke at the service. Biden said that Byrd, a Democrat who was the longest-serving senator in history when he died, was \u201ca friend, and he was a mentor and he was a guide.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that Byrd was once a KKK member \u2014 he organized and led a local chapter in West Virginia and was involved with the group throughout the 1940s.", "However, Byrd then went on to a long career in politics during which he repeatedly apologized and said he regretted his ties to the group.", "In a memoir he published in 2005, Byrd wrote of his affiliation with the group: \u201cIt has emerged throughout my life to haunt and embarrass me and has taught me in a very graphic way what one major mistake can do to one\u2019s life, career, and reputation.\u201d", "Byrd also told the Washington Post: \u201cI know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times \u2026 and I don\u2019t mind apologizing over and over again. I can\u2019t erase what happened.\u201d", "When Byrd died, Biden was far from the only one to \u201cpraise\u201d him.", "The NAACP\u2019s then-president said in a statement, which acknowledged the senator\u2019s former KKK ties, that \u201cSenator Byrd reflects the transformative power of this nation.\u201d", "McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, also spoke at Byrd\u2019s memorial service \u2014 and other Republicans issued statements remembering Byrd. Texas Sen. John Cornyn said that Byrd was \u201ca tireless public servant\u201d and that the \u201cSenate has lost a great champion, he will be missed greatly.\u201d", "That\u2019s not to say Byrd\u2019s checkered history is absolved in everyone\u2019s eyes: The Committee to Defend the President pointed to the fact that a private college in West Virginia recently announced that it would remove Byrd\u2019s name from its health center, citing \u201cdivisiveness and pain.\u201d", "But the matter is more nuanced than simply saying that Biden \u201cpraised KKK members.\u201d And there is no evidence that Biden praised any other members of the racist group, making the plural use of the word \u201cmembers\u201d inaccurate.", "To support its claim that Biden \u201crepeated the N-word twice on camera,\u201d\u00a0the video\u2019s text quotes Biden as saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more N***** bigshots.\u201d It cites a C-SPAN video from 1985.", "That video is actually of a public hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee and Biden\u2019s words were not his own. Nor was he \u201crepeating\u201d the \u201cN-word\u201d in a manner to agree with or endorse it, as the ad implies.", "That hearing was on the nomination of William Reynolds, who was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to be associate attorney general. At the time, Biden was the ranking minority member on the committee.", "Reynolds was the assistant attorney general for civil rights, and Biden\u00a0questioned Reynolds\u2019 role in a Louisiana redistricting plan that had been struck down by the courts because it was biased against Blacks, as the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported\u00a0at the time. Reynolds had declined to challenge the state\u2019s plan.", "Biden was reading from a court ruling \u2014 which cited a confidential memo written by Reynolds\u2019 staff \u2014 to suggest Reynolds was aware of racial motivations behind the plan, and to question Reynolds\u2019 commitment to voting rights.", "Early in the C-SPAN video (at the 1-minute mark) Biden says he planned to revisit the Louisiana case and tells Reynolds that \u201cyour critics suggest as you well know \u2026 that you are very insensitive to the concerns of minority persons.\u201d", "Later, at 16:55 in the video, Biden quotes from the court order and memo, which relayed what \u201cimportant \u2026 legislators\u201d who had opposed an earlier plan (known as the \u201cNunez plan\u201d) had said: \u201cWe already have a n***** mayor; we don\u2019t need any more n***** big shots.'\u201d", "\u201cIt seems to me that it\u2019s awful clear that the court had no trouble finding, on a factual basis and outlining how it looked at this case, that there were clear, clear evidence of intent to discriminate against Black folks,\u201d Biden went on to say (18:10).", "Reynolds\u2019 nomination was ultimately unsuccessful.", "Chad Banghart, executive director of the Committee to Defend the President, sent us a link to a recent Breitbart story that found that Biden quoted the line from the memo other times during the hearings; the story questioned if even repeating the quote was acceptable.", "That doesn\u2019t change that the committee\u2019s ad fails to acknowledge that the words were not Biden\u2019s own.", "Editor\u2019s note: Swing State Watch is an occasional series about false and misleading political messages in key states that will help decide the 2020 presidential election.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
