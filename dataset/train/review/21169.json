We fact-checked his claims.", "The president was accurate on many counts, including that the national curfew in response to the Covid-19 pandemic was the first put in place since independence in 1963.", "Kenyatta was also mostly on the money regarding matters of economy and trade. Kenya has increased its trade within the East African Community, helped loosen trade regulations across the continent, and improved in international ease-of-doing-business rankings.", "But while the textbook-to-pupil ratio in the first grades of school is nearly one to one, it is incorrect that 100% of students progress from primary to secondary education, and this repeats previously unproven claims.", "\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bIn November 2020 Kenya\u2019s president Uhuru Kenyatta reported on the state of the nation, nearly one and a half years since the last such address.", "The speech centred on his administration\u2019s efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and its \u201cBig Four\u201d agenda that is focused on health, housing, manufacturing and food security.", "The president also made claims of progress in various areas from education and land to the business environment and electricity connections.", "We checked the accuracy of eight of Kenyatta\u2019s pronouncements.", "We have contacted the presidency for the source of the data used in the claims and will update this report with their response.", "[The Covid-19 dusk-to-dawn curfew is] Kenya\u2019s first ever nationwide curfew since independence.", "To stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, in March 2020 Kenyatta said a nationwide curfew would be \u201cin effect in the territory of the republic of Kenya\u201d from 7 pm to 5 am.", "Starting on 27 March, the curfew\u2019s hours have varied. At the time of writing, it is in place until 3 January 2021 between 10 pm and 4 am.", "In his November address, Kenyatta said the curfew was \u201cKenya\u2019s first ever nationwide curfew since independence\u201d.", "The best records on curfews would be the legal notices published in the Kenya Gazette as required by the Public Order Act, Dr Mutuma Ruteere told Africa Check.", "Ruteere is the director of the Centre for Human Rights and Policy Studies in Nairobi. A former United Nations special rapporteur, he has written extensively on security, policing and terrorism in Kenya.", "\u201cWhen a curfew is declared, it has to be gazetted,\u201d Brian Kimari told us. He is a junior research fellow at the thinktank and has authored a policy brief on the curfew during the pandemic.", "Kimari could not find an instance of another nationwide curfew, and we also came up empty when we scoured the gazette's archives.", "The records do show that regional curfews have been declared before, in north-eastern Kenya in the 1960s and 70s during the shifta war and more recently during operations against the al-Shabaab terror group. Curfews were also in place in the cities of Nairobi and Nanyuki during the 1982 coup attempt, in some districts during various security operations, and during the 2007/08 post-election violence.", "A news article from March 2020 said a national curfew had been in place before but under a colonial era state of emergency, citing veteran Kenyan administrator Joseph Kaguthi.", "Kimari said that the reference to the curfew by Kenyatta was meant to signal that the pandemic is \u201ca very serious moment\u201d for the country, but it also cast a spotlight on the \u201csecuritisation of the pandemic response\u201d. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu", "\u201cAs at the end of 2019 calendar year, we had been able to achieve a textbook-to-pupil ratio of 1:1 for grades 1 through to 3.\u201d", "Kenya\u2019s government took over the distribution of textbooks from schools in January 2018.", "For the most recent data on this, Dr Emmanuel Manyasa directed us to the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. He is the executive director of Usawa Agenda, an advocacy group in the education sector.", "The 2019 basic education statistical booklet notes that the education ministry distributed books \u201con numeracy and literacy because they are the foundational skills in education\u201d.", "\u201cThe data shows that the 1:1 pupil-textbook ratio in mathematics, English and Kiswahili has almost been achieved in Grade 1, 2 and 3,\u201d the booklet says.", "It breaks this down by grade and enrolment.", "The ratios have been rounded up, meaning some pupils were sharing books. For example, some 49,088 grade 1 pupils would not have had their own textbook.", "Why is the ratio important? According to the education ministry, pupils sharing textbooks with more than one other child achieved less.", "\u201cIdeally, more learning material should improve learning outcomes,\u201d Manyasa told Africa Check. But there were also other factors at play, he said, such as teacher shortages, especially in the rural areas. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu", "\u201cDuring my administration, 4.5 million titles have been issued in the seven years since 2013.\u201d", "Kenyatta compared this number to the six million title deeds he said had been issued from independence in 1963 to when he took office in 2013. He made the same claim in another national address in June 2020.", "(Note: Since 2012 title deeds are also referred to as \u201ccertificates of title\u201d in Kenya. They prove that the person named in the certificate owns the land.)", "Since June 2020, the lands ministry website has claimed that 4.5 million deeds have been issued \u201csince 2013 compared to 5.6 million since independence\u201d.", "In June Farida Karoney, the cabinet secretary for lands, gave Africa Check a similar number of 5.6 million from 1963 to 2012. From 2013 to June 2019 about 4.1 million deeds were issued, she said, and 388,000 from July to April 2020. The minister\u2019s figures added up to 4.49 million.", "We have asked Karoney for the number of deeds issued since April and will update this report once we receive a response.", "Only the ministry can confirm the number of deeds it has issued, the Kenya Land Alliance, a not-for-profit organisation that advocates for land reform in the country, previously told Africa Check. \u2013 Vincent Ng\u2019ethe", "Kenya currently ranks 56th globally and third in sub-Saharan Africa on the ease of doing business report, from a low of 136th globally in 2014.", "Every year, the World Bank publishes a report ranking how friendly countries make their economies to investors.", "The most recent, Doing Business 2020, ranks Kenya 56th out of 189 countries.\u00a0 In the sub-Saharan Africa region the country was third after Mauritius and Rwanda.", "The 2015 report, using data current as of June 2014, placed Kenya 136th. So on this score the president was accurate. The presidency has also cited the country\u2019s progress up the rankings in previous years. \u2013Vincent Ng\u2019ethe", "In March 2018, Kenya and Ghana were the first countries to not only sign but also ratify the landmark agreement creating the African Continental Free Trade Area.", "The African Continental Free Trade Area is expected to increase trade both within Africa and with other regions and has been described as the largest free trade area in the world based on the number of countries.", "The agreement establishing it was signed by 54 of the bloc\u2019s 55 members in March 2018 during an African Union summit in Rwanda. Eritrea has not yet signed.", "The agreement\u2019s status list shows Kenya was the first to ratify it on 6 May 2018, a day ahead of Ghana. Some 28 countries had ratified the agreement as of October 2019, meaning they agreed to be bound by its terms. \u2013 Vincent Ng\u2019ethe", "The last mile connectivity programme crossed the 7.2 million household connections mark.", "According to Kenya Power, the country\u2019s electricity utility, \u201clast mile\u201d refers to the last link to the consumer\u2019s premise or home.", "In June 2020 we rated as unproven a claim by Kenyatta that the government had connected 8 million households to the electric grid. Because of a delay in appointing Kenya\u2019s auditor-general, the utility firm only published its 2018/19 annual report in November 2020.", "The report shows that in the year to June 2019, some 306,771 customers were connected to electricity. (Draft treasury figures gave a figure of 440,822 customers.)", "As of 30 June 2019, the annual report showed Kenya Power had connected 5.4 million domestic consumers. Another 1.29 million were connected under the rural electrification programme, for a total of 6.7 million.", "Domestic connections accounted for 94.5% of all customers. This category has over the last five financial years accounted for at least a 90% share of the total.", "On its website, Kenya Power says that as of June 2020 it \u201csells electricity to over 7.5 million\u201d but does not specify how many customers were domestic.", "The available data accounts for 6.7 million of the 7.2 million connections cited by the president. Kenya Power\u2019s 2019/20 annual report, to be published in January 2021, will likely give newer data but in its absence we rate the claim as unproven. \u2013Vincent Ng\u2019ethe", "Kenyan exports within the East African Community jumped to a six-year high in 2019.", "The East African Community counts six member countries \u2013 Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.", "The 2020 economic survey from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows that in 2019, Kenya made KSh140 billion in exports to the other countries. This was the highest since 2013.", "The finalising of the community\u2019s common market protocol meant that its members were trading more with each other, Dr Paul Kamau told Africa Check.", "He is a senior fellow at the University of Nairobi\u2019s Institute for Development Studies and has published research on Kenya\u2019s trade in East Africa.", "\u201cThis could be giving the business community more confidence,\u201d he said, adding that as markets such as the US and China get more competitive, there has been more focus on regional markets. \u2013 Vincent Ng\u2019ethe", "For the second year running Kenya has achieved a transition rate of 100% from primary to secondary school.", "In his previous state of the nation address in April 2019, the president claimed the country had achieved a 100% transition from primary to secondary school. We fact-checked the claim then and found it to be incorrect.", "There are conflicting claims about the transition rate in 2019.", "In February 2019, an education ministry report said the transition rate was 93%.", "Citing the ministry\u2019s data, the 2020 economic survey published by the national statistics office in April gave the transition rate for 2019 as 85.5%.", "The 2019 basic education statistical booklet from the ministry put it at 95% for 2019.", "A year later, in February 2020, education minister George Magoha claimed a 99.8% transition rate.", "We have contacted the education ministry for clarity. The available data however does not show a 100% transition rate in 2019 or 2020. Experts have previously told Africa Check that achieving this full rate is difficult in the absence of a law making secondary school compulsory.", "Secondary school is also not completely free and this will keep some students away.
