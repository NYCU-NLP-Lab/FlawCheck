["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Democratic Senate candidate Tim Kaine recently took a swipe at his likely Republican opponent, George Allen for supporting tax cuts passed under former President George W. Bush.\n\nKaine charged the tax breaks have exacerbated the country\u2019s deficit, and he argued Allen shared the blame for that.\n\n\"These (Bush) tax cuts were put in place, I believe in 2003. George (Allen) was the deciding vote for them to be put in place,\" Kaine said during a Dec. 7 debate between the two candidates.\n\nDid Allen cast the pivotal vote on whether those tax cuts went into effect? We decided to check.\n\nThe Bush era tax cuts were enacted in two phases.\n\nThe first phase, in 2001, lowered income tax rates, levies on estates, and rebated money to tax filers. The package, projected to cost $1.35 trillion over 10 years, easily passed the Senate by a 58-33 vote with Allen\u2019s support.\n\nThe second phase, in 2003, lowered taxes on stock dividends and long-term capital gains, among other provisions. The package, projected to cost $350 billion over six years, passed by the slimmest of margins in the Senate.\n\nAllen was among 48 Republican senators and two Democrats who voted in favor of the bill. On the other end, 46 Democrats, three Republicans and one independent voted against it. That led to a 50-50 split.\n\nVice President Dick Cheney, a Republican, cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate and the measure passed, 51-50.\n\nSo did Allen have the deciding vote?\n\nYes, said Michael Kelly, a spokesman for the Kaine campaign. He said if Allen had voted against the 2003 tax cuts, they would have failed by a 51-49 Senate vote.\n\nWe read news articles that ran the day after the vote in The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer. They all prominently stated that Cheney cast the tie-breaking vote. None of them mentioned Allen.\n\nOur Conclusion:\n\nKaine said Allen cast \"the deciding vote\" in passing the 2003 package of Bush tax cuts.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Allen\u2019s support helped lead to a 50-50 split, setting up a tie-breaking vote for the tax cuts by Vice President Cheney. And Kaine accurately argues\u00a0that had Allen voted differently, the legislation would have failed.\n\nBut the outcome would have been altered if any of the 50 senators who supported the tax cuts \u00a0had voted differently. And we can add Cheney, who broke the tie. That brings us to 51 people who, by Kaine\u2019s rationale, cast \"the deciding vote.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s compare the scenario to a basketball game that\u2019s tied, 50-50, after four quarters of play and won, by one point, on a dramatic shot at the end of overtime by a player named Jones. Fans would marvel at how Jones\u2019 shot won the game. But Kaine, under his logic, could attribute the \u2018\u2018deciding\u2019\u2019 basket to anyone who scored for the winning team, including Smith, who sank a free throw in the second quarter.\n\nIt would be misleading to\u00a0spread word that Smith hit the the game winner. It is similarly misleading for Kaine to claim Allen cast the \"deciding vote\" on the 2003 tax cuts when Cheney broke the tie at the end.
