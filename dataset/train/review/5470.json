["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on March 16, 2021 | Updated on May 24, 2021", "Sen. Ron Johnson, as he predicted, got himself in trouble for saying he \u201cnever felt threatened\u201d by those who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, but he \u201cmight have been a little concerned\u201d if they were \u201ctens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and antifa protesters.\u201d", "In response to critics who found his remarks to be racist, Johnson wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal \u2014 \u201cI Won\u2019t Be Silenced by the Left\u201d \u2014 that distorted a report\u2019s findings on last year\u2019s demonstrations against racial injustice.", "In his op-ed, Johnson cited the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project to \u201cpush back\u201d at \u201cleftists\u201d who claim that last year\u2019s protests were \u201cmostly peaceful.\u201d But the September report Johnson cited found that \u201cmore than 93% of all demonstrations connected to the movement\u201d were non-violent.", "\u201c[T]he senator is taking the overall figures out of context and distorting the report\u2019s key conclusions,\u201d Sam Jones, an author of the report, told us in an email.", "Jones also said that Johnson\u2019s op-ed overstated the number of demonstrations that involved violence and the number of people who died during them.", "The controversy began on March 12 when radio host Joe Pagliarulo interviewed the Republican senator from Wisconsin. About six minutes into the 15-minute interview, Pagliarulo said Johnson\u2019s Democratic colleagues are playing a political \u201cgame\u201d when they accuse him of racism.", "Pagliarulo, March 12: There\u2019s no way people that you go to work with every day really think that you and I are white supremacists because we believe in conservative values, right?", "Johnson: No, and I\u2019m also criticized because I\u2019ve made the comment that on January 6th, I never felt threatened, because I didn\u2019t. And mainly because I knew that even though those thousands of people that were marching to the Capitol \u2014", "Pagliarulo: Yeah.", "Johnson: \u2013were trying to pressure people like me, to vote the way they wanted me to vote, I knew those are people that love this country, that truly respect law enforcement, would never do anything to break a law. And so, I wasn\u2019t concerned.", "Now, had the tables been turned \u2014 and Joe, this could get me in trouble \u2014 had the tables been turned and President Trump won the election, and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned.", "Johnson may have thought that the pro-Trump supporters wouldn\u2019t break the law that day, but he turned out to be wrong. So far, there have been more than 300 arrests, according to a database created by NPR.", "In his op-ed, Johnson didn\u2019t mention the number of arrests stemming from the Capital riot. He also didn\u2019t provide the number of deaths related to the riot (five, including a Capitol Police officer) or people who were injured (including at least 138 Capitol and Metropolitan Police Department officers). But he did provide such statistics for what he called \u201clast summer\u2019s political violence.\u201d", "Johnson wrote that he felt \u201ccompelled to push back\u201d at liberals who say the demonstrations that happened in the months after George Floyd\u2019s death in police custody were peaceful. In the op-ed, Johnson favorably compared the largely white mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 with those who turned violent at demonstrations for racial justice.", "\u201cThousands of protesters \u2014 no one knows the actual number \u2014 marched to the Capitol,\u201d Johnson wrote about the pro-Trump mob. \u201cOnly about 800 people illegally entered the Capitol. Still fewer engaged in violent acts.\u201d He then cited the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a nonprofit that collects data on political violence and protest events.", "Johnson, March 15: Leftists who want to memory hole last summer\u2019s political violence immediately started lecturing me that the 2020 protests were mostly peaceful. Apparently they\u2019ve forgotten that, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, 570 leftist protests became riots last year. Twenty-five people lost their lives and 700 law enforcement officers were injured.", "The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project did not say that \u201c570 leftist protests became riots last year\u201d and did not find that 25 people were killed during those demonstrations.", "The report found that there were more than 10,100 political demonstrations in the U.S. from May 24 to Aug. 22 and less than 570, or about 5%, resulted in violence. That included all political demonstrations, including those against COVID-19 restrictions and counter demonstrations to the protests against racial injustice.", "The report said that during that time \u2014 actually from May 26 to Aug. 22 \u2014 there were \u201cover 7,750 demonstrations linked to the BLM movement across more than 2,440 locations in all 50 states and Washington, DC.\u201d", "\u201cMore than 93% \u2014 approximately 7,208 events \u2014 involved no violent or destructive activity, and under 7% \u2014 approximately 543 events \u2014 did involve violent or destructive activity,\u201d Jones, one of the authors, told us.", "But, he added, \u201cit would be inaccurate to say that those 543 events were riots caused by BLM or by \u2018leftists,\u2019 as the senator suggests.\u201d", "\u201cThese events include cases where violence was instigated by actors other than the demonstrators. ACLED data indicate that BLM-linked demonstrations faced much higher levels of police intervention and force than other types of demonstrations, for example, and in many of these cases police took a heavy-handed approach to break up the protests, prompting clashes with demonstrators and escalating the events into violence,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAdditionally, in some cases, violent or destructive behavior may have broken out as a result of aggressive intervention by counter-demonstrators or non-state actors like militia groups, and BLM-linked demonstrations were also targeted in dozens of car-ramming attacks throughout the year. It would be misleading to frame all of these events as \u2018BLM riots.'\u201d", "Ben Voelkel, a spokesman for the senator, told us in an email that the senator\u2019s op-ed \u201cdoesn\u2019t ascribe causation, but instead a result.\u201d The senator\u2019s op-ed was \u201cworded exactly this way: \u2018became riots last year,\u2019\u201d Voelkel said.", "Jones also said that Johnson\u2019s reference to 25 people who died during the demonstrations is inaccurate. The figure doesn\u2019t come from the report, but rather an article by the Guardian. The article, based on ACLED data, reported that \u201cat least 11 Americans\u201d were killed \u201cwhile participating in political demonstrations\u201d and another 14 died \u201cin other incidents linked to political unrest.\u201d", "Of the 11 killed during political demonstrations, nine were \u201cdemonstrators taking part in Black Lives Matter protests\u201d and \u201ctwo were conservatives killed after pro-Trump \u2018patriot rallies,'\u201d the Guardian reported.", "\u201cSo it is incorrect to suggest that all of these 25 people were killed by BLM or \u2018leftist\u2019 demonstrators, or that all of the deaths were at BLM or \u2018leftist\u2019 demonstrations,\u201d Jones said.", "Update, May 24: The Washington Post\u00a0reported\u00a0on April 19 that District of Columbia Chief Medical Examiner Francisco J. Diaz found that Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick suffered two strokes nearly eight hours after being sprayed with a chemical irritant during the riot. Diaz told the Post that Sicknick died of natural causes, but \u201call that transpired played a role in his condition.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
