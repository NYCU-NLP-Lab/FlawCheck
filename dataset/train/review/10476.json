["By Robert Farley and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on April 19, 2019", "The Russia report released April 18 contradicts President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that special counsel Robert Mueller had two conflicts of interest that prevented him from conducting an impartial investigation:", "According to the report, in the days after Mueller was appointed special counsel on May 17, 2017, Trump complained to advisers that Muller had conflicts of interest. Trump said those included that \u201cMueller had interviewed for the FBI Director position shortly before being appointed as Special Counsel, that he had worked for a law firm that represented people affiliated with the President, and that Mueller had disputed certain fees relating to his membership in a Trump golf course in Northern Virginia,\u201d the report reads.", "According to the report, the president\u2019s advisers \u2014 including then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, then-White House counsel Don McGahn and Bannon \u2014 \u201cpushed back on his assertion of conflicts, telling the President they did not count as true conflicts.\u201d Bannon told investigators that he \u201crecalled telling the President that the purported conflicts were \u2018ridiculous\u2019 and that none of them was real or could come close to justifying precluding Mueller from serving as Special Counsel.\u201d", "On May 23, 2017, shortly after Mueller was\u00a0appointed\u00a0special counsel, Justice Department ethics officials\u00a0concluded\u00a0it was \u201cappropriate\u201d for Mueller to lead the investigation even though his former law firm, WilmerHale, had represented Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; his daughter, Ivanka Trump; and Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.", "Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores noted that Mueller himself was not involved in representing Kushner, Manafort or Ivanka Trump. \u201cMr. Mueller is permitted to participate in matters involving his former firm\u2019s clients so long as he has no confidential information about the client and did not participate in the representation,\u201d she said.", "Nonetheless, the president repeatedly made public claims highlighting his other concerns about Mueller\u2019s purported conflicts. Most recently, Trump made his case for Mueller\u2019s conflicts in a speech at the 2019 Conservative Political Action Conference on March 3.", "Trump, March 3: But we have conflicts. I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said, why isn\u2019t that mentioned? He wanted the job as FBI Director. I mean, these are things that are out there; they know it. Why isn\u2019t that \u2014 and I didn\u2019t give it to him. Why isn\u2019t that mentioned?", "Trump detailed those same accusations during an interview with the Daily Caller last fall.", "Trump, Sept. 4, 2018: But I view it [the Mueller investigation] as being illegal for many reasons. Some of which are that, number one there was no crime and number two everybody was conflicted, including Mueller. There were, I mean tremendous conflicts here, you know the conflicts, you\u2019ve heard the conflicts.", "Daily Caller: Speaking of one which you cited, I\u2019d like to know, you said you interviewed Mueller for FBI director.", "Trump: Sitting right in that chair.", "Daily Caller: What did you think during the interview?", "Trump: I liked him, but I didn\u2019t give him the job?", "Daily Caller: Why?", "Trump: But I had a business dispute with Mueller before that. I had a real business dispute.", "And during an interview on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d\u00a0last summer.", "Trump, Aug. 23, 2018: When you see Mueller with all the conflicts. He\u2019s so conflicted. Comey\u2019s his best friend. He had a really nasty business transaction with me, which he never reported. I\u2019ve been talking about it; he never reports it. I mean, you look at the bad things. He wanted the FBI job, that Christopher Wray has.\u201d", "And, of course, Trump has repeated the claim on Twitter.", "Is Robert Mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump, including the fact that we had a very nasty & contentious business relationship, I turned him down to head the FBI (one day before appointment as S.C.) & Comey is his close friend..", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2018", "FBI Director James Comey was fired on May 9, 2017, and the administration set out quickly to find his replacement in what turned out to be a very public vetting process.", "On May 12, 2017, Politico reported that four people \u2014\u00a0acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, former Justice Department Criminal Division Chief Alice Fisher and former U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Michael Garcia \u2014 were set to be interviewed the next day. \u201cHenry E. Hudson, U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia, Fran Townsend, former Homeland Security Adviser to former President George W. Bush, and Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, were also interviewed,\u201d the story said.", "Similarly, the Washington Post\u00a0and Bloomberg\u00a0each named eight people who were interviewed on May 14, 2017. PBS listed 14 possible candidates for the job.", "But there was no media mention of Mueller at that time.", "But according to Trump, after he fired Comey, Mueller came to him to interview for the director\u2019s position \u2014 a job that Mueller held for 12 years until he retired in 2013 \u2014 but Trump says he turned him down. According to Trump, Mueller \u201cwanted the job \u2026 and I didn\u2019t give it to him.\u201d", "That narrative was echoed by an unnamed White House official in June of 2017, as\u00a0reported by CNN and others.", "In an interview on June 15, 2017, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about the meeting between Trump and Mueller. She said it was her understanding that it was a job interview on the day before Mueller was named as special counsel, though she wasn\u2019t aware of whether it was for acting or permanent FBI director. Sanders did not answer the question about why the administration hadn\u2019t mentioned him as a possible candidate, as it did with others.", "Bannon, however, has a different recollection of events.", "In an interview with investigators, \u201cBannon recalled that the White House had invited Mueller to speak to the President to offer a perspective on the institution of the FBI. Bannon said that, although the White House thought about beseeching Mueller to become Director again, he did not come in looking for the job.\u201d", "In other words, Bannon says Mueller did not come to the White House for a job interview. And it was the White House, not Mueller, that was considering wooing Mueller into taking the job.", "We reached out to Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, for more details about what actually took place at the meeting, whether it was an interview, and whether Mueller was seeking the director job. \u201cWe\u2019ll decline comment beyond the report,\u201d Carr said.", "Trump also claimed that Mueller had a conflict because the two men had a \u201cvery nasty & contentious business relationship\u201d regarding Mueller\u2019s membership fees at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia. Through a spokesman, Mueller has denied that there was a dispute.", "\u201cMr. Mueller left the club in October 2011 without dispute,\u201d special counsel spokesman\u00a0Joshua Stueve told DailyMail.com\u00a0in July 2017.", "Mueller\u2019s report provides some details on how and why Mueller left the club \u2014 but none of it suggests that the two men had a \u201cvery nasty & contentious business relationship.\u201d", "According to the report, Mueller informed the club in a letter on Oct. 12, 2011, that he would no longer be a member. The letter \u201cnoted that \u2018we live in the District and find that we are unable to make full use of the Club\u2019 and that inquired \u2018whether we would be entitled to a refund of a portion of our initial membership fee,\u2019 which was paid in 1994,\u201d the report said.", "\u201cAbout two weeks later, the controller of the club responded that the Muellers\u2019 resignation would be effective October 31, 2011, and that they would be \u2018placed on a waitlist to be refunded on a first resigned/first refunded basis\u2019 in accordance with the club\u2019s legal documents,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe Muellers have not had further contact with the club.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
