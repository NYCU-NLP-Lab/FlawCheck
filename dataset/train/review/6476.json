It uses an offensive slur and it is deeply offensive and mocks our long and proud heritage.", "The name is offensive, their logo stereotypes European Americans as people who sit on chairs and lean against what appears to be a bourbon barrel, claiming we are all a bunch of alcoholics. Sure, they'll SAY it's a \"cracker\" barrel but everyone knows crackers don't come in barrels, they come in bags and boxes!", "Change the name C****er Barrel to Caucasian Barrel. After all, white people should have something to be offended by, too!", "The petition was popular on social media sites, where some users found it clever (and others claimed the joke as their own):", "I demand that Cracker Barrel immediately change its name to Caucasian Barrel because I am offended", "\u2014 Jamey McMahan (@jameymcmahan75) July 10, 2015", "Since @Redskins name is offensive, we should change the @CrackerBarrel name next. #RedskinsNation pic.twitter.com/v9rWHs61YD \u2014 David (@dpartenio) July 10, 2015", "We need to change the name Cracker Barrel to Caucasian Barrel.
