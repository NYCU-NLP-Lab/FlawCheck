["A Facebook post, archived here and published on July 22, 2020, includes an image of what looks like a monument perched on the side of a mountain surrounded by arid land. Shared dozens of times, the caption in the post asks \u201cwho built this in africa (sic)\u201d.", "People commenting on the picture suggest it may have been taken in Tigray, Ethiopia, a popular stop for tourists and a region where Ethiopians believe the Ark of the Covenant was brought from Jerusalem by King Solomon 3,000 years ago.", "The biblical references are not far off but reverse image searches show that the picture is only a composite and the impressive-looking structure is an imaginary depiction of an ancient site in Israel, not in Ethiopia or anywhere else in Africa.", "The image can be found on Wikimedia Commons, a database free for public use.", "Under the file name \u201cMasada BW A.JPG\u201d, the description of the image says that it is a \u201cmodel of the northern palace\u201d. Dated February 24, 2008, it is credited to Berthold Werner.", "\u201cThis is a retouched picture, which means that it has been digitally altered from its original version,\u201d reads additional information on the image, before specifying that it is composed of two pictures -- \u201cone for the palace and one for the background\u201d.", "Werner, who died in 2017, maintained his own Wikimedia page where he published multiple images of new and old sites in Israel.", "Another Wikimedia page called Herod the Great replicates Werner\u2019s image in a section labelled \u201cModels of the Northern palace at Masada\u201d.", "Indeed, Masada exists, in Israel and not Africa, but only as ruins.", "Originally an ancient fortress constructed between 37 BCE and 4CE by Herod in Israel\u2019s Judean Desert, the site overlooks the Dead Sea. It was occupied by Jewish rebels after the Jewish revolt in the first century, also known as \u201cthe siege of Masada\u201d, where it was defended against a Roman army for months.", "Masada today is a recognised heritage site and the model of Herod\u2019s imagined northern palace used by Werner in his image can be viewed on-site or downloaded from the Unesco website here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
