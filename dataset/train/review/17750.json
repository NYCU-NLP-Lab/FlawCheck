How can this be? Simply put, our privacy laws are outdated.\"", "Since May, when former government defense contractor Edward Snowden leaked the details of two National Security Agency spy programs that track phone and Internet communications, there has been a heightened interest in how much privacy Americans actually have.", "PolitiFact Georgia gets and sends a lot of email. We wanted to know whether our bygone missives could be subject to government perusal, so we went looking for answers.", "Graves\u2019 update referenced the Email Privacy Act that he introduced, along with U.S. Reps. Kevin Yoder and Jared Polis, to update the current electronic communication privacy laws. The bill, introduced in May, has gained 137 bipartisan co-sponsors and has been referred to a House committee. The Graves bill is a companion to a similar bill being pushed in the Senate by U.S. Sens. Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee. The Senate bill passed out of committee and is up for a full chamber vote.", "If passed, both bills would update the current law that governs data storage, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. The ECPA, passed in 1986, regulates government access to private information that is transmitted and stored on the Internet, such as email. The law considers emails stored on third-party servers for longer than 180 days as abandoned. The 1986 law allows federal agencies to obtain a subpoena -- but doesn\u2019t require a warrant from a judge -- to view the records. (Emails less than 180 days old do require a judicial warrant to obtain.)", "\"The (ECPA) was written at a time when people didn\u2019t store emails on a server and there was no cloud. Storage was expensive and most people didn\u2019t keep emails long -- they downloaded things to the desktop,\" said Mark Stanley, a campaign and communications strategist for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit public policy organization that works to improve privacy in communications technology.", "When the law was written, users of the early Internet often downloaded emails directly to their hard drives to save them. \u00a0Service providers deleted messages on their servers immediately to free up valuable storage space. Today, storage space is practically unlimited. Deleting messages from your inbox doesn\u2019t preclude them from still existing on your computer\u2019s hard drive, your email provider\u2019s server, or in the inbox or on the server of the person receiving the email.", "Graves\u2019 email privacy act would drop the 180-day provision from the existing law and require a warrant to obtain the emails. The bill \"would ensure that Fourth Amendment protections Americans already have for mail, phone calls, and other paper/hard documents are extended to their soft communications too,\" the three congressmen wrote in a Wired op-ed.", "One exception exists to the current electronic communications privacy law, but not in our area. A ruling in a 2010 federal appeals court case, United States v. Warshak, found that police violated a man\u2019s constitutional rights by reading his emails without a warrant. The Supreme Court has not addressed this case, and the ruling only applies to states in the court\u2019s 6th Circuit jurisdiction of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee.", "Because of this ruling, email and Internet companies Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo require warrants and subpoenas to release emails and other stored data.

GovTrack, which follows federal legislation, gives Graves\u2019 bill only an 8 percent chance of being enacted; the Senate bill fares a bit better at 14 percent.
