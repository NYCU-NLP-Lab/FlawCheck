["\u201cAfter PM Modi completed one year of his term in office, I praised him for the work done so far, on which Sonia Gandhi took umbrage and became angry. Once, while coming out after addressing the parliament, I happened to come face to face with her. She was accompanied by Gulam Nabi Azad and Mani Shanker Aiyer, who greeted me but Sonia kept waiting for me to greet her first. She forgot that the First Citizen of the country was in front of her. She had to acknowledge the President of the country and not Pranab Mukherjee. This greatly pained me from inside, that Sonia is so used to subservience.\u201d If Postcard News is to be believed, these are words of former President Pranab Mukherjee extracted from his book. But then Postcard News is not to be believed.", "The Facebook page of the fake news website, Postcard News has posted an excerpt from former President\u2019s book that expresses his admiration for PM Modi and displeasure with Sonia Gandhi.

In fact, it is yet to be penned down by the author. Former president Mukherjee\u2019s earlier books covered the time period before his presidency.

The founder of the website was recently arrested for circulating fake news. As we have always said, the fake news doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. It needs an ecosystem of supporters around it who encourage it and help it to flourish. Alt News had documented several instances where prominent leaders of the ruling party have shared the articles of this fake news peddling website. Of late, the editor of the website has even found a place in debates run by Republic TV and has ironically shared views on the menace of fake news.
