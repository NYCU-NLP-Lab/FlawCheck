["Weeks after\u00a0the bitterly fought presidential race ended\u00a0with the naming of Joe Biden as the projected winner over President Donald Trump, some are still claiming a victor can not yet be\u00a0named.", "\u201cPresident Trump won and the world is starting to see!

The Biden-Harris ticket gained roughly 51% of the popular vote to the Trump-Pence ticket\u2019s 47%, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.", "But as the 2000 and 2016 elections showed, the popular vote is not the sole \u00a0determinant of presidential elections; the Electoral College makes the final call.", "Each state is allowed a number of electors, which is determined by adding its number of senators (always two) to its number of House representatives (varies by state). Nationwide, there are 538 electoral votes to cast.", "On Election Day, people vote for their preferred candidate's electors, who are chosen by political parties or independent candidates before the election. Those individuals, collectively the Electoral College, then cast votes for president and vice president, usually representing the choice their state's voters made.", "Candidates have to win at least half of the country's electoral votes (270 votes) to be elected president.", "Biden is projected to receive 306 electoral votes to Trump\u2019s projected 232, thanks to wins in key states like Georgia (16 electoral votes), Michigan (16 votes), Wisconsin (10 votes), Pennsylvania (20 votes) and Arizona (11 votes). Trump won by the same Electoral College breakdown in 2016, which he called a \u201cmassive landslide victory\u201d at the time.", "The Trump campaign and its allies flooded state and federal courts after the election, filing over 40 lawsuits, primarily in battleground states,\u00a0\u00a0according to a running tally by Marc Elias, a Democratic elections expert and founder of\u00a0Democracy Docket. The lawsuits\u00a0claimed\u00a0ballots had errors because voters were required to use Sharpies,\u00a0observers didn't have enough access to monitor ballot counting and late-arriving mail ballots were improperly mixed with legal votes.", "None has gotten very far; just\u00a0one case has been won and at least eight are pending.", "More:Texas attorney general asks Supreme Court to block Biden victory in 4 states", "Dave Wasserman, House editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, told USA TODAY that Trump has no path to victory.", "\"The case for Trump having won the election is so preposterous that the only explanation is that the losing side does not like the results,\" he said.", "More:For these Trump supporters primed to disbelieve defeat, challenging the election was a civic duty", "Many Trump supporters have expressed disbelief that Biden won, and by such margins. But Biden\u2019s campaign won\u00a0 by persuading just enough swing voters, making gains in unexpected states and rebuilding the coveted \u201cblue wall\u201d that toppled in 2016.", "According to CNN\u2019s national exit poll, 94% of self-described Democrats voted for Biden in 2020 compared to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 89% of self-described Democrats  in 2016, and 89% of self-described liberals, compared to Clinton\u2019s 84%.", "Biden\u2019s victory was really won on the basis of support from moderates and independents, though. He received 64% of votes cast by self-described moderates, 12 points ahead of Clinton, and won independents by 13 points \u2013 a group that Clinton lost by 4 points.", "Biden continued to build on the groundwork laid out by Clinton in historically red states like Arizona and Georgia. Clinton did not win Arizona or Georgia in 2016, but she did perform better than Obama in both. The swing toward Biden in those states was more than double his national swing, CNN reported.", "Wasserman said he predicted prior to the election that\u00a0Arizona and Georgia would flip, but the similar states of Texas and Florida would not due to their Hispanic electorate.", "\"It's the fact that Texas and Florida have such high Hispanic shares, but in particular, in Florida, the Hispanic electorate is substantially Cuban, and we knew that that was a particular strength for Trump entering this election, whereas in Arizona, Hispanic voters are predominantly of Mexican ancestry and Trump did not make as strong astride among those voters,\" he said. \"In Georgia, there's not much of a Hispanic vote to speak of so it was really a question of what the shift would be in the Atlanta suburbs.\"", "Fact check:Video claim that Dominion tech manipulated Georgia votes is false", "Trump suggested throughout his campaign that Biden would \"destroy the beautiful suburbs,\" but it turned out many suburbanites disagreed.", "Biden won back a number of crucial Midwest states that Clinton lost to Trump in 2016 largely thanks to suburban voters. The cluster of historically Democrat-won states, dubbed the \u201cblue wall,\u201d include three of the five major battleground states this election cycle.", "\"We saw a consistent pattern across the country, in both close states and states that weren't so close, that Biden made significant strides compared to Clinton's performance four years ago in suburbs, predominantly affluent suburbs, of major metro areas,\" Wasserman said.", "In Wisconsin, the divide between the state's rural and urban populations was defined, as 42 Wisconsin counties, many small and rural, cast more ballots for Trump than in 2016. Biden won Wisconsin by bolstering support in the populous suburbs of Milwaukee and Madison, despite average turnout in the cities themselves. Biden\u00a0erased Trump's entire 2016 margin in Wisconsin in just the counties surrounding Milwaukee, Wasserman said.", "That same divide made Michigan competitive. Biden made gains in counties like Kent, where Grand Rapids is located, and the Detroit metropolitan area, though he underperformed Clinton in the city of Detroit. Trump improved his margins statewide, but not enough to surpass Biden\u2019s lead.", "Biden again leaned on the suburbs of major metropolitan areas in Pennsylvania, outperforming Clinton by more than 150,000 votes in the four counties surrounding Philadelphia. Wasserman said Biden erased Trump's 2016 margin in just two of those counties.", "Since cities are typically\u00a0Democratic strongholds, as are rural areas for Republicans, the suburbs in between the two have always been highly contested. According to the Brookings Institute, there was a shift in large suburban counties from a 1.2 million vote advantage for Trump in 2016 to a 613,000 vote advantage for Biden as of mid-November.", "Trump and his allies have largely pointed toward cities as the crux of unfounded claims of fraud, but cities aren't to blame for the president's loss.", "\"There's also a pretty consistent pattern that cities are some of the only places where Trump performed better than he did four years ago,\" Wasserman said, pointing to Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Detroit \u2013 all cities in swing states \u2013 as well as New York and Chicago.", "\"The idea that somehow the patterns don't line up is preposterous,\u00a0because we're seeing them in both the close\u00a0states and the non-competitive states.\"", "The \"blue wall\" wasn't the only place Biden won back with help from the suburbs. In Georgia, the state was flipped blue due to a combination of higher turnout in Atlanta and massive gains in the suburbs around it.", "In Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta, Biden beat Trump by 240,000 votes\u00a0to Clinton's 180,000 votes. And, in growing suburban counties Gwinnett and Cobb, which are farther out from Atlanta, Biden beat Trump by 132,000 votes. Clinton won those counties combined by just 26,000 votes.", "Wasserman said that Biden's success in the suburbs is likely due to both attitudinal change in the past four years and the exodus of Black voters nationwide from cities to suburbs.", "Fact check:Biden won popular, Electoral College votes in several battleground states", "Biden will be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, whether Trump acknowledges his win as legitimate or not. Biden has already begun the process of transitioning to the country\u2019s highest office.", "Though Trump has not formally conceded, his administration has granted the new administration access to intelligence briefings, office space, secure computers and other government services, USA TODAY previously reported. Trump tweeted Nov. 23 that the move was made at his recommendation.", "The announcement, made by Emily Murphy of the General Services Administration, allocated over $6 million to Biden\u2019s transition team for hiring and other transition-related expenses.
