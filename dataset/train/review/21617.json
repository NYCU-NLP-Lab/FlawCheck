["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on April 28, 2020", "Numerous websites are spreading a false story claiming that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u201cpromises to resign\u201d if President Donald Trump is reelected. The story originated on a website that calls its content satire, but has since been shared as if it were true.", "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has remained a prominent focus for stories published by America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, the network of websites that calls its work \u201csatire\u201d but whose content often deceives social media users \u2014 or is republished elsewhere and presented as fact.", "Fictitious headlines about Pelosi created by America\u2019s Last Line of Defense have claimed, for example, that Pelosi used Social Security money to pay for the House impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. Another claimed Pelosi vowed to resign if that impeachment effort failed. Neither was true.", "Now, a made-up story first published on bustatroll.org, asserting that \u201cPelosi Promises to Resign if Trump is Re-Elected,\u201d has migrated to at least six other websites, including gnfnews.com,\u00a0nlatimes.com,\u00a0sugend.com,\u00a0kuncinews.com,\u00a0monatimes.com,\u00a0and portaliamerican.com.", "Together, the story on those various websites accrued more than 31,000 Facebook engagements, according\u00a0to CrowdTangle data. The links were shared in many pro-Trump Facebook groups, where commenters often welcomed the erroneous information.", "For those who clicked through and read the original version of the story, published April 10 on bustatroll.org, there are multiple indicators that the story is a fabrication. There\u2019s a \u201csatire rated\u201d mark in the header image on the website, and a tag beneath the headline reads: \u201cPelosi Satire with Chile Sauce and Liquid Cheese.\u201d", "But none of the websites that republished the story uses clear disclaimers to indicate the story is completely bogus.", "One version re-uses an image of Pelosi from the original website that has a hardly visible watermark on Pelosi\u2019s jacket collar that signifies \u201csatire rated.\u201d Another version appears to edit that out.", "And the text of the made-up tale otherwise largely reads like a news report on a supposed announcement in which Pelosi said she would \u201cresign\u201d if the president is reelected because Trump would be \u201cthere to block my agenda\u201d \u2014 even though the announcement never happened.", "It goes on to quote a \u201cSenator Soundbite himself, Joe Barron\u201d who \u201cwas delighted to hear the news of Pelosi\u2019s resignation.\u201d That may be intended as a nod to the \u201cJohn Barron\u201d alter ego Trump reportedly used when acting as his own spokesman in New York City early in his career. There is no senator by that name.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Accessed 28 Apr 2020.", "Dunlop, W.G. \u201cPelosi did not pledge to resign if impeachment \u2018fails.\u2019\u201d AFP Fact Check. 3 Feb 2020.", "Fisher, Marc and\u00a0Will Hobson. \u201cDonald Trump masqueraded as publicist to brag about himself.\u201d Washington Post. 13 May 2016.", "\u201cPelosi Promises to Resign if Trump is Re-Elected.\u201d BustaTroll.org. 10 Apr 2020.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
