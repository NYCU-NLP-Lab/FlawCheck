["A Facebook post shared nearly 1,000 times in South Africa claims that Mel Gibson has \u201cblown the whistle on the epidemic of \u2018parasites\u2019 who \u2018control Hollywood\u2019 that are involved in #childSacrifice and. #pedophilia\u201d (sic).", "The post alleges that the star said \u201cevery studio in Hollywood is bought and paid for with the blood of innocent children\u201d.", "Internet searches of the post\u2019s headline \u201cMEL GIBSON'S SHOCKING REVELATION ON HOLLYWOOD\u201d found articles with the same content here and here from March 4, 2020.", "The claim quotes Gibson as saying that \u201ckey players in the movie business... perform sacred rituals that are sick and totally at odds with the moral fabric that binds most patriotic Americans. The worst part: It\u2019s an open secret in Hollywood and everyone wants in on it.\u201d", "It alleges that the actor made the comments while promoting the movie \u201cDaddy\u2019s Home 2\u201d in 2017 in London. More specifically, the post claims Gibson said these things to TV guests backstage after appearing on the Graham Norton Show.", "Brief red carpet interviews here, here and here at the London premiere strictly promoted the comedy and nothing else. The same could be said for another interview here in which Gibson and fellow actor John Lithgow are taught \u201cdad jokes\u201d.", "The closest Gibson appears to speak on the entertainment industry during the movie\u2019s promotion is in this interview, again alongside Lithgow, where the pair are asked by Associated Press about the Weinstein sexual harassment scandal.", "Gibson describes it as a \u201ctragic healing process\u201d but makes none of the utterances claimed in the fake posts.", "Part of the claim is that Gibson made his comments after appearing on The Graham Norton Show for British television, where he allegedly called Hollywood an \u201cinstitutionalised pedophile ring\u201d that \u201cuse and abuse kids for their own sick spiritual beliefs.\u201d", "He is also purported to have said that he was blacklisted by Hollywood in 2006 \u201cfor voicing his opinions about the industry that clashed with their liberal agenda,\u201d but Gibson has featured in at least 14 movies since then.", "\u201cThey see the blood of a sexually abused infant as the \u2018ultimate prize\u2019 and say that it\u2019s \u2018highly enriched. Babies are like a \u2018premium currency\u2019 and hold a higher value of anything else you can think of: Diamonds, drugs, caviar, you name it. They are literally trading these kids like a currency for favors, movie roles, kickback,\u201d the claims go on to say.", "No record", "There is no public record anywhere of Gibson making those statements and his publicist Alan Nierob denied the actor had ever said any of the quotes attributed to him.", "Nierob told AFP Fact Check he had not seen the claims before nor does he know where they stem from.", "But AFP Fact Check traced the probable origin of the claims to a story published in 2017 on a website formerly called Your News Wire that has since changed its name and removed the online article for failing to meet \u201ceditorial standards\u201d.", "\u201cWhen we moved domains to NewsPunch.com in 2019, stories like this no longer adhered to our new editorial standards.\u201d", "\u201cWe originally published this story on our old domain YourNewsWire.com back in 2017,\u201d said Sean Adl-Tabatabai, co-founder of News Punch (formerly Your News Wire), in an email to AFP Fact Check. \u201cBack then we would screen bizarre stories from people who emailed in, and we would also source some of our stories from obscure blogs on the web -- many of these stories would then be published on the website.\u201d", "The author who submitted the content and subsequently promoted a link to it on his Facebook page was Baxter Dmitry. His Facebook page describes him as a journalist who is \u201cpassionate about motor sports, military history and the truth\u201d.", "\u201cWhen we moved domains to NewsPunch.com in 2019, stories like this no longer adhered to our new editorial standards,\u201d Adl-Tabatabai said. \u201cSpecifically there was no proof that Mel Gibson said any of the statements quoted in the original article. Because of this, we decided to unpublish the story, as the claims being made in it could not be adequately fact-checked by us.\u201d", "Still, it hasn\u2019t stopped the claim spreading online, particularly among QAnon conspiracy communities, like this Facebook page called\u00a0 \u201cChasing The White Rabbit -17anon- .v2.0 Revived\u201d, which shared the post here.", "The page, which was previously shut down and recreated on January 20, 2019, is managed by three people out of Poland and one person from the United States, according to the Facebook page transparency information, and it promotes the idea of a \"deep state satanic mafia\" that rules every aspect of the world.", "QAnon adherents generally believe that dozens of global elites, many seen as \u201cleft wing\u201d or \u201cliberal\u201d, are behind a worldwide paedophile network. Part of their narrative casts US President Donald Trump as the avenger of abused children and the saviour of humanity.", "Another recent post published on the same page has been fact-checked by other independent organisations.", "Gibson took flak for an anti-Semitic tirade during a 2006 drunk-driving arrest. He later apologised, blaming it on alcoholism.", "He has voiced some criticism for Hollywood in the past. In a clip from an old interview\u00a0shared on YouTube, Gibson spoke about arriving in Hollywood and the \u201ccockroach resilience\u201d a person needs to survive in the town.", "In the edited clip, which could be easily taken out of context, Gibson says: \u201cA place like this can humiliate you and it can be humbling, it does rip your life to pieces if you\u2019ll let it and it\u2019s always pounding at the walls, these little guys, these little heathens with no soul downstairs with horns on their heads with a battering ram trying to beat your walls in, but that\u2019s your own devils, you know.\u201d", "However, he doesn\u2019t say anything about paedophilia or child sacrifices.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
