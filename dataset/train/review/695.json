(AP)", "Donald Trump\u2019s tweet cites a report from One America News, a pro-Trump television network. That report relies on an \u201cunaudited analysis\u201d that appears to have originated in a thread on a website called TheDonald.win.", "That thread cited Edison Research data as its source. But Edison Research, which helps provide exit polling data, told us it has found no evidence of voter fraud in its data.", "Dominion Voting Systems, state election officials and the federal government say there\u2019s no evidence that millions of votes were miscounted.", "Since Joe Biden was elected to be the next U.S. president, President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that voter fraud affected the outcome of the race. Now, Trump says millions of votes cast for him were deleted.", "In a Nov. 12 tweet, Trump blamed Dominion Voting Systems, a company that makes voting machines. As evidence, he cited a report from One America News Network, a pro-Trump television network.", "\"Dominion deleted 2.7 million Trump votes nationwide,\" the president said in his tweet, quoting the OANN report. \"Data analysis finds 221,000 Pennsylvania votes switched from President Trump to Biden. 941,000 Trump votes deleted. States using Dominion Voting Systems switched 435,000 votes from Trump to Biden.\"", "Since Election Day, Trump has refused to concede the presidential race to Biden and doubled down on unproven allegations of fraud. Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, has also fanned unproven allegations that Dominion changed votes for the president.", "Trump\u2019s tweet about millions of deleted votes doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, either.", "(Screenshot from Twitter)", "The report Trump cited in his tweet aired on OANN on Nov. 12.
