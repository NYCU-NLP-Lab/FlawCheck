["The national anti-tax group Club for Growth, whose\u00a0political action committee\u00a0is backing conservatives in seven U.S. Senate and House races around the country, released a TV ad through one of its affiliates\u00a0that attacks Leah Vukmir.", "The ad, produced by CFG Action Wisconsin and released July 12, 2018,\u00a0makes a series of claims against the Wisconsin Republican, starting with this one:", "\"Vukmir wrote a letter seeking leniency for a fellow state legislator convicted of sexual assault.\"", "As we\u2019ll see, Vukmir did write a letter that was clearly in support of the lawmaker.", "The case", "Vukmir, a suburban Milwaukee state senator, and political newcomer Kevin Nicholson, who is endorsed by Club for Growth, are running in the GOP primary on Aug. 14, 2018. The winner will face Democrat Tammy Baldwin on Nov. 6, 2018.", "See all of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race.", "The TV ad footnotes a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article that revealed the existence of Vukmir\u2019s letter. The letter was sent on behalf of then-Rep. Bill Kramer of the Town of Waukesha, the onetime Republican leader of the state Assembly.", "According to the December 2017 article, which cited court records as a source:", "Vukmir wrote a brief character reference letter for Kramer in 2014, a month after Kramer pleaded no contest to two counts of fourth-degree sexual assault, both misdemeanors, in a plea bargain. He originally was charged with two felonies.", "The letter was sent to the judge in Waukesha County, in suburban Milwaukee, just before the judge sentenced Kramer to three years of probation that included five months in jail with work-release privileges.", "The conviction stemmed from a 2011 incident outside a Republican Party event at a tavern. The victim told the court she feared Kramer might rape her after she resisted his advances, which included shoving her against a car, forcibly kissing her, putting his hands up her shirt and grabbing her groin.", "The victim did not report it at the time, but came forward after Kramer allegedly groped a legislative aide\u2019s breasts and bragged about his sexual prowess to a female lobbyist at a 2014 fundraiser in Washington, D.C.", "Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc.", "The letter", "Here\u2019s what Vukmir\u2019s letter said:", "I have known Bill Kramer for over 12 years and consider him a friend. I have known Bill when he was drinking and I have known Bill when he was not drinking.", "By the time of his sentencing, Bill will have been sober for 270 days. Being sober has had a profound impact on Bill for the better. I also think it is important to recognize that Bill became sober under his own volition. Bill became sober to improve his life, not because he was sent to a court-mandated program.", "I believe this change has improved Bill\u2019s life considerably.", "Analysis", "Club for Growth spokesman Bob Pipkin defended the group\u2019s claim by referring us to an article about the disclosure of Vukmir\u2019s letter in the Wisconsin Gazette, which describes itself as a progressive, alternative newspaper.", "\"We took the interpretation of a liberal Wisconsin newspaper; they interpreted it as leniency,\" he told us.", "A caption to a photo with the article says Vukmir sought leniency, although the headline and the first sentence of the article merely said Vukmir sent a letter supporting Kramer.", "Mattias Gugel, a Vukmir campaign spokesman, told us: \"The accusation that Leah wrote a letter asking for leniency is a blatant lie. She simply spoke about a colleague seeking help for addiction issues.\"", "But it\u2019s not as though Vukmir\u2019s letter would have been seen by the judge as urging a harsher sentence for Kramer rather than a lighter one.", "We also sought views from two lawyers based in Waukesha County, where Kramer is from and where the crime occurred.", "Criminal defense lawyer Jerome Buting, known for his work on the case made famous by the film \"Making a Murderer,\" said Vukmir\u2019s letter does seek leniency:", "If you write a letter on behalf of a defendant at sentencing, most of the time I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that\u2019s seeking leniency, whether it\u2019s expressed that way or not. You're trying to convey to the judge that this one incident doesn\u2019t necessarily portray everything about his (the defendant\u2019s) character, and that is one of the big factors the court has to consider in sentencing.", "Paul Bucher, who does criminal defense work and is the former district attorney in Waukesha County, disagreed, saying some letters explicitly ask for leniency or no jail time and Vukmir\u2019s doesn't:", "We do character letters all the time because all the court really knows about the client is what is in the criminal complaint. So, the job of a defense \u00a0lawyer is to give the judge a broader picture of who is standing in front of him. (Vukmir\u2019s letter is) a pretty standard, boilerplate, character letter.", "But even if it doesn\u2019t go far as some, Vukmir\u2019s letter clearly was written to help Kramer.", "Our rating", "Club for Growth says Vukmir \"wrote a letter seeking leniency for a fellow state legislator convicted of sexual assault.\"", "It\u2019s fair to say that letters written on behalf of criminal defendants facing sentencing cover a range. Vukmir\u2019s letter to the judge in Kramer\u2019s case is limited to Kramer\u2019s character. It doesn\u2019t go as far as some letters in such cases that explicitly ask for leniency or lighter treatment, such as probation rather than jail.", "But while the word leniency might mean different things to different people, it\u2019s clear that Vukmir\u2019s letter was written to benefit Kramer \u2014 in other words, seeking a lighter sentence, rather than a harsher one.", "We rate Club for Growth\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "Editor's note: This item was corrected on July 18, 2018, after it was first published, to clarify the Club for Growth entities.", "YouTube, Club for Growth TV ad, July 12, 2018", "Email, Leah Vukmir campaign spokesman Mattias Gugel, July 16, 2018", "Leah Vukmir letter to Waukesha County Circuit Court, Nov. 20, 2014", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"U.S. Senate candidate Leah Vukmir wrote letter on behalf of lawmaker convicted of sex assault,\" Dec. 1, 2017", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Rep.
