["About this rating", "Some customers in China are buying bottles and cans of fresh air.", "The companies selling the air are not Chinese firms, the air is sold in compressed form in cans or in bottles (not in plastic bags), and the product is not necessarily being  bought as a practical source of clean air.", "It may have started as a joke in the Mel Brooks satire \"Spaceballs,\" but in February 2016 various publications began reporting that bottles of fresh air were being sold to Chinese customers seeking relief from persistent air pollution in major cities such as Beijing.", "As countries such as China and India have developed industrially, they have also developed major smog problems.  In December 2016, the New York Times reported that Beijing officials sparked controversy when they listed smog as a natural disaster:", "Beijing is still reeling from a grimy November, and public anger over smog is running high. Some are concerned that classifying the murky air as a natural disaster will reduce pressure on officials to fix the problem, The Beijing News said.", "Levels of fine particulate air pollution, known as PM2.5, soared to a monthly average of 100 micrograms per cubic meter in November, according to Luo Yi, head of the Ministry of Environmental Protection\u2019s environmental monitoring bureau, a ministry statement said. PM2.5 particles are smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, and they can enter deep into the lungs and even into the bloodstream.", "Across the so-called Jingjinji region \u2014 which is home to 130 million people and includes Beijing, the surrounding province of Hebei and the port city of Tianjin \u2014 the average PM2.5 level in November was 102 micrograms per cubic meter, Mr. Luo said.", "According to the World Health Organization, which has stricter guidelines than most countries, yearly averages of PM2.5 levels should not exceed 10 micrograms per cubic meter.", "Moses Lam, a Canadian entrepreneur, saw an unlikely product opportunity in this phenomenon: pristine Canadian Rockies air. Lam said his canned air business is booming:", "We\u2019re selling fresh air in China, but we sell in a can, not in a bag. We started our company first selling two Ziploc bags full of air. After we sold them on eBay, we figured there might be a bit of a market there, and we wanted to improve our product. So we started compressing air in cans.", "Now Lam's company, Vitality Air, sells thousands of cans of fresh air collected from Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. He has customers in China, India and South Korea, with a developing market in Vietnam.", "On 3 January 2017, the Chinese government announced that 24 cities were on \"red alert\" for smog, with \"red\" being the most serious level for alerts in China's four-tiered public warning system. Lam said that during the winter months, pollution gets worse because Chinese citizens are heating their homes and burning coal, which adds to pollution produced by coal-burning factories:", "The pollution and our sales for product goes hand in hand for sure. We see a spike in sales, we also see a spike in people asking for distributorship of our products. Every time this year we move thousands and thousands of bottles.", "Lam said he's seen photographs of Chinese people selling each other inflated bags of air, but that's not where he got the idea. Vitality, which incorporated in 2015, has a 24-foot trailer and 14,000 pounds of equipment (including a giant vacuum device) which Lam uses when he drives from Edmonton to Banff and collects 200,000 liters of air over about a 40-hour period. The air is compressed into containers that double as face masks, allowing customers to experience the smell and quality of Rocky Mountain air for about 160 breaths:", "Lovin' that Rocky Mtn air!
