Rick Scott said Florida did nothing special to lure 300 Deutsche Bank jobs to the state.", "Companies are practically tripping over each other to relocate to Florida because of its alluring beaches and business-friendly approach. At least that\u2019s the picture Gov. Rick Scott painted during a June 24, 2013, interview on Fox News.", "\"That\u2019s why companies like just today, Deutsche Bank, added 300 jobs right here in Florida,\" Scott told host Stuart Varney on Your World with Neil Cavuto. \"Last week, I was with the Paris Air Show. We have companies from France, companies from Virginia moving to Florida. So it\u2019s clearly working in our state. And I hope you\u2019ll buy a one-way ticket and do your show down here.\"", "Varney chuckled, then pressed for more details. \"That\u2019s an invitation I might just take up. Quickly though, Deutsche Bank, they\u2019re bringing 300 jobs to Florida, I think they\u2019re going to Jacksonville. Can you tell me, did you offer them something special? Did you say, I\u2019ll build you an exit off the freeway? No property taxes for a time? Did you do anything like that at all to get them in?\"", "Scott dismissed the notion. \"No, what we do is we make sure we have an educated workforce. You know, you can\u2019t have a lower income tax than zero. Our business taxes are going down every year, so that\u2019s happening. I cut the, I got rid of the sales tax on machinery and equipment for our manufacturers. So every year, we\u2019re trying to make our state a state that no one can compete with because we like jobs. We like businesses. I want to make sure we\u2019re the No. 1 state for your family to get a job, get a great education and afford to live.\"", "We wondered whether Florida nabbed a big jobs deal without offering \"something special,\" as Varney put it.", "In a statement tied to the jobs announcement, the managing director of Deutsche Bank Jacksonville hailed the \"tremendous support from the state of Florida and the City of Jacksonville,\" which he said \"played a large part in our decision to increase our footprint at this location.\"", "What kind of support? The state wouldn\u2019t tell us, saying that information is shielded from public records laws, but a look at news clips and city council legislation filled in the blanks well enough.", "The short answer: money.", "Deutsche Bank has received a bevy of state and local tax incentives since starting a Jacksonvillle campus in 2008. That year, Deutsche Bank chose Jacksonville over Nashville, Tenn., and Charlotte, N.C., as the site for expanding two subsidiary companies, according to the Florida Times-Union. The expansion came with the promise of $4.8 million in state and local incentives for creating 1,000 jobs and doing capital investment.", "In the summer of 2012, state and local governments offered another $1.45 million to create 260 jobs.", "Fast forward to the most recent expansion, which Scott highlighted in his comments. In April, the Jacksonville City Council agreed to partner\u00a0with the state to offer $2.08 million in tax incentives to Deutsche Bank in exchange for adding 300 jobs over three years.", "The jobs would pay about $62,000 a year on average and bring the total Jacksonville workforce to 1,600 by 2016, according to city records.", "Under the plan, Deutsche Bank would receive up to $1.8 million in tax refunds through the Qualified Target Industry program, with Jacksonville paying 20 percent ($360,000) and the state paying the rest.", "The bank could also recover $140,000 in property taxes based on a pledge to spend $10 million in renovations to its office space and buy new furniture and technology.", "Separately, Jacksonville\u2019s Office of Economic Development said Scott has agreed to contribute an additional $140,000 from a pot of incentive money used largely at the governor\u2019s discretion to close deals. Scott's state Department of Economic Opportunity would not confirm whether that is the case, saying only that Deutsche Bank had not yet received any money for the project.", "That\u2019s normal, however. State incentives typically are offered on jobs that are actually created, not just promised.", "\"It\u2019s absolutely worth the investment,\" said state Rep. Daniel Davis, a Republican who leads the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce. \"You have a little investment up front to invest in the long haul.\"", "A Deutsche Bank spokesman downplayed the role of incentives in the company\u2019s decision, saying \"there were numerous factors that led to this announcement of new jobs at our Jacksonville location.\"", "Our ruling", "We are not evaluating whether Deutsche Bank finds several things about Florida attractive for expanding its company: the weather, the lack of income tax, etc. We are looking at Scott\u2019s response to a pointed question in his Fox News interview: Did Florida offer \"something special\" to Deutsche Bank in exchange for 300 jobs?", "Scott could have acknowledged that economic incentives were used in the deal. Instead he said they were not.", "That's incorrect.", "Records show the company is ready to receive up to $2.08 million in state and local incentives if it hits its job targets.
