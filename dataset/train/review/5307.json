According to the story, a woman stabbed her boyfriend several times after he attempted to have sex with a raw turkey:", "Police were called with reports of a domestic violence incident. When they arrived, they found 24-year-old Ryan Mills on the ground in the living room next to an uncooked turkey carcass. He was stabbed five times, once in the arm and four times in the legs.

His girlfriend admitted to finding him in the bathroom \u201cgoing at it hard\u201d with the Thanksgiving meal. That\u2019s when she grabbed the turkey and ran into the living room while Mills chase after her, apologizing. Rodriguez admitted that\u2019s when she lost it and began stabbing him in his extremities.", "Rodriguez was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon and Mills is being charged with \u2018animal abuse\u2019 But, in a magnificent piece of legal footwork, his attorney argues that he can\u2019t be guilty of that crime, because a carcass is not an \u2018animal\u2019 ... If Mills is convicted, he could serve up to two years in prison, because of a previous conviction in 2005 for shooting a dead pig named Mitzie so that he could have sex with it.", "The image of the couple involved in the purported turkey carcass sex act dispute was the same as one used for a previous fake news item about a meth-addled couple eating a homeless man in New York's Central Park.
