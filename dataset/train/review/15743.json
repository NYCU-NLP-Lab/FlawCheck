["The post, that credits US-based news organisation CNN as the source, was shared widely on WhatsApp among Sri Lankan users.", "Below is a screenshot of the misleading WhatsApp message:", "The message reads in part: \"Breaking news from CNN. Dr Li Wenliang, China's hero doctor who was punished for telling the truth about corona virus and later died due to the same disease, had documented casefiles for research purposes and had in casefiles proposed a cure that would significantly decrease the impact of the COVID-19 virus on the human body.", "\"The chemical Methylxanthine, Theobromine and Theophylline stimulate compounds that will ward off the virus in a human with at least an average immune system. Whats more shocking is that these complex words that were difficult for people in China to understand is actually called tea in India.\"", "Dr Li Wenliang was an ophthalmologist working in the Chinese city of Wuhan who died in\u00a0February, 2020 after contracting COVID-19. Before his death, he was one of a group of doctors in Wuhan who shared posts on social media warning of a SARS-like virus spreading in the city in December, as reported by AFP here.", "Methylxanthine, theobromine and theophylline are all stimulants and caffeine derivatives, commonly found in tea.", "Similar posts were also shared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here.", "A similar claim was also reported by Sri Lanka\u2019s TNL television network during its evening news bulletin on March 24, 2020.", "The claim is false.", "A keyword search on both Google and the CNN website for the alleged report cited in the misleading posts yielded no results.", "Dr. Jayaruwan Bandara,\u00a0director of the Sri Lanka Medical Research Institute,\u00a0told AFP by\u00a0phone on March 26, 2020 that while tea may strengthen immunity, there is \u201cno research\u201d on the benefits of drinking tea for COVID-19 patients.", "He said: \u201cWhile drinking tea can be beneficial for one\u2019s health, it cannot be touted as a preventive measure or a treatment in the case of COVID-19. The only way to minimise infection as recognised by other international health agencies, is social distancing, following proper hand hygiene and refraining from touching one\u2019s eyes, mouth and nose.\u201d", "A spokeswoman\u00a0for Sri Lanka National Science Foundation also said there was no evidence to suggest tea can \"alleviate or prevent COVID-19 infections\".", "During a phone conversation with AFP on March 26, 2020, she said: \u201cThe three chemical compounds mentioned in the claim are mostly found in green tea due to the difference in the way it is processed. The antioxidants in green tea can be good sources to provide certain conditionings to the body in specific situations. But so far, there is no study done, clinically or microbiologically to ascertain if tea can alleviate or prevent COVID-19 infections.\u201d", "The WHO also states in the Q&A section of its website here, that \u201cthere is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease\u201d.", "Dr. Ashan Pathirana, the registrar at Sri Lanka\u2019s Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) told AFP on March 25, 2020 that \u201cthe circulation of false information relating to various COVID-19 \u2018cures\u2019 without a scientific basis, can have grave repercussions\u201d.", "\u201cWhile there is no harm to health by consuming tea, these types of information circulated among vulnerable masses creates a sense of false security, which can be deadly in itself,\u201d he said.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
