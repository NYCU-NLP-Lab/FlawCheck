By 1968, the Constitution placed that power in the hands of the Cabinet.", "In the 1970s, there was pressure from the Legislature on Gov. Reubin Askew, a Democrat, to make it easier to restore civil rights. Legislators passed a bill in 1974 that included automatic reinstatement, but the Florida Supreme Court declared that unconstitutional because it bypassed the governor\u2019s clemency power.", "Askew then convinced the Cabinet to amend the clemency rules to make restoration easier.", "Randall Berg, a civil rights attorney at the Florida Justice Institute, told PolitiFact that Askew was motivated by a personal belief that \"after one had served their time, they had paid their debt and ought to start with a clean slate so they might become productive members of society.\"", "Askew also wanted to speed up the process. The Cabinet restored rights in its role as the Executive Clemency Review Board, but meetings were only held quarterly, and the process was slow.", "\"There were simply too many people to determine who got their civil rights restored and who did not,\" Berg said in an email.", "The 1975 rule that Askew promoted included automatic reinstatement after a person was released from prison or parole, with the exception of the right to own or possess firearms.", "Each month, the Cabinet signed orders to grant restoration of civil rights.", "In 1977, the wording was changed to allow members of the Clemency Board to object to restoring a particular individual\u2019s rights.", "A timeline from the state\u2019s Parole Commission explains how the rules changed after Askew. In the early 1990s, Gov. Lawton Chiles tightened the rules, which made it harder for ex-felons to regain their rights. (That happened amid the backdrop of prison overcrowding, which led the state to release prisoners early.) Gov. Jeb Bush then took steps to simplify the process. (For example the application shrank from 12 pages to one.) But advocates said there was more to be done.", "Crist changes", "In April 2007, Crist convinced the Cabinet to streamline the process.", "\"Some who favor the current system argue that restoring civil rights is somehow ''weak on crime,\" as if restoring the right to vote, to serve on a jury or to work lessens the punishment or encourages a person to commit new crimes. In fact, the opposite should be true,\" Crist wrote in a Miami Herald op-ed. \"Giving a person a meaningful way to re-enter society, make a living and participate in our democracy will encourage good behavior.\"", "Under Crist, ex-offenders convicted of less serious offenses could regain their rights without a hearing, while those convicted of crimes such as murder required a more thorough investigation and a hearing.", "Though some news articles used the word \"automatic\" to describe this process, that\u2019s an oversimplification, because the Parole Commission had to approve it.", "Some advocates argued that Crist\u2019s change didn\u2019t go far enough. Under Crist, there were more than 150,000 restorations, but a backlog of 100,000 remained when he left office, according to the Tampa Bay Times.", "In February 2011, newly elected Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi argued that the process was too easy for released felons. One month later, Bondi, Scott and the rest of the Cabinet scrapped the process and set a minimum of a five-year waiting period. During Scott\u2019s tenure through mid\u00a0September, about 850 offenders have had their rights restored.", "Gelber\u2019s response", "We contacted Gelber and told him that our research showed Askew sought restoration of felons\u2019 voting rights before Crist did. Gelber told PolitiFact that he was unaware of Askew\u2019s actions in 1975 and did some additional research; he said he found some differences between the restoration rules under Askew and Crist. (One difference related to some wording under Askew that required an ex-con to be a resident of Florida for one year, but that paragraph was in a section related to offenders who were not U.S. citizens.)", "\"While there are some debatable distinctions, I think my statement unfairly diminishes Gov. Askew's efforts,\" Gelber told PolitiFact in an email. \"The truth is, both men deserve high praise for what they did because the position they advocated is often unpopular and requires a measure of political courage. I have revised my statement to pay homage to Gov. Askew while at the same time congratulating Gov. Crist.\"", "Here is how Gelber re-worded the claim: \"as Governor he convinced the Cabinet to approve the automatic restoration of felon rights for nonviolent offenders for the first time since Gov. Reubin Askew implemented a similar reform in 1975 (since reversed by Governor Scott).\"", "Our ruling", "Gelber said that Crist \"sought for and got approved the automatic restoration of felon rights for nonviolent offenders for the first time in Florida history.\"", "First, a minor quibble: the restoration of felon rights under Crist was not automatic because the Clemency Board still had to sign off on it.", "However our main objection to Gelber\u2019s statement is his claim that Crist was the \"first\" to do this in Florida history. In 1975, Askew and the Cabinet changed the rules to allow for \"automatic restoration\" of rights for voting. Under Askew, the changes broadly applied to offenders, whether they had completed sentences related to violent or nonviolent offenses. Crist\u2019s policy favored nonviolent offenders.", "Depending on your viewpoint it was Askew who earned kudos or criticism -- not Crist -- for making it far easier for felons to regain civil rights including the right to vote. Gelber changed the wording of his claim in response to this fact-check.", "At PolitiFact, we give props to people who admit to errors and correct them, but that doesn\u2019t change our analysis or rating of the original claim.", "We rate this claim False.", "Charlie Crist for governor campaign website statement by Dan Gelber, \"Why I support and trust Charlie Crist,\" Updated version, Dec. 10, 2013", "Florida Parole Commission, Rules of Executive Clemency of Florida, Approved Sept. 10, 1975", "Florida Parole Commission, Rules of Executive Clemency, Approved 2007", "University of Florida thesis by Robert Lucas, \"Automatic?
