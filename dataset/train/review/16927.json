["About this rating", "On and around Feb. 16, 2021, Texans across the state were dealing with a deadly arctic blast that brought below-freezing temperatures and knocked power out for millions of residents struggling to keep warm.", "Amid this desperation and chaos, Mayor Tim Boyd of Colorado City, a small city in the western portion of the state, shared a belligerent Facebook post telling residents that in his opinion, they should be fending for themselves instead of expecting the government to use their tax dollars to help them through the disaster.", "Boyd has deleted the Facebook post \u2014 and we couldn't locate his Facebook page \u2014 but local TV news stations caught it and took screenshots, which were shared widely on social media:", "The full text of Boyd's original post read:", "No one owes you or your family anything; nor is it the local governments responsibility to support you during trying times like this! Sink or swim, it\u2019s your choice! The City and County, along with power providers or any other service owes you NOTHING! I\u2019m sick and tired of people looking for a damn hand out!
