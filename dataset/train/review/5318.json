Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., touted a number of things his home state can be proud of.", "\"I'm from a little state, most patriotic state in the nation,\" Manchin told the crowd. \"More veterans per capita, fought in more wars, shed more blood, lost more lives ... than any state. On top of that we've done all the heavy lifting.
