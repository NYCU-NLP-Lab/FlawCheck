["By Eugene Kiely and Robert Farley", "Posted on March 23, 2017", "There is still no evidence to support President Donald Trump\u2019s tweets accusing President Barack Obama of illegally \u201ctapping my phones in October\u201d during the \u201cvery sacred election process.\u201d", "In a March 22 interview with Time magazine\u2019s\u00a0Michael Scherer, Trump said \u201cnew information\u201d from the House intelligence committee chairman proved his tweets about a \u201cWatergate/Nixon\u201d-style scandal were \u201cright.\u201d That\u2019s wrong.", "Trump is referring to a press conference\u00a0Rep. Devin Nunes held shortly before Trump spoke with Scherer. At his news conference, the Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee said he reviewed \u201cintelligence reports\u201d that show \u201cincidental collection\u201d on some unnamed Trump transition team members in November, December and January. Nunes, a Trump transition team member himself, said he believed the incidental collection of information was legally obtained.", "As of this writing, Trump\u2019s tweets \u2014 in which he described Obama as a \u201cbad (or sick) guy!\u201d \u2014 are still unsupported on multiple levels, based on Nunes\u2019 account of the intelligence reports he read:", "In his Time magazine interview, Trump said that things he says or tweets frequently \u201cturn out to be right,\u201d citing the wiretapping tweets as an example.", "Trump, March 22:\u00a0This is a Politico story. \u201cMembers of the Donald Trump Transition team possibly including Trump himself were under [inadvertent] surveillance during the Obama administration following November\u2019s election.\u201d House intelligence chairman Devin Nunes told reporters, wow. Nunes said, so that means I\u2019m right, Nunes said the surveillance appears to have been \u2026 incidental collection, that does not appear to have been related to concerns over Russia.", "Scherer: But so incidental collection would not be wiretapping of you, it would be wiretapping of \u2026", "Trump: Who know what it is? You know, why, because somebody says incidental. Nunes is going to the White House.", "Scherer: Nunes has also said that he has no evidence that your tweet was right, previously.", "Trump: Well, he just got this information. This was new information. That was just got. Members, of, let\u2019s see, were under surveillance during the Obama Administration following November\u2019s election. Wow. This just came out. So, ah, just came out.", "When he read part of the Politico story, Trump left out the word \u201cinadvertent\u201d \u2014 which we inserted above. Trump also downplayed the article\u2019s use of Nunes\u2019 term \u201cincidental collection,\u201d suggesting that it is labeled as such because \u201csomebody says incidental.\u201d But this inadvertent collection of intercepted communications is important context when assessing Trump\u2019s wiretapping claim.", "Incidental collection occurs when a targeted foreign person happens to communicate with an American or an American is mentioned in intercepted communications.", "\u201cWe may incidentally acquire the communications of Americans even though we are not targeting them, for example if they talk to non-U.S. persons outside of the United States who are properly targeted for foreign intelligence collection,\u201d Robert S. Litt, then-general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said in a 2013 speech. \u201cSome of these communications may be pertinent; some may not be.\u201d", "Nunes raises an important issue about how the intelligence community protects the identities of Americans who are inadvertently picked up during the legal surveillance of non-U.S. persons.", "During the March 20 House intelligence committee hearing, FBI Director James\u00a0Comey stressed the importance of protecting the identity and privacy of \u201cU.S. persons\u201d caught up in surveillance operations. He said the intelligence agency conducting the surveillance refers to them in its reports as \u201cU.S. person number one\u201d or \u201cU.S. person number two,\u201d and they are only \u201cunmasked,\u201d or identified, if other intelligence agencies believe the name may be relevant to their investigation. It is also possible that the identity of a person may be known to some from the context of the intercepted communication, even if the name remains undisclosed.", "Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security advisor, is an example of a Trump transition team member caught up in the surveillance of a foreign agent. Flynn was overheard in late December, before Trump took office, discussing U.S. sanctions against Russia in phone calls with that country\u2019s ambassador to the United States. That information was leaked to the media in February, and Flynn was forced to resign because until then he had publicly insisted he did not discuss the sanctions with Russia.", "The Trump administration has long complained about leaks to the media, and, more recently, it has taken issue with the \u201cunmasking\u201d of U.S. persons caught up in the surveillance of foreign targets. It may have a point about those things. But that does not mean the president\u2019s tweets about Obama are at all accurate. There is no proof of that.", "The illegal wiretapping claim wasn\u2019t all that Trump got wrong in the Time interview.", "Trump doubled down on his unfounded accusation that Rafael Cruz, the father of Sen. Ted Cruz, was with Lee Harvey Oswald just prior to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Trump told Time that his baseless claim about Cruz was something he read \u201cin the newspaper.\u201d The newspaper in question is the tabloid National Enquirer. And while Trump told Time the paper \u201chad a picture of Ted Cruz, his father, and Lee Harvey Oswald, having breakfast,\u201d it did not. For more info on this absurd claim, see our story, \u201cTrump\u2019s Tall Tabloid Tale,\u201d and \u201cTrump Defends Oswald Claim.\u201d", "Asked about his unsubstantiated claim that \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of people in New Jersey celebrated on Sept. 11, 2001, when the World Trade Center was attacked, Trump falsely said, \u201cWell if you look at the reporter, he wrote the story in the Washington Post.\u201d That is not what the reporters wrote. And the reporters never backtracked on that, despite Trump\u2019s many claims to the contrary.", "Trump also stuck to his baseless claim that millions of people voted illegally for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cWell I think I will be proved right about that too,\u201d Trump told Time.", "\u201cWell now if you take a look at the votes, when I say that, I mean mostly they register wrong, in other words, for the votes, they register incorrectly, and/or illegally. And they then vote. You have tremendous numbers of people. In fact I\u2019m forming a committee on it,\u201d the president\u00a0said.", "As we have reported, repeatedly,\u00a0a 2012 study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that \u201cmore than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters\u201d and that \u201capproximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.\u201d But there is\u00a0no evidence that millions voted illegally, as Trump claims.", "The president describes himself in the Time interview as a soothsayer. He may believe he has an uncanny ability to predict the future, but we have seen no evidence to support his unsubstantiated claims about alleged past events that involve illegal campaign wiretapping, Cruz\u2019s connection to JFK\u2019s assassination, massive 9/11 celebrations and widespread voter fraud.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
