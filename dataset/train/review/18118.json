Darrell Issa (R-California) \"hid\" from constituents by standing on the roof of his office in Vista, a city in northern San Diego County.

Darrell Issa (R-CA) was so afraid of a group of protesters that he hid on the roof of his district office instead of listening to his constituents.", "Issa\u2019s opponent Mike Levine tweeted a picture of Issa hiding on his district office roof to avoid angry questions from people about health care:", "Yes, this is really @DarrellIssa on the roof of his district office building.

Absolutely.", "Protest organizer Ellen Montanari said Issa did speak to at least two protest attendees, including herself and one other person, from what she saw.

He spent some time talking to a few of those gathered regardless then headed upstairs to take a pic of everyone.", "Montanari told us in a phone interview that things unfolded with a bit more hostility than Moore let on. Since late January 2017, protesters have been gathering outside Issa's Vista office every Tuesday.

He\u2019s come down to speak with us a number of times. I went over to shake his hand, and he said, 'step away, you're a protester.' I said 'no, I\u2019m a constituent.' He went on to just blast me. Our whole point is that we want to hear form him, and he has in the past been rude and condescending, but nothing like this. He was being incredibly disrespectful to me, and the rally participants. I listened to him for a little while and he turned on his heel and walked away. I walked back and I decided he was not interested in talking with us, he was more interested in talking at us. It's our rally, the people paid for the microphone, and so I decided that if he was going to be a bully he was not going to get the microphone.", "Montanari said he stopped to chat with at least one other participant before going back into his office, \u00a0appearing on the rooftop, then coming back out with a piece of cake which he gave to a supporter of President Donald Trump, who also attends as a counter-protester:", "There\u2019s one Trump supporter who comes every week \u2014 we know him, we\u2019ve gotten to be buddies.
