The president spoke to then-CEO and Chairman Terry Gou, and the company then announced it was still building a liquid crystal display manufacturing plant here.", "So it wasn\u2019t surprising to hear Trump back the company even as we learned it failed to meet the job targets to receive any subsidies for the second straight year.", "In an Oct. 17, 2020, interview with WTMJ-TV\u2019s Charles Benson, Trump said the company was still going to deliver on its promised 13,000 jobs.", "\"They will do what I tell them to do. They will do what\u2019s supposed to be done. Because they did make promises,\" Trump said. \"If they don\u2019t meet the standards, you shouldn\u2019t give them the tax credits, but they will end up being a great investment for your state. \u2026 If I win the election, Foxconn is going to come in with money like no other company has come into our country, you watch.\"", "But it was Trump\u2019s explanation for Foxconn\u2019s lack of progress that struck us as particularly interesting.", "Asked why the company hadn\u2019t met expectations, Trump said, \"No. 1, you had a pandemic.\"", "Since the Foxconn deal was signed in 2017, officials have repeatedly referenced the changing marketplace and Foxconn\u2019s resulting strategy shifts as factors in the slow ramp-up in Mount Pleasant.

Scott Walker and approved by the GOP-led Legislature, Wisconsin agreed to provide as much as $3 billion in subsidies (cash payments made to the company) and hundreds of millions in infrastructure improvements.
