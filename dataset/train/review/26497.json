Harry and Megan's children are eligible to be POTUS,\" the Feb. 24 post states. \"Way to play the long game, George III.\"", "King George III ruled the British Empire during the American Revolution from 1763-83, according to the Library of Congress.", "In an ironic twist, George's descendant Prince Harry married an American, actress and divorcee Meghan Markle, hence the \"long game\" referenced in the Facebook post.", "The post is an exact copy of a Feb. 23 post to Facebook group Formidable Republican Opposition.", "\"I found the meme somewhere else, but I don't recall exactly where \u2014\u00a0I believe a friend posted it, but I don't know if it was original content from them.\u00a0The meme obviously doesn't contain the nuance of the actual situation, but it's funny,\" the poster, Dillion Beyer, told USA TODAY in an email.", "Harry and Meghan \u2014 also known as the Duke\u00a0and Duchess\u00a0of Sussex \u2014 captured international attention after a bombshell interview with media mogul Oprah Winfrey aired on March 7 that included, among other claims, accusations of racism against members of the royal family. The Facebook post predates the interview.", "The duchess announced her second pregnancy in February, according to USA TODAY. A son, Archie Harrison\u00a0Mountbatten-Windsor, was born in 2019.", "Time will tell if the youngest members of the Sussex family will decide to run for president some day, but there may be a few obstacles in their way.", "Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution states \"no Person except a Natural Born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President.\" The candidates must also be at least 35 years old and have resided in the country for 14 or more years, according to the Constitution Annotated.", "\"Children born of Prince Harry and Megan Markle in the United States would be citizens and would be eligible to run for president when they are old enough, but they would have to win this in an election rather than inherit the office,\"\u00a0John R. Vile, professor of political science at Middle TennesseeState University, told USA TODAY.", "USA TODAY reported on the Sussexes' move\u00a0to the United States over a year ago. The couple's newborn would face no barriers to running for the highest office in the land. But Archie was born in the United Kingdom and would have been ineligible to run a few decades ago.", "Standards for naturalization were first outlined in H.R. 40, or the 1790 Naturalization Act.

The contingency was null if the father never lived in the United States, according to a 2016 Fordham Law Review article.", "Fortunately for some well-known presidential candidates, such as Canadian-born Sen. Ted Cruz and the late Sen. John McCain, who was born in Panama, the statute changed in 1978 to recognize citizenship to children born abroad if either\u00a0parent was a U.S. citizen at birth, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. (The Senate also passed a resolution in 2008 recognizing McCain as a natural-born citizen.)", "USCIS also lists a specific category for children of a\u00a0U.S. citizen and\u00a0an alien Under this condition, the child can acquire citizenship at birth if \u00a0the citizen parent lived physically in the United States for at least five years with two of those years occurring after 14 years of age.
