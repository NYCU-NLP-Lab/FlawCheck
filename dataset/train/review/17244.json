["By Robert Farley", "Posted on March 6, 2018", "President Donald Trump often likes to boast about his ability to negotiate better deals for the government. This week, the boast was the cost of a new embassy in Jerusalem, and it was a doozy.", "\u201cTwo hundred and fifty thousand dollars versus a billion dollars. Is that good?\u201d Trump asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.", "It would be if it were true. But Trump is comparing the cost of renovating and adding to an existing facility in Jerusalem to use temporarily as an interim embassy with the cost of building a new, permanent home for the embassy in Jerusalem.", "Moreover, it\u2019s unclear where Trump is getting that $1 billion estimate for the cost of the permanent facility.", "We asked the White House press office who provided Trump with the $1 billion estimate. It did not respond.", "But just a week ago, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said it was \u201cpremature to discuss financing arrangements\u201d for the new construction. \u201cWe have not had any formal discussions or any formal proposals of the sort, and when it comes to overall cost estimates, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll have to work out with Congress,\u201d Nauert said in a Feb. 28 briefing.", "Trump\u2019s comments came during remarks before a bilateral meeting with Netanyahu on March 5. Trump was asked about the opening of the U.S. Embassy, which Trump announced in December would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll have it built very quickly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have it built very quickly and very inexpensively.\u201d", "Trump then continued: \u201cThey put an order in front of my desk last week for a billion dollars. I said, \u2018A billion? What\u2019s that for?\u2019 \u2018We\u2019re going to build an embassy.\u2019 I said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to spend a billion dollars.\u2019 And we\u2019re actually doing it for about $250,000. So check that out. Now, it\u2019s temporary, but it\u2019ll be very nice. Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars versus a billion dollars. Is that good?\u201d", "\u201cYeah, it\u2019s good,\u201d Netanyahu said.", "On Dec. 6, Trump formally announced his intention to relocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act in 1995 recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and calling for the relocation of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But since then, Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama signed waivers every six months putting off the relocation, fearing that it would be an impediment to Middle East peace talks. (Read here for some history on why the relocation of the embassy is controversial.)", "\u201cWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\u201d Trump said on Dec. 6. \u201cToday, I am delivering.\u201d", "On Feb. 23, the State Department announced plans to open an interim U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem in May in a building that currently acts as the U.S. Consulate General Jerusalem. The building will temporarily house the U.S. ambassador \u201cand a small staff.\u201d By the end of 2019, however, the State Department plans to build an annex on the same compound for the \u201cAmbassador and his team with expanded interim office space.\u201d", "A State Department official told us internal modifications to allow the embassy to open in an existing facility in May are anticipated to cost $200,000 to $400,000. So that\u2019s presumably where Trump got the $250,000 figure, which he identified as going toward a \u201ctemporary\u201d facility.", "The State Department says it has begun to search for a site for a permanent embassy, \u201cthe planning and construction of which will be a longer-term undertaking.\u201d", "That, of course, is the bigger ticket item. But as we said, we\u2019re not sure where the president is getting his $1 billion estimate, and the press office did not clarify. The New York Times cited a former State Department official who estimated the cost at half that, $500 million.", "Patrick Kennedy, who retired last year from the State Department where he served as under secretary for management, told the New York Times that embassies can cost anywhere from $150 million to $1 billion to build. According to the Times:\u00a0\u201cThe one in Jerusalem is likely to cost somewhere in the middle of that range \u2014 about $500 million \u2014 because it does not need the housing, warehouse or security functions of some of the most expensive buildings, such as those in Baghdad and Kabul, Mr. Kennedy said.\u201d", "Asked about Trump\u2019s comments about the embassy costing $250,000, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said, \u201cI think the point he\u2019s making is that he\u2019s going to do it faster and far less expensive than a billion-dollar project, as was projected.\u201d She did not say who made that projection.", "Trump suggested that the $250,000 figure was tied to the interim facility when he said, \u201cNow, it\u2019s temporary.\u201d", "But he muddied the issue when he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to spend a billion dollars. \u2026 We\u2019re actually doing it for about $250,000.\u201d He then said, \u201cTwo hundred and fifty thousand dollars versus a billion dollars. Is that good?\u201d It would be \u201cgood,\u201d if the figures were for the same thing, but they are not.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
