["By Saranac Hale Spencer and Angelo Fichera", "Posted on July 28, 2020", "A widely shared video, featuring a doctor falsely claiming hydroxychloroquine is a \u201ccure\u201d for COVID-19, ignited an online storm that resulted in the video being pulled by social media platforms. There is no known cure for COVID-19, and current scientific evidence hasn\u2019t found that hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment.", "A video pushing the use of an unproven COVID-19 treatment has received widespread attention, including on Twitter by President Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr., whose account was temporarily suspended for directly sharing the video.", "Twitter, YouTube and Facebook have been removing the video since it started circulating on July 27 and amassing millions of views. The video spreads the debunked claim that COVID-19 can be cured with hydroxychloroquine \u2014 the drug that has been continuously touted by the president.", "The clip features a Houston-area doctor named Stella Immanuel wearing a white coat in front of the U.S. Supreme Court building as she proclaims that a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and the antibiotic azithromycin has cured COVID-19 patients.", "Immanuel was speaking at a press conference arranged by an organization called \u201cAmerica\u2019s Frontline Doctors.\u201d We couldn\u2019t find much information about the group and neither its founder, Simone Gold, nor its lawyer,\u00a0Steven Mitby, returned our calls for comment. But the group appears to be connected to the Tea Party Patriots Foundation, which runs the conservative Tea Party movement. The group\u2019s logo and an open letter to Trump written by Gold are featured on a webpage copyrighted by the foundation.", "Gold is a licensed doctor in California, although it appears that she most recently ran a concierge medical business, which she described on her website as working \u201cthe same way as a highly effective Fortune 100 CEO.\u201d Her website says Gold \u201creads the latest research, consults with the foremost experts, and examines the scientific literature\u201d to provide \u201cvery high quality CEO-level information to her client-patients.\u201d", "However, in April, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the U.S., Gold stood outside the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles wearing a white coat embroidered with her name above the words \u201cEmergency Dept.\u201d and recorded videos about her \u201cexperience practicing emergency medicine in this era of the COVID-19 crisis.\u201d", "In one video she claimed \u201cthe emergency department volume is down.\u201d In another video in front of the hospital, she reported that, \u201cwe have been very successful at flattening the curve.\u201d", "But Gold has never worked at the hospital. In fact, the only time she was affiliated in any way with Cedars-Sinai was when she worked on a per-diem basis in a Cedars-Sinai Medical Network urgent care clinic for less than three weeks in 2015, Sally Stewart, a spokeswoman for Cedars-Sinai told FactCheck.org in an email.", "Immanuel has an equally opaque background, and she didn\u2019t return our calls either.", "Immanuel is a licensed doctor in Texas and lists her practice as the Rehoboth Medical Center. That medical center is listed as being registered with the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts in September 2019 by Solange Gabice. We reached Gabice by phone, but she hung up when we asked if her clinic was treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine.", "It\u2019s worth noting also that the same strip mall in Katy, Texas, that houses the clinic also houses Fire Power Ministries, a Christian ministry run by Immanuel.", "During a July 28 press briefing, the day after the video went up, Trump questioned why social media platforms had been removing it. \u201cThey\u2019re very respected doctors,\u201d the president said.", "When a reporter asked him about Immanuel, who also has claimed that doctors make medicine using DNA from aliens, Trump noted that she appeared with several other doctors.", "\u201cI thought she was very impressive in the sense that she came \u2014 I don\u2019t know which country she comes from \u2014 but she said that she\u2019s had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her.\u201d", "In the video, Immanuel repeats the word \u201ccure\u201d a half-dozen times when referring to using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, saying it can prevent any COVID-19 deaths.", "\u201cNobody needs to get sick. This virus has a cure,\u201d she says at one point. \u201cIt is called hydroxychloroquine, zinc and Zithromax.\u201d (Zithromax is a brand name for the drug azithromycin.)", "First of all, there is no known \u201ccure\u201d for COVID-19, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention points out. And the current scientific evidence doesn\u2019t support the conclusion that hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating the disease, as we\u2019ve explained before.", "Since early in the novel coronavirus pandemic, hydroxychloroquine \u2014 a drug that is used to treat malaria and other illnesses \u2014 has been touted as a potential treatment. Trump has repeatedly cited it, at one point referring to it as a \u201cgame changer.\u201d", "But numerous randomized controlled studies have cast serious doubt on its effectiveness when it comes to COVID-19.", "\u201cThere are no data from randomized clinical trials that demonstrate effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for COVID,\u201d Dr. Neil Schluger, chairman of the department of medicine at New York Medical College School of Medicine, told us in a phone interview. Schluger has studied hydroxychloroquine in relation to COVID-19. \u201cThere are now several randomized clinical trials that show that it had no effect.\u201d", "\u201cThe vast majority of expert opinions \u2026 is that hydroxychloroquine has no benefit in COVID illness,\u201d he added.", "Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also said the drug is \u201cnot effective\u201d for treating COVID-19 in a July 28 interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d", "\u201cThe overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease,\u201d Fauci said.", "As we\u2019ve reported before, the Food and Drug Administration had\u00a0issued an emergency use authorization in March to allow adult and some adolescent patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to obtain hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile \u201cwhen clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible.\u201d", "Amid growing evidence the drug is not effective, the FDA announced in June that it had revoked the EUA for the drugs because they are \u201cunlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA,\u201d and that the \u201cknown and potential benefits\u201d of the drugs \u201cno longer outweigh\u201d the risks \u2014 which can include \u201cserious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects.\u201d", "A large randomized controlled study called RECOVERY, in the U.K.,\u00a0reported in a preprint, which hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed, that hydroxychloroquine wasn\u2019t associated with reduced mortality \u2014 and was actually associated with \u201can increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death.\u201d\u00a0The study said that 26.8% of the 1,561 patients given hydroxychloroquine died within 28 days, whereas 25% of patients given usual care died in that time span \u2014 a difference that was not statistically significant.", "The authors wrote that \u201cthese results indicate that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment\u00a0for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.\u201d", "Another study published July 16 in the Annals of Internal Medicine \u2014 a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that involved more than 400 participants\u00a0 \u2014 found that \u201c[h]ydroxychloroquine did not substantially reduce symptom severity in outpatients with early, mild COVID-19.\u201d", "There was one observational study by the Henry Ford Health System,\u00a0published\u00a0in the\u00a0International Journal of Infectious Diseases on July 1, that found hydroxychloroquine was associated with lower mortality for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. But, as we\u2019ve explained before, the study has limitations \u2014 and it stands in contrast to multiple randomized controlled trials that have found the drug is not beneficial to hospitalized patients (and two other observational studies).", "During the press conference, Immanuel also claimed that a\u00a02005 study \u201csaid it works.\u201d", "That study \u2014 which found that \u201c[c]hloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV\u00a0in cell culture\u201d \u2014 \u201cis no evidence at all that it\u2019s a cure for COVID,\u201d Schluger said.", "\u201cThat was a different coronavirus; that was the coronavirus that causes SARS,\u201d he said. Secondly, he said, the study involved cells in test tubes. Potential drugs are evaluated in test tubes, then in animals, before they move into the three phases of clinical human trials, he said \u2014 and 90% of drug candidates that make it to human trials fail because they aren\u2019t effective or aren\u2019t safe.", "A study in a test tube involving a different virus, Schluger added, is \u201cnot how the FDA approves drugs.\u201d", "Likewise, Dr. Radha Rajasingham, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases and international medicine at the University of Minnesota, told us in an email that \u201c[w]hen something \u2018works\u2019 in cell culture, the next step is to test it in animals, and then in humans to prove efficacy in this setting. Thus, it\u2019s not reasonable to make clinical decisions based on one lab-based study.\u201d", "Despite the evidence that hydroxychloroquine isn\u2019t an effective treatment for COVID-19, Immanuel in the video generally dismisses such studies (erroneously suggesting that they only involved \u201c20 people, 40 people\u201d) \u2014 and claims she has successfully treated more than 350 patients.", "She also says: \u201cI\u2019ve put myself, my staff and many doctors that I know on hydroxychloroquine for prevention. Because by the very mechanism of action, it works early and as a prophylaxis.\u201d", "There are scientists exploring the use of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylaxis, or preventive, and some results have been published.", "Rajasingham and fellow researchers at the\u00a0University of Minnesota\u00a0published the results of a post-exposure prophylaxis randomized controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 3.", "The double-blind trial recruited more than 800 volunteers who received either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo within four days of exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19. Nearly 12% of hydroxychloroquine participants developed a COVID-19-like illness compared with 14.3% of those getting the placebo \u2014 a difference that was not significant.", "Rajasingham said her group is currently analyzing the results of a trial that looks at hydroxychloroquine as a pre-exposure prophylaxis, involving 1,500 health care workers.", "\u201cBut without clear evidence that this works in randomized clinical trials (in humans) I would not believe this medicine is efficacious,\u201d she said.", "Schluger said he understands why the public is desperate for an answer, and why some might look to hydroxychloroquine. But \u201cthe job of doctors and scientists is to figure out if things really work \u2014 and as far as we can tell, hydroxychloroquine doesn\u2019t seem to have any significant effect.\u201d", "He said doctors like Immanuel should submit their evidence for peer-review and \u201csee if it stands up to scrutiny.\u201d", "At one point in the video, Immanuel claims, \u201cyou don\u2019t need masks, there is a cure.\u201d Immanuel and the doctors behind her in the video are not seen wearing face masks.", "There is no cure, as we said. And the CDC has\u00a0explained\u00a0that face masks or coverings could help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus by containing respiratory droplets created when people cough, sneeze or talk. That\u2019s how the virus is primarily spread and containing fluids is called\u00a0source control.", "The CDC has been recommending the use of face coverings since\u00a0early\u00a0April, when the agency changed its\u00a0initial position\u00a0on the use of face masks during the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic, citing new studies on the transmission of the novel coronavirus.", "We\u2019ve written numerous stories\u00a0explaining\u00a0that\u00a0guidance\u00a0and\u00a0correcting\u00a0misinformation\u00a0on the\u00a0issue, but bogus claims like Immanuel\u2019s continue to add to the confusion.", "We\u2019ve\u00a0written before\u00a0that there have been relatively few randomized controlled trials looking at the efficacy of face masks when worn by the public, and the ones that have been done are inconsistent or have not observed large effects. But given lab studies of how masks work, many experts support them, and the World Health Organization has, like the CDC, recommended their use during \u201csevere epidemics or pandemics.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
