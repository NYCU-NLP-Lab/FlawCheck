["About this rating", "In June 2007, Kerry Stiles of Ocklawaha, Florida, purchased a pair of \"Sand-N-Sun\" flip flops at Walmart. Soon after wearing the sandals (which she donned only a few times), she developed a painful skin rash or chemical burn on her feet that corresponded with the thong portion of her flip-flops.", "Stiles' experiences with the fearsome footwear were recounted in full on her web page. She chronicled the development of the injury in a series of photographs spanning the period between 22 June and 8 September 2007. (Some of the photos are better not viewed by the overly sensitive because they depict wounds of a disturbing nature.)", "Get this: fake Hawaiian Sandals 'made in Chine' are made with toxic plastics resins and elastomers from containers used to store agrochemicals, and are painted with toxic paint with high lead content. The effect is catastrophic!", "Don't buy flip flops from Wal-mart!", "Many products coming out of china are now being recalled due to unsafe materials to make products and keep the budget at a low cost. Lead is MIXED in the paint for toys and here is what happened when a customer bought a pair of flip flops from wal-mart, these were CHEMICAL BURNS:", "[Rest of article at https://www.lamanaphotography.com/walmart.htm]", "The flip-flops had been manufactured in China. Others who had bought the same brand of sandals reported experiencing similar problems.", "In September 2007, Walmart instructed their stores to stop selling the product until they could conduct their own investigation.", "The definitive cause of Stiles' reaction to the flip flops is not known \u2014 while there might have been a noxious chemical incorporated into the footwear, the unfortunate woman (and others) could also have experienced an allergic reaction to some otherwise innocuous substance used in the manufacturing process.", "Walmart asserted they received only ten complaints about skin irritation related to these flip flops out of seven million pairs sold. The company said in a press release reported upon by Dallas television station KDFW on 11 September 2007 that: \"Product safety is a top priority at Wal-Mart and we are taking this report very seriously. Of several million of this product sold, we have had only a few similar claims. Nonetheless, we are removing the product from our shelves for testing and are preventing our registers from selling them.\"", "However, on 13 September 2007, a reporter in Tulsa told of finding a pair of the recalled flip-flops at a Wal-Mart in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Said the reporter: \"When we went to the check-out, the computer couldn't scan the price, but the cashier, just trying to be helpful, over-rode the machine and sold them to us.\"", "Stiles challenged Wal-Mart's claim of receiving only ten complaints about the brand of flip-flops that injured her, providing accounts (including photographs) on her web site of others similarly harmed.", "Rodriguez, Maggie. \u00a0 \"Wal-Mart Recalls Chinese-Made Flip-Flops.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Early Show [CBS]. \u00a0 12 September 2007.", "KOKI-TV [Tulsa]. \u00a0 \"Woman Contracts Flip-Flop Rash.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 13 September 2007.", "KDFW-TV [Dallas]. \u00a0 \"Wal-Mart Pulling Flip-Flops from Shelves After Complaints.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 11 September 2007.", "KDFW-TV [Dallas]. \u00a0 \"Woman Claims Made-in-China Flip-Flops Burned Feet.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 30 August 2007.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
