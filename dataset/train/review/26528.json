["About this rating", "A study published in October 2020 showed that sick vampire bats interacted less with other bats in their group, a behavior that the authors say affects the rate of pathogen spread in the community much like \"social distancing\" in humans.", "However, researchers describe this self-isolating behavior as \"unintentional\" and \"sickness-induced,\" in contrast to social distancing in humans, which is often intentional and consciously preventative.", "Snopes is still fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

They may have also mastered the art of social distancing in times of disease outbreak.", "Research published in October 2020 from Ohio State University found that wild vampire bats will self-isolate when feeling ill.", "Researchers say that understanding how other animals respond to disease outbreaks may help to inform our understanding of disease transmission and infection prevention in humans.", "Individual social behaviors change as a pathogen spreads across a population. Some animals are known to self-isolate when they\u2019ve become sick, like moribund ants who leave their nest to die in isolation, while others, like the honey bee, are exiled by their colony mates. Such behavior has been described as the first line of defense against parasites, bacteria, or viral infections. Social distancing, for example, may help or hinder a population\u2019s ability to effectively respond to an outbreak.", "To determine how individual vampire bats interacted with their colony mates when infected, researchers captured 32 female bats living in a hollow tree in Belize and injected each with a molecule called lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that induced an immune response to make the bats feel sick. Fifteen other bats from the same colony were given a placebo saline solution to serve as the study control. Each individual bat was equipped with a penny-sized \u201cbackpack\u201d computer that measured how close a bat came to another bat every few seconds. Over the course of three days, scientists focused on how many bats the study subjects encountered, how much time they spent with others, and how well-connected they were to the social group.", "One of the tiny \"backpack\" computers worn by bats in the study.

Writing in the scientific journal Behavioral Ecology, the study authors noted that this unintended \u201csocial distancing\u201d could be the result of what is known as \u201csickness behavior,\u201d or the increased lethargy and sleep that comes with being sick. In short, it\u2019s hard to be social when one is sleeping the day away.", "There are, of course, limitations to the study. For example, the researchers did not document the spread of disease and though it was a wild group of bats, their \u201cillness\u201d was a product of human intervention. Furthermore, changes in behavior may depend on the pathogen. Some infections or parasites may make an individual more likely to engage with their groupmates, which increases the transmission rate of a particular pathogen and thus its success rate.", "Regardless, the findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of pathogenic spread within social groups and populations.", "\u201cSocial distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, when we feel fine, doesn\u2019t feel particularly normal. But when we\u2019re sick, it\u2019s common to withdraw a bit and stay in bed longer because we\u2019re exhausted. And that means we\u2019re likely to have fewer social encounters,\u201d said study co-author Simon Ripperger in a news release.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing we were observing in this study: In the wild, vampire bats \u2013 which are highly social animals \u2013 keep their distance when they\u2019re sick or living with sick groupmates. And it can be expected that they reduce the spread of disease as a result.\u201d", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
