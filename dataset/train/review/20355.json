["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 17, 2021 | Updated on April 28, 2021", "Evidence of the efficacy of face masks to help control the spread of the novel coronavirus has grown since the start of the pandemic. But a Facebook video, viewed tens of thousands of times, uses false and misleading claims to tell viewers that masks are \u201cunsafe\u201d and \u201cineffective.\u201d", "Multiple lines of evidence back the use of face masks to protect against the coronavirus, although some uncertainty remains as to how effective mask interventions are in preventing spread in the community.", "Lab tests, for example, show that certain masks and N95 respirators can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets or aerosols, which are thought to be the primary ways the virus spreads.", "Observational studies, while limited, have generally found mask-wearing to be associated with a\u00a0reduced\u00a0risk\u00a0of contracting the virus or\u00a0fewer\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0cases\u00a0in a community.", "A\u00a0few\u00a0randomized controlled\u00a0trials have found that providing free masks and encouraging people to wear them results in a small to moderate reduction in transmission, although these results have\u00a0not always\u00a0been statistically significant.", "Masks should not be viewed as foolproof, as no mask is thought to offer complete protection to the wearer or to others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wear the most protective mask that fits well and can be worn consistently. Loosely woven cloth masks are the least protective. Layered, tightly woven cloth masks offer more protection, while well-fitting surgical masks and KN95 respirators provide even more protection and N95 respirators are the most protective.", "Link to this", "A Missouri-based chiropractor \u2014 who has been previously warned by federal officials to stop spreading misleading content regarding unproven COVID-19 treatments \u2014 is now wrongly telling Facebook users that face masks have been proven \u201cunsafe\u201d and \u201cineffective.\u201d", "In a Feb. 11 video live-streamed on Facebook and viewed more than 70,000 times, Eric Nepute rattles off a list of 20 arguments against wearing face masks \u2014 claiming, for example, that they cause cavities and \u201cfacial deformities\u201d and increase the chances of contracting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.", "But many of Nepute\u2019s claims are false, misleading or unsupported. And a central takeaway \u2014 that masks are \u201cineffective\u201d \u2014 is rebuffed by recent evidence to the contrary.", "Two doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently summarized the growing evidence that masks can help to control community spread of the virus. In a piece for the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association, they wrote: \u201cCompelling data now demonstrate that community mask wearing is an effective nonpharmacologic intervention to reduce the spread of this infection, especially as source control to prevent spread from infected persons, but also as protection to reduce wearers\u2019 exposure to infection.\u201d", "Rather than cite credible research on masks, Nepute largely adapted his claims from a\u00a0January post\u00a0on the website of the Canada-based Centre for Research on Globalization. That website has pushed conspiracy theories about the 9/11 terrorist attacks and other topics; a recent State Department report said the website \u201chas been a steady source of anti-U.S. and anti-Western disinformation and propaganda ever since\u201d its 2001 debut.", "For his part, Nepute has spread unsound advice before, drawing the scrutiny of the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC in May sent a letter warning Nepute that he was unlawfully advertising products and services \u2014 including chiropractic care and intravenous vitamin therapy \u2014 to treat or prevent COVID-19. The letter advised him to \u201cimmediately cease making all such claims.\u201d", "Update, April 28: The\u00a0FTC\u00a0and\u00a0Department of Justice\u00a0announced on April 15 that the government had charged Nepute with violating the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act \u201cby deceptively marketing products containing vitamin D and zinc as scientifically proven to treat or prevent COVID-19.\u201d It was the first\u00a0civil\u00a0complaint alleging violations of the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act, which was part of an\u00a0appropriations package\u00a0signed\u00a0into law in December.", "Throughout Nepute\u2019s 24-minute video about masks, he repeatedly urges viewers to visit his website for vitamins while presenting the faulty claims about face masks \u2014 and later, COVID-19 vaccines and more.", "Here, we\u2019ll fact-check a few of the claims in the video.", "Nepute begins: \u201cReason no. 1 \u2014 this is wild right here. Cavities. I didn\u2019t even know this was a thing until I started digging into it about a week or so ago. New York dentists are reporting that half their patients are suffering from decaying teeth at a higher rate in 2021 and 2020 than they had been before, due to \u2014 and this is Dr. Rob Raimondi \u2014 he told Fox News that just a week ago, that people are getting cavities from wearing a mask.\u201d", "The underlying story from the Centre for Research on Globalization that is being used by Nepute refers to an interview that Raimondi, a dentist in New York, did with the New York Post in August, which was republished on the Fox News website. Raimondi told the Post that his practice was seeing people with gum inflammation and \u201ccavities in people who have never had them before \u2026 about 50% of our patients are being impacted by this.\u201d", "But the American Dental Association told us in a statement that \u201c[t]o date, we have seen no evidence of an increase in cavities in the last year, or that wearing a mask affects your risk of cavities.\u201d", "Dr. Patricia Corby, associate dean of translational research in the department of oral medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, similarly told us in an email that \u201cthere is no rationale why wearing a mask would increase decay or periodontal disease. Also, no research has been done to prove otherwise.\u201d", "What Raimondi and a colleague told the Post, more specifically, was that wearing a mask can increase mouth dryness, since people may breathe more through their mouth when wearing a mask, which can lead to bacteria building up. But they didn\u2019t advocate against wearing masks.", "Raimondi in a subsequent Instagram post about the interview said, \u201cWe absolutely support mask wearing.\u201d He recommended some ideas for avoiding dry mouth.", "The American Dental Association likewise told us that \u201cexcessive breathing through your mouth, whether you are wearing a mask or not, may increase development of dry mouth, which increases the risk of cavities. Saliva helps to keep the mouth moist and remineralize tooth enamel which helps fight decay. Even when wearing a mask, it is best to breathe through your nose. Another good way to decrease the risk of cavities is to drink fluoridated water. This can help to avoid dry mouth as the fluoride in the water will help prevent tooth decay.\u201d", "Corby said COVID-19 could have affected individuals\u2019 dental and oral health in another way: The pandemic prompted dental clinics around the world to shut down \u2014 and some practices to close completely. Even when some could reopen, she said, the pace was slow and some patients were hesitant to visit the dentist.", "\u201cNo. 2: Facial deformities. Masking children triggers mouth breathing, which has been shown to cause narrowing of the face, narrowing of the mouth, high vaults in the palate, dental malocclusions \u2014 and the list goes on and on,\u201d Nepute tells his viewers. \u201cThis is according to the Journal of General Dentistry. They say you shouldn\u2019t wear one.\u201d", "He\u2019s referring to the Academy of General Dentistry\u2019s journal, General Dentistry, which did not say not to wear a mask. The report being referenced didn\u2019t evaluate masks at all.", "Instead, the 2009 report looked at the implications of mouth breathing in children.", "Dr. Callan White, a dentist and national spokesperson for the Academy of General Dentistry, told us by phone that the video\u2019s claim requires \u201cseveral jumps.\u201d There is no scientific evidence showing that children resort to exclusively breathing through their mouth while wearing a mask, he said, and that they do so for long enough to mirror children who experience chronic mouth breathing.", "\u201cChildren who suffer from these conditions aren\u2019t able to breathe through their nose at all, or very little, at all times. This condition creates the most harmful effects at night while the child is sleeping,\u201d he told us in an email. \u201cThere is a significant difference in frequency and duration of the habit\u201d of mouth breathing due to wearing a mask.", "\u201cWith this said, remind children to breathe through their nose while wearing a mask, make sure the mask properly fits the child, take mask breaks when possible, and clean/disinfect cloth masks frequently (discard disposable masks as directed by manufacturer),\u201d he added.", "Nepute also misleadingly claims that face masks are associated with an \u201cincreased risk of COVID-19.\u201d", "\u201cWhat, wait a minute, I thought I was wearing a mask to stop the spread of COVID-19?\u201d he says. \u201cJust like when they told me that I\u2019m getting a vaccine to stop the spread, that doesn\u2019t do it either.\u201d (We\u2019ll address his factual distortions about vaccines later in this story.) He then cites \u201cpublic health officials of Ontario\u201d to claim that \u201cmask use by the general public could be associated with the \u2026 theoretical elevated (risk) of COVID-19.\u201d", "That\u2019s a reference to a September document issued by Public Health Ontario that described what the agency knew about the use of masks to control the spread of the coronavirus \u2014 including the benefits, which Nepute fails to mention.", "Instead, Nepute homes in on only one part of the document, which says: \u201cMask use by the general public could be associated with a theoretical elevated risk of COVID-19 through decreased physical distancing and self-contamination.\u201d", "But those, again, are\u00a0theoretical risks \u2014 and ones that can be mitigated if other steps are taken while wearing masks.", "The first theoretical risk is that people wearing masks may not maintain physical distancing. But that\u2019s why health officials have continued to advise that masks should be worn in addition to, not in place of, distancing.", "And the second theoretical risk Nepute is citing, of self-contamination, \u201crefers to evidence that shows the frequency of face-touching behaviour in general,\u201d Public Health Ontario told us in an email.", "The agency said \u201cthe point about the \u2018theoretical elevated risk\u2019 is taken out of context.\u201d", "\u201cIf the outside of a mask is contaminated, there would be a theoretical risk that touching the mask then touching your face could result in exposure to virus \u2026 the mitigation for that is frequent hand hygiene,\u201d PHO told us. \u201cPHO continues to monitor and review the emerging evidence on non-medical masks and COVID-19.\u201d", "The agency further noted that the same document being cited also said on its first page that \u201cthe evidence shows that public mask-wearing is likely beneficial as source control and mandatory public mask policies have been associated with a decrease in new COVID-19 cases compared to regions without such policies.\u201d", "\u201cBacterial pneumonia is on the rise,\u201d Nepute says. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a ton of that in our practices. We\u2019ve seen so much respiratory bacterial infections it\u2019s not even funny, especially among children.\u201d", "He adds: \u201cIn Oklahoma press conference, Dr. James Meehan indeed testified, reporting coming from all of his colleagues are showing, across the world, increase in bacterial pneumonia.\u201d", "Nepute is referencing an ophthalmologist who was speaking out against a mask mandate in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in August. Meehan claimed (at 4:40) that \u201creports coming from my colleagues all over the world are suggesting that bacterial pneumonias are on the rise.\u201d He went to say he believed \u201cuntrained members of the public are wearing medical masks repeatedly, in a non-sterile fashion.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that experts do not recommend that medical masks that are meant to be worn once be reused.", "But we found no evidence to suggest that cases of bacterial pneumonia are on the rise \u2014 or that masks are causing such a trend. And experts have debunked different iterations of the same claim before.", "For example, Dr. Catharine Paules, an assistant professor at Penn State who specializes\u00a0in infectious diseases, has said \u201cthere is no data\u201d to support the claim that masks trap in bacteria and fungus and make people more susceptible to bacterial or fungal pneumonia.", "And our fact-checking colleagues at Reuters debunked a viral falsehood in September that mask-wearers were \u201carriving in ICU with antibiotic resistant strains of pneumonia from breathing in the pathogenic organisms they were meant to exhale.\u201d", "Nepute goes on to wrongly claim that \u201coh, by the way, that\u2019s the No. 1 thing that killed everybody during the Spanish Flu of 1918. Not the virus, but the bacterial infections. These masks are causing this.\u201d", "That\u2019s inaccurate, too.", "In 2008, researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \u2014 including the institute\u2019s director, Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2014 published a study that found that most deaths from the 1918 flu pandemic likely resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia after contracting the flu.", "\u201cThe pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs,\u201d the National Institutes of Health said in a release explaining the study.", "So to suggest the flu wasn\u2019t involved in those deaths is wrong. Furthermore, that study made no mention of masks.", "After trying to discredit masks and erroneously suggesting vaccines are ineffective, Nepute asks, \u201cWhy are you not doing the things that do work?\u201d and turns his attention to vitamin D. He later pitches an offer for a \u201cpatriot pack\u201d of vitamins that includes vitamin D3 and zinc.", "Nepute shows a Healthline story from October, headlined: \u201cNew Study Found 80% of COVID-19 Patients Were Vitamin D Deficient.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s why you should be taking vitamin D every day,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is like the 100th study that\u2019s shown vitamin D helps with this.\u201d", "He\u2019s overstating things.", "We\u00a0addressed\u00a0this topic several months ago and explained that, while vitamin D might be helpful in terms of COVID-19, there isn\u2019t enough scientific evidence yet to\u00a0know whether it can treat or prevent the disease. Research is ongoing.", "That said, health experts do advise getting enough vitamin D as part of a healthy lifestyle, regardless. Most of a person\u2019s vitamin D is made in the skin by exposure to sunlight.", "The Healthline story was about a\u00a0study\u00a0published in October in the\u00a0Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism\u00a0that evaluated the vitamin D levels of 216 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It found that the hospitalized patients had lower levels of vitamin D compared with a group in the general population \u2014\u00a0although it didn\u2019t identify a relationship between lower vitamin D levels and more severe disease among those patients.", "While suggestive, the study doesn\u2019t prove that vitamin D was a factor in whether those patients fell ill\u00a0or that taking vitamin D supplements would have helped, as it was not a randomized controlled trial.", "Nepute again returns to the topic of COVID-19 vaccines, asking: \u201cWhat do you mean it works?\u201d He goes on to add: \u201cEffective in what? It does not stop the spread of the virus. You understand that, right?\u201d", "First of all, the main point of the vaccines is to prevent those who contract the novel coronavirus from becoming seriously ill with the COVID-19 disease. And in that regard, they are highly effective. For more information, see our SciCheck story \u201cQ&A on COVID-19 Vaccines.\u201d", "As for\u00a0Nepute\u2019s suggestion that vaccines won\u2019t stop the spread of the virus, as we\u2019ve explained before, it\u2019s currently unclear how much the vaccines will limit transmission. But there\u2019s a good chance they will help curb transmission to some degree: Experts say with other vaccines, a vaccinated person, even if infected with the virus, often sheds less virus, therefore making them less contagious.", "Nepute also shows viewers the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, scrolling through entries and saying, for example: \u201cHere\u2019s what happened, this person had this done \u2014 it was the Pfizer vaccine \u2014 they died. This person had abdominal pain, it was life-threatening.\u201d", "But as we\u2019ve explained before, anyone can report to that system through an online form, and there is no vetting of the reports. And there is no evidence that authorized COVID-19 vaccines are harming people on any kind of wide scale. Many have the expected sore arms or temporary flu-like symptoms following vaccination, but serious side effects are uncommon, according to the CDC.", "The CDC notes that reports of death to VAERS following vaccination \u201cdo not necessarily mean the vaccine caused the death\u201d and that it \u201cfollows up on any report of death to request additional information and learn more about what occurred and to determine whether the death was a result of the vaccine or unrelated.\u201d", "It adds: \u201cTo date, VAERS has not detected patterns in cause of death that would indicate a safety problem with COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d", "About 20 minutes into his video, Nepute also claims that COVID-19 cases have dropped \u201cbecause they\u2019ve already changed the testing.\u201d", "\u201cThat happened on Inauguration Day, the World Health Organization said, stop the PCR testing, start switching to antibody testing,\u201d he claims.", "That\u2019s false. As we\u2019ve previously explained, the WHO\u2019s notice on Jan. 20 was a memo to lab professionals about the proper use of PCR tests. It was distorted on social media, with dubious websites wrongly claiming the guidance represented a massive change in testing protocol.", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
