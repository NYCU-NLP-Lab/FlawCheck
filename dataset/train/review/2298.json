The first two are of an obituary on Legacy.com for someone named Connor D. Betts, who died in 2014 at the age of 22. It says he was survived by four siblings, including someone named Megan Betts. The third screenshot shows a Daily Beast headline identifying the Dayton shooting suspect\u2019s sister, also named Megan Betts, who was among those killed in the shooting. The post seems to suggest that she and the sister of the Connor Betts who died in 2014 are the same person.", "But they\u2019re not.

More recently, he had been studying psychology at a local community college and worked at a Chipotle restaurant, the Washington Post reported.", "The obituary in the Facebook post is for Connor D. Betts, but the Dayton shooting suspect\u2019s middle name was Stephen.", "The obit for Connor D. Betts said he was survived by his mother, Kathleen O\u2019Leary Betts, and his father, Robert Betts.
