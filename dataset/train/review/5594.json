["\u201cThe COVID package costs every single American $5,750 and then gives SOME people $1,400,\u201d said a March 7, 2021 Facebook post by \u201cDear America\u201d podcast host Graham Allen that has been shared more than 7,000 times.", "\u201cALSO, Your children\u2019s children will be paying off this 1.9 TRILLION dollar addition to our National Debt long after you and I are gone....PATHETIC!\u201d the post continued.", "Similar posts, including on this Donald Trump fan page, used a screenshot of text tweeted by Republican Representative Dan Crenshaw. His tweet was retweeted and shared from his Facebook page more than 40,000 times, as well as from his Instagram account, where it was liked more than 170,000 times.", "The posts circulated as Congress considered the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 which spreads $1.9 trillion worth of aid across broad sections of pandemic-stricken US society. It received final passage by the House on March 10 and was signed into law by President Joe Biden on March 11.", "No Republicans voted for the bill, which they criticize for addressing \u201cleft-wing priorities\u201d that go beyond the pandemic.", "The plan comes after two earlier pandemic relief packages during the administration of former president Donald Trump, one worth $900 billion and the earlier CARES Act valued at $2.2 trillion.", "Claims that the latest relief package will cost every American $5,750 are roughly based on dividing the total $1.9 trillion price tag by estimates of the US population, economists told AFP.", "Although that is one way of understanding the cost to \u201cthe average American,\u201d the plan wouldn\u2019t literally cost everybody the same amount, said Alex Brill, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. He was a staff economist with the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors during the George W\u00a0Bush administration.", "\u201cThat\u2019s not how our system works. We don\u2019t have a system where... when we have the bills we just split them evenly like we all went out to dinner or something like that,\u201d Brill said by phone.", "It is unknown, however, how the cost will vary from that average between individuals, Brill said. The federal government is borrowing $1.9 trillion to pay for the relief package, but it is still not clear how that debt will be paid back, although taxes will be used to do so, he said.", "\u201cIt could be that we raise taxes on the rich and the rich pay it back or it could be that we raise taxes on everybody,\u201d or perhaps, in the future, spending on Medicare, defense or something else will be cut so that taxes don\u2019t have to be raised, Brill added.", "\u201cBut in either scenario taxes will go to paying off the money... being borrowed today,\u201d he said.", "At the end of fiscal year 2019, publicly held debt was $16.8 trillion, or 79 percent of US gross domestic product.", "The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a non-partisan research initiative at the University of Pennsylvania, found that the American Rescue Plan produces a net present loss in GDP of $16,512 per capita. This \u201csuggests that the cost is potentially higher than the $5,750,\u201d Marcos Dinerstein, an economist from the team, said by email.", "\u201cBut it cannot be directly translated into what it costs for each individual\u201d without further analysis, he emphasized.", "The Budget Model figure \u201ctakes into account all losses in GDP from now into the future and puts it in 2020 dollars so we can have a number that summarizes the policy impact,\u201d Dinerstein said. \u201cMany people will not be alive that long and hence their cost would be much lower.\u201d", "In its analysis, the Budget Model found that the relief\u00a0plan\u2019s expenditures would stimulate the economy in 2021, when wages and tax revenue would rise. In subsequent years, though, as investors buy government debt with savings that would have gone to \u201cproductive capital,\u201d wages would fall along with GDP and government revenue, the Budget Model said.", "Gray Kimbrough, an economist with American University\u2019s School of Public Affairs, said the social media claims about the Rescue Plan are \u201ckind of based on misleading portrayals of ways that you can think about this.\u201d", "The package needs to be viewed in a much broader context than the stated cost of $5,750 and the $1,400 payments, Kimbrough said by phone.", "\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing here is comparing specific numbers that may be calculated in a way that makes sense but are not necessarily getting at what this act really accomplishes and what it really costs,\u201d he said.", "The posts and tweets ignore the fact that, in addition to the stimulus checks of up to $1,400, the package includes many other things, he said.", "Among them: an extension of $300 a week unemployment benefits, expansion of the Child Tax Credit, billions of dollars for vaccines, assistance for health insurance, and aid for schools as well as for state and local governments.", "\u201cThe idea is that spending is worth it when it increases growth to pay for itself or it otherwise attains things that we want to have happen,\u201d Kimbrough said.", "\u201cIn this case we have to address the pandemic to enable the economic growth to pay for things like this, and so it is certainly a leap to say that this leads to a direct payment of $1.9 trillion in additional debt that will have to be paid off.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
