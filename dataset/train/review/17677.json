He's not paid. He's an adviser, like many others. But I do not have lobbyists running my campaign,\" Romney said. He added that Kaufman did not attend the campaign's regular strategy sessions.", "Johnson kept challenging Romney, noting that Kaufman had traveled on the campaign plane and then he got Romney to acknowledge that Kaufman had provided advice during strategy sessions for debates.", "To examine the truth of Romney's statement, let's first address his point that you must be a paid staffer to be \"running\" the campaign.", "Because of the dynamic nature of a political race and the uneven flow of money, campaigns routinely rely on volunteers to play key roles.
