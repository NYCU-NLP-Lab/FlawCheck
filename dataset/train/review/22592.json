The image of the plane comes from a PhotoFunia template that allows users to create their own plane banners in a few short clicks:", "Here's a look at the original photograph from the Women's March (left) and the plane banner that was created with PhotoFunia:", "It is also worth considering that the concept of the domineering \"alpha male\" is based on incomplete science, has been questioned more and more since the phrase entered the popular lexicon in the 1980s via primate research, and in fact may simply be nothing more than an urban legend that endures through a combination of a shoddy understanding of pack behavior and wishful thinking.", "Waddell, Kaveh. \u00a0 \"The Exhausting Work of Tallying America's Largest Protest.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Atlantic. \u00a0 23 January 2017.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
