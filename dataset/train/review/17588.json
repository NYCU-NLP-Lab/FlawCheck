Marco Rubio, R-Fla., arrives at the chamber to take taking an oath and vote on how to proceed on the impeachment against former President Donald Trump, at the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 26, 2021. (AP)", "The total number of presidential directives signed by Biden during his first two days in office is greater than the number signed by Trump and Obama over the same period.", "The available record before FDR isn\u2019t complete enough to definitively say whether Rubio is also right about all presidents, but experts said it\u2019s likely that his claim still holds.", "It\u2019s worth noting that Biden issued multiple orders directed at a specific issue that\u2019s actively affecting the entire nation: the coronavirus pandemic.", "Sen. Marco Rubio, R. Fla., claimed that President Joe Biden talks like a centrist, but is \"governing like someone from the far-left.\"", "\"He has issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone,\" Rubio said in a video.", "Is that true?", "Rubio tweeted the video shortly before 8 a.m. Jan. 22, so we evaluated Rubio\u2019s claim based on actions Biden had taken up to that point (Jan. 20-21).", "Setting aside the political implications of the word \"fiat,\" we found that available evidence supports Rubio\u2019s assessment: Biden\u2019s use of the executive power in his first two days far outpaced that of his predecessors.", "Rubio\u2019s office did not respond to our requests for information.", "The total number of presidential directives signed by Biden during his first two days in office is greater than the number signed by Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama over the same period.", "Biden issued 17 executive orders on his first two days in office, compared with Trump who issued one and Obama who issued two. Biden issued three proclamations, while Trump and Obama each issued one.", "Executive orders state how to manage the operations of the executive branch of the federal government. Proclamations communicate information on holidays, commemorations, special observances, trade, and policy.", "The Office of the Federal Register numbers each executive order and proclamation consecutively as part of a series and publishes them in the daily Federal Register after the White House sends over the information. Other presidential documents, such as memoranda and notices, are not numbered but are also published.", "The Office of the Federal Register is in the process of digitizing documents published prior to 1994. So we were unable to use that source to compare Biden\u2019s actions with all other presidents. We turned instead to the American Presidency Project, a nonpartisan source of presidential documents hosted at the University of California, Santa Barbara.", "If Rubio was referring to a president\u2019s first two days in office (instead of any two-day period), the available documents show that he is correct dating back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose first inauguration was in 1933, said Gerhard Peters, a political science professor at Citrus College and co-director of the American Presidency Project.", "The available record before FDR isn\u2019t complete enough to say definitively whether Rubio is also right about earlier presidents, but experts said it\u2019s likely that his claim still holds.", "\"Before FDR, presidents simply did not charge into office as prepared for action,\" said John Woolley, co-director of American Presidency Project and professor emeritus of political science at UCSB. \"Even Lincoln, judging by the record assembled by (his secretaries John G. Nicolay and John Hay), did not fire off as many orders as Biden despite there already being an active revolt in progress.\"", "Rubio used the word \"fiat\" \u2014 a politicized term that would suggest Biden rushed in sweeping and long-lasting policy changes. However, Biden in his first two days issued 10 executive orders and one memorandum to address a specific issue that\u2019s actively affecting the entire nation: the coronavirus pandemic.
