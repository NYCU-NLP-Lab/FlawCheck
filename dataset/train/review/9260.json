["By Lori Robertson and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on February 24, 2020", "Former Vice President Joe Biden distorted the facts in two interviews in the wake of the Nevada caucuses:", "Biden\u2019s campaign points to Sanders expressing opposition to the Affordable Care Act before the Senate ultimately passed the legislation. It\u2019s true Sanders said as late as a week before the Dec. 24, 2009, vote that he was \u201cnot voting for the bill\u201d but that he would \u201cdo my best to make this bill a better bill\u201d that he could support. After a provision was added for billions in funding for community health centers, Sanders\u2019 vote was a yes.", "Biden made his claim during an interview on MSNBC on Feb. 23, a day after the Nevada caucuses, in which the former vice president came in second, behind Sanders. (See the 4:57 mark of the video.) \u201cHe was opposed to Obamacare, didn\u2019t like the fact we didn\u2019t push a single-payer option,\u201d Biden said of the Vermont senator.", "It\u2019s no secret Sanders, who has pushed Medicare for All legislation, backs a \u201csingle-payer option,\u201d or a universal coverage system in which everyone has health insurance through the federal government. He also supported that in 2009, introducing an amendment for a single-payer system while the ACA was being debated. However, he proposed the amendment on the Senate floor on Dec. 16, 2009, knowing it wouldn\u2019t pass and then withdrew it when Republican Sen. Tom Coburn objected to a request to dispense with the reading of the full amendment.", "On the Senate floor, Sanders criticized the Republican effort to \u201cbring the U.S. government to a halt by forcing a reading of a 700-page amendment,\u201d and he went on to explain why he wanted to propose legislation he knew would fail.", "Sanders, Dec. 16, 2009: My amendment, which was cosponsored by Sens. Sherrod Brown and Roland Burris, would have instituted a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. I was more than aware and very proud that, were it not for the Republican\u2019s obstructionist tactics, this would have been the first time in American history that a Medicare-for-all single-payer bill was brought to a vote before the floor of the Senate. I was more than aware that this amendment would not win. I knew that. But I am absolutely convinced that this legislation or legislation like it will eventually become the law of the land.", "The following day, after a public option provision was dropped from consideration, Sanders told Fox News that \u201cas of this point, I\u2019m not voting for the bill,\u201d citing the lack of a \u201cMedicare-type public option.\u201d He said he would \u201cdo my best to make this bill a better bill, a bill that I can vote for, but I have indicated both to the White House and the Democratic leadership that my vote is not secure at this point.\u201d", "The public option was a federal government health insurance plan that individuals and small businesses could have selected among other, private insurance policies. The Senate also considered, but eliminated, a compromise Medicare buy-in option for those age 55 to 64. Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent, opposed those measures.", "But just two days after that, on Dec. 19, 2009, Sanders touted the addition of a provision he said he requested to add $10 billion in funding for community health centers to boost primary health care services. And, as we said, when the Senate held the final vote on the Affordable Care Act, Sanders voted for it.", "By the time of the vote, the bill also included an extra $600 million in Medicaid funding to Vermont, though the Associated Press reported it was the negotiation from the state\u2019s other senator, Patrick Leahy, that won that concession due to the state having already expanded Medicaid eligibility prior to passage of the ACA.", "Vermont wasn\u2019t the only state to get benefits viewed as deals to secure votes. The AP listed seven senators, as well as a handful of other states and interest groups that got some concession in the final bill. Then-President Barack Obama said that \u201ccompromise is part of the process,\u201d adding the new amendments \u201chave made this landmark bill even stronger.\u201d", "On Dec. 22, 2009, Sanders said on MSNBC that the community health center funding, which would go to all states, \u201cwas an important factor in helping me to vote for this bill.\u201d", "The Biden campaign pointed to several instances in which Sanders called the ACA \u201cmodest.\u201d In October 2013, Sanders also said in an interview that it was \u201ctoo complicated,\u201d and his Senate office said: \u201cHe prefers a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system that would provide better care to more people at less cost.\u201d But those statements don\u2019t indicate that Sanders \u201copposed\u201d the ACA; they show he\u2019d prefer a Medicare-for-All system instead, a position he has campaigned on in the presidential race.", "Sanders\u2019 campaign pointed out that the senator defended the ACA in 2017 when Republicans were trying to repeal and replace it.\u00a0\u201cOur job today is to defend the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Sanders told supporters at rallies that year, according to Vox. \u201cOur job tomorrow is to create a Medicare-for-all single-payer system.\u201d", "The senator has been consistent in saying the ACA is a first step, in his view, and Medicare for All is what he believes the U.S. should implement. In that Dec. 22, 2009, interview with MSNBC, two days before his \u201cyes\u201d vote, he said the ACA wasn\u2019t \u201canywhere near as strong a bill as I would like,\u201d mentioning several factors including the lack of a public option. But, he said there were \u201ca lot of good things\u201d in the legislation, such as an expansion of insurance coverage to millions of the uninsured. The choice, he said, was either to \u201ckill the bill\u201d or \u201cpass something and try to improve it in years to come.\u201d", "He reiterated that after the Senate passed the bill. \u201cThe bill is not as strong as I wanted and I will work to improve it, but it begins to move this country toward the long-time goal of providing comprehensive, affordable health care for all Americans,\u201d Sanders said in a statement on Dec. 24, 2009. \u201cWe can do better, but this is an important step forward.\u201d", "On March 25, 2010, Sanders also voted for the reconciliation bill, passed as part of the ACA. He dropped an effort to try to add a public-option amendment to that legislation, saying that then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid convinced him and others that doing so might \u201cdestabilize a very sensitive situation,\u201d according to a report at the time in the Las Vegas Sun.", "In an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Margaret Brennan, host of CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Biden falsely claimed that he had never said that South Carolina would be his campaign\u2019s \u201cfirewall,\u201d in case he didn\u2019t perform well in the first three primary contests.", "Biden has previously used that term more than once when talking about his chances to win the state, where until recently Biden\u00a0had long held a double-digit lead\u00a0in polls \u2014 primarily\u00a0due\u00a0to his support among black Democratic voters in the state.", "Brennan, Feb. 22:\u00a0South Carolina, though, was your firewall.", "Biden: You said it, my firewall. I\u2019ve never said it\u2013", "Brennan:\u00a0The campaign has said it\u2019s your\u2013", "Biden:\u00a0No\u2013", "Brennan:\u00a0\u2013firewall.", "Biden:\u00a0It\u2019s not \u2014 I said I\u2019m going to do well there. And I\u2019ll do well there and I\u2019ll do well-beyond there as well.", "In an\u00a0NBC News\u00a0interview\u00a0on Feb. 2, for instance, Biden said: \u201cI think I\u2019ll do well in Nevada. And I think I have a real firewall in South Carolina. And then we go into the Super Tuesday states that have a significant number of minorities and African Americans. I think I\u2019m gonna do fine.\u201d", "The day before that, after a campaign event in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa,\u00a0CNN reported\u00a0that Biden made a similar statement about South Carolina while answering a CNN reporter\u2019s question about his chances in the Iowa caucuses.", "\u201cI just think it\u2019s a different year in that I think the measure, you all won\u2019t do it now, and I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, but I think what you\u2019re going to have to measure is who can represent every aspect of the Democratic Party,\u201d Biden said, according to CNN. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I think it matters how you \u2013 it\u2019s [Iowa] not as consequential in one sense as it has been in years past. Because I feel very strongly that we have a great firewall in South Carolina. I think we\u2019re in a position where we\u2019ll do very well in Nevada, I think it\u2019s gonna be a real uphill race as it always is for a non-New Englander in New Hampshire. And I think it\u2019s gonna be just a tossup here [Iowa]. It has been all the way along.\u201d", "The Associated Press also\u00a0reported that\u00a0Biden said in October that South Carolina is the state that would really propel his campaign forward.", "\u201cPeople talk about South Carolina being a firewall. I kind of view South Carolina being a diving board. It\u2019s going to catapult me into the Super Tuesday areas that are a lot of the South, from Georgia to Texas to Florida, across the board,\u201d he was quoted as saying.", "Biden\u2019s denial about once describing South Carolina to be his campaign\u2019s \u201cfirewall\u201d comes as recent polls show his lead in the state has dropped to single digits.", "A\u00a0CBS News poll conducted before \u2014 and released the day after \u2014 Sanders easily won in Nevada, showed that Biden (28%) has just a 5 percentage point lead over Sanders (23%) in South Carolina. CBS News noted that Biden\u2019s lead was once as large as\u00a028 percentage points\u00a0(over Sen. Elizabeth Warren) in November, according to another of its polls.", "In the interview, Brennan also said that the same poll showed Biden\u2019s support among black voters has declined by 19 percentage points in four months \u2014 from 54% to 35%.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
