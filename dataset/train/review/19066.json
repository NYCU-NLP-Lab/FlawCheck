Spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to Cuccinelli\u2019s support of personhood bills in 2007 and 2012 that would have granted legal rights to human embryos from the moment of conception. Those bills, he said, would have banned all abortions.", "Cuccinelli, as we\u2019ve noted before, did support personhood bills. But that doesn\u2019t mean he opposes abortion in every circumstance.
