["A video of a youth thrashing an elderly man has been shared by several users with the claim that a sadhu was beaten by a Muslim man in Uttarakhand. Below is a tweet by one Nitin Shukla which reads, \u201cPalghar wasn\u2019t an accident but an experiment. Now sadhus are being lynched in different places. The one beating him is a Muslim. Will it be you tomorrow? They will enter your house and kill you? Just like Delhi? If you want to save yourself, send these terrorists to jail.
