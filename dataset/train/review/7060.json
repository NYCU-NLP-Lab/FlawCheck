With a distinctive Wisconsin tone, Bryce said: \"Let\u2019s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I\u2019ll go to D.C.\"", "At least in Democratic circles, Bryce became a sensation. Ten months later, his prospects improved dramatically when Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, announced he would not seek re-election to his southern Wisconsin seat.", "But despite Bryce\u2019s everyman image, which he has continued to cultivate in the campaign, a claim he made on the May 6, 2018, edition of \"The Circus,\" a weekly political program on the Showtime cable network, caught our attention.", "It came during this exchange with co-host Mark McKinnon, as Bryce made a reference to President Donald Trump:", "Bryce: Last year at this time, I was working on a parking structure, and just talking with the co-workers, just really ticked off at what's going on, and they're like, what are you going to do? And I was like, well, I'll show you.\n\nMcKinnon: So you're not a politician?\n\nBryce: No, and I think that's what people like. But I mean, people voted for Trump because he was seen as a non-establishment type guy.", "Nationally, Bryce is a newbie; but this isn\u2019t his first electoral rodeo.", "So, let\u2019s check his claim that he is not a politician.", "Like us on Facebook.

August 2012: Bryce lost, 70 percent to 30 percent, in the Democratic primary for an open seat in the Wisconsin Assembly.", "2. February 2013: Ten candidates, including Bryce, ran for three seats on the Racine Unified School Board. Four of them, including Bryce, were eliminated in the primary.", "3.

He was defeated, 61 percent to 39 percent, by a Republican who formerly held the seat.", "To Mordecai Lee, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee political science professor and former Democratic state lawmaker, Bryce seems more like \"a wanna-be politician.\"", "\"It\u2019s easier to say who is a politician,\" Lee said, referring to current elected officials in jobs that pay more or less a full-time salary. \"Short of that, it sort of becomes a rhetorical somersault.\"", "But his current campaign means Bryce is now making his fourth run for public office in six years \u2014 arguably, enough to make him a perennial candidate. And running for Congress is a much larger venture than school board, or even the statehouse.", "\"There\u2019s not an obvious point when a person becomes a politician,\" said Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist, \"but Bryce has done enough things that he\u2019s clearly moving toward that category.\"", "Taegan Goddard, publisher of Political Wire, was stronger.", "\"If you continue to run, you\u2019re spending a decent amount of effort trying to win public office \u2014 you\u2019re a politician in that case,\" he said, adding: \"If you\u2019re going to spend that much time running for a congressional seat,\" he added, \"that is a full-time job.\"", "Indeed, for Bryce to flatly reject the label of politician as he did on Showtime, verges on disingenuous. In the eyes of a typical ironworker who has never run for public office, Bryce\u2019s four runs might make him look very much like a politician. And he hasn\u2019t been working the iron during 2018, his campaign told us, as he runs full time for Ryan\u2019s seat.", "More Randy Bryce fact-checks:", "His campaign staff \"first to unionize in the history of politics.\" Mostly True.", "Under his own bill, Trump's family could not have come to U.S. Half True.", "Ryan hasn\u2019t held a public town hall in the district in 600 days.
