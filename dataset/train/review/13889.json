Zelenko\u2019s claims, however, rest solely on taking him at his word: He has published no data, described no study design, and reported no analysis.", "In an open letter to Trump dated March 23, 2020, and published online in various locations, Zelenko provided his first batch of assertions without providing evidence to support his treatment regime:", "I developed the following treatment protocol in the pre-hospital setting and have seen only positive results. [...]", "The rationale for my treatment plan is as follows. [...] We know that hydroxychloroquine helps Zinc enter the cell. We know that Zinc slows viral replication within the cell. Regarding the use of azithromycin, I postulate it prevents secondary bacterial infections. These three drugs are well known and usually well tolerated, hence the risk to the patient is low.", "Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.", "In sum, my urgent recommendation is to initiate treatment in the outpatient setting as soon as possible in accordance with the above. Based on my direct experience, it prevents acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), prevents the need for hospitalization and saves lives.", "As has been noted elsewhere, combining hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin can cause serious problems for people with certain heart conditions. Though zinc appears to be an important factor in several immune functions, a potential mechanism for how it might work against viral infections is not well-understood.", "In an interview with Forward, Zelenko \u201cacknowledged that his regimen was new and untested, and that it was too soon to assess its long-term effectiveness.\u201d He instead argued that \u201cthe risks of waiting to verify its efficacy\u201d were greater. This is an assertion with which public health officials largely disagree.", "Regardless, making an assertion in a blog post or in a YouTube interview that neither describes the study design nor provides the actual data used to reach a conclusion about efficacy cannot, in any way, be critically evaluated. As such, this claim is rated \"Unproven.\"", "Zelenko, Vladimir. \u00a0 \"\u2019A Report on Successful Treatment of Coronavirus.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Global Research. \u00a0 23 March 2020.", "American College of Cardiology. \u00a0 \u201cVentricular Arrhythmia Risk Due to Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin Treatment For COVID-19.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 29 March 2020.", "Hemil\u00e4, Harri, and Elizabeth Chalker. \u00a0 \"\u2019Zinc for Preventing and Treating the Common Cold.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Cochrane Library. \u00a0 September 2017.", "Feldman, Ari. \u00a0 \"\u2019This Doctor Was Already Treating Patients With Trump\u2019s \u2018Gift from God\u2019 Drug \u2014 Before FDA Approval\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Forward. \u00a0 24 March 2020.", "Mackey, Robert. \u00a0 \"Trump Disagrees With Top Immunologist Over Untested Drug Treatment for Covid-19.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Intercept. \u00a0 20 March 2020.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
