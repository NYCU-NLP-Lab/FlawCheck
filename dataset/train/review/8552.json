Sebelius, which upheld the ACA but found states couldn\u2019t be forced to expand Medicaid under the law. Writing in January 2017 in the Notre Dame Law School journal, Barrett reviewed a book by Randy Barnett. She said: \u201cIn NFIB v. Sebelius, the inspiration for Barnett\u2019s book, Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did\u2014as a penalty\u2014he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress\u2019s commerce power. \u2026 Barnett is surely right that deference to a democratic majority should not supersede a judge\u2019s duty to apply clear text. \u2026 If the majority did not enact a \u2018tax,\u2019 interpreting the statute to impose a tax lacks democratic legitimacy.\u201d", "That\u2019s clearly a critique of Roberts\u2019 opinion.
