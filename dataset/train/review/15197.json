["An alleged rate list with a price tag put on non-Muslim women with an exhortation to lure them and convert them to Islam is circulating on social media. The price ranges from Rs. 6 lakh for a Hindu Brahmin girl to Rs. 3 lakh for a Jain girl and Rs. 7 lakh for a Sikh girl.

Such a mistake would be unusual if this had actually been a pamphlet issued by an Islamic organisation. Moreover, it is the heart-shaped image at the top of the pamphlet that gives the most concrete evidence of this poster being a photoshopped one. The gun-shaped image within the heart is actually the flag of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shi\u2019a Islamist militant group.
