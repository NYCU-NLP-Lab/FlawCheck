That's when people protesting government spending will bring 20-30 children dressed in prison uniforms and put them in fake debtor jails.

And it's also a great way to ensure continued work for psychologists of tomorrow.", "The event is part of a nationwide Tea Party demonstration put on by Libertarians, Republicans, and others who think economic stimulus bills are a good occasion to put our children into fake debtor jails.", "Sid Dinerstein, chairman of the Republican Party of Palm Beach County and an organizer of the event, said the fake jails will be two dimensional, meaning the kids won't actually be held captive at any point. Except by the government's excessive debt.", "This same photograph was similarly used outside its original context as part of a meme in 2012, but that time it was employed to scare parents about the looming \"police state\" as behavioral issues in school were being treated as crimes:", "Barton, Eric. \u00a0 \"Children with No Financial Future to Be Jailed.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 [Broward Palm Beach] New Times. \u00a0 14 April 2009.", "Shapiro, Leslie and Manas Sharma. \u00a0 \"How Many Migrant Children Are Still Separated from Their Families?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 8 August 2018.", "Ainsley, Julia and Jane C.
