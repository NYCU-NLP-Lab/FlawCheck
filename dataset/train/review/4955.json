["By Robert Farley", "Posted on March 11, 2020", "Sen. Bernie Sanders wrongly claimed President Donald Trump said if people have symptoms of the new coronavirus infection, \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter, go to work.\u201d That\u2019s not what the president said.", "Trump was making the point that infections are likely to go unreported by many who may experience only mild symptoms, opt not to go to a doctor and then get better \u2014 including some who may continue to go to work. As a result, Trump said, the rate of deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, may appear to be higher because of the unreported cases.", "Some may fault Trump for not immediately noting \u2014 as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \u2014 that people who experience symptoms are encouraged not to go to work. But Trump was not recommending that people with coronavirus infections go to work.", "Sanders\u2019 comments came during a Fox News town hall on March 9 when he was asked to assess Trump\u2019s handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak.", "Sanders said the fast-spreading virus \u2014 which has now been declared a pandemic \u2014 demonstrates why Medicare for All is a good idea.", "\u201cYou have got millions of people in this country today who may feel that they have a symptom, but you know what? They cannot afford to go to a doctor. And then they are going to go to work,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have a president of the United States, you know, \u2018Doesn\u2019t matter, go to work.\u2019 We have a president who says absurd things. So, what we need to do is, right now make it clear that all Americans, if you are feeling sick, go to a doctor. It will be paid for. Don\u2019t hesitate to go to the doctor.\u201d (See the 4:05 mark of the video.)", "About a minute later, Sanders mocked the president for saying he has a \u201cnatural ability\u201d to understand the problem.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t say stupid things,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou don\u2019t suggest to people that you can go to work. That\u2019s not what the scientists and what the doctors are saying.\u201d", "Sanders isn\u2019t the only one who has characterized Trump\u2019s words this way. For example, Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth tweeted: \u201cAs a general rule, you shouldn\u2019t trust what President Trump says. With the coronavirus, it could be dangerous to your health. Don\u2019t go to work if you are sick.\u201d", "But Trump never said that sick people should go to work.", "Trump made the comments in question in a telephone interview on March 4 with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, when the president called the World Health Organization estimate that 3.4% of reported COVID-19 patients worldwide have died \u201ca false number.\u201d As we wrote, that\u2019s not a false number, although experts say Trump has a point that the fatality rate may ultimately be quite a bit less than 3.4%, because the WHO\u2019s rate does not take into account unreported cases. Trump\u2019s point was that there are likely a lot of unreported cases.", "Trump, March 4: Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number. Now, this is just my hunch, and \u2014 but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it\u2019s very mild. They will get better very rapidly. They don\u2019t even see a doctor. They don\u2019t even call a doctor. You never hear about those people. So, you can\u2019t put them down in the category of the overall population in terms of this corona flu and \u2014 or virus. So you just can\u2019t do that. So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work \u2014 some of them go to work, but they get better. And then, when you do have a death, like you have had in the state of Washington, like you had one in California \u2014 I believe you had one in New York \u2014 you know, all of a sudden, it seems like 3 or 4%, which is a very high number, as opposed to \u2014 as opposed to a fraction of 1%. But, again, they don\u2019t know about the easy cases, because the easy cases don\u2019t go to the hospital.", "Trump did not say that people experiencing symptoms of the virus should go to work. Rather, he was saying that cases will go unreported because many people will not go to a doctor; they will simply allow the illness to take its course and get better.", "After some TV commentators criticized the president\u2019s comment, Trump tweeted that he \u201cNEVER\u00a0said people that are feeling sick should go to work.\u201d", "To be clear, the CDC has recommended that employers \u201cactively encourage sick employees to stay home.\u201d", "According to the CDC, \u201cEmployees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are recommended to stay home and not come to work until they are free of fever (100.4\u00b0 F [37.8\u00b0 C] or greater using an oral thermometer), signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines (e.g. cough suppressants).\u201d", "Some may fault Trump for not echoing those warnings to workers and employers when he made his comments on Fox News, but his point was not that people with symptoms should go to work, only that some with mild symptoms will.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
