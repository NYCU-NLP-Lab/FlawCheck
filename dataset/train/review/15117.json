["About this rating", "In late July 2019, multiple misreports about the a Democratic delegation to Italy and Ghana were spread online. One of those versions involved a false claim that U.S. Rep.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., posted a picture to her official Twitter feed showing Pelosi visiting the memorial with her:", "They said \u201csend her back\u201d but Speaker @SpeakerPelosi didn\u2019t just make arrangements to send me back, she went back with me \u270a?", "So grateful for the honor to return to Mother Africa with the @TheBlackCaucus and commemorate The Year of Return! #Doorofreturn #Ghana pic.twitter.com/0yVBLcAEs5", "\u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) August 1, 2019", "\"Send her back\" was a reference to a rally chant about Omar at one of U.S. President Donald Trump's political events.
