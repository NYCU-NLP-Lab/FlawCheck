["Donald Trump has said he\u2019s thinking about running for president, and while he\u2019s gotten a lot of attention for questioning President Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate, he\u2019s also made several provocative statements about foreign policy.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News, Trump discussed the Middle East, starting out with the war in Iraq, then moving on to U.S. air strikes in Libya.\n\n\"You know in the old days, when you won a war, to the victor belongs the spoils. You kept it,\" Trump said. \"We win a war, and we hand it over to some people we don't know and we leave.\"\n\n\"And we lose the contracts to China,\" interjected one of the Fox anchors.\n\n\"Yes, China will be another one,\" Trump agreed. \"By the way, Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya. What are we doing?\"\n\nWe thought Trump\u2019s statement about Libya and China was interesting, so we decided to look into it. We asked a Trump spokesman for comment, but we didn't hear back.\n\nSo we turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a federal agency that collects data on energy. We\u2019ll take Trump\u2019s statement in two parts.\n\n\u00a0\u2022 Libya supplies the oil for China. Libya does supply some oil to China, but it\u2019s not as large as Trump\u2019s statement implies.\n\nThe EIA showed that Libya\u2019s No. 1 customer is Italy, which bought 28 percent of Libya\u2019s exports in 2010. Italy was followed by France, at 15 percent, then China, at 11 percent. After that, Libya sold to Germany, 10 percent; Spain, 10 percent; Greece, 5 percent; the United Kingdom, 4 percent, and United States, 3 percent. (More on that 3 percent in a bit.) Other countries combined to buy 14 percent of Libya\u2019s exports.\n\nWe also wanted to know what share of China's imported oil comes from Libya. We found that in 2009, China bought most of its imported oil from Saudi Arabia, which supplied 21 percent. That was followed by Angola, 16 percent; Iran, 11 percent; Russia, 8 percent; Sudan, 6 percent; Oman, 6 percent; Iraq, 3.5 percent; Kuwait, 3.5 percent and then Libya at 3.1 percent. Libya is followed by Kazakhstan at 2.9 percent and Venezuela at 2.6 percent. Other countries combined supplied 17.4 percent of China\u2019s imports.\n\nSo China is a big customer of Libyan oil, but not the biggest, and there are many other customers. And Libya is far from being China\u2019s chief supplier. It ranks ninth.", "\u2022 We get no oil from Libya. The United States doesn\u2019t get much oil from Libya.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. imported 25.7 million barrels of oil from Libya, down from a recent high of 42.8 million barrels in 2007. The U.S. didn\u2019t import any oil from Libya between 1982 and 2004, due to an oil embargo first imposed by President Ronald Reagan.\n\nLibya is such a small source that it doesn\u2019t make it into the list of the top 15 countries from which the United States imports oil.\n\nU.S companies are working to develop Libya\u2019s oil sector, however. In 2009, a deputy assistant secretary of state told Congress that U.S. companies are \"probably the most active and the most successful\" in helping Libya revitalize its oil sector.\n\n\"They're seeking our technology because it's the best in the world and we're doing quite well,\" said the U.S. State Department\u2019s William Hudson. \"The Chinese are also active, but our companies have really taken the lion's share so far of bidding on plots for oil production.\"\n\nTrump said, \"Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya.\" His point in the first sentence was clearly that Libya was a major supplier of oil for China. But the data do not support his claim. Libya is far from being China\u2019s chief supplier. It ranks ninth.", "The second part of his statement is false -- the U.S. does get oil from Libya and the percentage is likely to increase..", "On the whole, we rate Trump\u2019s statement False.", "Fox News, interview with Donald Trump, April 4, 2011", "U.S. Energy Information Administration, Country Analysis Briefs: China, November 2010\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration, Country Analysis Briefs: Libya, February 2011\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. Imports from Libya of Crude Oil, March 30, 2011\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. Imports by Country of Origin, March 30, 2011\n\nBBC News, Timeline, Libya sanctions, Oct. 15, 2004", "Prof. Deborah Brautigam, China and Libya: What's the Real Story?, March 4, 2011", "Interview with Prof. Deborah Brautigam, April 11, 2011", "Federal News Service, Hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, July 16, 2009, accessed via Nexis", "Los Angeles Times, Libyan strife exposes China's risks in global quest for oil, March 9, 2011", "The New York Times, In Libyan Port, Stranded Migrants Watch Hope Depart, Feb. 26, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
