There is also no evidence that the party operated a program called WIC, or something similar.", "The federal government created WIC in 1972 as an amendment to the Child Nutrition Act of 1966.

Party members and volunteers reportedly went to local grocery stores to ask for donations, consulted with nutritionists on healthy breakfast options for children, and then prepared and served the food.", "The government\u2019s 1966 Child Nutrition Act (that WIC was added to later on as an amendment) also established the pilot School Breakfast Program, which provided low-cost or free breakfasts to children in public schools. This was in operation three years before the Panthers\u2019 breakfast program began.", "Social media posts claim the Black Panther Party created the federal nutritional assistance program WIC.", "The party did run many community initiatives, including its successful Free Breakfast for Children Program.", "While some believe the effort may have inspired the federal government to make its school breakfast program permanent, and by extension WIC as well, there is no evidence that the party created or ran WIC.", "The statement is not accurate.
