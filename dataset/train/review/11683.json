["Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson fired up the crowd during a speech at the state GOP convention June 11 by declaring that \u201cwe\u2019re besieged today by political correctness.\u201d", "To illustrate his point, he singled out Janet Napolitano, the former Arizona governor who joined President Barack Obama\u2019s Cabinet. \u201cWe have a director of homeland security who cannot use and will not use the term \u2018terrorist attack\u2019 but instead substitutes \u2018man-made disaster,\u2019 \u201d Patterson said.", "Has the leader of an agency charged with keeping the United States safe indeed scrubbed \u201cterrorist attack\u201d from her vocabulary?", "When we contacted Patterson, he pointed us to congressional testimony that Napolitano gave in early 2009 and media accounts of the criticism that followed.", "On Feb. 25, 2009, Napolitano made her debut appearance before the House Homeland Security Committee. Before delivering her prepared statement, the committee\u2019s ranking Republican, Peter King, R-N.Y., noted correctly that the word \u201cterrorism\u201d did not appear in the text of her remarks.", "King said that he was \u201cnot trying to get into semantics on this\u201d but that \u201cit\u2019s important for us in positions of leadership to constantly remind people how real that (terrorism) threat is \u2026 and if we don\u2019t do it, it\u2019s going to be hard for us to get legislative support for the measures that we think have to be taken.\u201d", "In an aside to King as she addressed the committee, Napolitano then invoked the \u201cT\u201d word to describe the agency\u2019s mission: \u201cto confront and prepare for threats that face this nation, be they man-caused -- and terrorism, Rep. King, I believe falls into that category and is central to that category -- or be they caused by nature.\u201d", "The phrase \u201cman-caused\u201d deviated from Napolitano\u2019s prepared text, which used \u201cman-made\u201d instead. The first instance we found of Napolitano pairing the man-made concept with \u201cdisaster\u201d occurred a month earlier, in remarks prepared for her Senate confirmation hearing.", "Republicans, conservative commentators and other critics pointed to Napolitano\u2019s word choice as evidence that the Obama administration was tip-toeing around the threat of terrorism. Patterson told us that he sees it as \u201csome kind of reluctance to use words that others may take offense at even if those terms are accurate and truthful.\u201d", "Napolitano was asked about her terminology in March 2009 by a German news magazine, Der Spiegel. Using the term \u201cman-caused disasters,\u201d she replied, \u201cdemonstrates that we want to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur.\"", "In April 2009 remarks to an Anti-Defamation League conference, Napolitano offered further explanation for her use of \u201cman-caused disaster.\u201d She said that \u201cso often we think of terrorism and the mindset is just al Qaeda \u2026 But it is not the only such group, and so to use a different phrase is an effort to cause people to think more broadly about what we are dealing with, and that is those who seek to commit violence to impact broader societies through their economies, through the exercise of their freedoms, and the like.\u201d", "In early 2010, a writer for The New York Times cast the dust-up over Napolitano\u2019s language as an example of how the Obama administration has rejected some of the Bush administration\u2019s terrorism-related rhetoric (such as Bush references to \u201cevildoers\u201d and \u201cIslamo-fascist\u201d).", "So Napolitano says she\u2019s trying to expand the public\u2019s thinking about the kinds of threats the U.S. faces. Does that mean she cannot and will not say \u201cterrorist attack,\u201d as Patterson claims?", "It doesn\u2019t look that way.", "During her January 2009 confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Napolitano spoke the word \u201cterrorism\u201d five times and \u201cterrorist\u201d once; we counted.", "In March 2009, at a conference in Kansas City, Mo., she employed \u201cterrorist attack\u201d in response to a question about the role of the private sector in so-called \u201cfusion centers\u201d enabling law enforcement agencies to analyze and share intelligence information.", "And in a July 2009 speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, Napolitano used \u201cterrorist attack\u201d twice and \u201cterror attack\u201d once. An example: \u201cMake no mistake, Americans continue to be targeted in terror attacks,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cJust two weeks ago, American hotels were the target of bombings in Jakarta that killed eight people and injured six Americans.\u201d", "More recently, Napolitano told CNN on May 2, 2010 \u2013 the day after a sport-utility vehicle holding a bomb was found in New York\u2019s Times Square \u2013 that the incident was being treated \u201cas if it could be a potential terrorist attack.\u201d", "And on Friday, Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said: \u201cThe secretary speaks publicly about terrorism often, including in a speech less than 90 minutes ago to the American Constitution Society.\u201d", "Patterson said Friday that Napolitano\u2019s continued use of \u201cman-made disaster\u201d proves his point.", "We disagree. The essence of his charge at the convention was that the secretary can\u2019t and won\u2019t say \u201cterrorist attack.\u201d News accounts, congressional testimony and speeches prove otherwise.", "We rate Patterson\u2019s statement as False.", "Interviews with Jerry Patterson, Texas land commissioner, June 16 and 17, 2010", "E-mail correspondence with Patterson", "House Homeland Security Committee, video, \u201cDHS: The Path Forward, Feb. 25, 2009", "Department of Homeland Security, prepared testimony of Secretary Janet Napolitano before House Homeland Security Committee, Feb. 25, 2009", "CBS News, \u201cNapolitano Not Talking \u2018Terror,\u2019 \u201d Feb. 26, 2009", "Spiegel Online International, \u201cAway From the Politics of Fear,\u201d March 16, 2009", "Department of Homeland Security, \u201cRemarks by Secretary Napolitano at the Anti-Defamation League National Leadership Conference,\u201d April 22, 2009", "New York Times, \u201cObama\u2019s War Over Terror,\u201d Jan. 4, 2010", "U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, transcript of hearing on the nomination of Janet Napolitano to be homeland security secretary, Jan. 15, 2009", "Department of Homeland Security, \u201cRemarks by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to the National Fusion Center Conference in Kansas City, Mo.,\" March 11, 2009", "Department of Homeland Security, \u201cRemarks by Secretary Napolitano at the Council on Foreign Relations,\u201d July 29, 2009", "CNN, State of the Union with Candy Crowley, transcript, May 2, 2010", "Interview with Matthew Chandler, deputy press secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, June 18, 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
