As nearly all Americans come together on Memorial Day to honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for the country\u2019s freedom and safety, two CAIR officials spent the holiday weekend differently: questioning whether U.S. troops deserve to be honored and tweeting that the country was \u201cestablished upon white supremacy.\u201d", "The article was shared by the Facebook page \"Marines United\" on 14 April 2016, which may have led users to think that the item had been published recently. However, the article linked first appeared on 25 May 2015.

At no point during those tweets did Billoo or CAIR suggest or demand those opinions in any way influence celebration of Memorial Day. Billoo further described herself as \"staunchly anti-war,\" a position not at odds with conflicted feelings about Memorial Day.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
