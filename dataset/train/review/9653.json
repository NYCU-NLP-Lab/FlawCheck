They will NEVER like him, or vote for him. They are voting for \u2018TRUMP\u2019,\" Trump tweeted Nov. 1 around 8 a.m.", "Trump followed-up with a similar tweet a few hours later: \"Joe Biden constantly used the term \"Super Predator\" when referring to young Black Men, according to my sources.\"", "Trump also claimed this on the debate stage with Biden in September. Despite his repeated assertions, Trump\u2019s claims lack evidence.", "When Trump said this in September, his campaign pointed to a Trump campaign video that compiled clips of Biden saying the word \"predators.\" But none of those clips show Biden specifically calling Black people \"predators\" or \"superpredators.\" Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to our Nov. 1 query.", "As a senator in 1993, Biden supported a criminal justice bill that eventually became known as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.

It doesn\u2019t matter whether or not the person that is accosting your son or daughter or my son or daughter, my wife, your husband, my mother, your parents, it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not they were deprived as a youth; it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not they had no background that enabled them to become socialized into the fabric of society; it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not they are the victims of society. The end result is that they are about to knock my mother on the head with a lead pipe, shoot my sister, beat up my wife, take on my sons. So I do not want to ask what made them do this. They must be taken off of the street. That is No.1. There is a consensus on that. \u2026", "\"There is a second thing that we all have agreed upon.

Biden in a 1993 speech said that a portion of young people who lacked superpervision, structure and opportunities could become \"predators.\" The context of Biden\u2019s speech shows he was not specifically talking about Black people or any other specific group of people.
