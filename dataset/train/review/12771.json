["A New Zealand-based Facebook user here\u00a0posted a screenshot of an article with a caption saying:\u00a0\u201cSeriously WTH. Time to ensure your kids are not at school on Vax day folks.\u201d", "The screenshot shared in the post shows an article that is headlined: \u201cWHO now says your child\u2019s presence in school counts as \u2018informed consent\u2019 for vaccination - parental presence \u2018not required\u2019.\u201d", "The screenshot features the logo of\u00a0the World Health Organization and text with a heading that reads: \u201c3. An implied consent process\u201d.", "Part of the subsequent text is underlined and reads: \u201cThe physical presence of the child or adolescent, with or without an accompanying parent at the vaccination session, is considered to imply consent.\u201d", "The article shared in the screenshot appears to have been published here on a New Zealand-based website.", "The text in the article was taken from this 2014 WHO report titled \u201cConsiderations regarding consent in vaccinating children and adolescents between 6 and 17 years old.\u201d", "Posts making similar claims were also shared on Facebook here, here and here.", "The original article was shared over ten thousand times, according to data from the social media monitoring platform CrowdTangle.", "The article and the claims made in the Facebook posts, however, are misleading.", "Written consent", "A spokesperson for the New Zealand Ministry of Health said that \u201cwritten consent from parents/guardians is required\" for children under the\u00a0age of 16 to receive vaccinations at school.", "The agency\u2019s Immunisation Consent policy also states the consent process can only be undertaken \u201cafter the parent/guardian has had the opportunity to read the immunisation information and discuss any areas of concern\u201d.", "\u201cConsent forms are provided for immunisations given in schools by public health nurses and may also be used in mass vaccination settings. For children aged under 16 years who are being immunised at school, written consent must be obtained from the parent/guardian,\u201d the policy reads.", "Individuals over the age of 16 are able to self consent, according to the policy.", "The Ministry of Health spokesperson added that the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine has only been approved for people above the age of 16 \u201cso there is no expectation of school-based COVID-19 immunisation at this stage\u201d.", "Out of context", "The WHO does not say that sending your child to school equates to\u00a0blanket consent to vaccinations, as the article suggests.", "\u201cWHO does not recommend one specific approach to consent,\u201d a spokesperson for the organization told AFP in an email on February 16.", "\u201cApproaches to consent can vary considerably across countries and settings depending on national consent laws and policies,\" they added.", "The 2014 WHO report, only part of which is shared in the misleading article, outlines three commonly used consent processes for vaccination programs: written, verbal and implied.", "Implied consent requires parents\u00a0be informed of any imminent vaccinations and given the opportunity to opt out, a WHO spokesperson told AFP.", "After that, the presence of a child at the school vaccination session would be seen to\u00a0\u201cimply consent,\u201d according to WHO guidelines.", "The 2014 WHO report stressed that when a child is unaccompanied by their parents it can be\u00a0\u201cchallenging to determine whether parents indeed provided consent\u201d and urges countries to \u201cadopt procedures that ensure that parents have been informed and agreed to the vaccination\u201d.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
