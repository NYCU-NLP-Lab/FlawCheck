["About this rating", "On 29 May 2018 the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a significant increase in the number of unaccompanied children held in U.S. government detention centers compared to the prior month, as reported by the Washington Post:", "The number of migrant children held in U.S. government custody without their parents has surged 21 percent in the past month, according to the latest figures, an increase driven by the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d crackdown on families who cross the border illegally.", "Although the government has not disclosed how many children have been separated from their parents as a result of the new measures, the Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday that it had 10,773 migrant children in its custody, up from 8,886 on April 29.", "This increase in detentions follows a 6 April 2018 Department of Justice announcement that the Trump administration would be taking a new \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d regarding border crossings that explicitly include child separation. This policy has been controversial both for the child separation issue as well as its assertion that it requires the Department of Justice to prosecute \u201c100 percent\u201d of border crossing cases, which would deny a person\u2019s right to request asylum. Standing next to a segment the border called Friendship Park on 8 May 2018, Sessions said:", "People are not going to caravan or otherwise stampede our border. We need legality and integrity in the system. That\u2019s why the Department of Homeland Security is now referring 100 percent of illegal Southwest Border crossings to the Department of Justice for prosecution.\u00a0 And the Department of Justice will take up those cases.", "I have put in place a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for illegal entry on our Southwest border.\u00a0 If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you.\u00a0 It\u2019s that simple. If you smuggle illegal aliens across our border, then we will prosecute you. If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law.", "While the data reported by HHS in late May do not tell us what percentage of currently detained children arrived with parents from whom they were subsequently separated, we do know that child separation at the southern border has been increasing under the Trump administration as part of an overarching stance on immigration in general.", "Even prior to the \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d, the Trump administration \u2014 which has floated the use of child separation as a deterrent to border crossings since at least March 2017 \u2014 has been separating children caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border from their parents in higher number than had been disclosed, as reported by the New York Times in April 2018:", "New data reviewed by The New York Times shows that more than 700 children have been taken from adults claiming to be their parents since October, including more than 100 children under the age of 4. The data was prepared by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services that takes custody of children who have been removed from migrant parents.", "Senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which processes migrants at the border, initially denied that the numbers were so high. But after they were confirmed to The Times by three federal officials who work closely with these cases, a spokesman for the health and human services department on Friday acknowledged in a statement that there were \u201capproximately 700.\u201d", "The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), run by HHS, aims to place children detained into foster homes \u2014 those of family members residing in the United States or in homes located by or run by non-governmental agencies. This serves, ideally, to reduce the numbers of children in immigration detention facilities.", "But, in addition to the increased the number of unaccompanied children in need of settlement resulting from the Trump\u2019s administration \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d, some have argued that the administration has also reduced the ability for the government to find places to settle these children at all thanks to an recent ORR program known as the \u201cCommunity Safety Initiative.\u201d", "The program, which is intended to \u201cequip [unaccompanied alien children] with the tools they need to stay safe from gangs like MS-13\u201d and \u201cto ensure that the [unaccompanied alien children] we release from our care do not pose a danger to our communities,\u201d includes a controversial Memorandum of Agreement with the Department of Homeland Security, signed in April 2018, allowing for enhanced information sharing between two organizations. Advocates say this could be having a chilling effect on the resettlement program, as reported by the Washington Post:", "The agreement signed last month gives Homeland Security access to more information about potential sponsors and children\u2019s relatives \u2014 including their immigration status. That change will keep more kids in federal custody, immigrant advocates say, if their relatives are too scared to step forward or view a sponsorship decision as a choice between retrieving a child and risking their own deportation. In many cases, sponsors are aunts and uncles who may not have a close relationship to a child in custody and may be hesitant to jeopardize the immigration status of their own families, attorneys and advocates say.", "\u201cIt will also have a chilling effect on children\u2019s willingness to talk about who they know and who their relatives are because they won\u2019t want to get their families in trouble,\u201d said Michelle Brane of the New York-based Women\u2019s Refugee Commission.", "The Trump administration has used the capabilities of the Office of Refugee Resettlement as a way to justify their controversial policy of separating children from their families. In an interview with NPR, President Trump\u2019s Chief of Staff John Kelly argued that separating children from parents wasn\u2019t \u201ccruel and heartless\u201d because\u00a0 \u201cthe children will be taken care of \u2014 put into foster care or whatever.\u201d", "With over 10,000 children crowded into detention centers, including a temporary facility on loan from the Department of Labor set up to handle this most recent surge, it is unclear if Kelly\u2019s assertion is actually representative of the reality on the ground.", "Miroff, Nick. \u00a0 \u201cTrump\u2019s \u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019 at the Border Is Causing Child Shelters to Fill up Fast.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Washington Post. \u00a0 29 May 2018.", "Department of Justice. \u00a0 \"Attorney General Announces Zero-Tolerance Policy for Criminal Illegal Entry.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 6 April 2018.", "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. \u00a0 \"Obtaining Asylum in the United States.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 8 June 2018.", "Department of Justice. \u00a0 \"Attorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks Discussing the Immigration Enforcement Actions of the Trump Administration.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 8 May 2018.", "Ainsley, Julia Edwards. \u00a0 \u201cExclusive: Trump Administration Considering Separating Women, Children at Mexico Border.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Reuters. \u00a0 3 March 2017.", "Dickerson, Caitlin. \u00a0 \u201cHundreds of Immigrant Children Have Been Taken From Parents at U.S. Border Image.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Times. \u00a0 20 April 2018.", "Miroff, Nick. \u00a0 \u201c\u2018Lost\u2019 Migrant Children?
