["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Campaign literature distributed by Jim Sullivan for state Senate campaign in race against Republican Leah Vukmir", "In 2006, Wauwatosa Democrat Jim Sullivan won a Wisconsin state Senate seat long held by Republicans and helped his party take back control of the Senate.\n\nIn the 2010 race, Sullivan faces a tough challenge from state Rep. Leah Vukmir, a Wauwatosa Republican. Control of the Senate is again in play.\n\nBut Sullivan is running against his own party, declaring in a flier mailed to voters that he \"stood up to his own party by voting against the budget to stop runaway government spending.\"\n\nSo, is Sullivan a budget-busting maverick?\n\nLet\u2019s quickly break down Sullivan\u2019s claim into two parts, then add some context.\n\nSullivan \"stood up to his own party by voting against the budget\":\n\nSullivan\u2019s campaign said the flier\u2019s reference is to the 2009-\u201911 state budget, which the Senate approved, 17-15, in June 2009. Sullivan was the only Democrat to vote no.\n\nSullivan\u2019s budget vote was to \"stop runaway government spending\":\n\nDifferent people may define \"runaway\" spending differently. The $62 billion budget in question raised spending by 6.2 percent over two years and raised taxes and fees by $1.92 billion.\n\nWhile Sullivan cites a specific vote in his literature, he is making a broader point: that he has worked in Madison to rein in spending. For example, in citing his budget vote in a separate mailer, Sullivan says he \"wants our children to inherit a future free of wasteful government spending.\"\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a closer look at Sullivan\u2019s record, which in four years includes votes on two budgets and one \"budget repair\" bill.", "We asked Sullivan\u2019s campaign if there were instances, other than his 2009-\u201911 budget vote, in which Sullivan broke ranks with Democrats in an effort to control spending.\n\nThe campaign did not provide any.\n\nObservers noted that, given the Democrats\u2019 three-vote majority in the Senate, Sullivan\u2019s no vote did not affect the party\u2019s ability to get its budget passed.\n\nMordecai Lee, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee governmental affairs professor, said the two-year budget bill is the most important vote state lawmakers take. And leaders of the political party in power can exert great pressure on members to ensure that their budget passes.\n\nBut Lee, a former Democratic state senator, said he also witnessed cases in which a party would not fight an individual senator\u2019s budget vote against the party, if that senator faced a tough bid for re-election. \u00a0\n\nIn Madison parlance, it\u2019s called getting a pass.\n\nSo let\u2019s review.\n\nSullivan is telling voters in a campaign mailing that he \"stood up to his own party by voting against the budget to stop runaway government spending.\" He was the only Senate Democrat to vote against the 2009-\u201911 state budget, which raised taxes and spending. But Sullivan\u2019s vote didn\u2019t threaten his party\u2019s effort to pass the budget, he made no attempt to reduce spending in the plan and, on the previous budget and a budget repair bill, he voted with fellow Democrats to raise spending.", "We rate his statement Barely True.", "Email interviews with Sullivan for Senate campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Biese, Oct. 18, 20 and 21, 2010.", "E-mail interview with Vukmir for Senate campaign spokesman Luke Bacher, Oct. 18, 2010", "Interview with Wisconsin Republican Party treasurer Cathy Stepp, Oct. 20, 2010", "Interview with Sullivan for Senate campaign spokesman Zak Williams, Oct. 22, 2010\n\nInterview with Mordecai Lee, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professor of governmental affairs, Oct. 22, 2010\n\nJSOnline.com, State Senate goes to Dems, Nov. 8, 2006", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Wisconsin has a budget, Oct. 24, 2007", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Legislature didn't linger over painful budget process, June 27, 2009\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, Assembly passes budget, measure goes to Doyle, June 26, 2009", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, As Doyle's polls plunge, state Democrats try to stand clear, Oct. 18, 2010", "Sullivan for state Senate flier", "Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, State Tax and Fee Modifications Included in 2009 Act 28 (pages 1 and 25), July 8, 2009", "Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau,2009-11 Budget Summary Information, July 22, 2009", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
