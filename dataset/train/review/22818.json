["By Eugene Kiely and Robert Farley", "Posted on February 28, 2019", "Michael Cohen gave public testimony under oath that contradicted past statements by President Donald Trump on WikiLeaks, Stormy Daniels and a proposed Moscow real estate deal, as well as Trump\u2019s Vietnam War deferrals and his net worth.", "Here we lay out the conflicting accounts of what Trump\u2019s former personal attorney told the House Committee on Oversight and Reform at the Feb. 27 hearing, and what the president has said in the past.", "A key unresolved issue in the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election is whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks.", "Russia\u00a0intelligence services hacked into the computer network of Democratic Party officials and released the hacked material to WikiLeaks and others \u201cto help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances,\u201d according to a U.S. intelligence report released in January 2017.", "In his opening statement, Cohen said he was in Trump\u2019s office in July 2016 when Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s informal adviser and longtime friend, was on speaker phone talking about WikiLeaks and its plan to publicly release emails damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.", "Cohen, Feb. 27:\u00a0In July of 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump\u2019s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with [WikiLeaks founder] Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of \u201cwouldn\u2019t that be great.\u201d", "Cohen\u2019s statement directly contradicts Trump\u2019s claim that he never spoke to Stone about WikiLeaks.", "In an\u00a0interview\u00a0last month with the New York Times, shortly after Stone was indicted by the special counsel\u2019s office for lying to Congress, Trump had this exchange:", "Maggie Haberman, Times reporter, Jan. 31: Did you ever talk to him about WikiLeaks? Because that seemed \u2014", "Trump: No.", "Haberman: You never had conversations with him.", "Trump: No, I didn\u2019t. I never did.", "We should note that there is\u00a0no evidence that Stone ever talked to Assange, although that doesn\u2019t mean that Stone didn\u2019t boast that he did. Stone, however, texted news organizations after Cohen\u2019s opening remarks to say:\u00a0\u201cMr. Cohen\u2019s statement is not true.\u201d", "However, the special counsel\u2019s office alleges that on \u201cmultiple occasions\u201d Stone \u201ctold senior Trump Campaign officials about materials possessed by Organization 1 and the timing of future releases,\u201d as laid out in the indictment against Stone. The indictment refers to WikiLeaks as \u201cOrganization 1.\u201d (See \u201cTimeline of Russia Investigation\u201d for more details on Russia\u2019s influence campaign and WikiLeaks\u2019 role in it.)", "The Trump Organization was actively pursuing a real estate project in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign, but the public didn\u2019t learn about it until the Washington Post broke the story in August 2017 \u2014\u00a0about seven months into the Trump presidency.", "Trump signed a letter of intent with a Moscow-based developer, I.C. Expert Investment Co., on Oct. 28, 2015.\u00a0Cohen and\u00a0Felix Sater, a Trump\u00a0business associate,\u00a0led the Trump Organization\u2019s negotiations with Russian officials until at least June 2016 \u2014 which was the same month when reports first surfaced that Russia had hacked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers. At the time, the Trump campaign dismissed the hack as an inside job, not the work of Russia, and Trump issued numerous statements over the next several months saying he had no business dealings in Russia.", "In a July 27, 2016,\u00a0interview with a CBS affiliate in Miami, Trump said, \u201cI have nothing to do with Russia. I don\u2019t have any jobs in Russia. I\u2019m all over the world but we\u2019re not involved in Russia.\u201d A day earlier, he tweeted he has \u201cZERO investments in Russia.\u201d", "Even after he became president \u2014 but before the public learned about the Trump Moscow project \u2014 Trump denied having any business dealings in Russia.", "\u201cI have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian many years ago. I had the Miss Universe pageant \u2014 which I owned for quite a while \u2014 I had it in Moscow a long time ago. But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia,\u201d Trump said in a May 2017 interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt.", "In the NBC interview, and throughout the campaign, the president omitted any mention of his company\u2019s pursuit of the Moscow project. That was done on purpose, Cohen testified.", "Cohen told the House oversight committee that Trump \u201cknew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it.\u201d", "Cohen, Feb. 27:\u00a0In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell\u00a0me there\u2019s no Russian business and then go on to lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.", "Cohen continued to lie even after\u00a0the Post broke the story about the Moscow project and it became public knowledge.", "In November, Cohen\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0to lying to Congress when he told two congressional committees that\u00a0the company\u2019s pursuit of the project ended in January 2016 before \u201cthe Iowa caucus and \u2026 the very first primary.\u201d In fact, he said in his guilty plea, the Trump Organization continued negotiations into June 2016 \u2014 a month before Trump was nominated at the Republican National Convention.", "After Cohen\u2019s guilty plea in November, Trump falsely claimed that the Moscow project was \u201ca very public deal\u201d that \u201ceverybody knew about\u201d and \u201cwas written about in newspapers.\u201d Last month, Trump\u00a0dismissed the Moscow project as a \u201cvery unimportant deal,\u201d as he told the New York Times.", "\u201cI had no money invested. It was a letter of intent, or option,\u201d Trump told the Times. \u201cIt was a free option. It was a nothing. And I wasn\u2019t doing anything. I don\u2019t consider that even business. And frankly, that wasn\u2019t even on my radar.\u201d", "Cohen testified that the Moscow project was on Trump\u2019s radar, \u201cbecause he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.\u201d", "\u201cThere were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January of 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me \u2018How\u2019s it going in Russia?\u2019 \u2013 referring to the Moscow Tower project,\u201d Cohen said at the Feb. 27 House hearing.", "As we have written before, the president has denied that he had an affair with porn star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. He also denied, at least initially, knowing anything about the $130,000 that Cohen paid to Daniels in late October 2016 to prevent her from speaking out about the affair and damaging the campaign.", "The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0broke the story\u00a0about the hush money payment on Jan. 12, 2018.\u00a0The White House and Cohen denied the affair, without addressing the hush money payments. \u201cThese are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election,\u201d the White House said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0to the\u00a0Journal.\u00a0Daniels \u2014\u00a0 in a statement issued by Cohen on behalf of Daniels \u2014 said \u201crumors\u201d about \u201chush money\u201d payments are \u201ccompletely false.\u201d", "In early April, a reporter asked Trump directly if he knew anything about the payment. He answered, \u201cNo. No. What else?\u201d Pressed if he knew where Cohen got the money, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d", "But that false narrative was exposed on Aug. 21, when Cohen\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0to campaign finance violations for arranging \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u201cin coordination and at the direction of\u201d Trump \u2014 payments of $130,000 to Daniels and\u00a0$150,000 to\u00a0Playboy\u00a0model Karen McDougal. In McDougal\u2019s case,\u00a0Cohen admitted to \u201ccausing\u201d American Media Inc., owner of the\u00a0National Enquirer,\u00a0to pay McDougal for exclusive rights to her story of an extramarital affair with Trump with the express purpose of killing McDougal\u2019s story and preventing it from influencing the election, according to the plea agreement.", "In his testimony before the House oversight committee, Cohen provided a copy of a $35,000 check that he received from Trump in August 2017 \u2014 one of 11 payments Cohen said he received as reimbursement for the $130,000 payment to Daniels. Trump signed that check 10 months before\u00a0he denied knowing anything about the payment when asked about it in April 2018.", "Cohen, Feb. 27:\u00a0As Exhibit 5A to my testimony shows, I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank\u00a0account on August 1, 2017 \u2013 when he was president of the United States \u2013 pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me \u2014 the word used by Mr. Trump\u2019s TV lawyer \u2014 for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf.", "For his part, Trump has since acknowledged the payment to Daniels. Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, made that disclosure\u00a0on May 2, 2018, and Trump confirmed it on Twitter the next day.", "But Trump has maintained that he \u201cnever directed Michael Cohen to break the law,\u201d and he has rejected the government\u2019s contention that it was a campaign finance violation. Trump called it a\u00a0\u201csimple private transaction,\u201d not an illegal campaign contribution.", "During the 2016 campaign, Trump boasted that he was worth $10 billion. \u201cThe fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion. I have a great, great company. I employ thousands of people. And I\u2019m very proud of the job I did,\u201d he said during an August 2015 debate.", "But, as we wrote at the time, outside estimates attested to Trump\u2019s wealth, but placed the amount at between $3 billion and $4 billion.", "In his testimony, Cohen said Trump \u201cdirected us to inflate his net worth and inflate his assets,\u201d providing the committee with portions of\u00a0statements of financial condition for 2011 and 2013.", "\u201cIt was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed amongst the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes,\u201d he said.", "Trump got\u00a0five deferments\u00a0during the Vietnam War, including one for bone spurs in his heels. But in his opening statement, Cohen challenged the diagnosis of bone spurs \u2014 suggesting it was a ruse to avoid going to war.", "Cohen, Feb. 27: Mr. Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft. Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said that there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment. He finished the conversation with the following comment. \u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid, I\u2019m not going to Vietnam.\u201d", "We have no idea what Trump told Cohen and, even by Cohen\u2019s account, Trump did not directly say that the bone spur diagnosis was a fake. Cohen\u2019s comment does, however, corroborate the account of two daughters of the podiatrist who diagnosed Trump with bone spurs. In December, they told the\u00a0New York Times that their late father made the diagnosis as a courtesy to Trump\u2019s father, Fred.", "\u201cI know it was a favor,\u201d one daughter, Dr. Elysa Braunstein, told the paper. She and \u201cher sister, Sharon Kessel, 53, shared the family\u2019s account for the first time publicly when contacted by The New York Times,\u201d the paper wrote.", "In his response to Cohen\u2019s testimony, the president criticized his former lawyer for lying \u201cabout so many different things.\u201d But, he said, he was \u201cactually impressed\u201d that Cohen \u201csaid he saw no collusion\u201d between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or its agents during the 2016 campaign.", "\u201cI mean, he lied about so many different things, and I was actually impressed that he didn\u2019t say, \u2018Well, I think there was collusion for this reason or that.\u2019 He didn\u2019t say that. He said, \u2018No collusion,'\u201d the president said at a press conference in Vietnam, where he was meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \u201cAnd I was, you know, a little impressed by that, frankly.\u201d", "Cohen didn\u2019t exactly say there was \u201cno collusion,\u201d but he did say that he didn\u2019t have any evidence of it.", "In his opening remarks, Cohen said, \u201cQuestions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions.\u201d", "Later, asked by Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz if he was aware of any instances of Trump lying about colluding with the Russians, Cohen said\u00a0he couldn\u2019t answer the question \u2014 but again expressed his suspicions.", "\u201cI\u2019m not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not part of the campaign. I don\u2019t know the other conversations that Mr. Trump had with other individuals. There\u2019s just so many dots that all seem to lead to the same direction.\u201d", "The Trump campaign issued a statement in response to Cohen\u2019s testimony that relied heavily on the words of federal prosecutors who described Cohen as a liar. \u201cAs noted by the Southern District of New York, Cohen\u2019s wide array of crimes were \u2018marked by a pattern of deception that permeated his professional life\u2019 and his \u2018instinct to blame others is strong,'\u201d the statement said.", "That is true. Those partial quotes come from a sentencing memo filed in December. But it is also true that the sentencing statement said Cohen provided \u201ccredible\u201d information to the Southern District of New York.", "\u201cWith respect to Cohen\u2019s provision of information to this Office, in its two meetings with him, this Office assessed Cohen to be forthright and credible, and the information he provided was largely consistent with other evidence gathered,\u201d the memo stated.", "We can\u2019t say whether Cohen\u2019s version of events is correct in cases where it\u2019s his word against Trump\u2019s. In some instances, he provides evidence or his allegations are corroborated by other people or other evidence. But in other cases, Cohen provides no evidence at all. All we can do is lay out the facts and let others draw their own conclusions.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
