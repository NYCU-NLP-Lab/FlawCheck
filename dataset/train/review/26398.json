["By FactCheck.org", "Posted on February 24, 2020", "A viral meme falsely claims Sen. Bernie Sanders \u201csupported\u201d Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis and \u201caccused\u201d the hostages of \u201cbeing CIA spies.\u201d Sanders was affiliated with a political party that criticized U.S. policy on Iran, but there\u2019s no evidence he expressed those beliefs.", "A meme circulating on social media, getting thousands of shares, falsely states that Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was a Socialist Workers Party \u201cleader\u201d who opposed American policies during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis.", "The meme contains photos of Sanders, President Jimmy Carter, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the religious and political leader of Iran from 1979 to 1989. The accompanying text says: \u201cIn 1979 Iran took 70 Americans hostage for 444 days. Most America united, but one politician stood alone. Socialist Workers Party leader Bernie Sanders supported Ayatollah Khomeini against the US, condemned President Carter for imperialism, and accused the hostages of being CIA spies.\u201d", "The meme goes on to say, \u201cIs this what Democrat voters stand for? Bernie Sanders for President? Maybe in Iran. Not in the US.\u201d", "We could find no record of Sanders, currently the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential primary contest, taking such a stance regarding the hostage crisis.", "It has been widely reported over the years, including by the New York Times in 1990 and the Washington Post in 2015, that Sanders served as an elector for Socialist Workers Party presidential nominee Andrew Pulley in 1980, and has described himself as a \u201cdemocratic socialist.\u201d But Sanders was not a member \u2013 let alone a leader \u2013 of the Socialist Workers Party, according to 1981 news accounts cited by the myth-busting website Snopes for a story earlier this month.", "While he supported SWP candidates in the early 1980s, Sanders noted that he had some differences with the party.", "\u201cAlthough I am not in agreement with the SWP on all issues, I strongly support that party\u2019s attempt to become a nucleus for a national labor party which will fight for the interests of low income and working people,\u201d Sanders was quoted as saying in a\u00a0Rutland Daily Herald\u00a0story in July 1980.", "During the hostage crisis, the SWP did criticize the Carter administration, writing in its newspaper that the government\u2019s actions were \u201cdefying the wishes of the vast majority of the American people\u201d and \u201cdesperately trying to exploit the hostages to win popular support for U.S. military action.\u201d", "We could find no evidence, however, that Sanders agreed with that position. Nor is there evidence that Sanders supported the Ayatollah, accused President Carter of imperialism, or called the hostages CIA spies.", "The claims in the meme may have been prompted by an opinion column in the Daily Beast, which carried the headline \u201cWhen Iran Took Americans Hostage, Bernie Backed Iran\u2019s Defenders.\u201d The column noted that Sanders spoke in support of Pulley at an event in 1980 at which Pulley criticized Carter\u2019s handling of the hostage crisis and said many of the hostages were spies. But the column provided no evidence that Sanders ever expressed or held those views.", "Asked for comment on the meme, a spokesperson for Sanders\u2019 2020 campaign referred us to its statement for the Snopes story: \u201cSenator Sanders did not think the hostages were spies nor did he support their captivity. Any suggestion otherwise is nonsense.\u201d", "Misinformation about Iran and the United States arose in recent months following an escalation of tensions between the two countries. On Jan. 3, American troops used a drone to kill top Iranian intelligence commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Four days later, Iran fired missiles at Americans troops on U.S. bases in Iraq.", "Earlier this month, Sanders joined 54 other senators in approving a war powers resolution that would restrict the president\u2019s ability to engage in hostilities with Iran without congressional approval.", "By Corey M.
