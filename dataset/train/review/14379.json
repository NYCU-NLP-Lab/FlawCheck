Asked later to repeat himself, Martinez said in a voice-mail message: \"I think we\u2019ve had four Latinos in the designated \u2018gentlemen\u2019s agreement\u2019 seat\" on the council,\" plus, he said, another council member who says he was Latino, the late Robert Barnstone.", "\"That would be five total,\" Martinez said, adding he speculated at the event that up to five Hispanic residents could be elevated to the council all at once in the November elections.", "For the first time, voters are poised to fill 10 council seats from within geographic districts with the mayor\u2019s job filled, as before, by citywide balloting.", "And has Austin, which was incorporated in 1839, only had a few Hispanic council members?", "News organizations including the Austin American-Statesman have noted the \"gentlemen\u2019s agreement\" mentioned by Martinez as explaining why the seven-member council, elected citywide, has rarely had more than a black and an Hispanic member. Under the so-called agreement, certain seats on the council were seen among many as reserved for members of those minority groups to seek.", "The results: A \"Milestones\" web page created by the city says John Trevi\u00f1o was the first Hispanic citizen elected to the council; he won Place 5 on May 3, 1975.

We did it because there was a need in the (Mexican American) community.\"", "To our request for detail, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean guided us to the Austin History Center where researcher Jeff Carrillo pointed out city election results through history, posted online.
