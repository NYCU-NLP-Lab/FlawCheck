["A March 15 Facebook post questions federal travel requirements between Mexico and the United States.", "\"If Mexico requires a passport for entry from the US, why doesn't the US require a passport entry from Mexico?\" the meme states. The post has been shared over 600 times.", "The poster did not respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.", "Federal agencies in each country categorize entry requirements according to eligibility. Regardless, a valid passport is mandated for the\u00a0majority of travelers.", "A passport is required for travel across the U.S.-Mexico order \"in most cases,\" according to the U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Mexico.", "Mexican nationals must present a valid passport and visa to enter the United States by land or sea, per U.S. Customs and Border Protection.", "\"You still need something to prove your citizenship,\" Rhonda Lawson, public affairs specialist for the CBP, told USA TODAY. \"A person who goes to Mexico for whatever reason can travel on\u00a0their passport or an enhanced ID card or if they're part of a Trusted Traveler program, they can use their NEXUS card or SENTRI card.\" Other acceptable forms of documentation are listed on the CBPs website, Lawson said.", "NEXUS and SENTRI cards may be used for land or sea travel;\u00a0a\u00a0valid passport or NEXUS card\u00a0is required for air travel between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the State Department.", "The NEXUS card is available only to U.S. and Canadian citizens and permanent residents and Mexican nationals who meet certain conditions, per the CBP.", "Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection, or SENTRI, is a program feature of the Trusted Traveler program\u00a0for low risk U.S. citizens, permanent residents and foreign nationals\u00a0entering the U.S. on land, according to the CBP and the Department of Homeland Security.", "U.S. citizens traveling on maritime business may present a Merchant Mariner Document.", "Travelers entering Mexico by land with intent to travel outside the immediate border must have an entry permit, which requires a valid passport, according to the State Department.", "Border community residents who frequently travel between the U.S. and Mexico by car may also access a special passport card.

A Facebook post that claims the U.S. does not require a passport for entry from Mexico is inaccurate. A valid passport is required to enter either country in most cases. It is true there are special allowances for U.S. citizens living along the southern border, people traveling on maritime business and residents of either country who meet certain eligibility requirements to travel without a passport.\u00a0But proof of citizenship is required.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
