Tony Evers, a Democrat sworn in a mere three weeks earlier.", "\"We don\u2019t blame Foxconn for altering plans in an ever-changing technology business. It\u2019s also not surprising Foxconn would rethink building a manufacturing plant in Wisconsin under the Evers Administration,\" the statement read in part. \"The company is reacting to the wave of economic uncertainty that the new governor has brought with his administration. Governor Evers has an anti-jobs agenda and pledged to do away with a successful business incentive for manufacturing and agriculture.\"", "Is Foxconn really making changes in reaction to \"economic uncertainty\" created by the state\u2019s newly-minted governor?", "Let\u2019s review what we know.", "This was a fast-moving story, with different accounts of Foxconn\u2019s reported leanings coming from different sources across several days.", "But in the middle of that, Vos and Fitzgerald made a very specific and concrete claim: that Foxconn was reacting to uncertainty Evers caused.", "When we asked Vos and Fitzgerald to back up their claim, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer noted a series of changes in Evers\u2019 economic policy positions over time. But she said Republicans had no direct evidence connecting Foxconn\u2019s changes to Evers or any action by the new governor.", "\"The leaders believe that is the case,\" she said.", "Meanwhile, Foxconn hasn\u2019t explicitly laid out its current plans or the reasoning behind them \u2014 but several reports have pointed to market factors rather than political ones.", "Louis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn Chief Executive Terry Gou, voiced concern over the cost of making advanced TV screens in the U.S. due to labor expenses that exceed those in other countries, Reuters reported.", "The Nikkei story, citing unnamed sources, said plans are on hold due to the trade war between China and the U.S. and uncertainty over demand.

Walker could lose. These are all calculations corporations make.\"", "Nolette said slowing iPhone sales and the trade war are more likely factors in what exactly Foxconn builds and operates in Wisconsin.", "The statement by Vos and Fitzgerald expanded on the \"economic uncertainty\" claim by pointing to Evers\u2019 pledge to eliminate a business incentive.", "But studies show tax rates play a much lesser role in business investment decisions than market demand, supply networks, worker availability and transportation networks, said\u00a0Andrew Reschovsky, professor emeritus of public affairs and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin.", "What\u2019s more, there are contradictory aspects in Vos and Fitzgerald\u2019s own statement.", "Vos and Fitzgerald say they understand Foxconn changing its plans \"in an ever-changing technology business,\" but then blame Evers for causing changes.", "They say Foxconn is changing due to Evers, but then note Foxconn hasn\u2019t pulled back on its pledge to create 13,000 new jobs.", "\"You can see kind of a disconnect there,\" Nolette said. \"They\u2019re saying it\u2019s Evers\u2019 fault that the bad things are happening, but really things aren\u2019t that bad because the contract is still in place.\"", "Which brings us to an important point \u2014 the state has a signed contract in place with Foxconn.
