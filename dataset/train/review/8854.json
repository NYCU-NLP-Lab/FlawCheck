Mike Pence, a social conservative with a long history of taking anti-LGBT stands, as his running mate. Pence's 2000 Congressional campaign web site listed the following position statements under the heading \"Strengthening the American Family\":", "Congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal legal status with heterosexual marriage.", "Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a \"discreet and insular minority\" entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.", "In June 2015, The Journal Gazette reported that Pence had made a statement echoing Donald Trump's position that same-sex marriage is properly a \"state's rights issue\":", "Indiana Gov.
