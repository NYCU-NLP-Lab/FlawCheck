["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on April 23, 2020", "A viral post compares side-by-side screenshots from two news websites to falsely claim that using the same image of people at the beach during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of media deception. The location of the scene in Jacksonville, Florida, is identified accurately in each news report.", "Just over a month after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic, the White House issued guidance for states to start lifting business restrictions implemented to slow the spread of the disease.", "A day after that announcement, some beaches in Florida reopened on a limited basis. A picture of crowds on one such beach was used recently by two different news websites.", "The New York Post\u00a0used it to illustrate a\u00a0story about beaches opening on a limited basis near Jacksonville, Florida, which is where the photo was taken.", "The other site used it in a Facebook post that linked to a regularly updated blog about the pandemic, which, at the time, included an entry about beaches opening in Florida. That blog also included an entry on the COVID-19 death toll in Los Angeles, which provided the headline that showed up on Facebook underneath the picture. That juxtaposition could have confused readers, but anyone who clicked through on the link would have seen that the blog covered multiple issues.", "The site that posted the link on Facebook is called News Break, a news aggregating company. A spokesman for News Break, Greg Vederman, explained in a phone interview that the site\u2019s algorithm handles social media posts. In this case, it pulled a picture from the blog showing the beach in Florida and a headline about the death toll in Los Angeles.", "Side-by-side screenshots of the same photo being used under different headlines are now circulating in a viral social media post suggesting that they prove the media is deceitful. Above the two screenshots is text that says: \u201cThat\u2019s weird the exact same people who visited the beach in Florida are now at the beaches in California? Lol\u2026 awake yet?\u201d", "But there\u2019s nothing amiss in how the photo was used in either case.", "When it was used in the Post story, it illustrated the central topic. When it was used in News Break\u2019s Facebook post, it illustrated one of several topics addressed in the linked blog post. By simply clicking through on the link, readers could see that the blog featured an entry on the beaches in Florida as well as an entry on the death toll in one California city.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Facebook post. \u201cLos Angeles County records highest daily death toll.\u201d 18 Apr 2020.", "NBC News. \u201cSome states ease restrictions as protestors call for reopening economy \u2014 Here are the latest updates from around the globe.\u201d As of 18 Apr 2020.", "Vederman, Greg. Spokesman, News Break. Telephone interview with FactCheck.org. 23 Apr 2020.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
