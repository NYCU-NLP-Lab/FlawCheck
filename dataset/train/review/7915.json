Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, is leading a congressional investigation into the Russian intervention to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election.", "And he says this scandal isn\u2019t unique to Trump.", "\"This is not the first time they\u2019ve been involved in our elections,\" Burr said earlier this month.", "Burr is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which recently has hosted public, under-oath testimony of some of the Trump administration\u2019s top officials regarding Russian election meddling.", "Trump, for his part, has repeatedly called allegations of Russian meddling a fictional \"witch-hunt\" against him, and Russian President Vladimir Putin also denies any interference.", "Yet the U.S. intelligence community says the Russian government did try to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Independent observers agree, as do members of Congress including Burr.", "In a claim we fact-checked previously, Burr said his committee\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia has led to more transparency than usual. We rated that True.", "Now, we turn our attention to this claim that last year\u2019s meddling wasn\u2019t anything new.", "Here\u2019s the full context. A reporter asked Burr what his reaction was to Putin's denial of Russian election meddling. Burr responded:", "\"That there is no truth to Vladimir Putin\u2019s words. That by every judgment to this point, they were aggressively involved in the U.S. elections, Montenegro, France, they are involved in the German upcoming elections. And that this is not the first time they\u2019ve been involved in our elections, and that America needs to have a much more definitive response to them.\"", "Most of what Burr mentioned has been widely covered already. But not the last part. So we started digging.", "Close but no cigar", "Historians agree that what Burr said probably isn\u2019t literally true.", "This is the first time (at least as far as the public knows) that Russia attempted to influence a U.S. election in favor of a particular candidate.

Two said they had no idea what he was talking about. The others pointed to a handful of documented (yet relatively unknown) meddling efforts by Soviet leaders. None could identify any Russian meddling attempts.", "We also asked Burr what he meant. His office pointed us to an intelligence report, published in January, that concluded the Kremlin tried to help Trump and hurt his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.", "Spy games", "That report is \"a declassified version of a highly classified assessment\" made using CIA, FBI and NSA intelligence. It said the 2016 Russian meddling was the \"boldest yet\" in a U.S. election.", "It said with \"high confidence\" that Russia was behind the hack and publication of embarrassing emails from the Democratic National Committee, that it hacked into U.S. voting software, and that the Kremlin funded a large pro-Trump, anti-Clinton campaign in the United States using paid social media \"trolls\" as well as more traditional propaganda outlets.", "The report didn\u2019t completely back up Burr\u2019s claim. It said the Russians have spied on U.S. presidential candidates before, and have used state-owned propaganda outlets like RT and RT America to cast doubts on the\u00a0U.S. democratic process. But it listed no previous attempts to actually influence the outcome of an election.", "In fact, the report said the 2016 meddling\u00a0\"demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.\"", "And while this report made only vague references to Soviet meddling, our interviews uncovered a few instances of Cold War-era attempts to either boost one candidate or harm another.", "Over the course of 11 presidential elections between the end of World War II and the fall of the Soviet Union, we identified three secret attempts to influence an election.", "\u2022\u00a01960: Through his ambassador to the United States, Mikhail Menshikov, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev offered Adlai Stevenson help from a secret propaganda campaign.
