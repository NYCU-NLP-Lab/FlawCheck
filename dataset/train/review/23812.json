["When it comes to raising money from Wall Street, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joe Kyrillos recently offered a clear distinction between him and Democratic incumbent Robert Menendez.\n\nMenendez is the \"king\" of such donations, while Kyrillos has received nothing of the sort, he said.\n\n\"The guys in Washington \u2013 including my opponent, Senator Menendez \u2013 they govern by press release, and so, it\u2019s laughable to talk about the Wall Street thing, because he\u2019s the king of raising money from Wall Street, over a million dollars, one of the leaders in the United States Senate,\" Kyrillos, a state senator, said in a June 6 interview on NJToday. \"I haven\u2019t raised any Wall Street money at all.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Kyrillos needs to check his own campaign account.\n\nHe\u2019s right about Menendez being one of the leading recipients in the U.S. Senate of donations from the Securities & Investment industry, if not exactly the \"king.\" But Kyrillos is wrong to say he hasn\u2019t received any such donations, when records show he has collected nearly $60,000 for his current campaign.\n\nTo analyze Kyrillos\u2019 claim, we researched data available on OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan website tracking political donations. The website is managed by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe latest data on the Securities & Investment industry includes figures released by the Federal Election Commission on June 4 -- two days before Kyrillos\u2019 interview. The donations tallied on the website represent contributions of $200 or more from employees and political action committees within the industry.\n\nAccording to that data, Menendez has received nearly $1.4 million from the industry between 1989 and 2012. Menendez served as a congressman for 13 years before joining the Senate in 2006.\n\nThat amount puts Menendez in 15th place among the nation\u2019s 100 Senators for such donations, according to data on OpenSecrets.org. The 14 Senators with greater donations than Menendez include six Democrats, seven Republicans and one Independent.\n\nThe leading recipient is former presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), who has received about $11.2 million from the Securities & Investment industry.\n\nIn a statement, Menendez\u2019s campaign manager, Michael Soliman, pointed to the senator\u2019s \"long-standing record of championing common sense reforms that have sided with consumers over banks.\"\n\n\"This silly partisan gotcha attack is absurd - by Joe Kyrlllos\u2019s own standard John McCain, Mark Kirk, Scott Brown and Mitch McConnell - four Republican senator's - are the real Kings of Raising Money from Wall Street,\" Soliman added, referring to other senators who have raised more money from the industry than Menendez.\n\nAs for Kyrillos, he has received his share of such donations as well.\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, Kyrillos has received nearly $60,000 from the Securities & Investment industry for his current campaign.\n\nChapin Fay, Kyrillos\u2019 campaign manager, responded to our findings in a statement: \"You seem to be on a search to find anyway to find our statements not accurate and are missing the main point Senator Kyrillos made\u2014Bob Menendez was cited as a top recipient of Wall Street money and Joe Kyrillos was not.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAs the battle heats up for a U.S. Senate seat, Kyrillos claimed Menendez is \"the king of raising money from Wall Street, over a million dollars, one of the leaders in the United States Senate. I haven\u2019t raised any Wall Street money at all.\"\n\nData on OpenSecrets.org shows that Menendez has received nearly $1.4 million from the Securities & Investment industry, putting him in 15th place among sitting Senators for such donations. That ranking means Menendez is one of the leading recipients, but it\u2019s an exaggeration to call him \"the king of raising money from Wall Street.\"\n\nAlso, Kyrillos is wrong about his own fundraising, because he\u2019s received nearly $60,000 from the industry for his current campaign, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "NJToday, Kyrillos Says He Will Beat Menendez in November, June 6, 2012\n\nThe Star-Ledger, Sen.
