["By Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on June 21, 2018", "During the ongoing family-separation controversy, President Donald Trump and others have made false or misleading statements on several immigration issues:", "In adopting a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d for those crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, Trump is choosing to detain and criminally prosecute border crossers, rather than releasing them pending an immigration hearing \u2014\u00a0as the Obama administration did and his own administration had been doing.", "Trump explained his opposition to a so-called \u201ccatch and release\u201d policy in recent remarks to a small business group, saying, \u201cwhen we release the people they never come back to the judge.\u201d", "He told the National Federation of Independent Businesses that\u00a0only \u201clike 3 percent\u201d of people released pending their immigration hearings show up in court.", "Some Republican senators \u2014 led by\u00a0Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina \u2014 have proposed legislation to increase the number of immigration judges in an attempt to alleviate the backlog and expedite the immigration hearings.", "But the president has rejected that idea, too. \u201cWe don\u2019t want judges,\u201d he told the business group.", "Trump, June 19:\u00a0We don\u2019t want judges; we want security on the border. We don\u2019t want people coming in. We want them to come in through a legal process like everybody else that\u2019s waiting to come into our country.", "And it got so crazy that all of these thousands \u2014 we now have thousands of judges \u2014 border judges \u2014 thousands and thousands. And, by the way, when we release the people they never come back to the judge anyway. They\u2019re gone. \u2026", "Do you know, if a person comes in and puts one foot on our ground, it\u2019s essentially \u201cwelcome to America, welcome to our country.\u201d You never get them out, because they take their name, they bring the name down, they file it, then they let the person go; they say show back up to court in one year from now. One year. But here\u2019s the thing: That in itself is ridiculous. Like 3 percent come back.", "Trump gets two things wrong, but we will start with the easy one: The U.S. does not have \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of \u201cborder judges.\u201d", "The U.S. has \u201capproximately 350 immigration judges,\u201d according to the Department of Justice.", "Graham\u2019s bill, which has seven Republican co-sponsors, would authorize an additional 225 judges and \u201cprioritize resolving the cases of children and families in family residential centers.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s other claim \u2014 \u201cwhen we release the people they never come back to the judge\u201d \u2014 is also false. Trump said only \u201clike 3 percent\u201d show up for court, but we could find no evidence that the percentage is that low. Neither the White House nor the Department of Justice responded to our request for the supporting data.", "The Justice Department\u2019s FY2016 Statistics Yearbook reports that 25 percent of immigration cases were decided \u201cin absentia\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201cwhen an alien fails to appear.\u201d (See figure 23.) The report does not differentiate between those captured at the border for illegal crossing and those arrested in the interior of the country for other offenses.", "We asked the Department of Justice for clarification and the most recent data. We did not get a response, but we will update this article if we do.", "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen\u00a0Nielsen claimed that in the past five months, there had been a \u201c314 percent increase\u201d in adults trafficking children to the border, \u201cfraudulently claiming to be a family unit.\u201d That sounds like a big increase, but not when such cases are placed in context.", "The raw numbers behind the increase \u2014 which the Washington Post reported and DHS confirmed to us \u2014 are 46 suspected fraudulent cases in fiscal year 2017 and 191 suspected cases for the first five months of fiscal year 2018 \u2014 that\u2019s October 2017 through February 2018. That\u2019s a 315 percent increase.", "Those figures are a tiny fraction of the total number of family apprehensions at the border. There were 75,622 family unit apprehensions in fiscal year 2017 at the Southwest border, so the 46 suspected cases of fraud were just 0.06 percent of all family apprehensions.", "For the first five months of fiscal year 2018, there were 31,102 family unit apprehensions. The 191 suspected fraud cases would be 0.61 percent of that. The Post attempted to show how small of a percentage that is in a bar chart. It\u2019s a nearly imperceptible sliver.", "President Donald Trump has described the situation as \u201ca massive child smuggling trade.\u201d He\u00a0claimed in a speech to a business group on June 19 that child smuggling is \u201cthe worst it\u2019s ever been.\u201d", "We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s \u201cthe worst it\u2019s ever been,\u201d because we don\u2019t have statistics for previous years. DHS has not provided any numbers on suspected child smuggling or fraud cases beyond the current and previous fiscal year.", "We will update this article if we are able to obtain such numbers.", "Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin blamed the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for hundreds of thousands of families and unaccompanied minors from Central America coming to the U.S. illegally since 2012.", "Johnson, June 20: But here\u2019s what\u2019s happened since 2012, since DACA. Just to talk about unaccompanied children: Prior to that, somewhere between 3,000 or 4,000 unaccompanied children from Central America came into this country. Then DACA was instituted in 2012, and that problem skyrocketed. The numbers on it \u2014 about 225,000 unaccompanied children, just from Central America; about almost half a million family members. So we\u2019ve got another 750,000 individuals \u2014 very sympathetic \u2014 that we\u2019re just incentivizing for coming. And we have to stop those incentives.", "Johnson\u2019s office told us that he was relying on Department of Homeland Security figures for apprehensions of unaccompanied minors and families who came from the \u201cNorthern Triangle\u201d of Central America, which includes El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.", "The data provided \u2014 which we weren\u2019t able to find online \u2014 show that from July 2012, when DACA went into effect, to May 2018, there were 303,722 apprehensions of family units and 207,187 apprehensions of UACs from that region.", "Family units include at least two people, Johnson\u2019s office said, so that\u2019s how he figures there were at least \u201chalf a million family members.\u201d", "But none of those children would be eligible for DACA. The program was open to those who could prove they had been living in the U.S. continuously since June 15, 2007. Applicants had to be at least 15 years old but no more than 31 years old as of June 15, 2012. Eligibility also required proving they were not yet 16 when they arrived in the U.S.", "Johnson\u2019s office told us that the senator recognizes that DACA doesn\u2019t apply to those who came to the U.S. after the program started, but he believes \u201ccoyotes\u201d used that information to convince people to pay them to be smuggled into the country.", "It\u2019s possible that some who later came to the U.S. had been misinformed about the DACA program, but several government reports cited other reasons for the surge, primarily violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras", "A 2014 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said that, in 2013, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees surveyed 404 unaccompanied minors who illegally crossed into the U.S. after fiscal year 2012. That survey found that 48 percent of the apprehended children \u201csaid they had experienced serious harm or had been threatened by organized criminal groups or state actors, and more than 20 percent had been subject to domestic abuse.\u201d", "\u201cIt is not known if, and how, specific immigration policies may have influenced decisions to try to enter the United States unlawfully,\u201d the CRS report said.", "The Government Accountability Office issued a 2015 report that said federal officials \u201cmost commonly identified crime and violence and economic concerns as causes primarily responsible for the recent rapid increase\u201d in unaccompanied minors entering the U.S. illegally. GAO said it interviewed nine federal officials stationed in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras for the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security and USAID.", "According to the report, five of those officials told GAO that misinformation about U.S. immigration policies spread by smugglers were \u201ca primary cause.\u201d For example, two officials stationed in Honduras said Hondurans believed that a failed congressional attempt to pass comprehensive immigration legislation would have provided a path to citizenship, and that they\u2019d be reunited with family members and allowed to stay in the U.S.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
