["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "During his recent election announcement for governor of Missouri, Mike Parson trumpeted a strong economy in the state, taking particular care to highlight increases in small-business wages.", "\"With record lows in unemployment, more people are going back to work in Missouri,\" Parson said Sept. 8. \"Wages are on the rise \u2014 in fact we were the top small-business wage growth state in the nation.\"", "Does the governor\u2019s comment check out? We wanted to investigate.", "A spokesperson for Parson\u2019s campaign cited an April 2019 article from St. Louis Business Journal that used numbers from an April 2019 report from Paychex/IHS Market Small Business Employment Watch to show Missouri ranked first in the country in hourly wage growth for small businesses.", "At $25.55 per hour, Missouri small business wages were up 3.48%, or 86 cents, that month. The Show-Me State finished first ahead of California, New York, Arizona and Illinois in small-business wage growth.", "According to the Small Business Employment Watch\u2019s September report, Missouri now ranks third in the country in hourly wage growth increase at 3.38% (New York is second at 3.53% and Illinois is first at 4.11%). If assessing for weekly wage growth rise, Missouri is second at 3.83%. Illinois comes in at 3.84%, just .01% better than Missouri.", "Overall, Missouri has been a top-five small business wage growth state (by weekly earnings) every month this year, according to Paychex\u2019s analysis.", "So what is Paychex, and how does it calculate its data for the Small Business Employment Watch? Paychex is a human resources and payroll company with over 600,000 clients nationwide. According to a media spokesperson for the company, it \"uses up-to-date, aggregated payroll data from approximately 350,000 of Paychex's small business clients with fewer than 50 workers\" to keep its data current.", "All businesses whose wage data is included in the report must have run payroll for the month that the data is being compiled and the three months prior. According to a Paychex spokesperson, the sample includes millions of small-business workers.", "How many small-business workers are there in Missouri and in the United States? It depends what you consider a small business.", "Paychex defines a small business as a firm with fewer than 50 workers, but the U.S. Small Business Administration defines small businesses as firms with less than 500 workers. According to the SBA\u2019s 2019 profile for the state of Missouri, there are 1.2 million small business employees in the state of Missouri alone, and 58.9 million in the country.", "In other words, while Paychex represents a significant portion of small businesses, it\u2019s not the whole pie. The company itself claims to work with one in 12 private sector employees.", "Parson said, \"Wages are on the rise \u2014 in fact we were the top small business wage growth state in the nation.\"", "This statement is backed by statistics from Paychex that showed it to be true for the month of April, although Missouri fell behind in later months.", "Since it can\u2019t be proven that Paychex takes a representative sample, and it\u2019s the only indicator Parson cites, we rate this comment as Mostly True.", "Email exchange with Rich Crismer, spokesman for Parson campaign, Sept. 17, 2019.", "April 2019 wage growth report, accessed Sept. 11, 2019.", "Email exchange with Lisa Fleming, Manager of Public Relations at Paychex, Sept. 20, 2019.", "Paychex release archives, accessed Sept. 25, 2019.", "St. Louis Business Journal article,\u00a0accessed Sept. 17., 2019.", "Paychex FAQ page, accessed Sept. 28, 2019.", "U.S. Small Business Administration Economic Profile, accessed Oct. 2, 2019.", "U.S. Small Business Administration Economic Profile for State of Missouri,\u00a0accessed Oct. 2, 2019.", "Federal Reserve of St. Louis private sector employee data\u00a0for Sept. 2019, accessed Oct. 2, 2019.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
