["About this rating", "On 13 February\u00a02016, the web site Newslo published an article\u00a0claiming that Alabama congressman\u00a0Robert Aderholt proposed the introduction of \"hunger tests\" before food stamps were issued to potential recipients:", "A top Republican wants the federal government to spend half a billion dollars so states can make people on food stamps pass drug tests. Legislation Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.) proposes would cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program spending by $1.2 billion, then plow $600 million into grants for states to carry out drug testing programs. Federal law doesn\u2019t currently allow states to drug test food stamp recipients, an obstacle that has prevented Republicans in Georgia, Wisconsin and elsewhere from carrying out the policy. Aderholt\u2019s bill would allow drug tests, but not require them.", "...\u00a0in addition to allowing states to wilfully administer drug tests to food stamp recipients, the controversial bill would also require potential recipients to be tested for actual hunger every time prior to being issued food stamps.", "\u201cLook at what\u2019s going on right now,\u201d the Alabama Rep. said. \u201cThe United States budget is hemorrhaging money because of drug addicts who are misusing food stamps to purchase narcotics, but what many people don\u2019t realize is the fact that they are only part of the problem. There are many other so-called \u2018legitimately poor people\u2019 who are also receiving food stamps, but are using them to buy things like hot-tubs, motorbikes, finance pool parties and getting their hands on the latest iPhone or MacBook\u00a0...\u00a0That\u2019s why, as a way of making sure food stamps actually go to hungry people, I propose we introduce hunger tests prior to issuing the stamps to every potential beneficiary. The logistics of it are still in the works, but from what I can gather, we\u2019d be using a benign chemical that would be able to tell whether or not a person is experiencing hunger from their saliva. The chemical would be located on the stamps themselves, and upon licking the stamp, as you would a simple stamp at a post office, we would know straight away if a person is trying to trick us or if they really deserve food.", "While it's true that Rep. Aderholt introduced a bill on 11 February 2016 in support of requisite drug testing for food stamp recipients, all but the first paragraph quoted above was embellished\u00a0(as\u00a0Newslo\u00a0itself indicated).
