But going after the undocumented is not a crime strategy, when you look at the fact that the National Academy of Sciences in, I think it was November of 2015, the undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born.

It found: \"Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates.\" The study added that \"This disparity also holds for young men most likely to be undocumented immigrants: Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan men.\"", "It continued: \"Today, the belief that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes is perpetuated by \u2018issue entrepreneurs\u2019 who promote the immigrant-crime connection in order to drive restrictionist immigration policy.\"", "The academy is a nonprofit research organization charged with providing independent advice to the nation. It is funded largely by the federal government.", "Findings in a\u00a0March 2017 study by the libertarian Cato Institute also support\u00a0Villaraigosa's statement:", "\"Illegal immigrants are 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives.

It also found groups that challenged those studies or said more research is needed.", "PolitiFact\u2019s findings", "PolitiFact pointed to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census\u2019 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population.", "Looking at California prisons, immigrants are also underrepresented.
