Such emergency declarations bolster state or local \u201cefforts in providing emergency services, such as the protection of lives, property, public health, and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States,\u201d the Federal Emergency Management Agency notes.", "The federal government\u2019s response included\u00a0measures such as distributing water and providing water filters and water sampling. The emergency declaration\u00a0ended in August 2016.", "According to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, \u201c[s]ince July 2016, the city of Flint\u2019s water system has tested below action levels of the federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR).\u201d\u00a0In early 2018, the state declared the\u00a0water quality \u201crestored\u201d after repeated tests showed that 90 percent of samples from \u201chigher risk\u201d locations were below half the federal threshold of 15 parts per billion (ppb) for the\u00a0Lead and Copper Rule.", "Obama also\u00a0signed\u00a0the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act in December 2016. The act\u00a0provided $170 million for communities grappling with drinking water emergencies and Flint was specifically mentioned as an intended recipient.\u00a0The Environmental Protection Agency officially awarded Flint $100 million of the WIIN-authorized funding in March 2017, then under the Trump administration, to help fund water infrastructure replacements and upgrades.", "That\u2019s not to say the federal government\u2019s response was without criticism. The EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General, for example, said in a 2018 report that the agency\u2019s response was \u201cdelayed,\u00a0in part, because the EPA did not establish clear roles and responsibilities, risk assessment procedures, effective communication and proactive oversight tools.\u201d It cited \u201cimplementation and oversight lapses\u201d at the local, state and federal levels.", "Work remains ongoing to replace lead and galvanized steel pipes throughout Flint, and\u00a0distribution\u00a0of donated bottled water has continued in the meantime. Even so,\u00a0to say\u00a0\u201cObama declared Flint water crisis a National Emergency and never fixed it\u201d is misleading in several respects.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cThe Disaster Declaration Process.\u201d Federal Emergency Management Agency. 8 Jan 2018.", "\u201cEPA Awards $100 Million to Michigan for Flint Water Infrastructure Upgrades.\u201d Press release, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 17 Mar 2017.", "\u201cFederal Response by the Numbers \u2013 Flint, Michigan.\u201d Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
