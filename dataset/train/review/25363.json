A paralegal was killed, and dozens injured after a car rammed into demonstrators.", "Biden in the video condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's comments after the violence; Trump had said there were \"very fine people on both sides.\" Biden also rejected what he called Trump's moral equivalency between the white supremacists who \"spread hate\" and the protesters who stood against it, saying:", "[In Charlottesville] in August of 2017 we saw Klansmen and white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out in the open, their crazed faces illuminated by torches, veins bulging, and baring the fangs of racism. Chanting the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the 30s. And they were met by a courageous group of Americans, and a violent clash ensued, and a brave young woman lost her life.", "In other words, the graphic featuring Biden is a misquote. While antifa was part of the counter-protests in Charlottesville, Biden did not mention the group by name.
