["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "After the Mexican government spoke out against Georgia\u2019s tough new immigration law, state Attorney General Sam Olens accused it of hypocrisy.\n\nMexico joined with Guatemala and other Latin American countries to argue in federal court that Georgia\u2019s law interferes with international relations. What\u2019s worse, they said, it puts their citizens at risk of harassment by U.S. law enforcement.\n\nNot so fast, Olens said in a radio story aired June 28. \u00a0Mexico has little right to complain in light of its own immigration laws.\n\n\"If you're from Guatemala and you are found illegally in Mexico, you are automatically jailed,\" Olens told AM 750 and 95.5 FM News/Talk WSB. \"But here we have both Guatemala and Mexico complaining that we have laws to discourage illegal immigrants in our country.\"\n\nIllegal Guatemalans are \"automatically jailed\" if they\u2019re discovered in Mexico? Sounds harsh for a nation that\u2019s complaining about Georgia\u2019s law. We decided to check this out.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s House Bill 87 aims to crack down on illegal immigration in this state.\n\nOne of its more controversial provisions would give police the authority to investigate the immigration status of people who they believe have committed crimes and who cannot produce identification. Another would punish people who, while committing another offense, knowingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants or encourage them to come here.\n\nLast month, a U.S. district judge temporarily stopped these provisions from going into effect.\n\nWe contacted Olens spokeswoman Lauren Kane, who said that Olens\u2019 claim was incorrect and he will not repeat it in the future. She said in an email that he was unaware Mexico had changed its immigration law a few years ago.\n\nThen, violating Mexico immigration law was a criminal offense. Now it isn\u2019t. \u00a0\n\nMexico has tried to improve conditions for migrants, although human rights advocates say these efforts aren\u2019t enough. In 2008, reforms decriminalized immigration violations, said Andrew Selee, who directs the Mexico Institute, a research and policy center at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C.\n\nMerely being present in Mexico without papers is a civil violation, not a criminal one, experts told us.\n\nViolators are not arrested or put in jail, which is designated for criminals or those suspected of crimes. They are sent to detention facilities and undergo a separate administrative process.\n\nIllegal migrants may, if they choose, be deported within 48 hours and avoid a criminal record. If they contest their deportation, their stay in detention is much longer.\n\nLegislation signed in May by Mexican President Felipe Calderon aims to improve conditions further, said Amnesty International researcher Rupert Knox, who is an expert on Mexico. \u00a0\n\nThe new legislation reaffirms that people who cross the border into Mexico without papers are guilty of a civil offense, not a criminal one, according to Knox and news reports. It emphasizes they have a right to health care and education.\n\nIt also draws tighter restrictions on who can detain illegal migrants. Before the May legislation, Mexican police could detain an illegal migrant and hand him over to national immigration authorities for deportation. Now, only those detected by national immigration authorities can be sent for deportation.\n\nMexican police are not allowed to stop people on the suspicion that they are in the country illegally, Knox said.\n\nIn sum, Guatemalans found illegally in Mexico are not \"automatically jailed,\" as Olens said.\n\nSince immigration violations are not criminal offenses, irregular migrants who are discovered are sent to a noncriminal detention facility, not jail. Their cases are not handled by the criminal courts, but by a separate administrative system.\n\nAlso, if a Mexican police officer detects an illegal migrant, he cannot detain him for deportation. Only immigration authorities can do that.\n\nAs Olens\u2019 spokeswoman acknowledged, he\u2019s wrong.\n\nOlens earns a False.", "AM 750 and 95.5 FM News/Talk WSB, \"Six Illegal Immigrants Arrested at Atlanta Rally,\" June 28, 2011\n\nLos Angeles Times, \"Mexico law aims to reduce risks to migrants passing through,\" \u00a0May 28, 2011\n\nAmnesty International, \"Invisible Victims: Migrants on the Move in Mexico,\" April 28, 2010\n\nAFP, \"Mexico lawmakers vote to protect undocumented migrants,\" April 29, 2011\n\nAssociated Press, \"Mexican Congress approves end to criminal penalties for undocumented migrants,\" April 30, 2008", "USA Today, \"Activists blast Mexico\u2019s immigration law,\" May 25, 2010\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"Immigration law takes effect today,\" July 1, 2011,\n\nGeorgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, et al. v.
