["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on July 26, 2017", "In announcing he would ban transgender people from the military, President Donald Trump cited \u201cthe tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\u201d Whether the cost is \u201ctremendous\u201d is opinion, but a government-funded report found that allowing transgender people to openly serve in the military would likely have a \u201cmarginal impact\u201d on health care costs and military readiness.", "The report, released last year by the RAND Corp.,\u00a0estimated the additional cost at \u201cbetween $2.4 million and $8.4 million annually, representing a 0.04- to 0.13-percent increase in active-component health care expenditures.\u201d\u00a0It also found that \u201cless than 0.1 percent of the total force would seek transition-related care that could disrupt their ability to deploy.\u201d", "The RAND report was commissioned by the Defense Department after then-Secretary Ash Carter announced in July 2015 that the military would study \u201cthe policy and readiness implications of welcoming transgender persons to serve openly.\u201d", "Nearly a year later, Carter\u00a0announced\u00a0a new policy that immediately allowed\u00a0transgender service members \u201cto openly serve in the U.S. armed forces\u201d without fear of discharge. The policy also set a date of July 1, 2017, for allowing transgender individuals to join the armed forces. The delay was designed to develop training plans, revise regulations and forms, and implement guidance.", "On June 30, the Defense Department under Trump\u00a0delayed the start date for accepting transgender service members until Jan. 1, 2018. In a June 30 memo obtained by the Associated Press, Defense Secretary James Mattis told service chiefs and secretaries that he would \u201cuse this additional time to evaluate more carefully the impact of such accessions on readiness and lethality.\u201d", "Associated Press, July 1:\u00a0Mattis said the review by the services must be completed by Dec. 1, and he noted that his approval of a delay \u201cdoes not presuppose the outcome of the review.\u201d He said the additional time will ensure he has \u201cthe benefit of the views of the military leadership and of the senior civilian officials who are now arriving in the department.\u201d", "However, in a series of tweets, Trump abruptly announced the policy change before the end of the six-month review period.", "After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow\u2026\u2026", "\u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017", "Let\u2019s look at what we know about the number of transgender individuals currently serving in the military and their potential impact on health care costs and military readiness.", "In making his announcement that the military would accept transgender service members, Carter said\u00a0that \u201cthere isn\u2019t definitive data on the number of transgender service members.\u201d But he cited RAND\u2019s study of existing estimates \u201cand their best estimate was that about 2,500 people out of approximately 1.3 million active-duty service members, and about 1,500 out of 825,000 reserve service members are transgender.\u201d Those were mid-range estimates with the upper end of the ranges being 6,630 for active duty and 4,160 for the reserves.", "So we are talking about a small subset of active and reserve service members.\u00a0The number of service members that would seek gender transition\u2013related medical treatment is even smaller.", "Private health insurance data show that \u201c0.022 to 0.0396 annual claimants per 1,000 individuals\u201d seek transition-related health care each year. Based on that, RAND estimated that anywhere from 29 to 129 active-duty service members would seek such medical treatment each year among the force of 1.3 million members.", "Although Trump described the cost as \u201ctremendous,\u201d RAND estimated that providing transition-related health care would increase the military\u2019s health care costs for active-duty members \u201cby between $2.4 million and $8.4 million annually.\u201d That represents an increase of no more than 0.13 percent of the $6.27 billion spent on the health of active-duty members in fiscal 2014.", "As for military readiness, the RAND report said: \u201cSimilarly, when assessing the readiness impact of a policy change, we found that less than 0.0015 percent of the total available labor-years would be affected, based on estimated gender transition\u2013related health care utilization rates.\u00a0This is because even at upper-bound estimates, less than 0.1 percent of the total force would seek transition-related care that could disrupt their ability to deploy.\u201d", "The report\u00a0was less definitive regarding the impact of transgender individuals on \u201cunit cohesion.\u201d RAND said its review of data from the civilian population, foreign militaries, and previous integration experiences of gays, lesbians and women \u201csuggest a minimal impact on unit cohesion.\u201d But it acknowledged that its conclusion \u201cmay not hold for transgender service members.\u201d", "Update, July 28: In a July 27 memo, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, notified commanders in the various branches of the armed forces that the Pentagon would not change its policy on transgender service members until the White House provides formal guidance, according to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cIn the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,\u201d Dunford said in his memo. Defense Department spokeswoman Dana W. White reiterated that message in a separate statement\u00a0issued the same day that said the department will ensure \u201call service members are treated with respect.\u201d", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
