["California's\u00a0annual wildfires bring not only death\u00a0and destruction, they are stirring controversy over the federal government's response to the financial needs of the state.", "A Facebook user has circulated a post charging\u00a0that President Donald Trump has helped Russia with its fires, but not California.", "The Sept. 17\u00a0post says, \"Trump says No Aid for CA fires. But in July he offered to help Putin with fires in Russia.\" It has over 6,900 shares in its first 24 hours.\u00a0The Facebook user who posted the item did not immediately respond to requests\u00a0for comment.", "The claim\u00a0stems from a\u00a0number of tweets and public statements by the president,\u00a0in which he threatened to withhold financial help, accusing California of mismanagement of its forests.", "For at least two years,\u00a0the president has\u00a0criticized\u00a0California's handling of the fires, particularly over what he says is inadequate management of its forests.", "In November\u00a02018: \"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,\" Trump tweeted. \"Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\"", "On\u00a0Jan.9, 2019:\u00a0\"Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!\"", "On Nov.\u00a03, 2019, he revisited the theme\u00a0in a series of tweets: \"The Governor of California, @GavinNewsom, has done a terrible job of forest management. I told him from the first day we met that he must \u201cclean\u201d his forest floors regardless of what his bosses, the environmentalists, DEMAND of him. Must also do burns and cut fire stoppers.......Every year, as the fire\u2019s rage & California burns, it is the same thing-and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor. You don\u2019t see close to the level of burn in other states...But our teams are working well together in.........putting these massive, and many, fires out. Great firefighters! Also, open up the ridiculously closed water lanes coming down from the North. Don\u2019t pour it out into the Pacific Ocean. Should be done immediately. California desperately needs water, and you can have it now!\"", "In August, at a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump\u00a0threatened to\u00a0withhold fire aid to the Golden State, Politico reported.", "\"I see again the forest fires are starting,\" he said. \"They\u2019re starting again in California,\" he said. \"I said, you gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests \u2014 there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they\u2019re like, like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up.\"", "More:In California: Trump visits NorCal amid fires", "He added: \"Maybe we\u2019re just going to have to make them pay for it because they don\u2019t listen to us.\u201d", "According to the University of California Cooperative Extension, federal agencies, like\u00a0the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, own and manage 19 million acres, or 57% of the forests in California.\u00a0About 40% is owned by families, Native American tribes, or companies. And\u00a0state and local agencies \u2014 from Cal Fire to land trusts, plus\u00a0open space, park and water districts \u2014 own about\u00a03%.", "Regarding fire\u00a0aid for Russia, the Kremlin first raised the issue in a statement on July 31, 2019, as wildfires ravaged Siberia:", "\u201cVladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with US President Donald Trump this evening at the American side\u2019s initiative. The US President offered help in putting out wildfires in Siberia. ... The President of Russia expressed sincere gratitude for the kind attention and the offer of help and assistance. Vladimir Putin said he will accept the offer if it becomes necessary.", "\u201cThe President of Russia regards the US President\u2019s offer as a sign that it is possible that full-scale bilateral relations will be restored in the future,\" the Kremlin statement continued.", "Initially, the White House was coy on whether any aid was offered, according to CBS News, acknowledging\u00a0that\u00a0a discussion between the two leaders about wildfires had taken place\u00a0but not stating\u00a0directly that assistance\u00a0had been offered.\u00a0According to the White House, Trump \"expressed concern over the vast wildfires afflicting Siberia\" and the leaders \"discussed trade between the two countries,\" CBS reported.", "Trump, however, confirmed the offer of help when asked by reporters\u00a0at a brief\u00a0Aug. 1, 2019, news conference, Voice of America reported.", "\u201cMostly we discussed the forest fires in Siberia, and other parts of Russia,\" the president said. \"And I said, look, we have the greatest equipment, if we could help you let us know. Large sections are burning, and so I said to President Putin, if we can help you, let me know.\u201d", "Despite the offers, there is no evidence that any aid was ever sent.", "As for California, although Trump\u00a0threatened to withhold aid, the White House announced on Aug. 22\u00a0that the president \"declared that a major disaster exists in the State of California and ordered Federal aid to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by wildfires.\"", "Likewise, Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Aug. 22 that the White House \"has approved California\u2019s request for a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration to bolster the state\u2019s emergency response to wildfires burning in Northern California and support impacted residents in Lake, Napa, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Solano, Sonoma and Yolo counties.\"", "\u201cThank you to the President for your partnership and granting this urgent Major Disaster Declaration,\" Newsom added. \"California is battling two of the largest fires in our history and has seen nearly 600 new fires in the last week caused by dry lightning strikes. These are unprecedented times and conditions, but California is strong \u2013 we will get through this,\u201d said Governor Newsom.", "California Public Radio declared the Facebook post as false.", "Our research shows that while the president threatened on numerous occasions to withhold aid to fire-ravaged California, the White House nonetheless offered such aid. We also found that the president offered to help Russia with its wildfires, although there is no evidence any\u00a0help was ever given.
