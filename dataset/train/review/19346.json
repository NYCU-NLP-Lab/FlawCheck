Ilhan Omar of Minnesota \u2014 one of the\u00a0first two Muslim women\u00a0elected\u00a0to Congress in 2018 \u2014 has been a popular target for misinformation.

Instead, those pages shared the story along with statements such as, \u201cNo thanks.\u201d And readers of those pages have responded with anti-Islamic comments such as: \u201cThrow her in a pig pen!\u201d and \u201cWould much rather have a nationwide ban on Muslims, particularly her!\u201d", "The Quran states that it is \u201cforbidden\u201d to eat \u201cthe flesh of swine,\u201d which is considered \u201cimpure,\u201d as explained on the website IslamFaith.", "\u201cGod is protecting our health because the pig is an unclean animal.
