Not only does she get to attack him on a whole host of issues where he agrees with her, but\u2026 he's described Hillary Clinton as... one of the best secretaries of state in history.\"", "Cruz leveled a similar claim during the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican presidential debate in Houston, saying: \"And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times\u2026?\"", "We wondered. Did Trump truly rate Clinton\u2019s performance as secretary of state among the best ever?", "In response to our request for backup, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed us a link to a Jan. 17, 2016, web post by The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, presenting video of Trump saying on camera: \"And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else.\" A portion of the same video earlier appeared in a January 2016 Cruz campaign video suggesting tight ties between Trump and Clinton.", "Web searches led us to the Trump clip, posted by someone on LiveLeak.com, a British video-sharing site, Dec. 8, 2015.

Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else.\" That\u2019s not explicitly best-in-history, but could be bandied in that way.", "Then again, it occurred to us, that comment could be taken as having a different scope; that is, Trump saying only that anyone appraising Clinton would focus on her record as secretary of state. (We encourage \u00a0you to watch for yourself.) Consider this change of punctuation: \"And how did she do as secretary of state, probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else.\" Note too that Trump said next: \"You\u2019ll be looking at her record and everybody else is, will be looking at her record,\" a point he made several times in the interview.", "Trump praised Clinton in 2012-13", "Web searches led us to other instances of Trump making positive comments about Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state, which ran from the start of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency in 2009 through January 2013.", "From a Trump-Greta Van Susteren exchange on the March 28, 2012 episode of \"On the Record,\" a Fox News program:", "VAN SUSTEREN: \"Looking at the administration, how do you think the vice president has done?
