A mosque, the holy house of God, is being degraded by infidels the enemy of God in Norway. For those of you who are not aware. Apparently the government of Norway has started to burn the Koran. A mosque imam was standing outside the mosque offering free Korans to anyone who needs it. And when the imam was reading the Koran, police officers entered the mosque with their shoes on and a dog. He asked them to remove their shoes and take the dog out of the mosque to protect the house of God. The police and the dog attacked and hit him.", "\u201cThe person who speaks in the video asks for the video to be shared and to make the incident known by the world. God is great.\u00a0Oh God, help those who help your religion and exterminate those who want to exterminate your religion and Muslims! Amen.\u201d", "The same video was\u00a0also shared with a similar claim\u00a0here\u00a0and here on Facebook; here on Twitter and\u00a0here on YouTube, where it has been viewed almost 800 times.", "The video was\u00a0also shared in Arabic language here and here with the same claim.", "It was also shared in English here and here with a claim that the footage shows Norwegian police officers arresting someone who recited the\u00a0Koran\u00a0in a mosque, and here with a claim that Norwegian police entered a mosque to arrest a Muslim.", "The claims are false; the video has circulated in Dutch media reports about a man who was arrested for allegedly attacking police officers\u00a0during a disturbance at a mosque in Rotterdam. The reports contained no reference to\u00a0the man being arrested for reciting the Koran.", "A reverse image search and a keyword search on Google found the same two-minute, six-second video published on Facebook here on October 6, 2019.", "The Dutch-language caption translates\u00a0to English as: \u201cPolice officers with a police dog detained a worshipper at Essalaam Mosque in Rotterdam. On September 17, 2019, the police received a\u00a0message from the leadership of the mosque that they wanted to expel a man causing a disturbance. The four police officers had to use a police dog to overpower the man. The man\u2019s family were also afraid to him. The 43-year-old Rotterdam resident is still in detention.\u201d", "Multiple news reports in Dutch have also covered the incident, for example this October 4, 2019, report by Dutch-language daily newspaper\u00a0De Telegraaf.", "Below is a screenshot of De Telegraaf\u2019s report:", "The report\u2019s headline translates to English as: \u201cOfficers with police dog overpower man in mosque\u201d.", "The sub-headline reads in English as: \u201cImages circulating on the internet show an arrest in the Rotterdam Essalam mosque in Rotterdam South. Four officers and a police dog are attacked by a man sitting in a corner of a room.\u201d", "The first paragraph of the report reads: \u201cOn September 17, the police were called by the mosque because a man inside the Islamic prayer house on Vredesplein was making trouble, a police spokesperson told De Telegraaf.
