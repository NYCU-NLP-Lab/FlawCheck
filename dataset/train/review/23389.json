That program gives the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) authority under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to purchase agricultural products from American vendors and transport the products in \"family-sized boxes\" to food banks and other aid organizations for distribution to families in need. As of Sept. 29, 2020, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced that more than 100 million of the government-funded boxes had been distributed across the country through the Farmers to Families Food Box Program.", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqbr5yU8O3M&feature=youtu.be", "Included in millions of these aid boxes were letters purportedly written by Trump crediting his administration for their distribution. Both English and Spanish versions of the letters reportedly were included in the boxes, which read the following:", "As President, safeguarding the health and well-being of our citizens is one of my highest priorities. As part of our response to the coronavirus, I prioritized sending nutritious food from our farmers to families in need throughout America. We are partnering with local organizations, farms, and ranches to ensure that you receive locally-sourced fresh fruits and vegetables as well as dairy and meat products.", "The letter went on to refer readers to the president\u2019s coronavirus guidelines. A full version of the letter had been uploaded to a document cloud by ProPublica, a nonprofit news publication. It is unclear whether the letters were mandated by the USDA or by the president himself. Snopes contacted both the federal agency and the White House but did not receive a response at the time of publication.", "Fox News first reported in July that the letters were to be included in some boxes beginning in Summer 2020 and credited the idea to White House adviser \u2014 and daughter to the president \u2014 Ivanka Trump, who tweeted a photo of the letter in food boxes on Aug. 14.", "The White House letter was touted in an Aug. 24 news release that claimed Trump \u201cswiftly launched\u201d the Farmers to Families Food Box program with his administration\u2019s purchase of $3 billion in produce, dairy, and meat for families in need, and had approved an additional $1 billion for the program.", "\"In addition, President Trump is including a letter that reinforces COVID-19 safety guidelines and how Americans can best protect themselves and their families,\" read the news release.", "Democratic lawmakers argue that the letter violates the federal Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from using taxpayer resources to campaign or engage in other electioneering activities. While the president himself, who is up for reelection, is exempt from the law, the law does apply to White House staff, such as Ivanka Trump, and federal agencies like the USDA. Rep. Marcia L. Fudge, D-Ohio, and dozens of other congressional members signed an Aug. 14 letter in response to the inclusion of the letters in federal aid boxes:", "Using a federal relief program to distribute a self-promoting letter from the President to American families just three months before the presidential election is inappropriate and a violation of federal law. We strongly urge you to end the practice immediately,\u201d wrote the members.", "[...]", "A public health crisis is not an opportunity for the administration to promote its own political interests. Likewise, a federal food assistance program should not be used as a tool for the President to exploit taxpayer dollars for his re-election campaign.", "The authors of the congressional letter requested further information regarding the details of the letter, any associated costs, and who required its inclusion by Aug. 31. Snopes contacted Fudge\u2019s office to confirm whether she had received a response from the agency and if so, what information was included.
