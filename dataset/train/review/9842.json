Mitt Romney, R-Utah, leaves the Senate Chamber after a procedural vote, at the Capitol in Washington on Sept. 21, 2020.

I think there's some perception on the part of some writers and others that gee, what happened with Merrick Garland was unfair. I don't agree with that. I don't know whether you think it was a good decision or not but it wasn't unfair because it was consistent with history, it was consistent with precedent. It was consistent with the Constitution. So the idea that the Merrick Garland decision was unfair and therefore it has to be made up by doing something, which also wouldn't make a lot of sense \u2014 which is saying to President Trump, \u2018You can't get your nominee either\u2019 \u2014 that just doesn't follow for me.", "\"The Garland decision was consistent with history. The decision to proceed with the new nominee is also consistent with history and precedent.
