["Former Nigeria vice president Atiku Abubakar recently criticised the current administration\u2019s plan to borrow nearly US$6.9 billion.", "Writing in a national newspaper, Abubakar made a number of claims about the Nigerian economy, comparing the current administration\u2019s actions to Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s and his own.", "The former VP was largely correct about the worrying amount Nigeria spends on repaying foreign debt and that the United Nations has predicted lower growth for Africa because of the coronavirus pandemic.", "While he was also right about the price of oil when he took office, compared to today, he bungled facts about the repayment of debts under his watch, and economists warn it is difficult to directly compare government expenditure today to that of the 1990s.", "Former Nigeria vice president Atiku Abubakar recently criticised the current administration\u2019s plan to borrow nearly US$6.9 billion, saying the country should instead seek debt relief and push for higher oil prices.", "Nigeria is looking for $6.9 billion from three multilateral lenders. Finance minister Zainab Ahmed has said this is to cushion the country from \u201cexistential threats\u201d due to the Covid-19 pandemic and falling prices of oil, its top foreign exchange earner.", "Writing in the daily Vanguard newspaper in April 2020, Abubakar, who has vied for the presidency four times, made a number of statements to support his position. We fact-checked six.", "Before the novel coronavirus pandemic hit the globe, Nigeria spent 42% of its earnings on debt servicing.", "We asked the former vice president to provide evidence for his claims and for clarifications where necessary. We will update this report when he responds.", "The first cases of the novel coronavirus outside mainland China were reported in January 2020, according to the World Health Organization.", "Nigeria spent N2.1 trillion (about US$6.9 billion at the current official exchange rate) to service its debt in 2019, according to the country\u2019s debt management office. Of this, N1.69 trillion ($5.5 billion) was for domestic debt, and N408 billion ($1.3 billion) for foreign debt.", "Nigeria\u2019s revenue in 2019 was N4.77 trillion, according to the country\u2019s central bank. This came from sources such as oil and gas, value added tax, corporate tax and custom duty.", "Taken as a proportion of this revenue, about 44% was spent servicing debt. We therefore rate Abubakar\u2019s figure of 42% as mostly correct.", "Economics professor Philip Olomola told Africa Check that while there are \u201cvalid reasons\u201d for the debt owed by the government, using nearly half of the country\u2019s earnings to repay it was unsound in the long run.", "\u201cIn the face of dwindling revenue, governments take loans for projects and to keep the country running. However, debt servicing taking over 40% of the country\u2019s earnings is not sustainable,\u201d Olomola, who teaches at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife, said.", "The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa is projecting that Africa\u2019s growth will drop to 1.8%, and perhaps lower.", "The UN\u2019s Economic Commission for Africa focuses on the economic and social development of the continent.", "Abubakar said it was inevitable that Africa would take an economic hit from the pandemic, and said the agency had already revised growth projections for the region.", "A spokesperson for the commission, Privat Akochaye, directed Africa Check to a French-language report published in April 2020. This showed that the agency had pared back its growth forecast for the region for 2020, from 3.2% to between 1.8% and 2% in a best-case scenario. But this could shrink to 0.1% or, in a worst-case scenario, to as low as -2.6%.", "The commission therefore did revise its projections, though these forecasts tend to often change as more information becomes available.", "The price of oil was lower when president Obasanjo and Abubakar assumed office on 29 May 1999 than it is today ...", "The former VP\u2019s point was that a crash in the price of oil should not automatically \u201ctrigger a crisis\u201d.", "Abubakar took office as president Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s deputy on 29 May 1999, serving two terms until 2007.", "In May 1999, the price of Nigeria\u2019s main crude oil export, Bonny Light, was US$16.94 per barrel, according to historical data from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.", "On 8 April 2020, the day Abubakar\u2019s article was published, Bonny Light crude sold at $25.89 per barrel. Strictly interpreted, Abubaka was accurate that the price of oil was lower in 1999.", "But comparing the prices of oil in 1999 and in 2020 should be done with caution, economics professor Philip Olomola told Africa Check.", "\u201cThere is a need to consider economic fundamentals such as the changes in the demand for the commodity,\u201d he said.", "\u201cThe US for instance was buying more crude oil from Nigeria in 1999 than it is buying today. It\u2019s not just about the price. Even if it rises to $100 per barrel, if there are no buyers, it would make no difference,\u201d he said.", "\u2026 yet they paid off Nigeria\u2019s entire foreign debt.", "Returning to a familiar 2019 presidential campaign talking point, Abubakar compared debt levels during his time as VP with those of the current administration of president Muhammadu Buhari.", "When he exited office in 2007, Nigeria\u2019s foreign debt had been \u201cpaid off\u201d, Abubakar said. Is this accurate?", "A highlight of the Obasanjo administration was a debt cancellation deal it negotiated with the \u201cParis Club\u201d, an informal group of 22 creditor countries.", "In 2005 the creditors wrote off $18 billion of the roughly $30 billion Nigeria had owed them at the end of 2004. This was 84% of the country\u2019s foreign debt as at December 2004.", "Nigeria still had to pay $12.4 billion, according to the public announcement by the group, which was made in April 2006.", "Nigeria also paid its debt to private banks known as the \u201cLondon Club\u201d in a similar deal. The country\u2019s debt office showed this was done in 2007. But this statement of accounts showed Nigeria\u2019s foreign debt was $3.54 billion at the end of 2006 and $3.65 billion at the end of 2007.", "The data shows the Obasanjo government did not settle Nigeria\u2019s foreign debt as the VP claimed. They handed over to a new government in May 2007. That year, Nigeria still spent more than $1 billion to service foreign debts.", "Nigeria has devoted N37 billion to renovating the national assembly complex, which was built from the scratch for less than 20% of that amount.", "Abubakar also faulted the recent approval of a reported N37 billion to renovate the national assembly, which he said was \u201cbuilt from scratch\u201d for less than a fifth of this.", "Nigeria\u2019s plan to spend this amount, approved in December 2019, is the subject of public debate.", "The contract to initially build the national assembly was awarded in February 1996, with construction lasting two and a half years. The company that built it has given the value of the contract as N7 billion.", "But the value of Nigeria\u2019s currency has depreciated significantly over the years, economics professor Philip Olomola told Africa Check.", "When comparing the two figures, one \u201cshould consider factors such as changes in exchange rate and in the cost of construction equipment and material\u201d, the economist said.", "In 1996 the exchange rate was N21.9 to the US dollar. This means about $320 million was devoted to the construction of the complex.", "In December 2019, when the renovation budget was approved, the official exchange rate was N306 to the dollar, or $121 million.", "Olomola said the purchasing power of N7 billion in 1996 is likely to be more valuable than that of N37 billion today.", "The cost of building equipment and material has also generally increased over the years, King Nyenke, a professor of quantity surveying at the Rivers State University, told Africa Check.", "Nyenke said that if he were provided with the same bill of quantity as in 1996, the cost of building it now \u201cwould be higher\u201d than N7 billion.", "Because of the changes in these fundamentals, it is difficult to know for certain if the repair bill for the national assembly would be less than 20% what it cost to construct it.", "So we rate this claim as unproven.", "N13 billion was devoted to the State House clinic in the last five years.", "The hospital at the president\u2019s official residence is often reported as being ill-equipped and barely functional despite being allocated a large budget every year.", "\u201cIt is virtually useless as we face the most significant public health challenge of our national life,\u201d Abubakar wrote, claiming that N13 billion was allocated to the hospital in the five years to 2020. A similar claim was published by the Daily Trust newspaper on 6 April.", "The budget allocation to the facility in the 2016 budget \u2013 the first of Buhari\u2019s administration \u2013 was N2.83 billion. It dropped to N331.7 million in the 2017 budget before rising to N1.03 billion in the 2018 budget.", "In 2019 N799 million was budgeted for the hospital, and N723 million for 2020. The total is about N5.7 billion \u2013 less than half Abubakar\u2019s claim. (Note: The amounts released are sometimes less than what's budgeted, but a lack of historical data on budget implementation makes it difficult to know the exact amount that reached the hospital over the period.)", "Please complete this form to receive the HTML sharing code.", "Africa Check values your trust and is committed to the responsible management, use and protection of personal information.
