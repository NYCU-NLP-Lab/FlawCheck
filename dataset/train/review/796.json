["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on April 4, 2019", "In fiscal year 2018, Mexico apprehended 110,000 migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, and over the previous four fiscal years the total was more than 500,000. Yet, President Donald Trump said that for the \u201cfirst time\u201d in \u201cdecades\u201d Mexico \u201chas been starting to apprehend a lot of people at their southern border coming in\u201d from those countries.", "The Mexico apprehension figures were compiled by the Migration Policy Institute from Mexican government reports. This chart, published by MPI in March, compares apprehensions by the U.S. and Mexico of migrants from the three so-called Northern Triangle countries.", "Ariel G. Ruiz Soto, an associate policy analyst at the\u00a0Migration Policy Institute, told us MPI looked at apprehension and deportation statistics to see if there had been a noticeable change in Mexico under President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1.", "So far, according to statistics through February, there has been a slight decrease in those figures compared with the same time periods in the last two years of the previous administration, but, Ruiz Soto said, \u201cthe trends looked similar overall.\u201d Apprehensions at Mexico\u2019s southern border would be included in the Mexican government\u2019s overall figures.", "Trump, however, claimed in remarks before a meeting with\u00a0NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that this week marked \u201cthe\u00a0first time, really, in decades\u201d that Mexico \u201chas been starting to apprehend a lot of people at their southern border.\u201d", "The president made his remarks when asked about his calls to close the U.S.-Mexico border.", "Trump, April 2:\u00a0And I\u2019m ready to close it, if I have to close it.\u00a0Mexico, as you know, as of yesterday, has been starting to apprehend a lot of people at their southern border coming in from Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador. And they\u2019ve \u2014 they\u2019re really apprehending thousands of people. And it\u2019s the first time, really, in decades that this has taken place. And it should have taken place a long time ago. \u2026", "But Mexico is now stopping people coming \u2014 very easy for them to do \u2014 stopping people coming in through Mexico. Let\u2019s see if they keep it done, if \u2014 if they keep doing that.", "\u201cMexico has consistently been apprehending and deporting people in large numbers since the implementation of the Southern Border Program in 2014,\u201d\u00a0Rachel Schmidtke, program associate for migration at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, told us.", "Then-Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto implemented the Southern Border Program on July 7, 2014, with the goals of improving border security and migration flows, such as through temporary visitor and worker permits, and protecting migrants, including by providing medical care.", "A 2017 analysis of the program by Luis Alfredo Arriola Vega, a\u00a0visiting scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy\u2019s Mexico Center at Rice University, found there were many criticisms of the program, particularly regarding its goal of protecting migrants. Deportations \u201cconsiderably increased,\u201d the report noted, but the containment efforts \u201cmade routes more dangerous for people heading north.\u201d", "\u201cDiverse sources \u2026 agree in pointing out that PFS [Programa Frontera Sur, or Southern Border Program] effectively hardened Mexican migration policy because of the consequences associated with increased control at or near the southern border,\u201d Arriola Vega wrote.", "We asked the White House press office for an explanation of Trump\u2019s remarks, but we didn\u2019t get a response. Ruiz Soto told us Trump might be referring to two arrest operations in Mexico on April 1. The Mexican newspaper El Universo reported that Mexican immigration authorities detained 338 migrants traveling in buses and 150 people on foot in the Mexican state of Chiapas, which borders Guatemala. Most of those detained were from Central American countries.", "But, again, Trump\u2019s claim \u201cthat this is the first time in decades that Mexico is apprehending people in these numbers is false,\u201d Schmidtke told us.", "\u201cWhat has changed recently,\u201d she said, \u201cis that the number of Central American migrants entering Mexico through its southern border has increased, and in January and February of 2019 the National Migration Institute of Mexico began offering members of caravans a \u2018fast-track\u2019 humanitarian visa which allowed migrants to enter and travel freely in Mexico and afforded them certain protections.\u201d", "But the Mexican government stopped issuing those humanitarian visas in February. On March 28, the Associated Press reported that Mexico\u2019s interior secretary said the country would launch a \u201ccontainment\u201d plan for migrants at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the narrowest part of southern Mexico.", "Associated Press, March 28: Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero said the situation is complicated by a caravan of roughly 2,500 migrants heading north and fears of a much larger \u201cmother caravan\u201d possibly forming in Honduras.", "\u201cWe are going to locate our migration installations, of Federal Police and civil protection, harmoniously and with collaboration among all the federal government agencies in such a way that we have containment in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,\u201d she said in comments a day after meeting with U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big change.\u201d", "Schmidtke told us: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear what they mean yet by \u2018containment,\u2019 but it\u2019s clear Mexico is beginning to succumb to some pressure for the United States to increase their enforcement strategies.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
