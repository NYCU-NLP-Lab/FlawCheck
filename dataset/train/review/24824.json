["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on April 17, 2020 | Updated on April 20, 2020", "Social media posts falsely claim that federal payments from the COVID-19 stimulus package could reduce taxpayers\u2019 future refunds. The Internal Revenue Service says the payment \u201cwill not reduce your refund or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2020 tax return next year.\u201d", "The IRS has begun dispersing money from the $2 trillion COVID-19 economic stimulus package. But memes and videos on social media are spreading misleading messages about made-up consequences for those who receive the payments.", "A common claim in these posts is that payouts from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \u2014 which provides\u00a0$1,200 lump-sum payments to most individuals making less than $75,000 a year \u2014 will either reduce future tax refunds or will have to be paid back.", "One viral video originally posted on TikTok has been taken down from that site, but continues to circulate on Facebook, making the claim: \u201cSee, what they don\u2019t tell you is that this is just an advance on your next tax return\u2026 Next year, you\u2019re automatically going to owe $1,200 come tax season.\u201d", "That\u2019s not true.", "The claim in the video appears to stem from a misunderstanding of the language in the law, which uses a tax credit as the vehicle to get stimulus payments to individuals.", "In a March report exploring options to stimulate the economy as it faltered in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Congressional Research Service said: \u201cOne mechanism to provide cash payments relatively quickly is to create a new refundable tax credit and then advance it to households before they would otherwise claim it on their income tax returns.\u201d", "Later that month, when the CARES Act became law, that\u2019s exactly what it did.", "The CARES Act created a new tax credit for taxes that will be due on income earned in 2020, but it\u2019s available to eligible individuals now. The credit allows for payments of $1,200 to most individuals earning less than $75,000, as we said, and a reduced amount (on a sliding scale) to individuals who make up to $99,000. Couples who are married and file joint taxes can get $2,400 if their combined income is under $150,000, and parents can collect $500 per child.", "Like the familiar Earned Income Tax Credit or the Child Tax Credit, this tax credit does not need to be repaid.", "The Treasury Department confirmed that to us in an email, and the IRS website explains, \u201cthe Payment is not income and you will not owe tax on your Payment. It will not reduce your refund or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2020 tax return next year.\u201d", "Similarly, taxpayers receiving a stimulus payment based on a previous year\u2019s income level would not have to pay anything back if their earnings in 2020 exceed the program\u2019s income limits, according to the IRS.", "Still, confusion persists online. In an example of just how pervasive the misunderstanding is, a copy of a chart showing an accurate description of the law\u2019s allowances has been marked up and shared with misleading captions.", "One such post highlighted the section of the chart that said: \u201cThis is an advance on a new tax credit on your 2020 taxes. So if you get your stimulus check, you will not get that credit when filing for 2020 taxes.\u201d That part is correct \u2014 if a taxpayer collects the stimulus payment now, he can\u2019t collect it again when he pays his 2020 taxes. But the marked up chart was shared with this caption: \u201cThey gave you YOUR MONEY back in exchange for your money next year.\u201d That\u2019s not true.", "The individual who originally posted the chart, Fabian Saldivar of FS Tax Service Inc. \u2014 after seeing how social media users were responding \u2014 made it clear in his caption that the stimulus money is available through a new credit and it will not have to be repaid. In a phone interview with FactCheck.org he said, \u201cthey think it will get taken out of next year\u2019s taxes, which is not true.\u201d", "Update, April 20: To address reader questions, we\u00a0added\u00a0that taxpayers who\u00a0receive\u00a0stimulus payments based on a previous year\u2019s income would not have to pay anything back if their\u00a02020 earnings\u00a0exceed the program\u2019s income limits.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Telephone interview. 17 Apr 2020.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
