["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on January 9, 2017", "On Twitter, President-elect Donald Trump falsely wrote that a reporter \u201ctotally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad.\u201d As we have written before, the reporter never changed his story about the 9/11 terrorist attacks.", "Trump\u2019s tweet was in response to a speech given by actress Meryl Streep at the Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 8.

During the Republican primary, Trump cited that story as evidence for his discredited claim\u00a0that he saw on television \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of people in New Jersey celebrate the terrorist attacks.", "Trump made his claim about the celebrations during a speech in Alabama on Nov. 21, 2015. Two\u00a0days later, Trump tweeted a link to Kovaleski\u2019s Post article from Sept. 18, 2001, and demanded an apology from those who wrote that his statement was false.", "Via @washingtonpost 9/18/01.

The story, written by Kovaleski and Fredrick Kunkle, said that \u201cIn Jersey City \u2026 law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.\u201d", "In interviews after Trump made his claim, Kovaleski and Kunkle both said that they couldn\u2019t recall if the allegations about the tailgate-style celebration were ever substantiated.", "In a CNN story\u00a0published Nov. 24, 2015, Kovaleski was quoted saying that he and Kunkle \u201cdid a lot of shoe leather reporting in and around Jersey City and talked to a lot of residents and officials. \u2026 But I do not recall anyone saying there were thousands, or even hundreds, of people celebrating.\u201d", "And in an update to its story from Nov. 22, 2015, the Washington Post Fact Checker quoted Kunkle saying that he could never confirm the reports of celebrations.", "\u201cI specifically visited the Jersey City building and neighborhood where the celebrations were purported to have happened.
