["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Claims and charges keep flying in the U.S. Senate race between Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown and Republican Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel.\n\nMandel opened the final month of the campaign with a TV ad focused on Brown's \u00a0tax lapses.\n\n\"Sherrod Brown caught not paying his taxes\" are the announcer's first words, and the same words are displayed onscreen.\n\nIn a news release accompanying the ad, Mandel calls Brown \"a serial delinquent when it comes to not paying his property taxes\" because he \"failed to pay his own taxes three separate times.\"\n\nMandel's campaign cited articles by The Plain Dealer and Associated Press as support for the claim.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio looked at those stories and others. We also reviewed records from the District of Columbia's Office of Tax and Revenue.\n\nThe stories, in February 2012, reported that Brown had paid a penalty fee and interest a week earlier, after being four months late paying property tax on his Washington, D.C., apartment.\n\nBrown owed $922.04 in property taxes for the last half of 2011. The taxes were due by Sept. 26, according to the District property tax office. His delinquency added another $76.96 as a late penalty and $46.18 for interest.\n\nBrown also was delinquent in 2006 and 2007 and paid penalties and interest, according to tax records from the District. Before he paid the bill in 2007, his apartment was placed on a District of Columbia auction list for properties with taxes in arrears.\n\nThe delinquencies in 2006 and 2007 resulted in Brown paying a total of $735.07 in late charges and interest. Each of those original tax bills, excluding interest and fines, was for less than $900.\n\nBrown was asked about the delinquency during a conference call with reporters last February. He said, \"I was late. I misplaced the bill and I paid it as soon as I found out. I paid a penalty for being late, and it won't happen again.\"\n\nHe said he also had misplaced the earlier missed bills.\n\n\"This is a small apartment,\" he said. \"I'm not in D.C. nearly every week, I'm here when the Senate's in session, I'm here three or four nights a week. I paid the penalty. And in no way, obviously, was I avoiding taxes.\"\n\nBrown, who won his Senate seat in 2006 after serving seven terms in the House of Representatives, bought the one-bedroom apartment in 1993. He appeared to have paid the property taxes on time for a dozen years after that.\n\nHis primary residence is in Avon.\n\nMandel was accurate in saying that Brown failed to pay his taxes three separate times. Brown was late to pay. He did pay the taxes and penalty.\n\nThere is no indication he was trying to evade the tax, but that wasn\u2019t part of Mandel\u2019s claim, either.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim in the Mandel campaign ad rates True.", "Mandel for Senate, news release, \u00a0\"Sherrod Brown Voted to Raise Taxes and Raise His Pay \u2014 But Didn\u2019t Pay His Own Taxes Three Times,\" Oct. 2, 2012\n\nMandel for Senate, \"Serial Delinquent,\" Oct. 2, 2012\n\nThe Plain Dealer via Cleveland.com, \"Sen.
