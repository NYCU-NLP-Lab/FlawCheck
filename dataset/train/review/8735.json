["About this rating", "A photograph purportedly showing the insides of a leatherback turtle's mouth that is frequently shared online is often\u00a0viewed with a heavy dose of skepticism due to its gruesome and alien-like appearance:", "However, the image is indeed real.", "The esophagus of a leatherback sea turtle is lined with papillae, sharp, keratinized prongs that enable the turtle to dine on jellyfish:", "Another adaptation that leatherbacks and a few other sea turtles have is called esophageal papillae. These prongs are made of cartilage and line the throat of the turtle, and basically grip on to the jellyfish that it\u2019s eating and ensures that it doesn\u2019t slip back out as the turtle uses the muscles in its throat to expel excess salt water.", "The esophageal papillae also protect the leatherback from the stinging cells for the jellyfish \u2013 as you can imagine, the jellyfish don\u2019t go down without a fight, so these cartilaginous prongs keep the turtle from being injured by its prey. Now, leatherbacks travel vast distances and require a lot of energy to make these migrations possible \u2013 but jellyfish are primarily water, a little protein, some vitamins and minerals, and some fat. So \u2013 how on earth can a leatherback fuel it\u2019s body with them? Well, they actually have an extremely long esophagus that leads from the mouth to the rear of the body, and then it loops up the side again until it reaches the stomach, which is about a quarter of the way from the front of the turtle. This long esophagus acts as a holding pouch so that the leatherback can continually digest its food \u2013 as parts of its meal leaves the stomach digested, new jellyfish are being pushed into the stomach.", "The image seen here was first\u00a0posted online by The Los Roques Scientific Foundation in September 2010 and was reportedly\u00a0taken at\u00a0the\u00a0Los Roques Archipelago National Park in Venezuela.", "Additional\u00a0photographs showing the insides of a leatherback sea turtles mouth have been taken by several other scientific organizations:", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
