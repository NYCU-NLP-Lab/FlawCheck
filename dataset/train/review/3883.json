["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on February 11, 2020 | Updated on October 10, 2023", "Online posts have claimed to reveal various \u201ccures\u201d for the novel coronavirus. Some are benign, like eating boiled garlic, while others are potentially dangerous, like drinking chlorine dioxide, an industrial bleach. Neither will cure the virus.", "Treatments billed as miracle cures have cropped up across the internet since the\u00a0novel coronavirus\u00a0began spreading in Wuhan, China, at the end of December.", "One rumor claims that boiled garlic can cure the virus. Another says that loading up on vitamin C will do the trick. Yet another would have people, essentially, drink bleach.", "None of these \u201ccures\u201d will treat the virus.", "We\u2019re addressing each of these widely circulated claims in separate articles, starting with the most dangerous one \u2014 the claim\u00a0that drinking chlorine dioxide will cure the virus.", "Chlorine dioxide kits are sold online under various names \u2014 Miracle Mineral Solution, Miracle Mineral Supplement, Master Mineral Solution \u2014 but they are most often referred to as MMS.", "These kits typically include a bottle of sodium chlorite and a bottle of an \u201cactivator\u201d such as citric acid. When the two chemicals are mixed together, they make chlorine dioxide, a common industrial bleach\u00a0used in the production of paper products, according to the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.", "But MMS hucksters sell the chemical solution as a\u00a0cure-all\u00a0for cancer, AIDS, autism and, now, the novel coronavirus.", "One popular conspiracy theorist, Jordan Sather, wrote on\u00a0Twitter: \u201c\u2018NO KNOWN CURE FOR CORONAVIRUS\u2019, they say. Well, it sure sounds like chlorine dioxide could wipe it out.\u201d He\u00a0directed his 116,000 followers to a website called Keavy\u2019s Corner, which posted a banner at the top of its\u00a0site\u00a0telling customers, \u201cWe are experiencing high order volume that has us a few days behind on shipping.\u201d", "Keavy\u2019s Corner,\u00a0based in Florida, didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.", "Another major proponent of MMS, Kerri Rivera, posted a story on her website under the headline: \u201cGood News: Coronavirus Destroyed By Chlorine Dioxide.\u201d Rivera\u00a0primarily advocates for the use of MMS in treating autism. She was effectively barred in 2015 from selling chlorine dioxide for the treatment of autism in Illinois. But she is still active online and said in her recent post, \u201cWe already know CD is safe for ingestion by people, and has been used for helping the body heal from any number of health conditions including autism, malaria, herpes and AIDS.\u201d", "None of that is true. The\u00a0U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u00a0and similar agencies in the\u00a0U.K.,\u00a0Canada,\u00a0New Zealand, South Africa, and\u00a0Australia, have warned against the use of MMS.", "In August 2019, the FDA issued this\u00a0warning:", "FDA, Aug. 12, 2019:\u00a0Drinking any of these chlorine dioxide products can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and symptoms of severe dehydration. Some product labels claim that vomiting and diarrhea are common after ingesting the product. They even maintain that such reactions are evidence that the product is working. That claim is false.", "Moreover, in general, the more concentrated the product, the more severe the reactions. The FDA has received reports of consumers who have suffered from severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, life-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration, and acute liver failure after drinking these products. If you have had a negative reaction to any of them, \u00a0consult a health care professional as soon as possible.", "While MMS is available on websites that look like herbal medicine dispensaries, like Keavy\u2019s Corner, it is also described as a \u201csacrament\u201d by an organization that calls itself the Genesis II Church.", "Genesis II appears to have been one of the first major proponents of MMS. One of its founders, Jim Humble,\u00a0claims to have discovered the solution in 1996 and Genesis II members push the use of MMS in online\u00a0videos\u00a0and self-published\u00a0books, some of which are available on\u00a0Amazon. Humble did not respond to an email seeking comment.", "Shane Hawkins, who is\u00a0listed as a reverend on the Genesis II website, was sued by the state of Texas and barred\u00a0in 2017 from selling MMS. The state\u00a0sued\u00a0Hawkins after he charged $500 for admission to a series of \u201cseminars\u201d on the use of MMS at Houston-area hotels.", "Hawkins isn\u2019t the only person who has been to court for the sale MMS. Louis Smith, of Spokane, Washington, faced criminal charges in federal court for selling MMS on a website called Project GreenLife. He was\u00a0convicted\u00a0in 2015 and sentenced to more than four years in prison.", "And, in 2018, Stanley Nowak\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in Canadian court to selling MMS, an unauthorized drug under Canadian law.", "Despite warnings from government health agencies and legal consequences for direct sellers, pitches for MMS continue to get attention in conspiracy-theory and anti-vaccine circles online.", "That\u2019s likely because, like a lot of long-running conspiracy theories and scams, there\u2019s a grain of truth to MMS. Chlorine dioxide is\u00a0used as a disinfectant\u00a0in municipal water treatment, so people can ingest trace amounts of the chemical. But the Environmental Protection Agency has set a\u00a0maximum allowed level of 0.8 milligrams per liter. The dropper bottles used for MMS, however, serve 3 to 8 milligrams per drop, according to one medical journal. Humble\u00a0recommends\u00a0drinking six drops in a half-cup of water and then drinking the same amount an hour later to treat the coronavirus. That\u2019s about 200 to 500 times the maximum amount set by the EPA.", "The effect of drinking higher amounts of chlorine dioxide from MMS kits has been documented in medical journals by doctors who have treated patients who drank it. A\u00a075-year-old man in New York who tried to treat his prostate cancer with MMS ended up spending four days in the hospital and received a blood transfusion. A 2-year-old in Nashville drank from a bottle of MMS and was twice hospitalized, requiring two blood transfusions. And a 27-year-old woman in Birmingham, Alabama, accidentally drank two-and-a-half ounces of MMS instead of two drops and spent two days in the hospital.", "The FDA has warned against using MMS since 2010 and reiterated in a statement to FactCheck.org that \u201cthe FDA recommends consumers do not ingest these products.\u201d The statement, provided by spokesperson Jeremy Kahn, went on to say, \u201cWe understand people are concerned about the spread of the novel coronavirus and we urge people to talk to their health care provider about treatment options.\u201d", "Update, Oct. 10: Mark Grenon, a co-founder of Genesis II, and his three sons \u2014 Jonathan, Jordan and Joseph \u2013 were found them guilty of conspiring to defraud the U.S. government by distributing MMS as a cure for COVID-19 and other diseases. On Oct. 6, the judge sentenced Jonathan and Jordan Grenon to 12 and a half years in prison and Mark and Joseph Grenon to five years.", "Update, April 10: Phrasing for the novel coronavirus has changed since we first posted this story. We updated the original phrasing to reflect that.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
