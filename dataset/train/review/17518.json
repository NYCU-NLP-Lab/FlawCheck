["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on May 20, 2020", "President Donald Trump erroneously tweeted that Michigan\u2019s Democratic secretary of state was \u201cillegally\u201d sending \u201cabsentee ballots to 7.7 million people\u201d for this year\u2019s primary and general elections.", "The state said it will send absentee ballot applications \u2014 not actual ballots \u2014 to all registered voters, who may want to vote by mail.", "Trump, who has been critical of mail-in voting, made the false claim May 20, in a since-deleted tweet.", "\u201cBreaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path.\u201d", "About an hour after his message was sent, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson corrected the president on Twitter.", "\u201cHi!  I also have a name, it\u2019s Jocelyn Benson. And we sent applications, not ballots. Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia,\u201d she tweeted.", "Benson is correct that Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia have mailed absentee ballot applications to voters.", "Trump\u2019s original tweet was later deleted, six hours after he posted it, according to Politwoops. The president replaced it with one saying \u201cballot applications\u201d \u2014 instead of just \u201cballots\u201d \u2014 still claiming it\u2019s \u201cillegal.\u201d", "Benson announced May 19 that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of the state\u2019s registered voters would be mailed an application to vote by mail in the August and November elections. A press statement on the announcement said that 1.3 million of the state\u2019s 7.7 million registered voters are already on the permanent absent voter list, and receive applications from their local election clerk prior to each election.", "\u201cBy mailing applications, we have ensured that no Michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote,\u201d Benson said. \u201cVoting by mail is easy, convenient, safe, and secure, and every voter in Michigan has the right to do it.\u201d", "The National Conference of State Legislatures says that all U.S. states allow qualified voters to vote by absentee ballot, and five states (Utah, Colorado, Hawaii, Washington and Oregon) currently conduct all their elections primarily by mail. Michigan is one of 34 states that do not require an excuse from those who want to vote by absentee ballot, according to the NCSL.", "Trump also tweeted a threat to withhold unspecified federal funding from Nevada, which he said was sending \u201cillegal\u201d ballots to voters in the mail.", "\u201cState of Nevada \u2018thinks\u2019 that they can send out illegal vote by mail ballots, creating a great Voter Fraud scenario for the State and the U.S. They can\u2019t!,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cIf they do, \u2018I think\u2019 I can hold up funds to the State. Sorry, but you must not cheat in elections.\u201d", "Citing concerns about COVID-19, Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, did announce in late March that state election officials decided that it would be best to conduct an all-mail vote for the upcoming June 9 primary election.", "\u201cAll active registered voters in Nevada will be mailed an absentee ballot for the primary election,\u201d her office said in a news release.", "Nevada state law already allowed registered voters to request, for any reason, an absentee ballot to vote by mail. And neither the White House nor Trump\u2019s presidential campaign could explain why it would be \u201cillegal\u201d for Nevada to send ballots to voters for next month\u2019s primary election.", "In a statement released after Trump sent his tweet, Cegavske\u2019s office said: \u201cSecretary Cegavske lawfully declared the 2020 primary election as a mail-in election. In a recent court order, a federal judge ruled that Secretary Cegavske lawfully exercised authority granted to her by state law to call for a primary election conducted primarily by mail ballot.\u201d", "Election experts previously told us that fraud via mail-in ballots is more common than in-person voting fraud, but still rare. Plus, a recent study by Stanford University\u2019s Democracy & Polarization Lab found that neither the Democratic or Republican parties would benefit from an entirely vote-by-mail system.", "\u201cWe find that universal vote-by-mail does not affect either party\u2019s share of turnout or either party\u2019s vote share,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote.", "Editor\u2019s Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
