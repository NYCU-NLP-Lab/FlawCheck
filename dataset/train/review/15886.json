The parents had supposedly found the baby (alive) in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce with bite marks on the boy\u2019s arms and legs.", "So even in the context of the post, he didn\u2019t really get eaten. If it\u2019s any comfort, not only is the story fake, it also said the boy was expected to recover.", "The photo included on most of the posts is not a ravenous, drug-smoking teenager from Missouri. It\u2019s actually of a 28-year-old Indiana woman arrested in January 2016 on domestic battery charges.", "The true source of this story is a Jan. 20, 2016, article on WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a website known for posting fake articles. (That version said the babysitter\u2019s name was Anna Krutchiev.) The site says in its disclaimer that it is responsible for \"the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.\"", "There is no indication on the post we checked, or on most of the others reblogging the same fake story, that it's fabricated. Comments on these stories make it clear some horrified readers were tricked.", "But this story about a babysitter getting high and attempting to eat a child never happened.", "We rate it Pants On Fire!", "NotAllowedTo.com, \"Babysitter on crystal meth eats 3-month-old baby,\" Feb. 28, 2017", "WorldNewsDailyReport.com, \"Missouri: Babysitter on crystal meth eats 3-month-old toddler,\" Jan. 20, 2016", "Fox 59, \"Columbus woman arrested for domestic battery with child present,\" Jan. 11, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
