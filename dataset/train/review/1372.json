["About this rating", "Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.", "In September 2020, amidst the propagation of many (mostly false) reports intended to cast aspersions on the integrity of the upcoming 2020 U.S. presidential election, a series of tweets and blog posts went viral that claimed to show photographs of over a thousand mail-in ballots discovered in a Republic Services of Sonoma County landfill in Petaluma, California.", "However, the items shown in the photographs were not ballots, were not from 2020, and were not illegally discarded. As the County of Sonoma verified via social media, the pictured items were merely empty envelopes from the November 2018 election that had been disposed of as allowed by law:", "As the Election Integrity Project observed, \"Images and stories like these are being used to mislead people about the integrity of the election. We recommend caution when sharing images, especially images of uncertain provenance.\"", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
