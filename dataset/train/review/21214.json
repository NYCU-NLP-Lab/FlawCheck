["By Lori Robertson, Robert Farley, D'Angelo Gore, Jessica McDonald and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on June 19, 2019", "At a rally in Orlando on June 18, President Donald Trump officially launched his reelection campaign. Trump boasted that under his leadership, the country is \u201cthriving, prospering and booming,\u201d and he asked voters for four more years to \u201ckeep America great.\u201d", "\u201cNobody\u2019s done what we have done in two and a half years,\u201d he said. However, we found his\u00a0speech was filled with many familiar false, misleading and exaggerated statements about his record on jobs, military spending, veterans, energy, trade and more.", "During his speech, Trump twice took credit for the state of America\u2019s energy production, citing milestones that were achieved years ago or long expected.", "\u201cWe are, by the way, the number one producer of energy in the world because of what we\u2019ve done right now,\u201d the president said, early on in his remarks.\u00a0About a half hour later, Trump returned to the theme, stating, \u201cWe\u2019ve ended the last administration\u2019s cruel and heartless war on American energy. What they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.\u201d", "As we\u2019ve\u00a0explained\u00a0before, citing data from the Energy Information Administration, the United States is the top producer of natural gas. But that\u2019s a title the nation has held\u00a0since 2009. The U.S. also produces the most petroleum \u2014 and has done so since 2013.", "More recently, this past summer, the U.S. did\u00a0take over\u00a0as the leading producer of crude oil. Production of crude oil, however, had been ramping up for\u00a0many years, and the milestone was\u00a0expected.", "According to the most recent EIA data, the United States is not the largest overall producer of energy. That award goes to China, which in 2016 produced 107 quadrillion Btus of\u00a0total primary energy, a term that includes fossil fuels as well as nuclear and renewable sources.", "In 2016, the U.S. was second worldwide, with 84 quadrillion Btus. Since then, the U.S. has\u00a0increased\u00a0its energy production to 95 quadrillion Btus in 2018. The agency doesn\u2019t have more recent data for China, but U.S. production is still below China\u2019s 2016 level.", "Trump\u00a0repeated\u00a0his misleading claim that spending on defense is at a record high.", "Trump:\u00a0After past leaders slashed military budgets, we are rebuilding the U.S. armed forces with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year, far more than ever before.", "Trump got the dollar amounts right.\u00a0The\u00a0Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, a two-year budget agreement that Trump signed into law on Feb. 9, 2018, set the budget authority for national defense at\u00a0$700 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $716 billion in fiscal 2019.", "Neither figure is \u201cfar more than ever before\u201d in inflation-adjusted dollars.", "When\u00a0we reviewed this claim\u00a0last year,\u00a0Jacob Cohn, a research fellow at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, calculated the real, or inflation-adjusted, value of national defense outlays \u2014\u00a0actual spending in a fiscal year\u00a0\u2014 dating to 1940, which covers World War II spending. Cohn adjusted past national defense spending\u00a0(table 3.1)\u00a0based on the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s deflators (table 10.1) from the president\u2019s fiscal year 2019 budget.", "Cohn found that the most amount ever spent was in 1945, when the U.S. spent the equivalent of $950.1 billion (in 2019 dollars). More was also spent in 1943 and 1944, and in 2008 through 2012, which included the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.", "We also should note that the U.S. spent far more on defense as a percentage of the gross domestic product during World War II. The\u00a0department\u2019s\u00a0fiscal 2019 budget request included a graph that shows defense spending as a percentage of GDP peaked in 1944 at 35.5 percent \u2014 far more than the 3.1 percent projected at the time for fiscal year 2019.\u00a0WWII spending is an anomaly, but spending as a percentage of GDP has routinely been higher in the past than it is now.", "Trump again made a mostly meaningless claim about the number of U.S. workers, which he exaggerated in the process.", "Trump: And today, right now, as we speak, almost 160 million people are working, that\u2019s more than ever before, it\u2019s the first time ever, the number of people is almost 160 million and we\u2019re going to be breaking that number soon.", "Total nonfarm employment was 151.1 million as of May,\u00a0according to\u00a0the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics projections. That\u2019s the most all-time, but still well short of 160 million.", "But Trump\u2019s claim still doesn\u2019t mean much considering that the U.S. also has a\u00a0larger population\u00a0than ever before. U.S. employment isn\u2019t at an all-time high according to other (also imperfect) measures that factor in population.", "For those age 16 and over, the\u00a0civilian labor force participation rate\u00a0was 62.8 percent in May, and the\u00a0employment-population ratio\u00a0was 60.6 percent. Neither is the highest ever. BLS data also show the\u00a0national unemployment rate\u00a0\u2014 3.6 percent in May,\u00a0nearly a 50-year low \u2014 wasn\u2019t the lowest in history.", "The president made a misleading comparison about manufacturing job growth before and after he took office.", "Trump: In the eight years before I took office, on average, we lost 2,000 manufacturing jobs a month. Since my inauguration, we\u2019ve added 16,000 manufacturing jobs a month. That didn\u2019t happen by accident.", "As of May,\u00a0manufacturing employment\u00a0had increased by an average of 17,000 jobs per month since Trump was inaugurated. Trump is also correct that the manufacturing sector suffered an average loss of 2,000 jobs per month under Obama. However, Trump is including 13 months at the beginning of Obama\u2019s presidency that were during or immediately following the\u00a0Great Recession\u00a0that officially ended in June 2009. Manufacturing employment actually increased by an average of 11,000 jobs per month if tallied from when manufacturing job losses bottomed out in February 2010 until January 2017, when Obama left office.", "This graph shows the manufacturing sector almost steadily gaining jobs in that time and since. Although, as of May, there were still 907,000 fewer people employed in manufacturing compared with December 2007, when the economic recession began.", "Trump said that he is well on his way to keeping his signature campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border. But most of the construction so far has been replacement of existing fencing. None of it is the type of solid wall that he once talked about during the campaign, nor is it anything like the prototypes Trump commissioned early in his presidency.", "Trump: And we are building the wall. We\u2019re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. It\u2019s moving rapidly, moving very rapidly. \u2026 It\u2019s beautiful, I changed the design, it\u2019s stronger, bigger, better, and cheaper. Cheaper, a lot cheaper. You know sometimes when they don\u2019t give you the money, you have to make it cheaper, not going to happen, but it\u2019s going well.", "In a\u00a0White House meeting\u00a0on June 12, when Trump asked how \u201cthe wall\u201d is coming along, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan said that by the end of next year, DHS will have completed construction of \u201cover 400 miles, in partnership with DOD.\u201d", "But a couple caveats are in order. First, most of those 400 miles are replacement of existing wall. In May, U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u00a0reported\u00a0that since January 2017, when Trump took office, \u201capproximately 205 miles of new and updated border barriers have been funded through the traditional appropriations process and via Treasury Forfeiture Funding, of which approximately 42 miles have been completed to date.\u201d", "CBP has\u00a0identified\u00a0$6.1 billion over the last three fiscal years to fund 336 miles of new and replacement barriers, according to the agency\u2019s fact sheet. Of those 336 miles, 86 miles are \u201cnew primary wall,\u201d and another 24 miles are \u201cnew levee wall.\u201d But the majority \u2014 226 miles \u2014 are \u201cupdated\u201d barriers (either primary, secondary or vehicle barriers). Before Trump took office, there was already about 650 miles of fencing of various types along the border.", "The type of steel bollard fencing now being erected is also a far different construction design than\u00a0Trump once pursued. During the campaign, Trump talked about a solid wall of \u201cprecast planks.\u201d And early in his presidency, Trump commissioned, and later toured, prototypes of solid-wall designs. However, Congress passed spending bills that specifically funded only fencing designs deployed as of May 2017, such as steel bollards, and thereby precluding any of the\u00a0wall prototypes\u00a0that Trump commissioned.", "Trump packed two pieces of misinformation into one claim when he said, \u201cwe have never taken in 10 cents [in tariffs] from China, we would lose $500 billion a year with China.\u201d The president, as he frequently does, exaggerates the trade deficit he inherited with China \u2014 a deficit that has increased under his leadership \u2014 and he ignores the billions the U.S. has been collecting in tariffs for years.", "Trump: And remember this, and you know it as well as I do, we have never taken in 10 cents from China, we would lose $500 billion a year with China. We rebuilt China. They\u2019ve done a great job, but they took us for suckers, and that includes Obama and Biden. We took \u2014 they took us for suckers. Five hundred billion, five hundred billion. Somebody said, \u201cYou mean five hundred million.\u201d That\u2019s a lot too, right? No, $500 billion, actually more than that, I don\u2019t want to be too specific 507.", "The trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion.\u00a0Trump\u00a0has been\u00a0exaggerating\u00a0it\u00a0for years.\u00a0The trade deficit in goods and services with China was\u00a0$308.9 billion in 2016, Obama\u2019s final year in office, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The highest yearly deficit under Obama hit $333.5 billion in 2015. But the trade deficit with China has climbed higher under Trump, reaching $380.8 billion in 2018, the highest annual figure dating back to 1999,\u00a0according to BEA.", "The\u00a0total trade deficit\u00a0in goods and services with\u00a0all\u00a0countries under Obama was $503 billion in 2016. That, too, has gone up under Trump, reaching $627.7 billion in 2018.", "As we\u00a0also have written, it\u2019s not true that the U.S. has \u201cnever taken in 10 cents [in tariffs] from China.\u201d Setting aside that tariffs on Chinese goods fall on U.S. importers, and ultimately largely result in U.S. consumers paying higher prices, prior to Trump becoming president, the U.S. collected $122.6 billion in customs duties from 2007 to 2016, or $12.3 billion a year on average, according to the\u00a0U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb. Last year, the U.S. collected nearly $23 billion \u2014 an increase that reflects the higher tariffs imposed on China by the Trump administration.", "Trump falsely said that he and congressional Republicans enacted \u201cthe largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.\u201d Earlier in his speech, he called it \u201cthe biggest tax cut in history.\u201d", "Days before Trump\u00a0signed\u00a0the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law in December 2017, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation\u00a0estimated\u00a0that it would reduce tax revenues by $1.46 trillion over 10 years.", "The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\u00a0said\u00a0that an even more expensive plan Trump proposed before that one would have been only the eighth largest tax cut as a percentage of gross domestic product, and it would have been the fourth largest cut in inflation-adjusted dollars.", "The tax bill that Trump signed needed to cost roughly $6.8 trillion over 10 years to beat the 1981 tax cut under President Reagan, which was 2.9 percent of GDP,\u00a0according to\u00a0CRFB.", "Trump inherited a large number of federal judge vacancies, which he often\u00a0wrongly describes\u00a0as an (inept) gift from Obama. He did so again in his campaign kickoff speech, saying Obama \u201cwas very nice to us\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t fill the positions.\u201d In fact, the high number of vacancies left for Trump was due to a Republican-controlled Senate blocking Obama\u2019s late-term picks.", "Trump: I will soon have appointed my 145th judge. President Obama was very nice to us. He didn\u2019t fill the positions. I get there the first day. \u201cHow many judges do I have to appoint?\u201d They said, \u201cSir, 139.\u201d Now it\u2019s 145 and we\u2019ve just finished number 107, already approved sitting on the bench, how about that?", "When Trump took office, in January 2017, there were\u00a0112 federal judicial vacancies. By the end of the year, that number had grown to\u00a0144. It was at\u00a0131\u00a0as of June 19. But the high number of vacancies left for Trump was not the result of complacency by Obama, but rather opposition to Obama\u2019s judicial nominations from Senate Republicans who\u00a0took over a majority\u00a0during the last two years of Obama\u2019s presidency. Experts told us Senate Republicans confirmed far fewer judicial nominees in Obama\u2019s last two years than had been confirmed in the last two years of previous presidents. As a result, in early January 2017, just before Trump took office, there were\u00a059 federal court nominees\u00a0pending. That\u2019s why Trump inherited so many vacancies.", "In referring to the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump claimed, \u201cThey appointed 18 very angry Democrats to try to take down our incredible movement.\u201d As we\u2019ve written before, among the 17 investigators, 13 had previously registered as Democrats,\u00a0according to the\u00a0Washington Post.\u00a0Special Counsel Robert Mueller, meanwhile, was\u00a0described as a\u00a0registered Republican\u00a0by the\u00a0Post\u00a0when then-President George W. Bush appointed him FBI director in 2001.", "Trump also used an unconfirmed figure for the cost of the investigation, putting it at \u201c$40 million, probably a hell of a lot more than that.\u201d So far, we know the investigation cost $25.2 million as of Sept. 30, according to the special counsel\u2019s expenditure statements.\u00a0That figure includes $12.9 million for Department of Justice \u201ccomponents that support\u201d the special counsel\u2019s office and were \u201cexpenditures the components would have incurred for the investigations irrespective of the existence of the SCO.\u201d", "The investigation continued for nearly another six months, ending in late March. If the expenses then were similar to the expenses reported for the previous six months, total spending would be about $34 million. But we don\u2019t yet have a publicly released final amount.", "It\u2019s worth noting that the investigation also resulted in\u00a0former Trump campaign chairman\u00a0Paul Manafort agreeing to forfeit assets, including real estate properties and bank accounts worth an estimated $42 million to $46 million.", "Trump also went too far in claiming that his predecessor \u201cdid nothing\u201d about Russian interference in the 2016 election.", "Trump: And in September, just before the election, the FBI told President Obama about possible Russian interference and he did nothing because he thought that Hillary Clinton, Crooked Hillary was going to win, that\u2019s why he did nothing. He did nothing.", "As we\u2019ve written before, some Democrats have said Obama should have done more. But it\u2019s not the case that he \u201cdid nothing.\u201d Obama spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the issue in September 2016, and his administration worked with state officials from mid-August that year until Election Day to prevent voting systems from being hacked. Also, on Oct. 7, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a\u00a0public statement\u00a0that said the U.S. intelligence community is \u201cconfident\u201d that \u201cRussia\u2019s senior most officials\u201d were behind the computer hacking of the Democratic Party email systems.", "The president repeated his false boast that \u201cwe passed VA choice\u201d after politicians have been \u201ctrying to get that passed also for about 44 years.\u201d Obama signed the\u00a0bipartisan\u00a0Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, which created the\u00a0Veterans Choice Program, on Aug. 7, 2014.", "The program enabled veterans facing long waits or travel distances to VA facilities to receive care from non-VA providers.", "Trump has continued the program, and in June 2018, he signed the bipartisan\u00a0VA MISSION Act,\u00a0which provided funding to keep the Veterans Choice program for one more year and then consolidate it and other programs into a new Veterans Community Care Program.", "Trump falsely claimed that the VA \u201ccouldn\u2019t do anything\u201d about employees who mistreated veterans, prior to him signing accountability legislation.", "Trump: And we also passed VA accountability so that when somebody does bad things or mistreats, our wonderful veterans, we couldn\u2019t do anything with them. They were protected between civil service unions and all of the problems, it didn\u2019t matter, you couldn\u2019t do anything. Now, you can just say, \u201cYou\u2019re fired, get out, get out, get out.\u201d", "Trump\u00a0signed\u00a0the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act in June 2017, and it does aim to\u00a0make it easier\u00a0to remove employees based on performance or misconduct. But it was already possible for the VA to fire employees for cause prior to that law. The VA\u00a0fired more\u00a0than 2,000 employees each year going back to 2006 for discipline and performance reasons before Trump took office, according to data the department reported to the Office of Personnel Management.", "The president touched on one of his favorite subjects: the cleanliness of the nation\u2019s air and water.", "Trump:\u00a0And something I want to make clear to the media, we have among the cleanest and sharpest, crystal-clean, you\u2019ve heard me say it, I want crystal-clean air and water, anywhere on Earth. We are creating a future of American energy independence and yet our air and water are the cleanest they\u2019ve ever been by far.", "We\u2019ve written about these sorts of\u00a0claims\u00a0repeatedly,\u00a0most recently\u00a0when Piers Morgan interviewed Trump during the president\u2019s visit to the U.K. Over the decades, the U.S. has generally made progress on reducing pollution. But there is little evidence to suggest that America\u2019s water and air have substantially improved since Trump took office.", "On air quality, for example, the existing Environmental Protection Agency data is mixed at best. The\u00a0average national air pollutant concentrations for sulfur dioxide and ozone got\u00a0a bit better\u00a0between 2016 and 2017, but particulate matter got worse. The number of\u00a0days with unhealthy levels of air pollutants for sensitive groups also increased, from\u00a0701 days in 2016 to 729 days in 2017, and was well above 2014\u2019s low of 599 days. With so few data points, and lacking 2018 data, which is not yet available, it\u2019s difficult to make much of these trends. But they do not indicate that the air is the cleanest it\u2019s \u201cever been by far.\u201d", "In terms of rankings, the most recent\u00a0Environmental Performance Index\u00a0put the U.S. in 10th for air quality, and 29th for water and sanitation, although for drinking water, America tied for first with nine other nations. On wastewater treatment, which the EPI website\u00a0explains\u00a0can have impacts on human health and the ecosystem,\u00a0the U.S. came in at number 39, behind most of the Western world.", "Trump repeated a well-worn claim from the 2016 campaign, claiming that his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, \u201cdecide[d] that they\u2019re not going to give\u201d 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena and \u201cdeleted and acid washed\u201d them, \u201cwhich is very expensive.\u201d\u00a0Trump is referring to\u00a031,830 emails\u00a0that Clinton\u2019s lawyers had deemed personal and, per State Department policy, did not have to be turned over to the government.", "The emails were deleted in 2015 by an employee of the server management company after Clinton received a subpoena related to a Republican investigation into the 2012 deaths of four Americans in Benghazi. There\u2019s no evidence that Clinton knew that the emails were deleted after the subpoena was issued.", "Trump: If you want to know how the system is rigged, just compare how they came after us for three years with everything they have, versus the free pass they gave to Hillary and her aides after they set up an illegal server, destroyed evidence deleted and acid washed 33,000 e-mails, exposed classified information, and turned the State Department into a pay-for-play cash machine. \u2026 [T]he simplest thing, they get a subpoena from the United States Congress and they decide that they\u2019re not going to give it so Lindsey Graham, they delete and they acid wash, which is very expensive. \u2026 Nobody does it, they acid wash those emails, never to be seen again, but we may find them somewhere deep in the State Department.", "As we\u2019ve written before, in December 2014, Clinton gave the State Department 30,490 work-related emails. According to FBI notes of its investigation, a Clinton attorney in 2014 told Platte River Networks, the company managing Clinton\u2019s private server, that Clinton had preserved her work-related emails and \u201cdecided she no longer needed access to any of her e-mails older than 60 days.\u201d But a PRN employee didn\u2019t delete the other 31,830 emails from the server until March 2015, after the Republican-led committee subpoena.", "The\u00a0FBI said that PRN used BleachBit, a free software program, to delete the emails, not a \u201cvery expensive\u201d process, as Trump claims.", "The president said \u201cwe may find [the deleted emails] somewhere deep in the State Department.\u201d In fact, the FBI recovered about 14,900 emails that weren\u2019t part of the work-related emails Clinton turned over.\u00a0On Sept. 7, 2016, government officials said 30 of those emails were related to Benghazi, but only one had been previously undisclosed.

Nevertheless, similar figures were presented to Trump at an\u00a0opioid meeting\u00a0on June 12, so we suspect Trump is thinking of overdose deaths. Those numbers, however, were for all drug overdose deaths, not just those involving opioids.", "In that meeting, Assistant Secretary for Health\u00a0Brett Giroir\u00a0presented the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures for overdose deaths from any drug, which compared the past year\u2019s predicted tally of drug overdose deaths as of November 2018 to the same figure in November 2017.", "Giroir, June 12:\u00a0Nationwide, overdose deaths have now fallen 4.4 percent over the past year.

Of these, nearly all show a decline in opioid-related deaths, but only two are as large as the president suggests. Oklahoma saw a 24 percent drop, while Washington, D.C., saw a 17.5 percent decrease. The next closest is the state of New York, which had an 11.2 percent decline.", "Nationally, when calculated the same way as the 4.4 percent decline in total overdose deaths, the drop in\u00a0opioid-related deaths is 2.1 percent.", "It\u2019s possible more locales have experienced significant drops in opioid-related overdose deaths, and that those figures might more closely match what Trump emphasized in his speech, but we are unaware of such data. We reached out to the White House to find the source for Trump\u2019s numbers and did not receive a reply.", "Trump said that the Democrats who are co-sponsors\u00a0of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation in Congress \u201cwant to end Medicare as we know it and terminate the private health insurance of 180 million Americans who love their health insurance.\u201d The bills call for expanding Medicare into a national health insurance program that covers everyone. So, the plan would \u201cend Medicare as we know it,\u201d but by expanding benefits \u2014 adding\u00a0dental, hearing and vision coverage and instituting no premiums or copays, except for prescription drugs \u2014 and expanding coverage.\u00a0Private insurance, which does cover nearly 180 million people now, would be eliminated under the plan introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, with the exception of possibly limited private insurance to cover the few benefits that the new universal system wouldn\u2019t, and those policyholders would instead have health coverage under a new national Medicare program.", "Trump vowed: \u201cAnd we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. Always, always.\u201d But he, and Republicans in Congress, has not supported protections that go as far as those in the Affordable Care Act.", "Under the\u00a0ACA, insurers\u00a0can\u2019t deny coverage\u00a0or charge more based on health status. Republican health care bills debated in 2017 offered some preexisting condition provisions, but not such a blanket protection. For instance, as we\u2019ve written before, the House Republican bill said states could get a waiver to allow insurers to charge higher premiums based on health status for one year for those who had a lapse in their insurance coverage.", "The Trump administration also has sided with the plaintiffs in a Texas lawsuit seeking to find the ACA unconstitutional.
