["The claim was published by a New Zealand-based Facebook user here. The post has been shared over 270 times.", "The post features an image of a tweet that reads: \u201cAny vaccine that needs to be shipped and stored at -80 degrees isn\u2019t a vaccine. It\u2019s a transfection agent, kept alive so it can infect your cells and transfer genetic material. Don\u2019t let them fool you. This is genetic manipulation of humans on a massive scale. Shut it down.\u201d", "The Facebook user\u2019s caption reads: \u201cWorth some serious consideration. When the doctors speak out, perhaps you should listen.\u201d", "The image\u00a0was also shared hundreds of times by other Facebook users around the world; for examples see here and here.", "While it\u2019s unclear which vaccine the claim is referring to, the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech requires storage temperatures between -70\u00b0C and -80\u00b0C.", "The vaccine, which the companies say has an efficacy rate of over 90%, is a Messenger RNA-based vaccine that uses genetic material, not viral proteins, to trigger an immune response.", "\u201cOnce mRNA in a vaccine is inside of the body\u2019s cells, the cells use their genetic machinery to translate the genetic information and produce the antigens\u201d that are \u201crecognized by the immune system which generates a response,\u201d Pfizer explained.", "However, the Facebook post\u2019s claim that the vaccine can \u201ctransfer genetic material\u201d and is a \u201cgenetic manipulation of humans\u201d is false, according to experts.", "The mRNA vaccine can \u201cnever, ever, ever, enter the genome,\u201d Dr Kirsty Short, a research fellow at the University of Queensland\u2019s School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, told AFP in an interview on November 27.", "\u201cThe reason is because our genome is made of DNA and this genetic material is not DNA, but RNA -- and a rule of biology is that an RNA cannot insert itself into a DNA genome,\u201d she explained.", "Professor Helen Petoussis-Harris, a vaccinologist at the University of Auckland, also said that \u201cRNA cannot alter a person's genome\u201d.", "The mRNA vaccine requires extra cold storage because RNA is less stable and degrades in warmer temperatures, as noted here in Science magazine.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
