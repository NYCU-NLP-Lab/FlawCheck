The announcement of the rally's location also sparked controversy because Tulsa was the site of the 1921 massacre of hundreds of Black people by a white mob.", "The ad also placed the location for the gig at \"Third St near Denver Ave,\" which is across the street from the Bok Center where Trump's rally will be held. The ad also offered $10 as compensation, but it's unclear whether that amount is hourly, or for one day of work.", "While many factors connect the ad to the location and date of the Trump rally, Snopes is unable to contact the original source for the ad, and thus can't determine whether this was an attempt to hire actors with minority backgrounds to hold up signs at the rally.", "The ad was taken down by Craigslist administrators on June 15, 2020. Snopes was unable to contact the person who posted the ad, but has contacted Craigslist for comment, and will update this post if we receive a response.", "As of June 15, the page said \"This posting is being held for review.\" On June 16, it was flagged for removal, presumably for a terms of use violation:", "Social media posts calling out supposed Craigslist ads that solicit paid actors to show up as supporters frequently pop up before Trump rallies.
