["GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (left) is seeking a third term in the 2018 elections. State schools chief Tony Evers hopes to win the Democratic nomination to run against him.", "Since shortly after Republican Scott Walker became governor in 2011, Democrats have claimed that he cut $1 billion or more in state funding for public schools.", "Now, with Walker seeking a third term, the billion-dollar attacks are back.", "One was made by Tony Evers, who, as state schools superintendent, would seem to be in a good position to know. Evers is one of a slew of Democrats hoping to win the August 2018 primary election in order to challenge Walker in November.", "Evers was asked in a March 23, 2018, Wausau radio interview about a recent increase in funding Walker had approved for kindergarten through 12th grade schools. Evers replied by saying:", "In K through 12, I think it\u2019s a one-year flash. Governor Walker has taken over a billion dollars from the public schools and it hasn\u2019t been replaced. This year, a little bit of an anomaly \u2026.", "Some of the other Democratic candidates for governor, including Mahlon Mitchell and Kelda Helen Roys, have made similar attacks.", "There\u2019s no question that, despite recent funding increases, Walker earlier made significant cuts to school funding.", "But has Walker \"taken\" over $1 billion from public schools?", "Not in the way most people would think of a funding cut.", "Evers\u2019 evidence", "To back Evers\u2019 statement, his campaign provided calculations of \"total educational cost\" figures. They indicate school funding is down a total of more than $1 billion since 2010-\u201911 -- the final state fiscal year under Walker\u2019s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle.", "But those figures count federal, state and local sources of school funding.", "So, let\u2019s go to a more direct measure -- state money allocated in the state budget for K-12 schools.", "State funding of schools", "When we posed Evers\u2019 claim to the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the bureau provided us these GPR (general purpose revenue) figures.
