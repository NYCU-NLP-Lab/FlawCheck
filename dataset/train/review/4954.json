Johnny Carson turned and asked him how it felt to be the greatest guitarist ever. Hendrix quickly responded: \"I don't know. You'd have to ask Phil Keaggy.\"", "Other versions of the same quote have long circulated involving different musicians, such as a July 2013 post in which Hendrix was reported as\u00a0saying\u00a0of Rory Gallagher:", "Rory was the best. Walk on hot coals from Irish Tour. Just sit back and listen, nobody else could play it like that. When Jimi Hendrix was asked whats it feel like to be the best guitarist in the world he said \"You better ask Rory Gallagher\" John Lennon went to see Rory and said \"I have seen the future of Rock n Roll, its Rory Gallagher\" Just listen!", "While Prince is regarded as a fine musician, he wasn't necessarily seen as being in the top echelon of world-class guitarists by his fellow axe men.
