Further, Nancy Reagan's dress featured in the advertisement picture was from 1981, not 1985.", "The Washington Post reported in 1985 that \"the actual price paid by Mrs. Reagan is a private matter, adjusted by the designers because of the exposure given their designs when she wears them.\" However, the Post looked to industry sources and confirmed that \"the costs, at retail, for the clothes Mrs. Reagan plans to wear to the major inaugural festivities, excluding some accessories, would be $46,000.\"", "The Reagan White House declined to comment to the Post about the amount paid for the first lady's inaugural ball dress and other products.
