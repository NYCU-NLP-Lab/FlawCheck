["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on February 11, 2020", "Sen. Bernie Sanders claimed there was a \u201chuge voter turnout\u201d among young caucusgoers in Iowa this year, saying the turnout was \u201ceven higher than Obama\u2019s extraordinary victory in 2008.\u201d In fact, about 10,300 fewer young voters turned out this year than in 2008.", "Sanders, who finished in a virtual dead heat for first place with Pete Buttigieg in the contested Feb. 3 Iowa caucus, has made the argument that his grassroots campaign can defeat President Donald Trump.", "\u201cTo win, we need energy, we need excitement, we need the largest voter turnout in American history,\u201d Sanders told the Des Moines Register before the Iowa caucus. \u201cI think we are the campaign to do that.\u201d", "Even though turnout was only slightly better among Democrats in Iowa this year than it was four years ago, Sanders has repeatedly pointed to young voter turnout as a sign his campaign can bring out the youth vote in November. But he\u2019s spinning the figures.", "On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Feb. 9, Sanders said: \u201cIn Iowa, where the turnout was not as high as I wanted it to be, among young people, people under 29 years of age, we increased the voter turnout by some 33%. It\u2019s a huge voter turnout.\u201d", "On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d the Vermont senator said: \u201cThe young vote, of people under 29 years of age, increased by 33% over where it was four years ago, and was even higher than Obama\u2019s extraordinary victory in 2008.\u201d He called it a \u201cgreat omen for the 2020 campaign.\u201d", "Sanders is referring to an increase in the proportion, not the numbers, of young voters.", "It\u2019s true that an estimated 24% of this year\u2019s Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa were 29 years old or younger \u2014 a higher percentage than in 2008 (22%) and 2016 (18%), according to Edison Research, which conducts entrance polls at the Iowa caucus sites for major news organizations. But far more people participated overall in 2008, including more young people.", "\u201cIn 2016, participation in the Iowa caucuses was around 170,000 voters,\u201d Edison Research said in a blog post prior to the Iowa caucus. \u201cBut in 2008, turnout for the Democratic caucuses in Iowa reached record levels; 239,000 voters came out to participate in the caucuses that year.\u201d", "That means about 52,580 people ages 17 to 29 participated in the Iowa caucus in 2008 \u2014 which is far more than came out this year.", "As the Washington Post reported, 176,000 people participated in the Democratic caucuses in Iowa, which means about 42,240 of the Democratic caucusgoers were 29 years old or younger. That\u2019s about 11,640 more than participated in 2016 \u2014 when Sanders was also a presidential candidate \u2014 but it\u2019s about 10,300 fewer younger voters than in 2008.", "So, Sanders\u2019 claim that young voter turnout among Iowa Democrats \u201cwas even higher than Obama\u2019s extraordinary victory in 2008\u201d is pure spin.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
