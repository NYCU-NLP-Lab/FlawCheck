(L\u2019Osservatore Romano/Pool photo via AP)", "Vice President Joe Biden, the Obama administration\u2019s point person on advancing cancer research, traveled to the Vatican on April 29, 2016, to discuss technological progress in medicine.", "During that speech, Biden said, \"In the United States alone we lose more than 3,000 people a day to cancer.\" A few days later, Biden\u2019s office posted the text of that speech on Medium.", "When we looked into this statistic, we found a discrepancy.", "In the American Cancer Society\u2019s \"Cancer Facts & Figures 2016\" report, the group wrote that \"about 595,690 Americans are expected to die of cancer in 2016, which translates to about 1,630 people per day.\" That\u2019s roughly half of what Biden said.", "When we contacted Biden\u2019s office, spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak said the 3,000 figure refers to the daily number of cancer deaths in the Americas as a whole \u2014 not just in the United States \u2014 in 2012, the most recent year for which the World Health Organization has full data. We were able to verify that statistic here; officially, the number is 1.3 million annually, or just over 3,000 per day.", "Biden\u2019s office has changed the text in the Medium article to \"more than 1,600\" during the course of our reporting.", "They also inserted the following correction: \"*The initial number provided for daily cancer deaths in the United States was 3,000\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is roughly the number of daily cancer deaths across the broader Americas.\"", "Our ruling", "Biden said in his Vatican speech that \"in the United States alone we lose more than 3,000 people a day to cancer.\"", "Actually, that\u2019s the number of deaths for the Americas as a whole, not for just the United States. After we contacted Biden\u2019s office, they changed the number listed in the Medium article to the correct number, \"more than 1,600.\"", "While we laud speedy corrections, it is PolitiFact\u2019s policy to rate statements on the Truth-O-Meter in their initial version, which, in this case, could not be corrected in its original setting, a high-profile international speech.
