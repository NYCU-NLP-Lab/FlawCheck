It noted, for example, that seat belt use reduces injuries and that the blood-alcohol limit in Wisconsin is 0.08.", "But this distractions stat stood out:", "\"1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving.\"", "Amid all the potential causes for a crash \u2014 weather, impaired driving, other technology-related distractions \u2014 does texting really account for a full 25%?", "Let\u2019s see if Evers\u2019 took a wrong turn.", "The National Safety Council, a nonprofit organization chartered by Congress, says distracted driving of any kind is difficult to track since local authorities don\u2019t consistently record crash data.", "The council used to track texting and driving, but stopped doing so in 2015 with the proliferation of in-vehicle technology (such as entertainment systems, navigation and phone-linked operating systems).", "\"The nature of distracted driving has changed with the explosion of built-in dashboard systems,\" said Ken Kolosh, the safety council\u2019s manager of statistics.", "The council has long used crash stats from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which compiles crash reports from local police agencies around the country.

And cellphone use is a core piece of that.", "But the statistic he used to make that point is wrong.", "Experts say we don\u2019t have enough data to show how many crashes are currently related to texting.
