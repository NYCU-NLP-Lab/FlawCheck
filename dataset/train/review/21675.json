If one listens carefully, people in the video can be heard talking in Bengali.", "According to The Indian Express, the incident took place in August 2015 when Government Railway Police (GRP) intercepted 63 children who were travelling to a madrasa in Pune for training. The children were detained based on a tip-off from officials of CINI Asha Child Welfare Society.", "According to a statement issued by then Chairman of State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Asokendu Sengupta, the children were taken into custody and a stay was arranged for them at Purnea by the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). In another statement given to The Hindu, Sengupta had said, \u201cWe will follow the provisions laid down by the law in this case. If documents of children being admitted to madrasa will be provided, the CWC will release them. The children will also be released if parents want that them to return home\u201d.", "\u201cMeanwhile, top officials of Kolkata Police have said that the children would be released and sent back to Bihar by Monday night itself, to avoid any untoward incident\u201d, stated a report published by DNA on August 3, 2015.", "However, agitators protesting against the detention of the students blamed the police \u2013 \u201cIt is unfair on their part.

They were little children who were going to study\u201d.", "Alt News contacted Sengupta for further details of the case. He said, \u201cAs far as my knowledge goes, first of all, the incident is old and we took the decision based on a report by the Childline Sealdah. In this particular case, some children accompanied by one or two senior members were going from one place to another without any documents. That\u2019s why I asked the childline to not to allow them to move any further. According to JJ [Juvenile Justice] Act, CWC is the legal custodian of all the children (children in need of care & protection, CNCP) of their respective districts. So the boys needed to be sent to their respective [district] CWC authorities for identification. The protestors started a clamour that the children were apprehended only with the intention to stop them from taking religious training. That was not the case at all. I would like to say that our CM [Mamta Banerjee] took a very firm stand and supported me wholeheartedly and didn\u2019t allow the local administration to go against my wishes\u201d.", "Clarifying the doubts over the children\u2019s release, he added, \u201cThe children were taken without their knowledge and consent.
