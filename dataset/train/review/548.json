["On Friday, January 9, Indian news outlets reported that former Pakistani diplomat, \u201cAgha\u201d Hilaly has admitted that the February 26, 2019 Balakot airstrike saw 300 casualties on the Pakistani side. The aftermath of the Balakot airstrike had given rise to media reports placing the casualties at 300 citing \u201ctop government sources\u201d even as Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the casualty figure will not be provided. International media had subsequently reported that no one had died in the strikes.", "The story was reported by ANI, Republic, The Times of India, Moneycontrol, WION, Hindustan Times, NE Now, Odisha TV, Jagran, Swarajya, Lokmat, Oneindia, Deccan Herald, Business Today, Livemint, DNA, The Quint, News18 India, HW News, India Today, CNBC TV18, ABP News,  NDTV, India TV among others. Many of these reports are republished ANI story.", "This slideshow requires JavaScript.", "The reports say that in a TV news debate Hilaly said, \u201cIndia crossed the international border and did an act of war in which at least 300 were reported dead. Our target was different from theirs. We targeted their high command. That was our legitimate target because they are men of the military. We subconsciously accepted that a surgical strike \u2014 a limited action \u2014 did not result in any casualty. Now we have subconsciously told them that, whatever they will do, we\u2019ll do only that much and won\u2019t escalate.\u201d", "We looked for the debate on YouTube and found that it was uploaded by HUM news as part of a program called \u201cAgenda Pakistan\u201d. The topic of the debate was \u201cBy using the vocabulary of the enemy (in this context \u201csurgical strike\u201d) is Pakistan making its own case weak?\u201d. Zafar Hilaly begins to answer this question at around 4:17 minutes. At about 5:14 minutes he says, \u201cWhat you did, India, was an act of war. India ne jo kiya, international boundary ko cross karke ek act of war. Jisme kam se kam 300 logo ko unhone marna tha.\u201d In English, this translates to, \u201cWhat you did, India was an act of war. By crossing the international boundary India committed an act of war in which they intended to kill at least 300 people.\u201d", "In the very next sentence at 5:29 minutes diplomat states that the Indian operation had failed \u2014 \u201cIttifaqan vo nahi mare, humne [India ne] ek football field ko bomb kiya. (Coincidentally, they [Pakistani people] did not die and India bombed a football field.)\u201d", "In fact, Hilaly was also speaking about India\u2019s intention to kill 300 on the Pakistani side prior to the portion of the segment made viral. At about 4:30 minutes, he states, \u201cAapne aake ek madrasa ko, bakaul aapka intention ye tha ki ek madrasa mein jis mein 300 bachche bakaul aapke padh rahe the, udhar aake aapne strike karna tha. Iske maane 300 logo ko maarne ka irada rakha tha aapne. Vo the nahi, vo galat tha, vo hua nahi. Isliye ek football field mein jaake apna bomb phek diya humne. (It is said that your intention was to strike at a madrasa where 300 children were studying. This means that your intention was to kill 300 people. They were not there, this [information] was wrong, it [strike] did not happen so you threw your bomb in a football field.)\u201d", "From the video transcript is clear that at no point the Pakistani diplomat admitted that there were 300 casualties in the Balakot airstrike.", "None of the media organisations referred to the original video in their reports. But Republic and NE Now embedded a video uploaded by a Twitter user. If we compare the original video with the one embedded by Republic, there is an abrupt cut around 0:7-0:9 seconds. The word \u201cmarna (to kill)\u201d sounds as if Hilaly said \u201cmara (killed)\u201d. The \u2018n\u2019 pronunciation has been edited out.", "Former Pak Diplomat Zafar admitted On Tv that in Balakot airstrike 300+ Terr0rists kiIIed and response of Pakistan was weak.pic.twitter.com/EKYGGuC9dS", "\u2014 Maverick Bharat (@Mave_Intel) January 9, 2021", "His statement right after the above claim has also been removed in the viral clip. This was where Hilaly makes the claim that the Indian operation failed and the airforce instead bombed a football field.", "Furthermore, the viral video has been inverted and screen-recorded. The original video shows the damaged trees of Balakot and the doctored video shows a picture of PM Narendra Modi in military fatigue. The doctored video also doesn\u2019t feature the names of the people in the panel and the border is pink unlike the white border in the original video.", "Zafar Hilaly himself confirmed that his statement was \u201ccut, spliced and edited\u201d.", "The extraordinarily extent to which the Indian Govt has gone to cut, splice and edit the tape of my Hum TV appearance suggests their desperation to prove what they failed to do, namely, lend credence to Modi\u2019s lies about Balacot and his farcical claims.", "\u2014 Zafar Hilaly (@ZafarHilaly) January 10, 2021", "The Times Of India has an item based on the cut, spliced and edited tape of my Hum TV talk. Lacking first hand proof re Balacot, Modi is desperate for 3rd party confirmation for his lies and, not finding any, is doing a terrible job making it up.", "\u2014 Zafar Hilaly (@ZafarHilaly) January 10, 2021", "Nearly every Indian media organisation reported that former Pakistani diplomat Zafar Hilaly admitted that the Indian airstrike killed 300 people in Balakot. The reports were based on a clipped and doctored panel discussion shared on social media.", "Donate Now", "Kalim is a journalist with a keen interest in tech, misinformation, culture, etc", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
