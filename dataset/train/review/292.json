At best, you'll just be asked to remove the item, but at worst you could be barred from entering your polling place. Wear literally ANYTHING ELSE.", "It is\u00a0true that New York State voting laws contain a provision concerning \"passive electioneering\", and rumors about voter suppression due to such laws circulated in 2008 as well. \u00a0However,\u00a0there is\u00a0no reason that enforcement of it would affect only those who were\u00a0casting ballots for any particular\u00a0candidate.", "At the same\u00a0time, New York State's Board of Elections was inundated with calls from worried voters about being turned away on a technicality.
