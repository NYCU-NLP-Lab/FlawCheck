["\u201cForest fires are caused by poor management. Not by climate change,\u201d says one post, shared more than 12,000 times on Facebook since September 9, 2020. It says the Creek Fire and other blazes in California are the result of failures to clear \u201cbrush and dead overgrown trees\u201d from the land.", "A second post, also shared more than 12,000 times on the social network, attributes the fires to \u201cbad forestry practices\u201d and \u201cnot the climate change hoax.\u201d", "And a third post writes off global warming as a factor in the wildfires, blaming a \u201ctotal lack of forest maintenance\u201d for the devastation.", "The posts reflect a political divide on the disaster. Democrat-run California is sharply at odds with Trump, a Republican and climate change skeptic.", "One Facebook post shared cartoons suggesting that Democrats and \u201cleft-wing environmentalists\u201d have blocked the \u201clogging or brush clearing\u201d that has turned forestlands into \u201cdangerous firetraps.\u201d", "The online posts mirror comments from Trump who, during a visit to Sacramento, California, attributed fires there and along the West Coast to \u201cforest management\u201d and failures by local authorities to rake forest floors and clear dead timber.", "In a testy exchange with officials in California, who asserted that climate change had contributed towards the fires, Trump responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think science knows, actually.\u201d", "But independent research endorsed by the federal government in the US National Climate Assessment in 2018 says otherwise. The study said that \u201cclimate change is altering ecosystems and their services through major vegetation shifts and increases in the area burned by wildfire\u201d in the southwest.", "Experts on climate, fires and weather patterns told AFP that the blazes in California, Oregon and Washington were down to multiple factors, but that global warming had played a central role.", "Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate professor at Stanford University, cited the National Climate Assessment from two years ago, and said poor forest management alone could not explain the tenfold increase in land being burned across the western US these past four decades.", "\u201cIt is not true that global warming is playing no role,\u201d he said by phone.", "\u201cResearch indicates that around half of that increase in area burned is due to long-term warming through the effects of temperature on the dryness of the vegetation.\u201d", "Meanwhile, Diffenbaugh added, more people are moving from towns to rural areas, increasing the likelihood of accidental fires -- highlighted by the ongoing El Dorado blaze in southern California, which was triggered by a firework at a family event.", "Michael Goss, an earth sciences researcher at Stanford University, said via email that \u201cwarmer, drier conditions brought about by climate change, and associated drying of fuels, absolutely increases the risk of fast, destructive wildfire spread in California.\u201d", "And Bruce Riordan, director of the Bay Area Climate Adaptation Network in northern California, said by email that while some fires are raging through woodlands \u201cmany have been in grasslands and other vegetation regimes that have nothing to do with forest management.\u201d", "West Coast infernos have burned more than five million acres this year and killed dozens of people.", "Scott Stephens, a fire science professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said via email that better forest management \u201cwould enable more of our forests in California to withstand fire and climate change.\u201d", "Still, he added: \u201cClimate change is certainly real and is impacting fire here.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
