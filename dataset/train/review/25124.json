["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "In a recent guest column in The Oregonian, Metro president Tom Hughes talked up the benefits of spending public money on urban renewal projects. One of his examples was the well-groomed Pearl District in Portland\u2019s Northwest quarter.\n\n\"In Portland, urban renewal-based investments in roads, parks, sidewalks and streetcars spurred $3 billion of investment in private projects that repaired dilapidated buildings and created new ones on vacant and underutilized land in the Pearl District. Today, the Pearl supports thousands of homes -- 20 percent affordable -- and many new middle-class jobs.\"\n\nA PolitiFact Oregon reader wondered if the part about affordable housing was true. We did too. One-fifth isn\u2019t that big, but it might make us think twice about painting the entire neighborhood as filthy rich.\n\nLet\u2019s back up. In 1998, the Portland City Council created the River District Urban Renewal area -- which includes the Pearl -- gradually transforming a cluster of empty buildings into a bustling neighborhood. Old Town/Chinatown, Tanner Creek and Union Station are included in this district.\n\nCity leaders were concerned about the effect of development on housing, so the next year, they endorsed a housing strategy that called for 5,000 new housing units by 2020. Here are the goals:", "We know we\u2019re throwing a lot of numbers at you. But please, bear with us while we tackle the question of how the city met those goals. \u00a0\n\nAccording to the PDC\u2019s latest report, in 2007, about a quarter of the 7,400 units in the River District could be afforded by households in the lower two income brackets. The affordability percentage climbed to 40 percent with families up to 80 percent of median income.\n\nBut remember, these figures include Old Town/Chinatown, a grittier neighborhood by the river that has long served the poor and homeless. In fact, much of the river district\u2019s low-income diversity comes from Old Town/Chinatown, with 97 percent of 1,338 housing units open to people at 80 percent or less of median income.\n\nOn the opposite end, only 16 percent of 3,156 units in the \"Central Pearl\" are open to households in the three lower income brackets. In fact, more than 70 percent of homes in the Pearl are for households at 120 percent or more of median income. So it\u2019s as we suspected. The Pearl caters to the wealthy!\n\nMore important to PolitiFact Oregon, these figures don\u2019t back up Hughes, who specifically cited housing in the Pearl.\n\nWe turned to Jim Middaugh, Metro\u2019s communications director. He said Hughes was trying to make the point that development in urban renewal areas, including the Pearl, had \"a broad set of benefits for all income classes,\" including housing. Middaugh also argued for including Tanner Creek as part of the Pearl in our analysis.", "We re-considered. The Tanner Creek neighborhood at the north end of the River District is not as built up as the area between Burnside and Lovejoy, but it has attracted in recent years a Safeway supermarket, a chic park with a water feature, and several high-end restaurants that claim to be in the Pearl.\n\nIf we include the nearly 1,200 units in Tanner Creek, the percentage of homes affordable to low and very low income households grows to 15. The percentage grows to 23 if we include households earning up to 80 percent of median income. That would back up Hughes\u2019 statement.", "We know others might view the \"Pearl\" in Hughes\u2019 statement as the development cluster along Burnside and not the area north of Lovejoy.", "But in PolitiFact Oregon's humble opinion, we think it's fair to include Tanner Creek as part of the Pearl District because of its design layout, proximity and amenities. Dave Davis, president of the Pearl District Neighborhood Association, concurs that Tanner Creek is solidly within his group\u2019s boundaries. In fact, the residential Pearl District stretches from Burnside to the river, and Broadway to Interstate-405, according to a map.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True, and that\u2019s not meant as a knock on Hughes. What he said is accurate, but it needs a tiny clarification on what is included in the Pearl.", "Return to OregonLive to comment on this story.", "Tom Hughes, \"Urban renewal's power: Public investments boost prosperity for all,\" Nov. 2, 2011\nPortland Development Commission, \"River District Housing Implementation Strategy 2006 Annual Report,\" June 2007\nPortland Development Commission,\"River District Housing Implementation Strategy Annual Report,\" March 2005\nPortland Development Commission, \"2008 Central City Housing Inventory,\"\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, \"Affordable Housing,\" Sept. 13, 2011\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, \"HUD's Public Housing Program\"\nCity of Portland, \"Chapter 30.01 Affordable Housing Preservation\"\nEmails from Maileen Hamto, Portland Housing Bureau, Nov. 7, 14, 2011\nInterview with Jim Middaugh, Nov. 16, 2011\nInterview with Dave Davis, Nov. 18, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
