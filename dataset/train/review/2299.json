It occurs in every election.", "More than 24 million people voted in the election in the states that Bartiromo cites, making the 450,000 people who Powell says apparently voted for Biden and skipped the rest of the ballot less than 2%.", "We weren\u2019t able to verify the exact figures Bartiromo and Powell cited. We attempted to contact Powell about how she arrived at those numbers, but did not hear back.", "But using the New York Times elections data on Nov. 20, we did find that there were nearly 450,000 more votes cast for president in those five states than there were for the down-ballot U.S. House of Representatives races: 124,390 more votes in Pennsylvania; 117,458 more in Georgia; 31,123 more in Arizona; 115,717 more in Michigan; and 61,125 more in Wisconsin.

There is nothing at all \u2018miraculous\u2019 about some voters only being interested in voting for president,\" Burden said. \"Roll-off is most common when down ballot races are uncompetitive, but it happens even when those races are closely contested.\"", "He pointed to Pennsylvania\u2019s highly competitive 2016 U.S. Senate race as an example. The presidential race attracted 6.12 million votes in the battleground state, but the Senate race tallied 64,000 fewer votes.", "The Federal Election Commission provides vote totals for past elections that include tables that show how many voters made selections for the Senate, the House of Representatives and, when applicable, the president.", "In 2016, for example, 136,669,276 people voted for president. About 5 million fewer \u2014 131,652,452 \u2014 voted for a member of the U.S. House.", "In past presidential elections, in almost every state cited in Powell\u2019s claim, certified elections data shows there have been several thousand more votes for president than for other races down the ballot.

Tabulation results for early and election day voting, Stewart said, showed an undervote rate of 0.39% for both Biden and Trump.", "\"Thus far there's no evidence of unusual numbers of over or under votes, and indeed, it looks significantly lower than in 2016,\" Stewart wrote.", "Powell said at least \"450,000 ballots in the key states that miraculously only have a mark for Joe Biden on them, and no other candidate.\" We could not confirm that figure, but it does seem in line with the difference between the numbers of total votes cast in the presidential race and those cast in the down ballot House races in those states. We don\u2019t see evidence that all of these votes were for Biden, however.", "Powell presented this unremarkable undervoting statistic as evidence of fraud.
