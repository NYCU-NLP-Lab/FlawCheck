Is the state\u2019s homeless crisis really as severe as Steinberg claimed?", "We set out on a fact check.", "Our research", "This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve looked at Steinberg\u2019s statements on homelessness.", "In July, during his push for a statewide \u2018right to shelter\u2019 law, we examined his claims about the share of unsheltered homeless people in California compared with New York City \u2014 and on the soaring rate of homeless deaths in two major cities in the state. We found his assertions were generally correct, but needed a few clarifications.", "To verify Steinberg\u2019s statement about 90,000 unsheltered people, we reviewed a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development study called the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. Housing experts consider it the most comprehensive and current set of estimates for homeless populations nationwide.", "Released in December last year, the report shows California had nearly 130,000 homeless people both sheltered and unsheltered, a tally from a point-in-time count conducted in January 2018. That was the most of any state, far ahead of second-place New York with about 92,000 homeless people. Of course, more people live in California than any other state.", "Of California\u2019s total, 89,543 were unsheltered, meaning they were not living in an emergency shelter or similar residence.\u00a0Instead, they were found on the street, in a vehicle or abandoned building.", "This matches Steinberg\u2019s statement.", "At nearly 69 percent, California\u2019s share of unsheltered homeless people was the highest in the nation, the report found. Oregon had the second-highest share at about 62 percent.", "Steinberg\u2019s spokesperson said the mayor relied on the HUD report.", "California has the nation's highest rate of unsheltered homeless people, according to the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress.", "\u2018Double digit increases\u2019 in homelessness", "Chris Martin, a legislative advocate on homelessness at the nonprofit Housing California, said Steinberg used the best figure available.", "He said a new HUD report is expected in December.", "Based on early survey results around the state this year, Martin said he anticipates at least a 10 percent jump in California\u2019s overall homeless population when the report comes out. He did not have an estimate on how the unsheltered population might change.", "\"It\u2019s bad,\" Martin said, of the overall totals. \"I\u2019d say most communities around the state are seeing a double-digit increase.\"", "Martin pointed to one research group, HUB for Urban Initiatives, that estimates there\u2019s been a nearly 24 percent spike in homelessness statewide from 2017 to 2019.", "He noted that the federal homeless counts represent a snapshot-in-time of a community\u2019s homeless population.", "\"We usually estimate that two to three times the point-in-time number are homeless during the course of the year,\" added Sharon Rapport, director of the California State Policy Corporation for Supportive Housing, develops housing policy and makes housing loans.", "While the federal reports are issued each year, Rapport said the odd year counts are more comprehensive because not every jurisdiction did a survey in 2018.
