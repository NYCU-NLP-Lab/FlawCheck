["\u201cA Vaccine Or A Population Management Story,\u201d says the caption for a clip from the film watched tens of thousands of times on Facebook.", "The clip paints a misleading picture of the efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, questioning the research timeline and the recompense available in the rare case that a person suffered a serious side effect from the immunization.", "Thirty seconds into the clip, Arthur Caplan says: \u201cThe shortest time anybody\u2019s ever found a vaccine against any disease that I\u2019m familiar with is about seven years. The average time is 20. To be talking about a magic bullet coming in months, it borders on the absurd.\u201d", "It then cuts to interviews of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, talking about shorter time frames.", "Caplan, the director of the division of medical ethics at the New York University School of Medicine, said by phone that he was unaware he was in the film, though the quote, which he gave to CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d program \u201cseems correct.\u201d", "\u201cI am not worrying quite as much about dangerous vaccines being released, what I am worried about is that we don't find an efficacious vaccine that will let us get back to work and school,\u201d he said.", "There are, however, some reasons for optimism.", "\u201cThere are over 160 vaccines being examined for this one virus. That has never happened. We never had that many companies and science groups all working to find something at the same time,\u201d Caplan said.", "\u201cAnd also, we have never spent so much money so fast to find a vaccine that works. So those are reasons to be hopeful.\u201d", "But he did caution that \u201cthe first vaccine is not gonna be the end of COVID,\u201d saying that vaccines are likely to be only partially effective, and some people may not take them.", "AFP Fact Check previously debunked false claims about vaccine safety amid the accelerated timeline for development of a COVID-19 immunization.", "It also includes a segment from CBS News in which Norah O\u2019Donnell asks Bill Gates about the side effects from the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which is currently in clinical trials, with the anchor saying that 80 percent of participants experienced a systemic side effect.", "However, a systemic effect is any adverse impact that is not at the injection site.", "According to the National Institutes of Health, \u201cNone of the participants experienced serious side effects from the vaccine. However, more than half reported fatigue, headache, chills, or pain at the injection site. These symptoms were most common following the second vaccination and in those who received the highest vaccine dose.\u201d", "One minute and 20 seconds into the clip, Mary Holland of the non-profit anti-vaccine advocacy organization Children\u2019s Health Defense, claims, \u201cIf you take COVID-19 vaccines you are absolutely on your own. If you\u2019re permanently injured, if you lose your job, if your health care expenses go through the roof, tough luck.\u201d", "This is false, according to David Bowman, spokesman for the US Health Resources and Services Administration.", "COVID-19 vaccines, which are still in clinical trials, have been designated by the government for coverage under the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP).", "Bowman explained by email that the CICP process is administrative, not legal, and a person must request compensation within one year to be eligible.", "\u201cEven though a CICP injury table for COVID-19 countermeasures has not been established yet, requesters who demonstrate that their injury occurred as the direct result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure based on compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific evidence, are eligible for compensation,\u201d Bowman said.", "AFP's\u00a0full debunk of the film \u201cPlandemic: Indoctornation\u201d\u00a0is available here.", "Manon Jacob\u00a0contributed to this article.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
