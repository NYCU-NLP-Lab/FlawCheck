The Parler account seems to indicate the user lives in the Buckhead area of Atlanta. The woman\u2019s Facebook page says she lives in Baltimore.", "Both posts have the exact same words: \u201cHere\u2019s my Georgia Runoff Ballot. The Ballot says I voted for Loeffler and Perdue BUT the QR Code says I voted for Democrats. Scanned it into a Dominion Voting Machine.

Instead, the code tells the counting machine which bubbles would have been filled in had the machine received a traditional paper ballot with bubbles.", "The QR code is encrypted, Sterling said. This prevents people from using commonly available cellphone apps to scan the code and see what it says, he said.", "For further security, Sterling said, the ballots are made with a special paper that has security fibers embedded in it, similar to the fibers embedded in paper money to prevent counterfeiting. During election audits, the ballots are checked for the fibers to verify no counterfeit ballots have been slipped into the machines, he said.", "More Senate news:Where Georgia Senate runoff candidates stand on climate issues.", "It appears that whoever made the ballot photo broke the law, Fuchs said, as it is illegal to take a photo of a ballot in the polling site.
