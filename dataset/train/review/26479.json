The revelation came during a Q&A at Valdosta State University, where Trump was campaigning.", "Eyewitnesses say that around the midpoint of the forum, a first year psychology student began a question directed at Trump, by identifying herself as New Mexican. The U.S. presidential candidate immediately rolled his eyes and interrupted the young woman. \u201cOh we\u2019re definitely changing that,\u201d he said. \u201cNo please, continue. But when I get in there, New Mexico is gone.\u201d", "When asked to elaborate by the moderator, Trump opened up, revealing what his \u201cfirst act\u201d as President of the United States \u201cwill\u201d be. \u201cI mean come on, New Mexico? Are they really serious? My first day in office, I\u2019m changing that name so fast, it\u2019ll blow their sombreros straight off.\u201d", "The 19 year old student looked stunned, and asked why Trump would want to rename her home state. \u201cListen sweetie, I\u2019m here to make America great again, not Mexico. Alright?\u201d the billionaire responded sarcastically. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a real problem in that state with illegals, drugs and crime, and don\u2019t even get me started on the rapists.\u201d", "The\u00a0image at the top of the article depicted Trump announcing his bid to run for president in June 2015, and wasn't taken during an appearance at Valdosta State University in 2016.
