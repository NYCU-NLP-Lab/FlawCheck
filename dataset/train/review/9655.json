["The photo was shared on Facebook\u00a0here\u00a0on January 13, 2021. It features an image of Philippine presidential spokesperson Harry Roque.", "The photo\u2019s text overlay states: \"I stand with my previous statement that poor people have no right to choose. THEY CAN'T EVEN BUY FOOD, WHAT MORE VACCINES. DON'T BE PICKY BECAUSE YOU ARE POOR AND A BURDEN FOR THE GOVERNMENT. It's your fault you're still poor, you rely on the government for all of your needs. IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO BE PICKY DURING THE TIME OF PANDEMIC / Pres. Spokesperson Harry Roque says Filipinos who avail of the government's free vaccinations cannot choose which vaccine will be used during the immunisation campaign.\"", "The post circulated online shortly after Roque faced criticism for remarks he allegedly made about the Philippines\u2019 Covid-19 vaccination drive. This video from an official briefing on January 11 shows Roque saying Filipinos cannot be \u201cpicky\u201d about which coronavirus vaccine they receive.", "Comments from some Facebook users on the\u00a0post indicate it had misled them. One comment reads: \u201cAn insult to poor people. That we don\u2019t have the human right to choose because we are poor.\u201d", "Another said: \"Legit? he really said that? you have a link this might have been edited\".", "The image\u00a0was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook\u00a0here, here, here, here and here.", "The claim is false.", "Keyword searches on Google found the news graphic was originally published here by Philippine media organisation GMA News on January 11, 2021.", "The quote in the GMA News graphic reads: \"It's true, we have the right to good health but one cannot be picky because there are a lot of Filipinos who need to be vaccinated. One can't be choosy, but one can't also be forced inoculated.\"", "Below is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (L) and the GMA News graphic (R):", "The quote in the GMA News graphic corresponds to remarks made by Roque in this January 11 press briefing. An official transcript of the briefing contains no reference to Roque\u2019s purported quote about poor Filipinos, as claimed in the misleading posts.", "Roque\u2019s office also branded the misleading social media posts as \u201cfake news\u201d in this statement posted on Facebook on January 13, 2021.", "The statement placed the doctored news graphic side-by-side another Roque quote that sought to clarify his earlier remarks about vaccination. It states in part: \u201cWhen the vaccine arrives in February until June, one can\u2019t really be choosy\u00a0because only one vaccine would be available, and that\u2019s the one from China. If you do not want Sinovac, you won\u2019t be forced to take it.\u201d", "Roque made the clarification in this January 12 press briefing, which also does not contain the quote indicated in the doctored graphic.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
