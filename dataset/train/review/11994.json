Looting our businesses. Assaulting the elderly and burning our churches.\"", "The ad portrays multiple national Democrats as being antifa sympathizers and includes a claim that former Vice President Joe Biden was \"bailing the terrorists out of jail.\"", "We found that some Biden campaign members \u2014 not the campaign itself \u2014 donated individually to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a nonprofit that pays bail for low-income people. But there is no suggestion that the individuals who received these funds are accused of terrorism, according to Greg Lewin, interim executive director for the fund.", "RELATED: No, George Soros and his foundations do not pay people to protest", "Eagle is one of many Republicans running in an August primary to replace U.S. Rep. Francis Rooney, who is retiring from the safe GOP seat in coastal southwest Florida.", "We wanted to take a closer look at the ad\u2019s claim connecting antifa to these violent acts.", "Antifa refers to a collection of far-left, anti-fascist groups that rally against white supremacy and other causes, at times using violence. The antifa movement goes back decades, but regained attention after groups counterprotested white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.", "President Donald Trump and his allies have said that far-left groups, including antifa, are responsible for recent looting. But antifa, which is short for anti-fascist, is not an organization with an official membership, leader or base of operations. Some individuals self-identify with antifa.", "We asked Eagle\u2019s campaign for evidence that antifa was behind the violence and looting shown in the ad. Campaign manager Terry Miller responded with general statements but did not provide specific evidence.", "Miller said that U.S. Attorney General William Barr identified antifa as sowing unrest and violence during peaceful demonstrations. Barr in a May 31 statement said, \"The violence instigated and carried out by antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"", "Thousands of people have been arrested amid the nationwide protests following Floyd\u2019s death, not all for acts of violence. The number has included curfew violators, working press and others. It isn\u2019t possible to know how many were motivated by any particular political belief or association, but government intelligence reports, media reports and interviews with experts show no evidence that antifa played any significant role.", "Let\u2019s take a look at each image that flashes as Eagle makes each part of his claim:", "(Screenshot from Twitter)", "\"Killing our police\": The ad shows a picture of a tweet by Trump about David Dorn, a retired St. Louis police captain who was working security at a pawn shop June 2 when he was fatally shot.

No arrests have been made in that incident, but a police spokesperson told us that there is no evidence to suggest members of antifa are responsible.", "We found one image in Eagle\u2019s ad did show antifa supporters in Portland, Ore., but the ad omits any context.

Of roughly 80 federal charges the Post found, none cited an antifa plot. Many were arrested for minor, nonviolent offenses such as violating curfew or carrying an open container.
