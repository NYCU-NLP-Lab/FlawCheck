["\"Hypercapnia. It can be caused by rebreathing your own exhaled CO2 by wearing a mask continually,\"\u00a0reads the caption on a Facebook post shared more than 200 times since it was published on May 7, 2020.", "\"By prolonged use of masks, you are disrupting the normal airway, breathing process and inhaling excessive carbon dioxide/CO2 instead of oxygen\".", "The claim is repeated in Facebook posts shared hundreds of times\u00a0here and here. However, the posts\u00a0do not\u00a0specify a type of mask or define the \"prolonged\"\u00a0use.", "The claim surfaced in other parts of the world, including Asia. As\u00a0AFP Thailand's\u00a0fact check explains, the picture in the misleading post was originally published in the WikiJournal of Medicine and credited to its founder, Swedish physician Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m.", "However, unlike the misleading Facebook posts (below left), the original image (below right) does not claim that wearing a face mask can cause hypercapnia.", "Hypercapnia or hypercarbia is a build-up of carbon dioxide in the blood which usually happens as a result of hypoventilation, or not being able to breathe properly and get oxygen into the lungs.", "Symptoms of mild to moderate hypercapnia usually include anxiety, shortness of breath, daytime sluggishness\u00a0and headache. It can affect\u00a0people who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).", "Shabir Madhi, professor of vaccinology at South Africa's University of Witwatersrand, told AFP the prolonged wear of masks could not cause hypercapnia.", "There should be no issue \"unless you are wearing a plastic impermeable mask,\"\u00a0he said in an emailed response, adding however that care needs to be taken with very young children.", "Wolfgang Preiser, who heads\u00a0Stellenbosch University's medical virology division in South Africa, shared the same view.", "\"Certainly not if it is a proper mask and if one wears it properly. Remember surgeons have for decades been wearing masks for many hours at a time -- rare for them to pass out. And what about people in industries who wear masks day in day out?\"\u00a0he wrote in an email.", "He said that cloth masks allow gases to pass through \"very easily in both directions\", due to the fact that they\u00a0\"struggle to keep the fine particles (droplets) out\".", "\"Neither medical masks nor properly-done (DoH guidance) cloth masks will cause that [hypercapnia]\".", "Michael Herbst of the Cancer Association of South Africa also highlighted the fact that surgeons wear face masks without a problem.", "\"The average limb transplant surgery\u00a0can last between eight to 10 hours. During this time, the surgical team wear facial masks that are better fitting than the average cloth mask worn during the COVID-19 lockdown, and yet the surgeon, doing the most intricate microsurgery, remains sharp and performs his/her job proficiently,\"\u00a0he said.", "However, Herbst also\u00a0pointed to a study that looked at the relationship between headaches and the use of N95 respirators reserved for healthcare workers.", "The 2006 study surveyed healthcare workers to determine risk factors associated with the development of headaches and the continuous use of the N95 face mask.", "It found that \"healthcare providers may develop headaches following the use of the N95 face-mask\"\u00a0and that \"shorter duration of face-mask wear may reduce the frequency and severity of these headaches\".", "However,\u00a0Kenyan infectious disease epidemiologist Mark Nanyingi warned that people suffering from chronic respiratory illnesses may exert unnecessary pressure on their lungs while wearing masks.", "\u201cA person with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\u00a0can easily suffer from hypoxia or hypercapnia while wearing face masks for prolonged hours as their lungs are already under pressure and doing so they place themselves at a higher risk,\u201d he told AFP.", "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth face masks should allow for breathing without restriction and fit snugly but comfortably.", "AFP Fact Check has covered\u00a0similar claims\u00a0about the prolonged use of face masks causing hypoxia,\u00a0a lack of oxygen in the body.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
