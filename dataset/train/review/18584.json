We sorted the data using the Murder Accountability Project, which mines the FBI data. The most recent data is from 2014.", "There were 1,470 homicides reported in St. Louis from 2004-14. Of those, 795 were \"cleared.\" A cleared offense occurs when at least one person is \"arrested, charged with commission the arrest, and turned over to the court for prosecution (whether following arrest, court summons, or police notice),\" according to the FBI\u2019s website. All three of those requirements must be met for an offense to be considered cleared.", "Basically, a little over 54 percent of homicides were \"cleared\" in St. Louis between 2004 and 2014. That\u2019s in line with what Hanaway said.", "We'll note two caveats.", "First, there is a technical difference between homicide and murder. James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University said that murder is more restrictive term, and homicide includes any killing of a person, even an execution by the state. With murder, there is intent to cause bodily harm, however he said the terms are used interchangeably.", "Taking this into account, the number Hanaway is touting may be a little different from the data, but David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay\u00a0College of Criminal Justice, said using the word murder in place of homicide is \"completely mainstream.\"", "\"These terms are used so interchangeably that often the formal authorities don\u2019t even make the distinction.\" Kennedy said.", "Second, Kennedy also said the rate of unsolved criminal homicides is \"shockingly high\" in many cities, so the situation in St. Louis is not all that unique.", "Our ruling", "Hanaway said \"only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved.\"", "That\u2019s basically accurate looking at FBI data from 2004-14.", "We rate this claim True.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5682c82-966a-4646-90d4-df304162a1ac", "Republican Governor Debate, \"Fox2now\", June 6, 2016", "Interview, Jennifer Joyce, Circuit Attorney for the city of St. Louis, June 8, 2016", "Interview, James Alan Fox, professor of criminology at Northeastern University, June 10, 2016", "Interview, David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, June 10, 2016", "Email interview, Hanaway\u2019s Policy director Will Scharf, June 9, 2016", "Data, \"Murder Accountability Project\"", "FBI, \"Uniformed Crime Reports\"", "Email interview, Schron Jackson, St. Louis Police Department Public Information Manager, June 9, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
