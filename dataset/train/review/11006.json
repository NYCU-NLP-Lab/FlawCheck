Sharma had tagged Sharmistha Mukherjee, daughter of Pranab Mukherjee in this tweet. Sharmistha Mukherjee had, prior to the event, expressed consternation over her father\u2019s decision to attend it. She referred to this tweet by Sharma in a tweet she posted at 11:03 pm on June 7.", "See, this is exactly what I was fearing & warned my father about.

Suparna Singh, CEO of NDTV in a conversation with Alt News said, \u201cNDTV ran a story on the morphed photo. The inauthentic photo was accidentally used for half an hour this morning in an opinion piece by Mani Shankar Aiyar. We apologize for the error.\u201d Meanwhile, the RSS in a press release strongly condemned the photoshopped image, calling it a \u2018dirty trick by divisive political forces\u2019 which are out to malign the organisation.", "Alt News was alerted by a social media user about the possible source of the photograph.

It is this ecosystem that is often referred to as the dirty tricks department of the RSS and BJP.", "In this particular instance, Alt News found that the pages and accounts which Alt News has tracked for regularly posting misinformation had not shared this photoshopped image.
