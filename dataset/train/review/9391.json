(AP/Spagat)", "Some asylum seekers released by immigration officials in San Diego have been quarantining in a hotel to comply with the state\u2019s pandemic rules. Jewish Family Service of San Diego, a local nonprofit, has been helping them do so.", "The migrants have been cleared to stay in the country while they wait for their chance to present their cases in court, a Jewish Family Service representative told PolitiFact.", "In general, any immigrants who are physically present in the United States or who arrive in the U.S. can seek asylum, even if they were not legally admitted into the country.", "As former President Donald Trump was tried in the Senate for inciting an insurrection, Fox News host Laura Ingraham accused Democrats of plotting their own insurrection by \"enticing illegals to bust through our borders, exploit our resources and commit crimes.\"", "Ingraham said immigrants were exploiting American hospitality. \"You may not have stayed in a hotel in the past year, but illegals arriving since Biden\u2019s inauguration, they get to stay free of charge,\" Ingraham said Feb. 8, citing a report in the New York Times.", "\"It sounds so pleasant. Can you believe that? At a time when our own people are suffering,\" Ingraham said, after reading a snippet from the report.", "As part of a story about an influx of migrants at the U.S. border with Mexico, the New York Times reported that some migrants arriving in San Diego were quarantining in a hotel in order to comply with California\u2019s 10-day quarantine requirement for out-of-state travelers.", "\"To guard against the coronavirus, health authorities in San Diego have arranged housing for hundreds of arriving migrants in a downtown high-rise hotel, where they are being quarantined before being allowed to join family or friends in the interior of the United States,\" the newspaper found.", "A clip from Ingraham\u2019s monologue was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

They generally have to apply for asylum within one year of arriving in the U.S. For that reason, immigration experts took issue with Ingraham\u2019s characterization of the migrants in San Diego\u2019s hotel as \"illegals.\"", "\"A person can seek asylum at a port of entry to the United States or within the interior of the United States,\" said Erin Barbato, director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic at the University of Wisconsin Law School. \"If a person crossed the border without inspection, that person was not \u2018admitted\u2019 into the United States, but that does not make the person \u2018illegal.\u2019\"", "In San Diego, the immigrants quarantining in a hotel are those who have been released by immigration officials while they wait to present their case in an immigration court, Peled said.", "They have \"passed a credible fear interview conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, and are now awaiting their asylum cases in the U.S.,\" he said.", "When immigrants claim asylum, they are processed and either detained or released to friends or family who promise that they will appear at future court hearings, Hallett said. But getting people to their sponsors can be tricky in a pandemic, when travel is restricted.", "\"Thus, the government releases people to a local nonprofit that assists with the quarantine and then ensures that they arrive at their final destination,\" Hallett said. \"It appears that Jewish Family Service is playing this role in San Diego.\"", "Peled said JFS is helping families through their quarantines by providing case management as well as financial and travel assistance. He said the effort is part of San Diego County\u2019s ability to access federal funding for reimbursement of \"non-congregate sheltering\" \u2014 that is, temporary living arrangements that avoid crowding to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus.", "A spokesperson for the Border Patrol in the San Diego sector told the San Diego Union-Tribune that COVID-19 restrictions have caused some facilities to reach \"maximum safe holding capacity,\" prompting the release of some migrants before their court hearings.", "The practice of releasing immigrants until they appear before a judge was less common under Trump, Barbato said. The Trump administration starting in 2019 forced migrants to wait in Mexico while their cases moved through the immigration system.", "It isn\u2019t clear how many places are using hotels like San Diego.
