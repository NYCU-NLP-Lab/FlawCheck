In the past, Fox has characterized the injury to her opponent as a skull fracture.", "\u2022 The photo of the woman with the bloodied face was from an MMA fight that did not involve Fox and which took place several years after Fox\u2019s last MMA bout.", "\u2022 MMA is a combat sport and has an overall high rate of injury.", "With federal efforts underway to expand transgender rights, claims about transgender people have been rampant, and participation in sports is one particular area of focus.", "One claim making the rounds on social media takes aim at retired transgender MMA fighter Fallon Fox, whose last bout was in 2014.", "The Facebook post says, \"Fallon (Fox), a transgender MMA fighter, has now broken 2 female opponents\u2019 skulls,\" and shows a photo of Fox alongside an MMA fighter with a severely bloodied face.", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "During her two-year MMA career, Fox had one bout that resulted in facial injuries to her opponent \u2014 which is not uncommon in MMA \u2014 but the Facebook post gets most details wrong. Fox did not break two people\u2019s skulls. And she did not cause the injuries of or ever fight the bloodied person pictured in the post.", "Fox is a transgender woman whose sex at birth was male; she underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2006. When she went public with her story in 2013, she became the first openly transgender woman athlete to compete in MMA.", "The Facebook post implies that because Fox\u2019s sex at birth was male, she maintains a physical advantage over her opponents and, as a result, is causing serious injuries. But a study in the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine found that MMA fights have an overall high rate of injury, and that the majority of recorded injuries were to the face.", "During a 2014 fight, Fox defeated Tamikka Brents by knockout. One report at the time from a news outlet that covers MMA said that Brents had a concussion, broken orbital bone and required seven staples in her head.", "Fox has commented on her bout against Brents several times on Twitter. \u00a0In June 2020, when someone accused her of smashing two women\u2019s skulls open, Fox tweeted, \"For the record, I knocked two out. One woman\u2019s skull was fractured, the other not. And just so you know, I enjoyed it.\"", "In October 2020, replying to a tweet that has since been deleted, Fox tweeted, \"I fractured Tamikka Brents skull. And other women have done the same in the sport. You try to make it seem as if I\u2019m the only one who could do that. Why?\"", "Then, in February 2021, Fox described Brents\u2019 injuries in different terms. Responding to a claim that seems to mirror the one we are checking, Fox tweeted, \"The rumor\u2019s kinda based on another fight where I fractured opponent Tamikka Brents orbital bone years ago. They said I \u2018broke her skull.\u2019 As if it split in half & she died. Now there\u2019s rumors that I broke 2 women\u2019s skulls. Never broken anyone\u2019s skull. It\u2019s an orbital fracture!\"", "In the Facebook post about Fox, the photo that accompanies the claim juxtaposes images of a bloodied fighter and Fox giving thumbs-up signs. The bloodied person pictured is Kay Hansen, who started fighting in MMA bouts in 2017, three years after Fox\u2019s last bout.", "The fight that caused those injuries to Hansen took place in March 2018 against Kal Schwartz, and a media report at the time said that Schwartz \"paint(ed) her opponent red\" when blood poured out of a wound.", "Fox addressed the photo in a series of tweets last month, saying, \"So tired of the fake news circulating that I broke this woman\u2019s skull. The upper photo is fake. ...It was Kal Schwartz \u2014 a cis woman \u2014 who caused the damage to opponent Kay Hansen that I\u2019m being blamed for!\"", "A Facebook post says, \"Fallon (Fox), a transgender MMA fighter, has now broken 2 female opponents\u2019 skulls,\" and shows a photo of Fox alongside an MMA fighter with a severely bloodied face.", "Fox fractured one opponent\u2019s orbital bone; she did not break two people\u2019s skulls. The photo that juxtaposes Fox with bloodied MMA fighter Kay Hansen is misleading and inaccurate. Hansen\u2019s injuries were sustained in a 2018 fight with Kal Schwartz, and the fight took place years after Fox\u2019s last MMA bout.", "The claim contains an element of truth because one person sustained a head injury in a fight with Fox, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression and includes a photo that has no association with Fox.
