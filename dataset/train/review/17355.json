["About this rating", "On 20 January 2017, the day Donald J. Trump took office as President of the United States, news outlets posted photos\u00a0purporting to compare the size of the crowd attending Trump's inauguration to that attending Barack Obama's first inaugural ceremony in 2009. Although there was not yet an official count of how many people actually showed up at\u00a0the Trump event, so an accurate numerical comparison couldn't be made, the photos did appear to show a significant\u00a0disparity between the sizes of the crowds, with far fewer in attendance at Trump's inauguration than Obama's.", "For obvious reasons, the side-by-side images were relished by\u00a0anti-Trump factions, who\u00a0shared and retweeted them all day long.", "There was\u00a0one instance in particular wherein a retweet of the photos caught the attention of incoming Trump officials, who deemed them inappropriate \u2014 so inappropriate, in fact, that the Department of Interior promptly\u00a0deactivated every one\u00a0of its Twitter accounts in response.", "The offending retweet (since deleted) appeared on the National Park Service (@NatlParkService) Twitter feed:", "This was followed by another retweet (since deleted) of a text suggesting that the Trump administration had scrubbed information from the White House web site for ideological reasons:", "All of which caused a small\u00a0uproar on Twitter, where some users joked\u00a0that the National Park Service had \"gone rogue,\" others wondered about the legality of the retweets, and still others defended their content as \"factual, not anti-Trump.\" Later that day, the NPS Twitter account, along with all the other Department of Interior accounts, went silent. According to a report by CNN, the order came down from a \"career staffer\" at the department:", "In statements to The Washington Post, a National Park Service spokesperson explained why the action was taken and said\u00a0it would only be temporary:", "Thomas Crosson, a spokesman\u00a0for the National Park Service, the Interior agency whose employee retweeted the offending tweets,\u00a0said the action was \u201cinconsistent with the agency\u2019s approach to engaging the public through social media.\u201d", "\u201cThe Department of Interior\u2019s communications team determined that it was important to stand down Twitter activity across the Department temporarily, except in the case of public safety,\u201d Crosson said in an email.", "\u201cNow that social media guidance has been clarified, the Department and its bureaus should resume Twitter engagement as normal this weekend.\u201d With one exception, Crosson said: No social media posts on the policy priorities of the new Interior secretary, because Trump nominee Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) has not yet been confirmed.", "Indeed, by the next morning, U.S.\u00a0Department of Interior Twitter accounts went online again, commencing with a note of contrition\u00a0tweeted by @NatlParkService:", "We regret the mistaken RTs from our account yesterday and look forward to continuing to share the beauty and history of our parks with you pic.twitter.com/mctNNvlrmv", "\u2014 NationalParkService (@NatlParkService) January 21, 2017", "There has been no announcement regarding who may have been responsible for the retweets, or whether disciplinary action would be taken.", "Klein, Betsy.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Comparing Donald Trump and Barack Obama's Inaugural Crowd Sizes.\"\r\nCNN.\u00a0\u00a0 21 January 2017.", "Merica, Dan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Trump Admin Tells National Park Service to Halt Tweets.\"\r\nCNN.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a020 January 2017.", "Rein, Lisa.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Interior Department Reactivates Twitter Accounts Ffter Shutdown Following Inauguration.\"\r\nThe Washington Post.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a021 January 2017.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
