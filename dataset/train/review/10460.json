["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Gov. J.B. Pritzker | Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times", "The coronavirus pandemic has governors grappling with the implications of holding primary elections even as some are insisting everyone stay at home until the public health crisis subsides.", "Of 23 states that have not yet held primaries, at least eight\u00a0\u00a0are now postponed, according to news reports.", "Illinois was one of three states that allowed voting to continue as scheduled on March 17, even after Gov. J.B. Pritzker closed schools, barred restaurants from serving dine-in customers and prohibited mass gatherings. Ohio, which was also scheduled to vote that day, shuttered polling places hours before they were set to open by declaring a public health emergency.", "Following Ohio\u2019s 11th-hour move, Pritzker responded to criticism from Chicago\u2019s city election board over why he did not act to postpone in-person voting in Illinois.", "At an Election Day news conference, Pritzker said the city\u2019s board had asked him a week before \"to do something that is unquestionably not within my legal authority.\"", "\"They wanted me unilaterally to cancel in-person voting on March 17, convert Illinois to an all-vote-by-mail state, and extend vote by mail to May 12,\" Pritzker continued. \"They could not even begin to explain the legal basis for their request.\"", "It\u2019s impossible to say what would have happened had Pritzker\u2019s administration forced a delay like Ohio\u2019s, so calling it \"unquestionable\" is a bit of an exaggeration. But experts told us the governor\u2019s on firm legal footing to claim he cannot \u2014 on his own \u2014 interfere with the democratic process.", "During a state of emergency, which Pritzker declared earlier this month, public officials have broad authority to make drastic changes that may alter people\u2019s daily lives and undercut businesses\u2019 ability to operate.", "For example, Illinois\u2019 Emergency Management Agency Act allows the governor to control the movement of people within a \"disaster area,\" which in this case covers the entire state. It also permits him to seize property and suspend the sale of items such as alcohol or firearms. But it says nothing about postponing elections.", "In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine acknowledged he also lacked the authority to delay an election, according to the Columbus Dispatch. So he backed an attempt to get a court to change the date. When a judge denied that request, his public health director ordered all polling places closed. That action prompted a legal challenge, but Ohio\u2019s supreme court dismissed it, declining to stop the state from shuttering the polls.", "Experts told us Pritzker\u2019s administration may have been able to try something similar, potentially forcing the Illinois General Assembly to sort out a new date, as Ohio\u2019s is now doing. But the experts warned that doing so could have set a troubling precedent for future elections.", "\"You can say that even though the motivations here (in Ohio\u2019s case) were completely pure and even though the decision here was completely reasonable, this is a dynamic that is not particularly healthy to have a situation where a person who is elected himself is deciding not to hold elections,\" said Nadav Shoked, a local government expert at Northwestern University\u2019s law school.", "Indeed, Pritzker made a similar point during his press conference, warning \"it is exactly in times like these when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else.\"", "When we asked his office why the governor\u2019s administration had not tried to close polls like Ohio\u2019s did, spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh responded in an email that \"breaking the law and then hoping the Supreme Court agrees with you isn\u2019t how this administration prefers governing.\"", "So who can set a new election date or shift voting entirely to mail-in ballots in Illinois?", "Abudayyeh told us state lawmakers would have to pass legislation in order to make that happen. The legislature was not in session the week before the election.", "The state\u2019s election board also said it could not act unilaterally, noting in a March 16 press release that moving the election would require either a court order or legislative action.", "\"The Election Code is silent on the issue of canceling or postponing an election,\" spokesman Matt Dietrich told us in an email. \"It would require the General Assembly amending the Election Code to give us (or some other official or entity) such authority.\"", "Dietrich said the same goes for mandating election authorities send mail-in ballots to voters.", "Experts said it stands to reason that state lawmakers must take action in order to alter how elections are conducted.", "\"Who represents the people of the state? It\u2019s the state legislature,\" said Jaime Dominguez, an urban politics expert at Northwestern University. \"Voters are indirectly involved through their representative in the legislature.\"", "Pritzker said it was \"unquestionably\" not within his \"legal authority\" to postpone Illinois\u2019 primary election by changing the date or shifting the election to vote-by-mail.", "While there are too many hypotheticals to be certain Pritzker\u2019s administration could not have delayed the election in any way, experts told us the governor spoke correctly in describing the limits of his powers under state law.", "We rate his claim Mostly True.", "MOSTLY TRUE \u2014 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.", "Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "Video: Gov.
