Foreigners will think that this can be a counterfeit banknote.\u201d", "On December 12, 2020, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) issued a new set of commemorative notes to mark the Royal Coronation Ceremony of 2019.", "The release of the new gold 100 baht banknotes triggered concerns they could be mistaken for the existing 1,000 baht notes, the Bangkok Post reported.", "This 2010 research paper about banknotes describes a EURion constellation as: \u201cA pattern of symbols which can be found in a large amount of banknote designs since 1997. This pattern is one of many security features in a banknote.\u201d", "A similar claim about the banknotes was shared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here.", "The claim, however, is misleading.", "\u2018Modern anti-counterfeit technology\u2019", "The BOT also stated in this Facebook post that the commemorative banknotes possess anti-counterfeit features in line with other banknotes in circulation.", "On December 14, 2020, the Bank of Thailand issued this press release about the 100-baht commemorative notes, saying they incorporate \u201cmodern anti-counterfeiting technology\u201d.", "The text reads: \u201cThe two types of commemorative banknotes have utilised modern anti-counterfeiting technology which is used in the current banknotes (type 17) incorporated into their design, such as the translucent watermark, an animated 3D magnetic ink, a special ink with altering colours, and a special ink that glows under ultraviolet rays, in order to blend technology and storytelling through the pattern on the banknote for appropriateness and aesthetics.\u201d", "\u2018Not necessary\u2019", "Steven J. Murdoch, a Professor of Security Engineering at University College London\u2019s Department of Computer Science, said the EURion constellation was not a \u201cnecessary feature to prevent counterfeiting\u201d.", "\u201cThe EURion constellation and CDS (Counterfeit Deterrence System) are designed primarily to disrupt amateur attempts to counterfeit currency, and can be circumvented without too much difficulty,\u201d he said in an email to AFP on December 16, 2020. \u201cBanknotes contain many other security features which are much harder to bypass than the EURion constellation or CDS, such as the use of special papers/plastics and printing techniques which are hard to replicate.\u201d", "Nicholas Gessler, a retired Research Associate in Information Science and Information Studies at Duke University, North Carolina said: \u201cThe lack of the EURion Constellation does not necessarily mean that there are no security features incorporated into the note.\u201d", "\u201cThe EURion Constellation was designed to be detected by office photocopiers, it never did deter serious counterfeiters,\u201d he said in an email to AFP on December 18, 2020. \u201cThere are many other more modern and effective security features in use today. Some are made public to reassure the populace. Others remain secret to confuse the counterfeiters. Counterfeiting and counterfeit detection have always been, and always will be, a cat-and-mouse game.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
