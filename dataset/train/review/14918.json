["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on July 2, 2020", "President Donald Trump has falsely claimed his administration invested \u201c$2.5 trillion in all of the greatest equipment in the world\u201d for the military. That\u2019s approximately the total for defense budgets from 2017 to 2020, but the cost of purchasing new military equipment was 20% of that.", "It\u2019s true the Defense Department budgets passed under Trump \u2014 which total $2.9 trillion, in inflation-adjusted dollars, actually \u2014 have been larger than they were in the latter years of his predecessor. In the last four years under then-President Barack Obama, the defense budgets, in inflation-adjusted dollars, totaled $2.7 trillion, but the budgets in Obama\u2019s first four years were nearly $3.3 trillion.", "Those are the budget authority figures \u2014 the amounts Congress appropriated \u2014 from the Defense Department comptroller\u2019s budget report released this year. (Note: The fiscal 2009 defense budget was signed by then-President George W. Bush four months before Obama took office. The fiscal 2017 budget, which began on Oct. 1, 2016, when Obama was still in office, was signed by Trump.)", "So, in context, the amount Trump is touting isn\u2019t all that unusual.", "On occasion, Trump has emphasized the \u201ctrillion,\u201d as he did in a speech at West Point on June 13: \u201c[W]e have invested over 2 trillion \u2014 trillion; that\u2019s with a \u2018T\u2019 \u2014 dollars in the most powerful fighting force, by far, on the planet Earth.\u201d On May 22, he falsely claimed military funding \u201cused to be \u2018million.\u2019 And then, about 10 years ago, you started hearing \u2018billion.\u2019 And now you\u2019re starting to hear \u2018trillion,\u2019 right?\u201d", "That\u2019s wrong. The defense budget has been in the billions each year dating back to 1948 (as far as the Defense Department tables go). And those yearly budgets are still in the billions. As we said, Trump gets to \u201ctrillion\u201d by adding together several years.", "The president repeatedly has claimed all of the budget money was spent on equipment, such as ships, fighter jets, tanks and weapons. He made that assertion on June 25 when speaking at a shipbuilding company in Wisconsin.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve totally rebuilt the military \u2014 $2.5 trillion,\u201d Trump said, going on to talk about a contract awarded to that shipbuilding company, Fincantieri Marinette Marine, \u201cto build the next generation of guided missile frigates for the United States Navy.\u201d", "Trump then mentioned missiles, rockets and tanks, saying: \u201cWhat we had were great people in the military, but they weren\u2019t given the right equipment, so now they are. Two and a half trillion dollars. \u2026\u00a0We\u2019ve invested the $2.5 trillion in all of the greatest equipment in the world, and it\u2019s all made here, right in the USA.\u201d", "Procurement \u2014 as in buying equipment \u2014 made up 20.3% of those 2017-2020 defense budgets, or $590.7 billion. (That\u2019s in constant \u2014 inflation-adjusted \u2014 2021 dollars, per the Defense Department report.)", "The president has made some version of this claim at least 16 times, according to the Washington Post Fact Checker\u2019s database of Trump\u2019s claims.", "At times, he mentions the figure for the defense budgets without stipulating what specifically the money bought. \u201cI\u2019ve rebuilt our military. I spent two and a half trillion dollars. Nobody else did,\u201d he told Fox News on June 11. (As we explained, Obama did indeed approve budgets totaling more than that.)", "But other times, he has made the false claim about all of the funding going for equipment, or \u201cnew planes, ships, submarines, tanks, missiles, rockets \u2014 anything you can think of.\u201d", "Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told us when Trump has claimed $2-plus trillion was spent on military equipment, that\u2019s \u201cabsolutely untrue.\u201d", "\u201cWhat we spend on military equipment is a fraction of the defense budget,\u201d Harrison said.", "If we wanted to be generous, Harrison said, we could include the defense budget\u2019s \u201cresearch, development, test, and evaluation\u201d category, which pays for the development of technology, as part of military equipment. That category plus procurement would total 33.5% of the last four defense budgets.", "The largest defense budget category is operation and maintenance, which made up 40.2% of the 2017-2020 budgets, followed by military personnel, which was 22.6% of those budgets.", "But when the president hasn\u2019t been as specific, his $2.5 trillion claim could be interpreted to refer to what the U.S. spends in total on defense, and \u201cthat\u2019s about right,\u201d Harrison said.", "\u201cNo president can claim credit or get the blame for military spending all on their own,\u201d he added, noting that Congress passes appropriation bills that the president then signs into law. \u201cCongress has just as much of a role in military spending.\u201d", "The budget authority figures we have cited are those amounts appropriated by Congress. To see what the federal government actually spends, we would look at outlays. But even those total about $2.7 trillion for 2017 to 2020, using the inflation-adjusted numbers. As the Defense Department explains, money that\u2019s obligated in one year could be spent in another, or over several years.", "We contacted the White House about the president\u2019s claim but didn\u2019t get a response.", "As we said, the budgets signed by Trump (including the fiscal 2017 budget), include an increase in defense spending from Obama\u2019s second term.", "The Defense Department report shows the 2017-2020 budgets are 9.3% larger than the 2013-2016 budgets. But the defense budgets signed by Trump are 10.8% lower than the 2009-2012 budgets, in inflation-adjusted dollars. (Again, the 2009 fiscal year defense budget was signed by Bush in September 2008.)", "Obama\u2019s second-term budgets were subject to spending caps under the Budget Control Act of 2011, an effort to lower federal deficits. Beginning in fiscal 2013, Congress has raised those caps every year, according to a Congressional Research Service report, and there have been\u00a0much\u00a0larger cap increases\u00a0in the last three defense budgets signed by\u00a0Trump.", "In looking solely at procurement, the budgets for 2017-2020 are 24.8% larger than those in 2013-2016 but 5.8% lower than the 2009-2012 budgets, in inflation-adjusted figures.", "We previously wrote about Trump\u2019s false claims that the defense budgets he signed showed \u201crecord\u201d levels of spending. When adjusted for inflation, the defense budgets for fiscal 2007 through 2012 were all larger than the budgets signed by Trump, according to the Defense Department figures.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
