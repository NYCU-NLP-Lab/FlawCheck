In the rambling speech, Trump addressed his friend, billionaire businessman and campaign donor Sheldon Adelson, and stated the new embassy building would be constructed with \"Jerusalem stone.\"", "In the comments, Trump also appeared to be deriding his critics, who had expressed fears that he would not willingly leave office if termed out, or if he lost reelection.
