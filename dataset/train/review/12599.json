["About this rating", "In January 2014, a woman in San Diego, California, went to a local salon to get her hair done. \u00a0What happened next sounds like the most nightmarish of urban legends: the angle and degree she was tilted in the chair and the way her head tipped back over the sink while the stylist was washing her hair caused Elizabeth Smith\u00a0to have a stroke two weeks later:", "\"I vomited, my head became hot and I couldn't stand. I had weakness in my arms and legs. They didn't think I was going to live,\" said Smith, choking back tears.", "Smith says she could hardly believe what nearly killed her.", "Her doctors pointed to her time in the shampoo chair. Beauty Parlor Stroke Syndrome is what they called it. It's a rare but documented condition.", "Multiple doctors who saw Smith say when her neck was bent backwards, it hyperextended, her vertebrae slicing an artery. A clot began forming, later causing a stroke.", "\"Several of Ms. Smith's neurologists confirmed with her that the stroke was caused by the vertebra dissecting her artery during her hair wash,\" said Smith's attorney Carree Nahama.", "The danger is real, although the probability\u00a0of it happening is low. A study that came out in 1993, subsequently covered by the New York Times,\u00a0found\u00a0that older people have a higher risk of a stroke during or after a visit to the beauty salon (Smith was in her late 40s at the time):", "The patients suffered from a variety of complaints attributable to poor blood flow in arteries leading through the neck to the back of the brain, including severe dizziness, imbalance and facial numbness. Four out of five suffered strokes leading to permanent neurologic damage.", "\"In older people, neck motion beyond a certain degree can be extremely dangerous, particularly hyperextension and rotation,\" said Dr. Weintraub, chief of neurology at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y., referring to backward arching and twisting.", "He and others have suggested that patients receiving anesthesia or undergoing prolonged dental work may also be vulnerable, since they too have their necks arched back abnormally for prolonged periods.", "A 2006 study\u00a0also looked into the issue, saying while it probably occurred more than previously thought, the risk of stroke\u00a0in these cases was easily alleviated:", "Taken together, hyperextension combined with hanging the head backwards in a hair washbasin can be seen as a risk factor for posterior circulation ischemia. It probably occurs more often than assumed and a number of patients may report about previous dizziness episodes under the same conditions when asked specifically. It can be prevented by changing the shampoo routine from the hanging head position to a flexed or neutral position.", "Dr. Scott Olson, a vascular neurologist\u00a0at the University of California, San Diego, told us that while he hasn't seen this specific case, he has seen this\u00a0particular injury (more commonly called a \"vertebral artery\u00a0dissection,\" which can lead to subsequent clotting and stroke) and it's not unprecedented:", "It\u2019s pretty much a fluke. I\u00a0have seen people who\u2019ve had this happen while surfing, they happen after dental visits. \u00a0I had an auto mechanic who was working on a car for a day and had his head hanging over a creeper\u2026 I\u00a0had a patient fall asleep in a movie theater and ended up having a dissection.", "[But] ...It\u2019s like a lot of things in life where it\u2019s the same thing you\u2019ve done. I\u00a0think people should not be inordinately worried about it. \u00a0I mean, tens of thousands of people across this country have their hair washed at salons every day. It\u2019s very statistically uncommon.", "He says there are signs to watch\u00a0for after a potential injury:", "Things people should pay attention to, should be concerned about? Pain on one side of the neck after extension, and obviously, any neurologic symptoms like vertigo.\u00a0There\u2019s some genetic disorders, like Marfan Syndrome, hyperextensible joints, or connective tissue disease that will make you more prone.", "Elizabeth Smith says she racked up $250,000 in medical bills and has permanently lost part of her\u00a0vision and mobility. \u00a0She is now\u00a0suing\u00a0the salon for damages.", "On 30 March 2016, we spoke to Smith. \u00a0She told us:", "I had no idea that the story would go on, and I\u2019m glad that it has.", "The two big skepticisms really are \u2014 people think that you feel something, but you feel nothing, because your artery has no nerves, so you feel nothing when it happens. So just because you\u2019re like \"oh, I'm comfortable,\" doesn\u2019t mean it hasn\u2019t happened.", "The other thing is that the delay from injury to stroke is because you get a little bit of a bleed, and a little bleed won\u2019t clog or occlude your artery. It takes your body time to build a clot big enough to do the damage, roughly two weeks. For me, it was 8 days, but that wasn\u2019t the full stroke.", "Just don\u2019t bend your neck back, literally, at all. It can be something as simple as saying, \"put five or six towels down.\"\u00a0Don\u2019t bend your neck back, no matter how comfortable you are, or what your stylist says.", "Brooke Binkowski is a former editor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
