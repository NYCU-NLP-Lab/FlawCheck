["Fire consumes the Amazon rainforest in Altamira, Brazil, Tuesday, Aug. 27, 2019. (AP)", "As wildfires continue to consume large swaths of the Amazon rainforest, some social media users are crediting celebrities with trying to help extinguish them.", "In an Instagram post published Sept. 2, one user published a screenshot of a tweet that claims the singer Rihanna has hired \"five planes that carried 90,000 liters of water to support the fire control\" in the Amazon rainforest. Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research estimates there have been 90,000 fires throughout the region this year.", "\"We luv Rihanna,\" the Instagram user wrote about the artist. \"(Pretty sure it\u2019s a joke but we still luv her)\"", "We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a joke, but we do know it\u2019s not true. The post, which has racked up thousands of Instagram likes and numerous shares, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

We also reached out to the public relations agency that represents Rihanna for more details. We\u2019ll update this story if we hear back.", "A search for the original tweet pictured in the Instagram post turned up several examples of the same claim, although with different celebrities. Over the past week, tweeters have claimed that Selena Gomez, rapper Bhad Bhabie, Nicki Minaj and other public figures have also hired five planes to carry 90,000 liters of water to the Amazon.", "An advanced Twitter search of Rihanna\u2019s tweets revealed that the artist has never tweeted about the Amazon rainforest. She also hasn\u2019t mentioned the fires on her Instagram in the past several weeks.", "Finally, we couldn\u2019t find any news stories mentioning Rihanna even speaking about the Amazon fires, much less hiring planes to carry water there. It\u2019s reasonable to assume a celebrity as well-known as Rihanna would receive at least some press attention for such a move. Rihanna\u2019s foundation, for example, has been involved with other humanitarian efforts, such as giving grants to nonprofits for disaster relief.", "But when it comes to this rainforest claim, we couldn\u2019t find any evidence to support the notion that she or any of the other celebrities mentioned on Twitter had hired aircraft to help put out the Amazon fires.", "We do know, however, that the Brazilian military has used warplanes to dump water on the blazes.", "The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "Advanced Twitter Search, accessed Sept. 5, 2019", "Data from Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research, accessed Sept. 5, 2019", "Fast Company, \"How Rihanna\u2019s foundation is rethinking disaster response,\" Sept. 5, 2019", "Instagram post, Sept. 2, 2019", "Reuters, \"Warplanes dump water on Amazon as Brazil military begins fighting fires,\" Aug. 25, 2019", "Rihanna\u2019s Instagram profile, accessed Sept. 5, 2019", "Tweet, Aug. 24, 2019", "Tweet, Aug. 24, 2019", "Tweet, Aug. 24, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
