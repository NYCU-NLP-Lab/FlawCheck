["NC Senate Leader Phil Berger addresses the audience at The Male Leadership Academy of Charlotte in Charlotte, NC on Thursday, February 21, 2019 about the importance of people applying for the Opportunity Scholarship program. (McClatchy)", "North Carolina lawmakers want to make more people eligible for private school subsidies from the state.", "The subsidies come in the form of vouchers known as Opportunity Scholarships, a program that provides up to $4,200 to families interested in sending their students to private schools.", "State law currently limits vouchers to families earning about $63,000 a year, WRAL\u00a0reported. But a GOP-backed bill,\u00a0SB 609, would raise the limit to families making up to $70,000 a year.", "The NC Senate on May 8 voted 27-18 to approve the bill and send it to the House \u2014 against the wishes of Democrats who said the state shouldn\u2019t spend tax dollars on private schools.", "During debates, a pair of Mecklenburg County Democrats suggested program expansion isn\u2019t needed. Sen. Jeff Jackson\u00a0tweeted\u00a0that \"demand has been low.\" Sen. Natasha Marcus, meanwhile, said during a floor speech that there\u2019s \"no wait list\" for the vouchers.", "\"To the extent there\u2019s any wait list, it\u2019s that these parents make too much money to qualify,\" she said.", "Jackson\u2019s claim is debatable. Marcus\u2019s claim, however, is misleading.", "520 STUDENTS", "For the current school year, 7,593 of 8,113 eligible applicants got Opportunity Scholarships.", "Those 520 students weren\u2019t rejected because their parents made too much money, as Marcus said. They were blocked from receiving vouchers due to a cap that limits state spending on kindergartners and first-grade students, as PolitiFact reported in a\u00a0previous fact check.", "Students of any grade can receive vouchers. But the state \"can only award 40 percent of the money to kindergarten and first grade,\" said Kathryn Marker, director of grants, training, and outreach at the North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority.", "The so-called wait list evaporates after each year. In other words, the 520 students left out last year won\u2019t automatically be first in line when the application window opens this year.", "So, technically, there\u2019s no wait list at this moment. But Marcus is wrong to suggest that scholarships were given to every eligible family.", "Contacted by PolitiFact, Marcus said her comment was made in the context of funding.", "\"I was referring to the fact that no children were denied a voucher due to lack of funding, as is so often the case with Pre-K wait lists,\" Marcus said in an email. \"The arguments on the floor in defense of this expansion seemed to suggest we needed more funding to alleviate a waitlist.\"", "However, that distinction isn\u2019t clear upon reviewing her full comments during the May 8 debate.", "\"There\u2019s some talk about a wait list and some suggestion that not every kid who wants a voucher for private schools is able to get one and we need to expand,\" Marcus said during the May 8 debate.", "\"I want to be clear, as far as I know \u2014 and someone can correct me in this body if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 every student who has requested a voucher for private school in this state, every year that this program has happened, has received the full voucher amount to which they were eligible,\" she said. \"To the extent there\u2019s any wait list, it\u2019s that these parents make too much money to qualify. Every student who\u2019s eligible right now has received a voucher, and there\u2019s still $13 million left in this fund, sitting there held hostage for two years before it reverts back to the general fund. So, there\u2019s no wait list.\"", "INTEREST RISING", "Before we rule on Marcus\u2019s statement, we also wanted to weigh in on Jackson\u2019s tweet.", "\"A few years ago, we (controversially) started subsidizing private schools with vouchers. It was limited to low income families,\" Jackson tweeted. \"But demand has been low, so now they want to raise the income eligibility.\"", "The word \"low\" can be somewhat subjective and hard to define since the program is only five years old. There are also restrictions on who can qualify for the vouchers, so the pool of potential recipients is limited.", "Still, in each year of its existence, the number of new applicants and the number of recipients has gone up.", "\"Clearly, there\u2019s steady interest. We feel the program is growing in a sustainable way. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s flat, it\u2019s growing,\" Marker said.", "Contacted by PolitiFact, Jackson said unspent money is evidence of low demand \"relative to expectations.\" He pointed to money left on the table, as reported by the\u00a0Charlotte Observer\u00a0and\u00a0NC Policy Watch, a liberal advocacy group.", "Scholarship allocation data doesn\u2019t necessarily represent the total cost of the Opportunity Scholarship program, Marker said. According to Marker, the leftover money amounted to:", "2017-2018: $6.3\u00a0million", "2016-2017: $2.7\u00a0million", "2015-2016: $4.1 million", "2014-2015: $5.8 million", "OUR RULING", "Marcus said there\u2019s \"no wait list,\" and the only people who didn\u2019t receive scholarships weren\u2019t eligible. That\u2019s not telling the full story.", "There is not a wait list in the sense that eligible applications exceed demand, and the ones who didn\u2019t get a scholarship were rolled over to next year. But more than 500 families were left without scholarships last year \u2014 even though they were deemed eligible \u2014 because of a cap on vouchers to kindergarten and first grade students. Her claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.", "Correction:\u00a0A previous version of this story included inaccurate numbers for the amount of Opportunity Scholarship funding left unspent in fiscal years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. The change doesn't influence our ruling.\u00a0Our Truth-O-Meter rating remains the same.", "This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
