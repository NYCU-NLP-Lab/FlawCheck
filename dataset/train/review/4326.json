(AP)", "The second night of the Republican National Convention turned into the court of political opinion when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took the stage.", "Christie reached back into his days as a federal prosecutor to do something the Justice Department said it would not do: prosecute Hillary Clinton for her performance as secretary of state.", "Christie pulled out criticisms of example after example \u2014 the end of the Cuban embargo, the Iran nuclear negotiations, her support for ousting fallen Libya dictator Muammar Gaddafi \u2014 before asking the crowd to shout its \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" verdict.", "One of his charges included an oft-referenced comment she made about President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.", "\"In Syria, imagine this, imagine this. (Clinton) called President Assad a \u2018reformer.\u2019 She called Assad a \u2018different kind of leader,\u2019 \" Christie said. \"There\u2019s now 400,000 now dead \u2014 think about that. Four hundred thousand dead at the hands of a man that Hillary defended.\"", "PolitiFact has heard this claim before, first from Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace in June 2014, and again from U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio in October 2015.", "The attack has stuck to Clinton but the quote requires more context.", "The Arab Spring of 2011 pitted Assad, who assumed the presidency in 2000, and his government against citizens rising up for change.", "The starting point for what became a bloody civil war came in the remote city of Daraa, where 15 schoolchildren were arrested for spray-painting anti-government graffiti on their school with messages such as \"the people want to topple the regime,\" according to CNN. The military used brutal force to address sit-ins in Damascus and Daraa over the treatment of the jailed protesters, which spurred thousands more Syrians to turn against Assad.", "Clinton talked about the developments Syria on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation on March 27, 2011. Host Bob Schieffer pressed her on why the U.S. reaction would be different from its response to Libya with air strikes. Syria, Schieffer noted, is no friend of the United States as an enemy of Israel and ally of Iran, and Assad\u2019s father had \"killed 25,000 people, at a lick\" in 1982.", "Clinton\u2019s response did include the word \"reformer\" in regards to Assad, but there was more to it than Christie and others let on. Here\u2019s her response to Schieffer on March 27, 2011:", "\"Well, if there were a coalition of the international community, if there were the passage of a Security Council resolution, if there were a call by the Arab League, if there was a condemnation that was universal, but that is not going to happen because I don't think that it's yet clear what will occur, what will unfold.", "\"There is a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer.", "\"What's been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning, but there's a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities than police actions which, frankly, have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see.\"", "Two days later, Clinton was questioned by a Wall Street Journal reporter over what critics interpreted as her defense of Assad\u2019s regime.", "\"I referenced opinions of others,\" Clinton said. \"That was not speaking either for myself or for the administration.\"", "The video shows she attributed the \"reformer\" opinion to \"members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months.\"", "But there is a problem, as both PolitiFact and the Washington Post reported, with the \"both parties\" part.", "Democrats who visited with Assad around that time included California\u2019s Nancy Pelosi, who was the House speaker in 2007, and Sen. John Kerry, then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.", "Kerry had an optimistic view of Assad\u2019s leadership when he said, \"Syria will change, as it embraces a legitimate relationship with the United States and the West.\"", "But Republicans? The Washington Post counted 13 Republicans who traveled to Syria, but they expressed skepticism, not hope, for Assad\u2019s government.", "As the military crackdown on Syrians grew worse, Obama and Clinton called on Assad to go. Clinton was interviewed in November 2011 by Jake Tapper, who noted how she \"at one point seemed to have optimism that Assad was a reformer.\"", "Clinton said, \"Well, we had hoped so because there was a lot at stake, we wanted to see an agreement, for example, between Syria and Israel. That was something that people have been working on for 30 years. We heard what Assad said about what he wanted to do for reform. But when it came to it, in the Arab Spring and as people actually demanded some freedom and their rights, he responded, as we have seen, very violently.\"", "Christie didn\u2019t include this chapter in his prime-time \"indictment.\"", "A query to Christie\u2019s spokesperson was not returned by deadline.", "Our ruling", "Christie attacked Clinton for calling Assad a \"reformer\" and a \"different kind of leader.\"", "She did use those words, mostly, but there is more to the story.
