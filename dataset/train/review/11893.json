They amount to less than half the nearly 22.2 million jobs lost \u2014 also a record \u2014 in February and March as a result of the pandemic.", "Furthermore, the job recovery has lately lost momentum. The number of recovered jobs was 4.8 million in June but less than 1.8 million in July.

But independent tax analysts say Biden\u2019s plan to raise corporate taxes will indirectly affect employees due to lower investment returns or lower wages over time.", "As a result, most Americans would see a reduction in after-tax income, but \u201c[t]he change would be small for most of those middle- and lower-income households\u2014on average, only a fraction of a percent of their after-tax income\u2014and we estimate that 80 percent of the new tax revenue would come from the top 1 percent by income,\u201d according to\u00a0John Ricco, a senior tax analyst at the Penn Wharton Budget Model. That analysis was the basis for\u00a0a claim\u00a0by Eric Trump on the second night of the convention that under Biden\u2019s tax plan, \u201c82% of Americans will see their taxes go up significantly.\u201d", "Biden\u2019s\u00a0tax plan\u00a0includes provisions such as imposing a payroll tax on earnings over $400,000, restoring a top income tax rate of 39.6% for income above $400,000, and increasing the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.", "Ricco said that \u201c[v]ery few families would be sending larger checks to the IRS (or having more money withheld from their paychecks) under Biden\u2019s proposal.\u201d", "\u201cIf you\u2019re looking\u00a0only\u00a0at individual income taxes and payroll taxes, we find that about 2 percent of all families would see their taxes go up directly under the Biden plan \u2014 almost all of them in the top 5 percent by income,\u201d Ricco told us via email.", "But when you include Biden\u2019s plan to increase corporate taxes, the\u00a0Penn Wharton Budget Model analysis\u00a0found that \u201cthe tax plan will affect 82 percent of families,\u201d Ricco said. \u201cBut instead of seeing their taxes go up directly, those additional families are paying the corporate tax hikes in the form of lower investment returns or lower wages over time.\u201d", "According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model \u2014 which estimates the Biden tax plan would raise between $3.1 trillion and $3.7 trillion over 10 years\u00a0 \u2014 middle-income earners would see their after-tax income decline by 0.4%, or $180, on average.", "\u201cTo explain a bit more: because the corporate income tax is remitted by corporations and not people, economists have to make some assumptions about which people ultimately bear the burden of that tax,\u201d Ricco said. \u201cWe assume that, in the long run, a quarter of the corporate income tax falls on workers in the form of lower wages. \u2026 So while those workers wouldn\u2019t literally be remitting more in taxes, over time they would end up shouldering some of the burden of the tax increase.\u201d", "Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, told us via email, that \u201cit\u2019s more precise to say that Biden\u2019s plan would lower the incomes of 82 percent of Americans as a result of the tax changes, but not that it would generate a larger direct tax bill for those Americans.\u201d", "Trump claimed that his administration will \u201cfurther reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums,\u201d adding: \u201cThey\u2019re coming way down.\u201d But insurance premiums for those with employer-based plans \u2014 where nearly half of Americans get their coverage \u2014 have gone up, as they normally do.", "And while there\u2019s not one standard measure of total prescription drug costs, the metric Trump has pointed to in the past as evidence of a decrease now shows a year-over-year increase.", "Premiums: The Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s latest annual Employer Health Benefits Survey found premiums for single coverage went up 4% from 2018 to 2019 and family coverage premiums rose 5%.

When insurers set marketplace premiums for 2019, the Urban Institute\u2019s January report said, \u201cit became clear that many of them had overreacted to the tumult and uncertainty\u201d in pricing 2018 plans. So, those premiums, which do \u201cvary considerably across states,\u201d the report noted, have now dropped.", "Prescription drugs: Trump has been using the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019\u00a0consumer price index for prescription drugs to claim drug prices decreased \u201clast year.\u201d But that talking point, as we\u2019ve explained, is now outdated.

But it\u2019s important to remember that the violence, often in the aftermath of police shootings of African Americans, is occurring\u00a0on Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0watch, not Joe Biden\u2019s.", "As we have written, Trump and his campaign have repeatedly and falsely claimed that a Biden administration would eviscerate law enforcement, with Americans subjected to mayhem in the streets and unanswered", "Biden has said on a number of occasions that he is opposed to defunding the police, and a Biden spokesman told us the Democratic nominee supports more funding for police for some functions, such as initiatives to strengthen community relationships and for body-worn cameras.", "Biden wrote in an op-ed in USA Today on June 10, \u201cWhile I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people\u2019s rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police. The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms.\u201d", "It\u2019s worth noting the federal government pays a small percentage of law enforcement expenses. According to a\u00a0backgrounder\u00a0by the Urban Institute, 86% of police funding in 2017 was from local governments, with additional money ponied up by state governments.", "The \u201cYes, absolutely\u201d comment was also cited by Vice President Mike Pence in his address at the convention on Aug. 26. Here is the context for that remark.", "In a July 8\u00a0interview with progressive activist Ady Barkan about police reforms, Biden was asked about shifting some funding from police to social service agencies for tasks that could be better handled by the latter. \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d Biden responded. But as we said, he would support additional funding in some categories.", "In a segment of the interview that didn\u2019t appear on YouTube, Biden said he supports reforms, but \u201cthat\u2019s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police.\u201d(The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0Fact Checker obtained audio of the full conversation.)", "Both Biden and Trump have expressed support for the idea of social workers and mental health personnel joining forces with police in some cases, as we\u2019ve explained.", "As we\u2019ve\u00a0written, there is no agreed upon definition for the term \u201cdefund the police.\u201d Some critics of the police really do want to abolish police forces as we know them and replace them with other forms of community safety entities. Others advocate shifting some money and functions away from police departments to social service agencies. But in campaign ads and verbal attacks on Biden, Republicans generally use the term to mean devastating budget cuts for law enforcement, something Biden clearly opposes.", "Trump\u2019s border wall. Trump falsely said that Biden is \u201ceven talking about taking the wall down\u201d along the border between the United States and Mexico that the president has so vigorously championed.", "That is not the case. As we have written, both a Biden campaign position paper and a list of recommendations drafted by allies of Biden and his vanquished rival Sen. Bernie Sanders call for getting rid of the \u201cnational emergency\u201d designation that allows the use of Defense Department funds for the fencing that the Trump administration is erecting. But neither document says anything about tearing down what has already been built.", "A wall on the Mexican border to keep out immigrants trying to illegally cross was a major campaign issue in 2016 for Trump and a frequent rallying cry since.", "Trump also gave a misleading statistic for how much of the wall has been built. \u201cWe have already built 300 miles of border wall,\u201d he said. But as we have written, very few of those miles are new construction.", "According to an Aug. 7 story\u00a0in the\u00a0San Antonio Express-News,\u00a0only five miles of new fencing have been constructed. The paper said 260 miles of replacement and secondary walls have been built. The border is about 2,000 miles. The paper said its story was based on data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.", "Refugees: In blasting the Democrats\u2019 approach to immigration,\u00a0Trump said\u00a0that Biden had\u00a0\u201cpledged to increase refugee admissions by 700%.\u201d", "But that doesn\u2019t account for the fact that Trump has slashed the number of refugees allowed into the country since he took office.", "The last refugee cap set by Obama was for fiscal year 2017 \u2014 it allowed for\u00a0110,000 refugees\u00a0to enter the country. The following year, Trump cut the number by more than half, to\u00a045,000. In fiscal year 2019 he cut it further, to\u00a030,000, and, finally, in fiscal year 2020 he set the ceiling at\u00a018,000.", "That\u2019s the\u00a0lowest number\u00a0since the U.S. refugee admissions program began in 1980.", "So, it\u2019s true that Biden\u2019s\u00a0platform\u00a0calling for an initial cap of 125,000 is an increase \u2014 it\u2019s actually about 600% higher than the current cap \u2014 but it\u2019s only about 14% higher than the number set before Trump took office.", "Pledge of Allegiance: Trump repeated a misleading claim he first made on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0shortly after the Democratic National Convention. He told the crowd gathered at the White House, \u201cDuring the Democrat Convention, the words \u2018Under God\u2019 were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance \u2013 not once, but twice.\u201d", "Actually, the pledge was\u00a0recited in full\u00a0each night of the convention.", "The words \u201cunder God\u201d were omitted at the start of daytime meetings for two caucuses, though. That appears to be the source of the claim.", "Interestingly, the president got it right on the first day of his party\u2019s convention, when he\u00a0said, \u201cI can promise you a few things, number one, we will not be taking the word \u2018God\u2019 out of the Pledge of Allegiance, like they did a number of times at their caucuses.\u201d", "But on Aug. 27, Trump reverted to the misleading version of the claim in a night heavy with cultural references.", "Abortion: Repeating a version of a claim made by several GOP convention speakers, Trump\u00a0said: \u201cJoe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable, yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up until the moment of birth.\u201d", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve\u00a0already\u00a0written this week, many Democrats,\u00a0including Biden, call for codifying into federal law the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 ruling in\u00a0Roe v. Wade. That decision says that states cannot interfere with a woman\u2019s right to an abortion before the end of the first trimester, but can regulate or prohibit abortions once a fetus becomes viable outside the womb.", "Most states\u00a0ban abortion\u00a0at a certain point in the pregnancy, with exceptions to protect the mother\u2019s life. In 2016, the most recent data available,\u00a0only 1.2%\u00a0of abortions were done after 21 weeks.", "Condemning rioters: Trump misleadingly\u00a0claimed\u00a0that \u201cBiden and his supporters\u201d only began to condemn rioters after the Democratic convention \u201cbecause their poll numbers are going down like a rock in water. It\u2019s too late, Joe.\u201d Although he did not mention it in his convention speech, Biden repeatedly condemned violent protests prior to the convention.", "Trump, Aug. 27: During their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention. Never once mentioned. Now they\u2019re starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in water. It\u2019s too late, Joe.", "Trump appeared to be referring to\u00a0a video\u00a0Biden\u00a0posted on Twitter on Aug. 26 in which the Democratic presidential nominee responded to the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The shooting sparked chaotic and at times violent protests. That all unfolded\u00a0after\u00a0Biden spoke at the Democratic convention.", "\u201cYou know, as I said after George Floyd\u2019s murder, protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut burning down communities is not protest, it\u2019s needless violence, violence that endangers lives, violence that guts businesses and shutters businesses that serve the community. That\u2019s wrong.\u201d", "That was not the first time Biden has spoken out against rioters. After the police killing of George Floyd on May 25 and the ensuing protests in cities around the country \u2014 some of which turned violent or involved looting \u2014 Biden did condemn violent protests.", "\u201cI say they have a right to be in fact angry and frustrated,\u201d Biden said in\u00a0an interview\u00a0on CNN on May 29. \u201cAnd more violence, hurting more people, isn\u2019t going to answer the question.\u201d", "Biden also released\u00a0a statement,\u00a0widely\u00a0reported\u00a0in the\u00a0media, in which he said, \u201cProtesting such brutality is right and necessary. It\u2019s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not. The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest. It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.\u201d", "In\u00a0remarks on racial economic equity\u00a0on July 28, Biden reiterated that message.", "\u201cI\u2019ve said from the outset of the recent protests that there is no place for violence or the destruction of property,\u201d Biden said. \u201cPeaceful protesters should be protected \u2014 but arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted \u2014 and local law enforcement can do that.\u201d", "School choice: Trump wrongly claimed\u00a0Biden \u201cvowed to oppose school choice and close all charter schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children.\u201d", "As\u00a0we have written, Biden opposes federal funding going to \u201cfor-profit charter schools,\u201d but schools managed by for-profit companies make up only a fraction of charter schools \u2014 about 10%, according to a researcher for the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.", "And while Biden opposes vouchers for private school tuition \u2014 the ultimate in school choice for some \u2014 he does not oppose students choosing between public schools, magnet schools and high-performing charter schools.", "According to a statement provided by a Biden campaign official to FactCheck.org in July, \u201cVP Biden will do everything he can to help traditional public schools, which is what most students attend. As president, he will ban for-profit charter schools from receiving federal funds. He will also make sure that we stop funding charter schools that don\u2019t provide results.\u201d The campaign added that Biden \u201cdoes not oppose districts letting parents choose to send their children to \u2026 high-performing public charters.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
