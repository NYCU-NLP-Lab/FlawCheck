["\u201cCDC: Face Masks Don\u2019t Prevent Covid-19, Study Finds Masks Have Negligible Impact on Coronavirus Numbers,\u201d reads the headline of the article published on March 7, 2021 by One America News.", "The network, a favorite of former president Donald Trump, was suspended from YouTube for a week in November 2020 for falsely claiming there is a cure for Covid-19, and its article on the CDC study is part of a broader trend of inaccurate information about face masks and their impact on curbing the spread of the disease.", "The article has spread across social media, including here as a screenshot and here as a link. Similar claims also appear online, including here and here.", "The claims refer to CDC research that compared county-level data on mask mandates and restaurant reopenings with changes in Covid-19 case and death growth rates.", "State-issued mask mandates were in effect in more than 2,300 US counties during the March-December 2020 period under review.", "\u201cIt is important to note that the study did not examine the effectiveness of masks,\u201d a CDC spokeswoman, told AFP by email.", "OAN claimed the study found that \u201cface masks had a negligible impact on coronavirus numbers that didn\u2019t exceed statistical margins of error.\u201d", "This is incorrect. The study showed, and the spokeswoman confirmed, that the findings related to mask mandates were statistically meaningful.", "\u201cIn this study, mask mandates were associated with reductions in Covid-19 case and death growth rates within 20 days\u201d of the mandate\u2019s implementation, says the study, which includes a table showing that the results were statistically significant up to 100 days after the masking requirement took effect.", "The CDC emphasized that the study noted mask orders were linked to \u201cstatistically significant decreases in county-level daily Covid-19 case and death growth rates.\u201d", "Dr Gery Guy, one of the study\u2019s authors, said in an email that, \u201cmask mandates were associated with a 1.5 percentage point decline in Covid-19 case growth rate each day between 41 and 60 days after implementation.\u201d", "CDC Director Dr Rochelle Walensky referred to the study during a March 5 briefing.", "\u201cIncreases in both daily death rates and Covid cases and deaths slowed significantly within 20 days of putting mask mandates into place,\u201d Walensky said, adding later: \u201cYou have decreases in cases and deaths when you wear masks, and you have increases in cases and deaths when you have in-person restaurant dining.\u201d", "The release of the CDC study comes as states including Texas rescind face covering orders while vaccinations roll out but the nation\u2019s infection rate remains high.", "\u201cCommunity mitigation policies, such as state-issued mask mandates and prohibition of on-premises restaurant dining, have the potential to slow the spread of Covid-19, especially if implemented with other public health strategies,\u201d the study concluded.", "Health authorities including the CDC say that wearing face masks is safe and helps protect against the coronavirus which causes Covid-19 disease. Their effectiveness in limiting potential spread has already been extensively documented.", "\u201cOver the course of the pandemic, the scientific evidence and our understanding of masks have grown. The data we now have conclusively show that widespread use of masks is a very effective way to reduce the spread of Covid-19,\u201d the CDC spokeswoman said.", "AFP Fact Check has debunked numerous false or misleading claims about face masks and Covid-19.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
