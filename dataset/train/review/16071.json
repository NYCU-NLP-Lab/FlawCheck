["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on November 4, 2016", "Donald Trump misleadingly touts\u00a0tax cuts of 30 percent for \u201cworking people\u201d or 35 percent for \u201ca middle-class family with two children,\u201d adding that Hillary Clinton \u201cwants to raise your taxes up to the sky.\u201d\u00a0That distorts both Trump\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s plans.", "Some families could indeed see the cuts to their income tax bills that Trump cites, if they meet certain criteria. But change the criteria, and those tax savings change, too. It\u2019s not a blanket reduction for \u201cmiddle-class\u201d families or \u201cworking people,\u201d as the claims imply.", "In fact, the family cited by Trump\u2019s campaign would see either no tax increase under Clinton\u2019s plan, a decrease or a larger decrease than under Trump\u2019s plan, depending on the age of the kids.", "Here are some reasons why \u201cworking people\u201d or \u201cmiddle-class\u201d families might not receive the large tax cut promised by Trump:", "Separately, a Trump TV ad also claims his plan includes an average \u201c$5,000 tax reduction\u201d for child care expenses. It\u2019s a tax deduction \u2014 which lowers the amount of income subject to taxes \u2014 not a \u201creduction,\u201d or what\u2019s called a tax credit, off the taxes owed.", "To be sure, Trump\u2019s tax plan proposes tax cuts at all income levels, on average, according to analyses by both the Tax Foundation and the Tax Policy Center.\u00a0But an average tax cut doesn\u2019t mean that every household gets one.", "We\u2019ll go through several scenarios on what could happen to a\u00a0household\u2019s tax bill under Trump\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s plans, using tax calculators developed by both the Tax Foundation and the Tax Policy Center.", "In a TV ad that has aired in eight states, the Trump campaign claims that the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s tax plan includes \u201ca 30 percent tax cut\u201d for \u201cworking people.\u201d", "When we asked the campaign about the claim, a spokesman pointed to a specific scenario the campaign has cited before:\u00a0A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses.", "On the campaign trail, Trump\u00a0has come closer to making that specific claim. In talking about what he has recently called the \u201cMiddle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Sanford, Florida:", "Trump, in Sanford, Florida, Oct. 25:\u00a0So essentially a middle-class family with two children will get about a 35 percent tax reduction. Isn\u2019t that nice? It\u2019s about time. The middle class in our country has been devastated. And by the way, crooked Hillary wants to raise your taxes up to the sky. She wants to raise. We are the highest taxed nation in the world. She wants to raise your taxes right up to the sky.", "The same day in Tallahassee, Trump also said \u201cthe tax reduction will give a middle-class family with two children a basic break of 35 percent.\u201d", "True? It depends. It is true if that family fits the scenario the Trump camp cited \u2014 that is, a married couple earning $75,000 with two kids and $10,000 in child care expenses, which Trump would make tax deductible, and at least one child is younger than 13. In fact,\u00a0such a family could see even larger percentage drops in their income tax bill, depending on the ages of the children and whether one spouse or both works.", "If we assume one spouse earns all of the $75,000 and both kids are older than 5 but younger than 13, we get a 43 percent federal income tax reduction using the Tax Policy Center\u2019s tax calculator and a 45 percent reduction using the Tax Foundation\u2019s calculator.", "For all of our examples here, we used the standard, not itemized, deductions for simplicity. Keep in mind they are estimates, as both tax organizations make clear.", "There are differences in how the two calculators work. TPC\u2019s calculator is more comprehensive and includes more adjustable variables. For one, it includes the child and dependent care tax credit, which exists now and would remain under both candidates\u2019 plans. It\u2019s available to our couple earning $75,000, provided they both either work or attend school. And it applies for children under age 13.", "The Tax Foundation\u2019s calculator is simpler and doesn\u2019t include that dependent care tax credit, so we get the same result whether we divide the $75,000 income among the two spouses or not. If we divide the income between the couple using the TPC calculator, we get a tax reduction under Trump\u2019s plan of 30 percent to 32 percent, again, depending on the children\u2019s ages and provided at least one is under 13.", "The age 13 is also important for Trump\u2019s plan, because his child care tax deduction cuts off at that age. As we mentioned, his TV ad claims this is a \u201ctax reduction,\u201d but it\u2019s a deduction, not a tax credit.\u00a0His plan allows\u00a0parents to deduct child care expenses \u2014 up to the average cost in their state \u2014 from their income for up to four children up to age 13. His website says the deduction is limited to those earning under $250,000 a year or $500,000 for couples. And for low-income workers, making under $31,200 a year, he proposes increasing\u00a0the earned income tax credit by an amount\u00a0equal to\u00a0up to half of the payroll taxes paid by the parent earning the lesser amount.", "If a family earning $75,000 has two\u00a0kids 13 or older, and therefore not eligible for the child care deduction, the tax savings could be 14.4 percent according to the TPC calculator and 15 percent under the Tax Foundation\u2019s.", "The Tax Foundation\u2019s calculator only includes an adjustment for the number of children under age 5, a stipulation that matters for Clinton\u2019s plan, which would double the child tax credit for children under that age.", "And what about the tax implications for the hypothetical family earning $75,000 under Clinton\u2019s plan? We found, using both tax calculators, that the family\u2019s tax bill would stay the same as it is under current law, or it could decrease if at least one of the children was under 5. In fact, if both of the kids were under 5, that family could save more than it would under Trump\u2019s plan.", "Under Clinton\u2019s plan, the married couple earning $75,000 with two kids under age 5 and $10,000 in child care expenses could see a reduction in their income taxes of 50 percent, if one spouse worked, and 73.2 percent if both spouses worked.", "Trump was wrong to tell his audience in Sanford, Florida, that a \u201cmiddle-class\u201d family with two kids would \u201cget about a 35 percent tax reduction\u201d under his plan while Clinton \u201cwants to raise your taxes up to the sky.\u201d The hypothetical family his campaign cites wouldn\u2019t see a tax increase under Clinton and could even get a larger tax cut if their children were young.", "As we have written before, the analyses from the Tax Foundation and Tax Policy Center both found that nearly all of the tax increases Clinton has proposed would fall on the top 10 percent of taxpayers. \u201cNearly all of the tax increases would fall on the highest-income 1 percent; on average, low- and middle-income households would see small increases in after-tax income,\u201d the TPC concluded.", "Adjusting the Trump campaign example even just a little yields different results. For instance, a married couple with $70,000 in income, two kids (one under age 5) and $7,000 in child care expenses could save 21 percent, or $418, off its federal tax bill under Trump\u2019s plan. It could save 50 percent, or $1,000, under Clinton\u2019s.", "The tax scenario of one family can differ greatly from another\u2019s. As Roberton Williams, the Sol Price fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told us, it\u2019s possible to\u00a0pick examples to \u201cget whichever answer you want to get.\u201d", "Here are a few more hypothetical families and the varying impact under the two tax plans:", "We used the Tax Policy Center calculator for those numbers, since it\u2019s more comprehensive. But we found the same directional changes \u2014 families paying more or less or the same \u2014 in the Tax Foundation calculator.", "Trump also proposed allowing tax-free contributions, up to $2,000 per year, to dependent care savings accounts, with a 50 percent federal government match for low-income parents who contribute up to $1,000.\u00a0So families who took advantage of that program could lower their taxable income.", "As we stated, we used the standard deduction, but we\u2019ll give one example using itemized deductions. The Tax Policy Center provides examples of taxpayers deducting their mortgage interest, charitable contributions and the like.\u00a0A married couple earning $82,300 with $4,300 in child care expenses (one child under 5, one 13-16) and itemized deductions could save 13.9 percent (or $571) off their total tax bill under Trump\u2019s plan. The family saves $1,000\u00a0under Clinton\u2019s.", "Under Trump\u2019s plan, while on average, every income tax level sees a tax cut, it doesn\u2019t work out that way for everyone.", "As the examples above show, single parents tend to do worse under Trump\u2019s plan than under current law. That\u2019s because he eliminates the head of household filing status, which provides a larger deduction than the single deduction. And families with children under 5 tend to gain under Clinton\u2019s plan because of her doubling of the child tax credit for those children.", "Lily Batchelder, a visiting fellow at the Tax Policy Center and a professor at the New York University School of Law, has calculated that Trump\u2019s plan would increase the tax burden for about 8.7 million families. \u201cAbout 20 percent of households and more than half of single parents would pay more in taxes,\u201d she writes in an Oct. 28 paper.", "Trump\u2019s plan raises the standard deduction and eliminates personal exemptions, which works out fine for families with two kids.\u00a0They\u2019d get $28,800 in standard deductions and personal exemptions under current law, and get $30,000 under the Trump plan. But for a family with three kids, it\u2019s a worse deal \u2014 the normal $32,850 deduction and exemptions for them would be reduced under the Trump plan to the flat $30,000. With four kids or five, the gap between current law and the Trump plan widens.", "Also, the 10 percent tax bracket, which applies to the first $18,550 earned by a married couple under current law, would be eliminated and replaced with a 12 percent bracket.\u00a0Whether this hurts a couple\u2019s tax bill depends on their total earnings, and other factors.", "The Tax Foundation told us it was able to replicate Batchelder\u2019s results. But again, on average, it found middle-income taxpayers would see a tax reduction. \u201cSimply put, the middle class as a whole would see a tax reduction, but some middle\u00a0class families would see a tax increase,\u201d\u00a0Alan Cole,\u00a0an economist with the Tax Foundation, told us.", "The Tax Policy Center, too, estimates an average reduction in federal taxes for all taxpayers combined. For the middle quintile, since Trump was talking about the \u201cmiddle class,\u201d that\u2019s a 3.7 percent average reduction for tax units with children, and an 11.3 percent reduction for all tax units. (See the distributional tables in the PDF document\u00a0here.)", "Some would get a bigger reduction and some would get less, or even pay more in taxes, as we\u2019ve shown. But they\u2019re clearly not all getting a 30 percent or 35 percent tax reduction, as Trump\u2019s claims imply.", "Trump tries to measure the impact of his tax plan as the change in federal taxes owed. But both the TPC and Tax Foundation use the change in after-tax income as their preferred measures in analyzing tax plans. The TPC explains that after-tax income shows the change in income available to buy household necessities relative to what a household had before the tax change.", "Using the change in taxes owed can be misleading, the TPC says. \u201cThe percentage change in tax liability can be particularly misleading because it relies too much on the initial distribution of taxes,\u201d TPC explains in appendices to its reports on the candidates\u2019 plans. \u201cCutting the tax on a person making $1,000 from $50 to $10 is an 80 percent cut, whereas reducing taxes on a person making $1 million from $250,000 to $150,000 is just a 40 percent cut. But the tax savings boosts after-tax income by only about 4 percent for the poorer person, compared with a more than 13 percent increase for the higher-income person.\u201d", "Williams\u00a0notes that Trump\u2019s advisers say he would instruct Congress to make sure taxes on low- and middle-income taxpayers weren\u2019t raised. \u201cCongress would have to modify Trump\u2019s plan significantly to obey that order,\u201d Williams says. Perhaps the only way to do it is to offer both the current tax code and the new one under Trump, from which taxpayers would choose.", "Of course, both candidates\u2019 tax plans would face an uphill battle in Congress.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6f3f3aa3-1e76-4539-a05d-d0cfc6267b68", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
