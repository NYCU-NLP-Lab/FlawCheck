["About this rating", "President Obama opted to attend a visitation for Justice Scalia but did not attend his funeral.", "President Obama didn't fail to pay respect to Justice Scalia or play golf instead of attending his funeral, and Presidents do not historically attend all funerals of Supreme Court justices.", "The 13 February 2016 death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia immediately sparked\u00a0hot political debate and speculation, which hadn't abated by the time the\u00a0White House announced that\u00a0President Barack Obama\u00a0would not be attending his funeral:", "Instead, the president will pay his respects on Friday, when Scalia's body lies in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court building. Vice President Joe Biden will attend Scalia's funeral at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the White House said Wednesday during a press briefing.", "The White House press circuit was immediately abuzz with questions about the President's decision. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked whether Obama's plans \"include golfing\":", "Earnest revealed the president\u2019s plans during the daily briefing, saying Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will go to the Supreme Court on Friday \u201cto pay their respects to Justice Scalia\u201d while the justice lies in repose in the Great Hall. Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden, who share Scalia\u2019s Catholic faith, will be at the services instead.", "Earnest refused to be drawn out about why the president would not attend the funeral, saying he didn\u2019t know what the president plans to do on Saturday, and Scalia\u2019s son, Eugene, did not immediately respond to a question about whether the family requested that Obama not attend the funeral.", "President Obama's decision to not attend the actual funeral was endorsed by people close to Scalia's family:", "\"I wouldn't have expected President Obama to attend the funeral Mass, and I see no reason to fault him for not attending,\" said Ed Whelan, a former Scalia clerk who now heads the Ethics and Public Policy Center. \"The ceremony at the Supreme Court seems the most apt opportunity for the president to pay his respects, but he obviously might have severe competing demands on his time.\"", "The optics of paying his respects to Scalia are tricky for Obama, who would have been the subject of constant cutaways to his reactions and interactions with members of Congress during the funeral, distracting from memorials for the giant of American legal thought.", "Whelan told the New York Times that for Catholics, \"a funeral Mass is first and foremost a funeral, not an event of state.\" The article\u00a0suggested that the possibility of\u00a0disruption was a key factor in the White House's decision to have Vice President Joe Biden attend in his stead:", "Facing questions again about the decision, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, did not offer a direct answer but implied that one reason was the potential for the extensive presidential security detail to be disruptive.", "\u201cObviously, when the vice president travels to some place, his security footprint is at least a little bit lighter ... given his personal relationship with the family and given the president\u2019s desire to find a respectful way to pay tribute to Justice Scalia\u2019s service to the country, we believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement ... Some people actually want to use the funeral of the Supreme Court justice as some sort of political cudgel,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t think that that\u2019s appropriate, and, in fact, what the president thinks is appropriate is respectfully paying tribute to high-profile patriotic American citizens even when you don\u2019t agree on all the issues. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d", "The decision not to attend Scalia's funeral was not without precedent. \u00a0As NBC noted, four out of the past seven funerals for a Supreme Court justice have had either the president or the vice president in attendance (which means nearly half of them didn't):", "Former President George W. Bush attended the funeral for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.", "Former President Bill Clinton attended the funerals for former Chief Justice Warren E.
