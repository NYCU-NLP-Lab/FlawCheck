The company has kept the same can you already know, but when you look closely, you\u2019ll realize that it has swapped out its own name, \"Budweiser,\" for \"America.\" That\u2019s right, Budweiser has renamed its beer America for the summer. \"We thought nothing was more iconic than Budweiser and nothing was more iconic than America,\" says Tosh Hall, creative director at the can\u2019s branding firm JKR.", "It's pretty obvious what Budweiser is doing here. Summer is peak beer-selling season\u2014the entire industry sees a double-digit boost. Since 2011, Budweiser has released special summer-edition cans that feature images such as the American flag and the Statue of Liberty, upping the ante on its red-white-and-blue packaging with a full salute to patriotism\u2014as a nod to Memorial Day, July Fourth, and the quiet American dream of drinking a beer in your backyard while charring various processed meats.", "Summer is peak beer-drinking time, and for years, Budweiser has been using this time of year to release special cans to commemorate the season. This time, instead of just changing the cans, the company\u00a0is temporarily re-branding its product.", "So\u00a0while it it\u00a0true Budweiser was renamed \"America,\" that change is\u00a0only in effect until November 2016.", "Wilson, Mark. \u00a0 \"Budweiser Renames Its Beer 'America.'\"\r\nFast Company. \u00a0 10 May 2016.", "Asssociated Press. \u00a0 \"Budweiser Becomes 'America.'
