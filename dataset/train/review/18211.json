["Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, took the podium during the second night of the Republican National Convention, which followed an opening day that saw speakers make multiple false or misleading claims.", "AFP Fact Check breaks down the claims by Eric Trump below.", "\u201cBiden has pledged to defund the police, and take away your cherished Second Amendment,\u201d Eric Trump said. Both statements are false.", "Biden has said on multiple occasions that he does not want to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d a phrase that became a rallying cry after the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody at the end of May.", "In a June op-ed in USA TODAY, Biden wrote: \u201cWhile I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people\u2019s rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police.\u201d", "And in his first televised joint interview with running mate Kamala Harris, aired on August 23, he told ABC: \u201cI don't want to defund police departments. I think they need more help, they need more assistance.\u201d", "Biden did however agree in a\u00a0conversation\u00a0with activist Ady Barkan that some funding for police could be redirected -- a statement that Vice President Mike Pence used to criticize the Democratic candidate on the third night of the convention.", "Ultimately, funding for the police is a matter decided on the state and local level, meaning that a president\u2019s role in the matter is limited.", "On the issue of guns, Biden wants to enact tougher firearms regulations, but he has not called for gun ownership or the Second Amendment to the US Constitution -- which protects \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms\u201d -- to be \u201ctaken away.\u201d", "\u201cBiden has pledged to raise your taxes by $4 trillion.

This means that Biden\u2019s proposed tax hike would not affect 82 percent of Americans, as McDaniel claimed.", "\u201cNever-ending wars were finally ended,\u201d Eric Trump said when listing his father\u2019s accomplishments.", "But while Donald Trump has cut the number of American soldiers deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq, he has yet to bring US military involvement in either country to a close.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
