["\u201cA 50-year-old man is playing basketball in the female teen league, because he identifies as a young teenager. Mental issues? Prove me wrong,\u201d says text in a March 11, 2021 Facebook post above a photo of a tall transgender woman in a basketball uniform sitting in a room alongside her teammates.", "The claim appears on Facebook, Twitter, and Gab in English, while similar posts also appear in Portuguese and Polish.", "The claim comes as the debate on transgender athletes in women\u2019s sports intensifies in the US, with Mississippi\u2019s governor signing a bill on March 11, 2021 barring transgender women and girls from competing in women\u2019s athletics, a year after Idaho did so.", "Around two dozen other states have considered restrictions on transgender athletes.", "Although the photo in the posts is real, the social media posts falsely claim the person in the foreground identifies as a \u201cyoung teenager\u201d and states that she is currently playing.", "An online search for \u201cMission Saints,\u201d the team name visible on the women\u2019s jerseys, shows that the photo pictures Gabrielle Ludwig, a transgender woman who gained national attention when she joined the Mission College\u2019s women\u2019s basketball team, in California, in 2012.", "Ludwig, who is six feet, six inches tall and played while in her 50s, moved from player to assistant coach for a year following the 2013- 2014 season, Mission Saints Head Coach Corey Cafferata told AFP by phone. Ludwig\u2019s biography on the Mission Saints webpage confirms this.", "\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been an assistant coach for seven years. She played for me eight years ago,\u201d he said, citing age as the main reason for Ludwig\u2019s departure from the team, before she moved out of the area.", "\u201cNo, no that\u2019s not true,\u201d he said of claims that Ludwig identified as a young teenager. \u201cGabbi never said, \u2018I\u2019m an 18-year-old kid\u2019, never. She was a 52-year-old woman that had a full time job, that had a partner at home, and three kids.\u201d", "Ludwig was born in Germany and moved to the US as a child, played basketball as a male in her youth, and served in the US Navy during Operation Desert Storm, all before joining the Mission Saints.", "\u201cThey can\u2019t say that,\u201d Cafferata said of claims that Ludwig was playing in a teen league.", "\u201cThis is a community college, it\u2019s a college league,\u201d he said, adding that most other players were between 18 and 20 years old.", "Cafferata said that she did not particularly stand out athletically compared to the other women: \u201cI would say they were better than Gabbi, because they were younger, they were in better shape.\u201d", "Referring to paperwork affirming her female gender, Cafferata said, \u201cWhen Gabby came to me, she was within the rules.\u201d", "\u201cThis story is so old,\u201d Cafferata said. \u201cThere have been other transgendered people after her who played here, Gabbi was just the first one.\u201d", "Ludwig did not respond to AFP Fact Check\u2019s requests for comment.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
