This makes accurate estimates difficult.", "Kenya\u2019s tourism industry has, like that of many other countries, had a horror year, with some official projections estimating losses could reach as much as KSh13.5 billion (US$125 million).", "Describing the industry as \u201con its knees\u201d, tourism minister Najib Balala on World Tourism Day in September 2020 called for more investment.", "Restrictions put in place in the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic have been gradually rolled back, with international flights resuming on 1 August.", "As the country works to rebuild tourism, we fact-checked two significant claims made by Balala in May 2020 about its value to the country.", "Tourism forms 24% of Kenya's GDP", "The claim was published on the minister\u2019s official Twitter and Facebook accounts, and was greeted with incredulity from a prominent economist.", "We reached out to the minister to ask for the source of these figures and will update this report should he respond.", "For data on how different sectors contribute to Kenya\u2019s economy, John Kinuthia directed us to the annual economic survey from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. Kinuthia is a senior programme officer at the International Budget Partnership, a public finance thinktank.", "The data from the statistics office shows that in 2019, the biggest contribution to Kenya\u2019s gross domestic product, or GDP, was by agriculture.", "\u201cAgriculture remained the dominant sector, accounting for slightly over a third of the total value of the economy,\u201d the agency said in the 2020 edition of the survey.", "The growing of crops contributed 27.8% to GDP. When animal production, agriculture support services, fishing, forestry and logging were also considered, this share rose to 34.1%.", "The data showed other key contributors were transport and storage (8.5%), wholesale and retail trade (7.6%) and manufacturing at 7.5%.", "But the survey does not have data on the GDP contribution of tourism, Kinuthia noted. Africa Check asked the statistics office why this was the case.", "The bureau had no data on tourism\u2019s contribution because it \u201ccuts across many sectors\u201d, Collins Omondi, the acting director general, said.", "This included accommodation, air travel, transport and the service industry. Only a tourism satellite account would accurately show the contribution of tourism to the GDP, Omondi said, adding that Kenya\u2019s Tourism Research Institute was working on capturing this data. Local media have also reported this.", "A satellite account is a widely accepted and comprehensive measure of tourism\u2019s economic value.", "Other data sources however suggest tourism makes a far smaller contribution to the Kenyan economy. These include:", "Between 0.7 and 0.8%, according to a June 2020 report from the planning department in the treasury. This covered 2016 to 2019.

It sent us its methodology, which showed it considered the direct, indirect and \u201cinduced\u201d contribution of tourism to the GDP.", "This spanned accommodation, food, transport, cultural and sports services. For indirect contributions, it included \u201call public and private investments\u201d in tourism such as infrastructure, marketing, aviation and security.", "In countries where there were data gaps, the organisation said these were filled by \u201csupplementing data with estimates derived from the typical relationship between the missing information and other economic and travel and tourism indicators\u201d.

The most recent data on employment from the national statistics office shows that 18.1 million people were employed in Kenya in 2019. Of these, 3.1 million people were formally employed.", "The minister\u2019s figure would work out to a share of at least 9%.

We also came up empty with the UN\u2019s World Tourism Organization.", "The tourism ministry\u2019s own 2018-22 plan gives total unemployment at 9.2%, while a draft national tourism policy says it is 10%.", "In March 2020, the World Travel and Tourism Council gave the same estimate as the minister, of 1.6 million people.", "Africa Check has previously outlined the challenges of defining a job and capturing the informal sector.
