["About this rating", "On 25 February 2016, multiple high-volume Twitter accounts published warnings claiming that the meetup app \"Down to Lunch\" was a tool for human traffickers:", "DOWN TO LUNCH IS A SEX TRAFFICKING APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD pic.twitter.com/rs9MDQJM0b", "\u2014 Dory (@Dory) February 25, 2016", "DOWN TO LUNCH IS A SEX TRAFFICKING APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD pic.twitter.com/ADnDSsVHYQ \u2014 Common White Girl (@CommonWhiteGirI) February 26, 2016", "It was an odd claim, since\u00a0purpose of Down to Lunch was well documented, the app was hugely popular, and there was no information available to substantiate the allegations. A\u00a0TechCrunch profile introduced the app in August 2015 as\u00a0an alternative to group texts:", "Frustrated by how difficult it was to have spur of the moment get-togethers with friends, Stanford classmates Joseph Lau and Nikil Viswanathan spent a Friday afternoon in San Francisco\u2019s SoMa district building what they called Down To Lunch. \u201cI want to emphasize how simple or silly it was,\u201d said Lau. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know who was free, and who was where, and who was able to hang out,\u201d Viswanathan explained. \u201cWe literally made the simplest app we could think of \u2014 which was one button,\u201d joked Lau, describing the app\u2019s speedy development in early March. Perhaps it is Down To Lunch\u2019s straightforwardness that has allowed it to to grow so organically in the face of other full-time competitors like Free, which was co-founded by former Path employees. Unlike competing apps that require users to enter text or downselect into an activity type, Down To Lunch\u2019s simplicity makes it a useful tool without adding extra work for users.", "Between August 2015 and February 2016, Down to Lunch remained a popular app for real-time networking, but on 24 February 2016, a tweet shared a screenshot of an\u00a0App Store review from a few weeks earlier. The review claimed\u00a0that Down to Lunch was a covert trafficking app,\u00a0but the story that it offered (which featured strangers in sunglasses and trench coats, random middle-aged people crashing lunches and talking about photography, and\u00a0\u2014 of course\u00a0\u2014 a creepy van) wasn't substantiated by any evidence:", "DO NOT DOWNLOAD \"DOWN TO LUNCH\" IT IS A SEX TRAFFICKING APP pic.twitter.com/Xzh7EaRYSr \u2014 emily ;; 79 (@sebductive) February 25, 2016", "We contacted Down to Lunch about the sudden viral rumors. Co-founder Nikil Viswanathan told us that the review (since removed) appeared to have kicked\u00a0them off:", "... I actually thought this was pretty funny when I saw it yesterday. Someone wrote a fake app store review (apple flagged it and pulled it down) saying it was human trafficking and to be honest I thought it was a pretty funny review. Turns out it's more serious than we realized. The twitter accounts that are promoting this review turned out to be paid accounts ... This whole situation is ridiculous, hilarious, and flattering - we're just two friends who made this app for fun and its been blowing up all across the country in the last few weeks.", "Down to Lunch tweeted about the claims:", "Pretty stoked to see that people care enough to start a fake smear campaign about DTL!

There were two similarities between the individual rumors: they were of the always-popular \"human trafficking warning\" sort, and they took off after \"Common White Girl\" style accounts shared the rumor. \u00a0Those accounts frequently shared such content to generate traffic for\u00a0Twitter accounts:", "Where @TweetLikeAGirl sourced\u00a0the message from was unclear, and neither the sender nor the\u00a0recipient of the depicted text message was identified. That Twitter account is quite popular (with more than 1.3 million followers), however, and is identified in its description as a \"parody account.\" While some followers may have mistaken the tweet for a first-person tale, it was not: all the content on that particular timeline was\u00a0aggregated from other sources.", "The account's owner likely received an impressive\u00a0response to the human trafficking warning tweet above, as roughly an hour after posting it he\u00a0tweeted a similar (false) warning about a shopper's purported encounter with human traffickers in an Oklahoma Hobby Lobby store:", "A November 2014\u00a0BuzzFeed\u00a0article\u00a0(\"Meet the Network of Guys Making Thousands of Dollars Tweeting As 'Common White Girls'\") included comments from\u00a0Cameron Asa, a 21-year-old college student behind some of the accounts involved in the June 2015 claims. Asa explained to\u00a0BuzzFeed\u00a0how sharing breathless warning tweets was a lucrative content game for popular Twitter feeds:", "Asa's new game is keeping his account relevant and relatable \u2014 and it's working. He's now pulling in pretty massive money. He was a little uncomfortable discussing the amount he makes per retweet, but he said that it can be as high as hundreds of dollars.", "\"Lately I've been posting for different apps, and it can range from anywhere from $500 - $1,000 per post \u2014 it's awesome,\" Asa said. \"I actually did an app tweet last week and I ended up getting the app 20,000 downloads off one tweet.\"", "Warnings about human or sex trafficking are almost guaranteed to reach near-instant virality (the claim about Down to Lunch wasn't even the only rumor of that type that we saw\u00a0circulating\u00a0on 25 February 2016), and while the\u00a0intent of the Down to Lunch reviewer remained to be seen, the rumor was predictably\u00a0shared by opportunistic Twitter accounts which seem to exist solely to collect retweets and earn money.", "While the issue of human trafficking is\u00a0real and extremely serious (explained here by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime), Down to Lunch was in no way a risk for users based on its functionality and the ways in which trafficking typically occur. The app\u00a0uses\u00a0a device's contact list to simplify the process of coordinating social meetings between friends, and no aspect of it appeared to expose user information in an unsafe way.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
