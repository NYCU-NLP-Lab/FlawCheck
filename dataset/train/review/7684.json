It's also unlikely that the three former presidents posted and subsequently deleted the tweets. Messages sent from President Obama and Clinton are routinely retweeted thousands of times (Bush hasn't used the service since 2010) yet we found no retweets linking back to the original messages.", "Furthermore, it would be highly unlikely for these three former presidents to coordinate a social media joke simply to mock President Trump, before getting cold feed and deleting their posts without being detected by a mainstream media source.", "It is true that Obama, Clinton, and Bush all won presidential elections on their first attempts. Trump's claim that he won the presidency on his first try, however, is a matter of debate (and of how serious one considers his first attempt). He ran for the nomination of the Reform Party in 2000 and appeared on the primary ballot in two states. Trump withdrew from the race before the election.", "Although the 2000 campaign was the only time Trump actually entered any primary races prior to 2016, the real estate mogul toyed with the idea so often that his political aspirations found their way onto the popular cartoon show The Simpsons.", "Helmore, Edward. \u00a0 \"How Trump\u2019s Political Playbook Evolved Since He First Ran for President in 2000.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Guardian. \u00a0 5 February 2017.", "TV Guide. \u00a0 \"Here's a Timeline of Every Time Donald Trump Ran for President.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 18 July 2015.", "Helmore, Edward. \u00a0 \"How Trump\u2019s Political Playbook Evolved Since He First Ran for President in 2000.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Guardian. \u00a0 5 February 2017.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
