["By Brooks Jackson", "Posted on August 23, 2018", "A Democratic ad revives long-discredited claims of corruption and shady dealing by GOP Rep. Steve Pearce of New Mexico. We thoroughly debunked those same claims\u00a0eight years ago. And unlike wine and whiskey, political mud doesn\u2019t improve with age.", "Pearce is now running for governor. The ad was launched Aug. 21 by \u201cStronger New Mexico,\u201d a group backed by the Democratic Governors Association.", "The ad states that Pearce was \u201ctwice named one of the most corrupt members of Congress by an independent watchdog group.\u201d Overall, it insinuates a corrupt bargain for which we find no basis in fact.", "The group that called Pearce \u201ccorrupt\u201d is Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which has a Democratic tilt. Its current chairman\u00a0(and co-founder), for example, is Norman Eisen, who was President Barack Obama\u2019s White House ethics adviser from 2009 to 2011, and later his ambassador to the Czech Republic.", "Pearce was one of 18 Republicans on CREW\u2019s 2007 list of \u201cmost corrupt\u201d House and Senate members, which named only four Democrats. The following year Pearce was among 14 Republicans and six Democrats to be named \u201cmost corrupt.\u201d", "More important, CREW based its 2007 claim of corruption primarily on what it said was \u201chis failure to properly report a transaction on his financial disclosure report\u201d in 2003. In that transaction, Pearce sold the assets of his oilfield equipment leasing business for a reported $12 million.", "Trouble is, Pearce wasn\u2019t legally required to report that transaction, according to an official ruling from the House Ethics Committee,\u00a0which Pearce sought and obtained shortly after CREW posted its 2007 report.", "Nevertheless, CREW again named Pearce to its \u201cmost corrupt\u201d list in 2008, citing the same issue. CREW later admitted that it had \u201cerred\u201d in failing to discover and mention the ethics panel\u2019s ruling clearing Pearce. But it did not retract its \u201ccorrupt\u201d label and said \u201cwe stand by our original interpretation\u201d that the law required disclosure.", "In fact, the sale was no secret. Pearce did report ownership of the company, Lea Fishing Tools Inc., in his financial disclosure reports covering 2002 and 2003. He valued his stake at between $1 million and $5 million. On Oct. 8, 2003,\u00a0the Associated Press reported that Pearce had finalized a deal to sell the company to Key Energy Services, though no price was mentioned.", "The AP quoted a Pearce spokeswoman as saying the congressman was having trouble finding time to run the business.\u00a0\u201cThe Pearces felt like it was putting unnecessary stress on them and the business,\u201d she said. The AP didn\u2019t mention a price, however.", "When the newspaper Roll Call dug into the matter in early 2008, it reported that Pearce received about $12 million for the company \u2014 far above the value he placed on it in his disclosures. And Roll Call also found that an executive of Key Energy had testified at a House field hearing co-chaired by Pearce about six weeks before the deal closed.", "Based on a selective reading of that decade-old story, the DGA-backed ad says, \u201cHe made millions selling his company\u2019s assets for twice its stated value, to an oil company that testified before his task force.\u201d On screen appear the words, \u201cSteve Pearce cut deal with oil company,\u201d citing the Roll Call story.", "Left out of the ad is that the newspaper also reported: \u201cRoll Call found no evidence that Pearce has taken any legislative action to specifically benefit Key Energy Services.\u201d And no evidence has surfaced to indicate that Key Energy paid more than fair market value when it bought out Pearce\u2019s company.", "Pearce\u2019s spokesman told Roll Call that the value reported on the congressman\u2019s disclosure report was based on the depreciated value of its assets. The price paid by Key Energy was based on its value as a going concern.", "Roll Call reported, \u201cIn its announcement of the purchase, Key said it anticipated Pearce\u2019s company would generate $8 million a year in revenues.\u201d Paying $12 million to get an annual revenue stream of $8 million hardly amounts to a sweetheart deal.", "Pearce is running this fall against Democratic Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham to replace\u00a0two-term Gov. Susana Martinez, who is prevented by term limits from running for a third term.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
