["By Robert Farley, D'Angelo Gore and Lori Robertson", "Posted on July 23, 2019", "President Donald Trump and his top immigration adviser continue to criticize\u00a0four progressive Democratic congresswomen known as \u201cthe squad,\u201d but some of their claims twist the women\u2019s words.", "We\u2019ve dealt with a couple of these assertions\u00a0before, including a false claim that Rep. Ilhan Omar has expressed pride for al Qaeda. But Trump and senior adviser Stephen Miller have pointed to other instances in which they claim the lawmakers expressed anti-American or anti-Semitic remarks. Below, we present some of these claims and a fuller context of the comments made by the congresswomen.", "The president sparked controversy with  tweets on July 14 telling the four lawmakers \u2014 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar \u2014 to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested [countries] from which they came.\u201d", "The controversy continued when, during Trump\u2019s extended criticism of Omar at a rally in North Carolina on July 17, audience members began chanting, \u201cSend her back.\u201d The next day, Trump said he was \u201cnot happy when I heard that chant.\u201d He claimed that he tried to quell the chants by \u201cspeaking very quickly.\u201d But the video shows he did not.", "Since then, Trump has kept up his attacks, saying recently of the congresswomen, \u201cthey\u2019re very bad for our country\u201d and tweeting that they are \u201ca very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart.\u201d Miller went on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d to defend the president\u2019s words. The two continued, however, to back up their criticism with some claims that distort what\u00a0the lawmakers actually said. In other cases, more context may be helpful to readers.", "The claim: Ocasio-Cortez \u201ccall[s] our country and our people \u2018garbage.'\u201d \u2014\u00a0Trump, remarks at the White House, July 19\n\u201cShe\u2019s saying that America in her view right now is garbage.\u201d \u2014 Miller, \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d July 21", "What Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cBut where we are is not a good thing.

Those kinds of policies may sound \u201cradical,\u201d she said, but only because of \u201ca slow erosion \u2026 away from what we\u2019ve always been.\u201d", "\u201cAnd I think the thing that is really hard for people to sometimes see, is that we are on this path of a slow erosion, and a slow, slow, slow move away from what we\u2019ve always been,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cSo when someone is talking about our core, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh this is radical.\u2019 But this isn\u2019t radical, this is what we\u2019ve always been. It\u2019s just that now we\u2019ve strayed so far away from what has really made us powerful and just and good and equitable and productive. And so, I think all of these things sound radical compared to where we are. But where we are is not a good thing. This idea of 10 percent better from garbage shouldn\u2019t be what we settle for. It feels like moderate is not a stance, it\u2019s just an attitude toward life of like, \u2018meh.'\u201d", "On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d host Chris Wallace questioned Trump\u2019s characterization of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s use of the word \u201cgarbage.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t say the country was garbage,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cShe said some of the policies she opposes are garbage. \u2026 She said: This idea of 10 percent better from garbage shouldn\u2019t be what we settle for. She\u2019s talking about her proposal.\u201d", "Miller responded that it is \u201cliterally impossible to read the quote that way.\u201d", "\u201cHer point is we\u2019re starting at garbage, so I want to go a little better than garbage,\u201d Miller said. \u201cShe\u2019s saying that America in her view right now is garbage.\u201d", "It is certainly arguable that Ocasio-Cortez was saying that the starting point on some policies in the U.S. is garbage.

It has since been deleted.", "To be clear, we could find no evidence that any of the four congresswomen have ever uttered the phrase \u201cevil Jews.\u201d", "The president is likely referring to Omar\u2019s November 2012 tweet above. At the time, Omar was a child-nutrition outreach coordinator for the Minnesota Department of Education.", "In May 2018, while Omar was serving as a state senator in Minnesota, a conservative blogger resurfaced the tweet, and cited it as evidence that Omar is a \u201cproud Jew hater.\u201d Omar responded, via Twitter on May 31, 2018, saying, \u201cDrawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews.\u201d She followed that tweet with another one that sarcastically read, \u201cWell you know, if a Muslim says something negative about Israeli government, they must hate Jews. Didn\u2019t you get that memo.\u201d", "When asked about the tweet in a CNN interview in January, Omar again defended it, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know how my comments would be offensive to Jewish Americans. My comments precisely are addressing what was happening during the Gaza War and I\u2019m clearly speaking about the way the Israeli regime was conducting itself in that war.\u201d", "But after the CNN interview, Omar tweeted\u00a0that she \u201cheard from Jewish orgs. that my use of the word \u2018Hypnotize\u2019 and the ugly sentiment it holds was offensive.\u201d As New York Times columnist Bari Weiss put it, the term played into the conspiracy theory of Jewish people as \u201cthe duplicitous manipulator.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s now apparent to me that I spent lots of energy putting my 2012 tweet in context and little energy is disavowing the anti-semitic trope I unknowingly used, which is unfortunate and offensive,\u201d\u00a0Omar said via Twitter. She added that her comments about the Israeli government\u2019s actions were not an attack on people of Jewish faith. \u201cIt is important to distinguish between criticizing a military action by a government and attacking a particular people of faith,\u201d Omar said.", "In an interview on \u201cThe Daily Show with Trevor Noah,\u201d Omar reiterated that her criticism of actions by the Israeli government were not attacks on the Jewish faith.", "Omar has drawn criticism for other, more recent, tweets she has posted about Israel. In February, she again came under fire for a tweet in which she responded to a report that House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy was threatening to punish Omar and Tlaib for their criticism of Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins baby,\u201d Omar tweeted, drawing rebuke from Democratic and Republican leaders who said it drew on anti-Semitic narratives about money from wealthy Jewish people unduly influencing world politics.", "Omar later released a statement saying she \u201cunequivocally\u201d apologized for the comment.", "\u201cAnti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,\u201d Omar said. \u201cMy intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole. We have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity. This is why I unequivocally apologize. At the same time, I reaffirm the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be AIPAC, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry. It\u2019s gone on too long and we must be willing to address it.\u201d", "Omar created further controversy, when, at a forum at a Washington, D.C., bookstore on Feb. 27, she said, \u201cI want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.\u201d", "In the wake of the backlash, the House passed a resolution on March 7 condemning anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism and other forms of bigotry. Although it did not name Omar, the resolution condemned \u201cimputations of dual loyalty\u201d and stated that, \u201caccusing Jews of being more loyal to Israel or to the Jewish community than to the United States constitutes anti-Semitism because it suggests that Jewish citizens cannot be patriotic Americans and trusted neighbors, when Jews have loyally served our Nation every day since its founding.\u201d Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Tlaib all voted for it.", "Omar and Tlaib have been outspoken supporters of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for individuals and companies to boycott and divest from Israel over its policies toward Palestinians. On July 19, Trump said\u00a0Omar had that week \u201cput in a sanctions bill against Israel, and other things beyond sanctions.\u201d On July 16, Omar introduced a resolution \u201c[a]ffirming that all Americans have the right to participate in boycotts in pursuit of civil and human rights at home and abroad, as protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution.\u201d That resolution stands in contrast to a bipartisan resolution introduced in March \u201c[o]pposing efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel and the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel.\u201d The resolution in opposition to BDS has 346 cosponsors.", "Clearly, Omar\u2019s policies and comments about Israel have rankled some of her colleagues in Congress \u2014 both Republicans and Democrats. But neither she, nor any other member of \u201cthe squad,\u201d has used the term \u201cevil Jews.\u201d", "The claim: \u201cSaying, as Rep. Ocasio-Cortez did, that illegal immigrants are in effect more American than Americans is fundamentally an anti-American statement.\u201d \u2014 Miller, \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d July 21", "\u201cCortez said that illegal immigrants are more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be.\u201d \u2014 Trump,\u00a0political rally in North Carolina, July 17", "What Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cEvery day, immigrants commit crimes at a far lower rate than native-born Americans. And not only that, but the women and children on that border that are trying to seek refuge and seek opportunity in the United States of America with nothing but the shirt on their backs are acting more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be.\u201d \u2014 interview on MSNBC, Jan. 8", "Ocasio-Cortez made this statement in early January on \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d during the government shutdown,\u00a0speaking after Trump gave a speech from the Oval Office on illegal immigration and his request for funding for a border wall. Ocasio-Cortez referred to \u201cwomen and children on the border\u201d seeking \u201crefuge,\u201d not all \u201cillegal immigrants,\u201d as Trump and Miller said. She also didn\u2019t say they are \u201cmore American than Americans,\u201d as Miller claimed, but rather they \u201care acting more American\u201d than anyone \u201cwho seeks to keep them out.\u201d", "Later in the show, Ocasio-Cortez said these women and children were \u201cacting more in an American tradition\u201d than the president: \u201cAnd again, those women and children trying to come here with nothing but the shirts on their back to create an opportunity and to provide for this nation are acting more in an American tradition than this president is right now,\u201d she said.", "The claim:\u00a0\u201cShe thinks that people with the same skin color, all need to think the same. She said we don\u2019t need any more brown faces that don\u2019t want to be brown voices. We don\u2019t need black faces, that don\u2019t want to be a black voice.\u201d \u2014 Trump, political rally in North Carolina, July 17", "\u201cYou saw from Congresswoman Pressley this week that she was saying that if you are \u2014 if you\u2019re brown, you have to speak like a brown person; if you\u2019re black, you have to speak like a black person. That\u2019s the kind of ideology the president is rejecting.\u201d \u2014 Miller, \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d", "What Pressley said: \u201cYes, I do quote Shirley Chisholm a lot, who said, \u2018if they don\u2019t give you a seat at the table, bring your own folding chair.\u2019 But I\u2019ve amended that because I don\u2019t want to bring a chair to an old table. This is the time to shake the table. This is the time to redefine that table. Because if you\u2019re going to come to this table \u2014 and for all of you that have aspirations of running for office \u2014 for whatever lived experience and identity that you represent, if you are not prepared to come to that table and to represent that voice, don\u2019t come. Because we don\u2019t need any more brown faces that don\u2019t want to be a brown voice. We don\u2019t need black faces that don\u2019t want to be a black voice.
