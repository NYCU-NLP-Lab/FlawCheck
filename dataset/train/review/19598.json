["\u201cIt is illegal to lock your car doors in downtown Churchill, Manitoba in case someone needs to escape from a polar bear,\u201d according to Facebook posts, most featuring a photo of a polar bear peeking inside of a car.", "The claim resurfaced in April 2020, but can be found online as far back as 2011. It was mostly shared on Facebook pages dedicated to \u201cfun facts\u201d about the world.", "In the United States, police departments in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Maine and New Jersey also contributed to the claim\u2019s virality, by sharing it on Facebook as a way to remind their respective communities that, in the absence of polar bears, people should lock their car doors.", "However, no municipal law forbids Churchill residents from\u00a0locking their car doors.", "\u201cThere is no current law in place in Churchill that requires residents to not lock their vehicle doors,\u201d Paul Manaigre, a spokesman for the RCMP in Manitoba, the province that Churchill belongs to, told AFP by email.", "But the claim is grounded in some truth. Churchill, population 900, is known for\u00a0frequent polar bear visits when the ice on the nearby Hudson Bay melts in the warmer months.", "According to Manaigre, \u201cIt is common knowledge that polar bears may enter the community at any time, and those that may need to seek shelter from a polar bear can use a vehicle, as most people will leave them unlocked for this purpose.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s just a common practice to leave your doors open. I never lock my car doors in my personal vehicle,\u201d Erica Gillis, a research technician at the Churchill Northern Studies Centre, told AFP.", "She explained that this custom is partly due to the polar bear threat, but also because Churchill is a remote, isolated community not accessible by road. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many roads other than the main street,\u201d Gillis added.", "There is an estimated\u00a0population of 935 polar bears in the western Hudson Bay area, where Churchill sits. As a response to the frequent bear visits, the town established a polar bear alert program. A team tranquilizes the animals if they enter town and takes them to a polar bear holding center, known by locals as\u00a0the polar bear jail.", "Thanks to the program, the Manitoba town has not had a bear-related fatality since the early 1980s.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
