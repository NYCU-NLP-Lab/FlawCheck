In 2012, Archibong was one of four council members who voted against a pay raise that still passed by a 10-4 margin.", "Archibong represents the District 5 seat on the council, which includes several east Atlanta neighborhoods located in Fulton and DeKalb counties. An attorney in private practice, Archibong was first elected in 2001 and is hoping to be re-elected to a fourth four-year term.", "The District 5 council race has become particularly nasty in its final days, with accusations flying back and forth among the four candidates. On Thursday, Archibong filed a lawsuit in DeKalb County against Rinker and candidate Christian Enterkin, accusing them of slander. Enterkin also claimed in a flier that Archibong was late or absent to council meetings 90 percent of the time in 2011 and 2012. Enterkin\u2019s flier did not mention Rinker\u2019s claim that Archibong voted herself a pay raise.", "DeKalb County Superior Court Judge Gregory Adams denied Archibong\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order of statements about the councilwoman\u2019s attendance record and other claims about her.", "The city convenes a panel of citizens once every four years to review the salaries of the mayor and the council. In 2004, the panel met and proposed raising the council\u2019s pay from about $32,000 to $39,473. In March 2005, the council voted by a 9-3 margin to approve the pay raise. Archibong supported the salary increase and voted in favor of it.

Those records show Archibong has missed just one council meeting this year and two meetings per year in 2011 and 2012. They show she didn\u2019t miss any council meetings in 2009 and 2010. Council records, though, raised some questions about Archibong\u2019s punctuality.", "Our review of City Council meeting minutes since the beginning of 2010 shows Archibong was either absent or not listed as present when the meeting convened about 75 percent of the time.

The news website East Atlanta Patch published a spreadsheet that concluded Archibong was either absent or late 78.6 percent of the time during the same time frame.", "The council often hands out proclamations to citizens and visiting dignitaries at the beginning of meetings and then allows time for public comments before voting on legislation that is on its agenda. It is often 30 minutes to one hour before the council actually gets to the agenda. Most council members sit through the proclamations and public comments. Others, instead, hold sidebar conversations with their colleagues or administration officials or conduct other activities.", "\"I don't sit through proclamations,\" Archibong told us. \"I'm at work though, because the Committee on Council precedes the full council meeting.\"", "The Committee on Council is a semimonthly gathering of select council members who discuss council administrative issues.
