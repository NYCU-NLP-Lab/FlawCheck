And in typical drive-by-media fashion, he said, reporters rushed to spread lies when the news broke and were just as quick to exit when the facts emerged.", "\"MSNBC went to paid programming while they had editorial conferences to figure out how to deal with this!\" Limbaugh said, and emphasized the point later in his program. \"MSNBC, like I said, practically went off the air for a while to have behind-closed-doors meetings to figure out how to deal with this new revelation.\"", "We wondered did MSNBC interrupt\u00a0their programming for an extended commercial break after the details of Brown\u2019s theft were released?", "Pressing matters", "We should note that the timeline of the revelations is fragmented.

Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon. Johnson expressed his frustration at the Ferguson police\u2019s handling of the case. That press conference lasted from 12:09 p.m \u00a0to 12:45 p.m. Eastern.", "As for the surveillance video Jackson alluded to in his morning briefing, the exact timing of the full footage release is unclear, with dissonance between the three major cable networks.", "To the best of our knowledge, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch was one of the first -- if not, the first -- news outlet to air the video at noon Eastern. MSNBC led with the footage minutes later on Andrea Mitchell, after the show began at noon. Fox News aired it 40 minutes later. On CNN\u2019s Wolf, reporter Don Lemon said at 1:13 p.m. that the network still didn\u2019t have the tape in its hands.
