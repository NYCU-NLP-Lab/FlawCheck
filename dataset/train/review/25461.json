["U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff has drawn conservative fire for his role in the impeachment hearings, and a recent Facebook post attempts to tie the California Democrat to the late Jeffrey Epstein, the financier accused of sexually assaulting underage girls.", "In a photo published on Facebook on Nov. 24, Schiff appears to be sitting cozily on a couch with Epstein.", "\"Apparently they were buddies,\" the poster wrote. \"Which one is (was) the most sleazy?\"", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "That\u2019s because the image is doctored \u2014 and this isn\u2019t the first to feature Epstein edited into a photo. Earlier this year we debunked a post that claimed to show Epstein smirking while President Donald Trump inappropriately touched a young girl.", "The original image in this most recent Facebook post shows Schiff sitting with his father, not Epstein.", "He tweeted the picture on Nov. 22, 2018, saying: \"Eve and I are spending a wonderful Thanksgiving with my 90 year old Dad, Ed, and cousins Karen and Julia. Alexa is away for her studies and Eli is our photographer! Wishing you and your family a Happy Thanksgiving!\"", "The image that appears on Facebook also appears manipulated to make it look like a sex toy is resting on a table by the couch. It isn\u2019t in the original image.", "We rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "Facebook post, Nov. 24, 2019", "The New York Times, Jeffrey Epstein is indicted on sex charges as discovery of nude photos is disclosed, July 8, 2019", "Adam Schiff tweet, Nov. 22, 2018", "PolitiFact, This image of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein is doctored, July 10, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
