["About this rating", "On 14 April 2016, a\u00a0Facebook page called \"The Modular Body\" published a video purportedly showing a fleshy creature (named Oscar)\u00a0whose parts could be arranged in different formations:", "The page led to a web site, also called \"The Modular Body,\" where more clips could be viewed. \u00a0While the video\u00a0(which was\u00a0viewed more than 6 million times within two days of its initial posting) left many viewers wondering whether what they had just witnessed was real, \"The Modular Body\" page was up front about what the video actually showed: it is a sci-fi web series\u00a0that deals in speculative fiction, not documentary films:", "THE MODULAR BODY, an online SciFi story about a near future where the body is not a closed circuit, but a modular lifeform -- by Floris Kaayk", "In an interview with\u00a0The Creator's Project,\u00a0Kaayk, a Dutch filmmaker, explained that\u00a0researcher Cornelis Vlasman and his creation, \"Oscar,\"\u00a0are\u00a0fictional characters:", "\u201cUsually the headlines of those kind of articles present it as if it's already possible to create operational organs with currently available technology,\u201d Kaayk says. \u201cIf you start to read further, you'll discover that this field of research is still in a very early stage. It's not possible yet to print functioning, vascularized organs\u2014maybe in 30-40 years, but right now it's science fiction.", "\u201cI thought: Why would we print an organ exactly in the same shape as the one we already have? Why wouldn't we use this opportunity to improve it?\u201d Kaayk recalls. \u201cOr even more extreme: if we can print organs and body parts, why not completely redefine and redesign the human body? That's when I started approaching the current human body as a closed system. Difficult to repair or adapt, maybe even obsolete. An open, modular system could become immortal, and adaptable.\u201d", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
