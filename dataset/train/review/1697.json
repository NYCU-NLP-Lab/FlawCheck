["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on November 29, 2017", "Rep. Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House tax-writing committee, made misleading claims about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by the House earlier this month:", "Brady made his remarks on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d when he was asked if the House tax plan cuts\u00a0taxes \u201con people who don\u2019t pay taxes\u201d and raises taxes \u201con the people who pay taxes.\u201d In his answer, Brady talked about taxpayers with income of up to $200,000, which he described as the \u201crange of middle class \u2026 that we all worry about.\u201d", "Brady, Nov. 26:\u00a0The answer is no. We provide tax relief at every level under the House tax reform plan that we passed; 70 percent of the tax relief goes to those families making less than 200,000.", "As we have written, both parties have emphasized the impact of the tax plan on the so-called \u201cmiddle class.\u201d", "The House Democrats have criticized the plan as a windfall for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. They cite, among other things, provisions in the House bill that would cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, abolish the\u00a0alternative minimum tax, eliminate most itemized deductions and abolish the estate tax.", "The House Republicans \u2014 as Brady has done \u2014 say the bill will provide tax relief at every level. They cite the House bill\u2019s provisions that would increase the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600, create a new family tax credit of $300 per parent and non-child dependent, and\u00a0nearly double the standard deduction to $24,400 ($12,200 for single taxpayers).", "The bill would also collapse the seven income tax brackets, ranging from\u00a010 percent to 39.6 percent, to four (12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent).", "First, let\u2019s look at Brady\u2019s claim about families making less than $200,000 receiving most of the tax relief under the House bill.", "Brady, the chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, got the 70 percent figure from a Nov. 13 analysis of the House tax plan by the\u00a0Joint Committee on Taxation, the official congressional scorekeepers. But his committee spokesperson said Brady was not referring to the entire tax plan \u2014 just the changes to the individual income tax code for the year 2019.", "The JCT report indeed shows (first chart on page 6) that the individual income tax side of the House proposal would reduce taxes by $121.8 billion in 2019, and about $84 billion of that, or 69 percent, would go to those earning $200,000 or less.", "But cherry-picking one piece of the tax plan and looking at just one year ignores the overall impact of the legislation and how the impact on taxpayers changes over time.", "The JCT analysis provided multiple charts that estimate the impact of the tax changes on various income groups over 10 years in two-year increments. One of the charts measures the change in federal business and individual income taxes by income group for 2019, 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027. Using that chart, we calculated that 57.7 percent of the tax relief goes to those families making less than $200,000 in 2019 \u2014 not the 70 percent that Brady cited for 2019.", "By 2027, 50 percent of tax relief as a result of business and individual income tax changes would go to those making more than $200,000 a year.", "A spokesperson for the Ways and Means Committee said that Brady used the JCT estimate for individual income taxes, rather than its estimate that combines business and individual taxes, because the chairman believes the JCT underestimates the benefits of the business cuts on \u201cmiddle-class\u201d taxpayers.", "As we have written, JCT and\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office estimate that 25 percent of the corporate tax burden falls on workers. But Brady sides with economists who say it is higher than that, which would mean that corporate tax cuts would benefit workers more than estimated by the JCT.", "Brady made none of that clear in his interview. Instead, Brady cherry-picked the findings of the JCT report to present a more favorable tax outcome for the \u201cmiddle class\u201d than contained in the congressional analysis.", "Brady also misled viewers when he claimed that the House bill provides \u201ctax relief at every level.\u201d", "JCT doesn\u2019t explain why, but its analysis shows that some income groups would pay more in taxes\u00a0beginning in 2023. That also happens to be the year that the House bill ends the new family tax credit. This new tax credit (in section 1101 of the bill) would provide families with a $300 tax credit per parent and non-child dependent, but only until Jan. 1, 2023.", "In 2023, for example, taxes would increase compared with current law by $302 million for those earning less than $10,000 and nearly $1.9 billion for those earning between $20,000 and $30,000. (See chart below.)", "In unveiling the tax bill, House Speaker Paul Ryan touted that a typical family of four (with a median household income of\u00a0$59,000) would see a $1,182 tax cut. But\u00a0David Kamin, a professor at New York University School of Law who served as a special assistant to President Obama for economic policy, writes that Ryan\u2019s hypothetical family would have to pay more in taxes beginning in 2024, in part because of the expiration of the new family tax credit.", "Over time, those in the upper-income categories would pay more in taxes, too.", "Why?\u00a0Howard Gleckman,\u00a0a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us that\u2019s in large part because the House bill would use a less generous measure of inflation to index tax brackets.", "Under the current tax code, the IRS uses the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers to adjust tax bracket thresholds for inflation. But the House bill would switch to an index known as chained CPI.\u00a0As we have written, chained CPI is considered a more accurate measure, but it would mean bracket thresholds would rise more slowly and push more people into higher tax brackets.", "The JCT analysis shows that those with incomes between $200,000 and $500,000 would pay more in taxes in 2023 and 2025 than under current law, and those earning between $500,000 and $1 million would pay more in taxes in 2023.", "\u201cThe changed pattern in the later years is because of the expiration of the family credits and the effects of the chained CPI,\u201d Gleckman told us in an email.", "We should also note that even in the earlier years there will be winners and losers, despite Brady\u2019s claim that\u00a0the House bill provides \u201ctax relief at every level.\u201d TPC estimates that about 7 percent of households in 2018 would pay an average of $2,100 more in taxes under the House bill, and that nearly one-quarter would pay more in 2027.", "\u201cThe bills\u2019 effects on individual households would be highly idiosyncratic and will depend on where you live, how many children you have, and how you make your living,\u201d Gleckman told us. \u201cIf you live in a high tax state with lots of kids, and get paid a salary, you likely will lose. If you have one child, live in a low-tax state, and own investment partnerships, you will do very well.\u201d", "A House Ways and Means Committee spokesperson told us that the economic benefits of the tax plan will result in higher wages and offset the tax increases projected by the JCT. That\u2019s a matter of dispute.", "The CBO, in cooperation with the JCT, is required by law to produce a \u201cdynamic\u201d analysis that accounts for the economic impact of major legislation. But it\u00a0did not have time before the Nov. 16 House vote to conduct such an analysis. It still hasn\u2019t done one, although the Washington Post reports that congressional analysts are rushing to get one done before the Senate vote \u2014 a vote that could come as early as Dec. 1.", "Brady ended his answer on \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d by saying: \u201cAt the end of the day, I think everyone is going to keep more of what they earned.\u201d But that\u2019s not a promise he can make.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
