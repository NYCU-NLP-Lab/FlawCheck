The box reads \u201cAbortion Barbie\u201d, in a font similar to that used by Mattel, the US toy company which has manufactured Barbie dolls since 1959.", "Many of the comments under the post were from people who recognised that the doll was not a genuine product available for sale, but others expressed horror or disgust.", "\u201cWhat the hell??? If you buy this you have just as much issues as the person who came up with this idea,\u201d wrote one user.", "Under another version of the post, a user wrote: \u201cThis is so sad, Dear heavenly father please take this away from our childrens hands.\u201d", "But even a quick look at the photo indicates that the doll was fabricated as part of a political campaign. \u201cWendy Davis for Texas State Governor,\u201d the box reads in the bottom right-hand corner.", "Davis, a 55-year-old American lawyer, ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate in the 2014 Texas gubernatorial election.", "Her conservative critics had nicknamed her \u201cAbortion Barbie\u201d in reference to her long blonde hair and passionate stance against highly restrictive abortion laws in Texas.

He posted a video on his website which shows him putting the box together.", "The same page on his website includes a photo of this homemade boxed doll sitting on a cutting mat of the type used for handicrafts.
