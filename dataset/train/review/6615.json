The firearm that Elmore decided to break down and clean was his M24 Sniper Riffle (officially referred to as the M24 Sniper Weapon System).", "At approximately 1:50 AM \u2013 after cleaning and reassembling the rifle, Elmore rested it on the sill of his bedroom window to adjust its scope. While adjusting the scope it unintentionally landed on one of his neighbor across the street\u2019s open windows; Elmore told police and reporters that he was amazed at what he saw happening inside ... What Elmore saw through the high-powered scope on his riffle was \u2013 his neighbors, Fredrick and Lydia Cole tied to chairs in their upstairs family-room. The couple\u2019s 2-children Douglas (11-years-old) and Daniel (6-years-old) were sitting near their mother \u2013 also tied to kitchen-style chairs ... According to Elmore, while waiting for the police to arrive things continue to escalate rapidly at the Cole residence and he was greatly concerned for the family\u2019s safety.
