["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on December 18, 2019", "Memes spread on Facebook falsely purport to quote a passage about lying from President Donald Trump\u2019s 1987 book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d", "President Donald Trump\u2019s 1987 book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d includes a passage about how he uses \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d \u2014 or exaggeration \u2014 to promote his interests.", "But the book does not contain a quote that explicitly advocates lying to people, as memes circulating on Facebook\u00a0claim.", "The memes purport to quote the book when stating: \u201cYou tell people a lie 3 times, they will believe anything. You tell people what they want to hear, play to their fantasies, and then you close the deal.\u201d Some of the posts refer to Trump as \u201cDON The CON,\u201d others compare the supposed quote to one that is often linked to Nazi leaders Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels.", "We searched Trump\u2019s book and didn\u2019t find the quote in question \u2014 and, it turns out, the fact-checking organization Snopes debunked the same claim in 2016.", "The quote is at best an exaggeration of the actual passage we mentioned earlier about Trump\u2019s use of exaggeration.", "\u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d 1987: The final key to the way I promote is bravado. I play to people\u2019s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That\u2019s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It\u2019s an innocent form of exaggeration \u2014 and a very effective form of promotion.", "The book\u2019s notion of \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d has drawn renewed\u00a0interest in light of Trump\u2019s political career. The author Tony Schwartz, who served as a writer for the book and whose name appears alongside Trump\u2019s on the cover, has since publicly spoken out about regretting his role in creating the book \u2014 and writing that particular section.", "In an interview with the New Yorker in 2016, Schwartz said that \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d was a euphemism for deceit.", "\u201c\u2018Truthful hyperbole\u2019 is a contradiction in terms. It\u2019s a way of saying, \u2018It\u2019s a lie, but who cares?\u2019\u201d Schwartz said.", "This isn\u2019t the first time a president\u2019s book has been misrepresented: In 2008, we wrote about a chain email that twisted quotes, and made up others, from then-presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s book, \u201cDreams from My Father.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
