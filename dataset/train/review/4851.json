While it has been shared by several credible news sources, such as Time\u00a0and\u00a0The Guardian,\u00a0many viewers were skeptical about the footage and claimed that it was a \"CGI\" alligator. \u00a0However, the footage \u2014 like the alligator \u2014\u00a0\u00a0is real.\u00a0Course employee Wendy Schofield said that the enormous reptile\u00a0frequents the golf course and has become the club's unofficial\u00a0mascot:", "\"People have heard that he is out here and that is all they want to see so they will bring spectators to ride so somebody can get a picture,\" pro shop clerk Wendy Schofield told News 3. \"He doesn't bother anybody and they don't bother him. ...\"\"", "It is not\u00a0uncommon to spot alligators roaming the golf courses in Florida.

The recent one that was filmed walking across a golf course in Florida was widely reported as 15 ft. long, but nobody measured it so nobody knows how long it is in reality. Given that only three alligators in Florida have ever officially been measured as longer than 14 ft., it is highly unlikely that the alligator on the golf course is 15 ft. long. My own educated guess is that the golf course gator is 12-13 ft. long.", "As of 2014, the longest known credible record for an American alligator is 14 feet, 9.25 inches (450.0cm) long.", "John, Tara. \u00a0 \"Watch a Giant Alligator Take a Stroll Across a Florida Golf Course Like It's Jurassic Park.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Time. \u00a0 31 May 2016.", "The Guardian. \u00a0 \"Giant Alligator Crosses Florida Golf Course \u2013 Video.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0  31 May 2016.", "Forest, Ashley. \u00a0 \"Giant Alligator Roams Golf Course in Florida.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 KSNV-TV. \u00a0 26 May 2016.", "Brunell, Arnold. \u00a0 \"A New Record for the Maximum Length of the American Alligator.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Southeastern Naturalist. \u00a0 September 2015.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
