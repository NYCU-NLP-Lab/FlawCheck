Some had errors in the filings, others lacked standing. Mainly, the allegations lacked proof.", "A day after a mob of President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, President-elect Joe Biden spoke about the importance of democratic institutions. He said that one of those pillars was the judiciary system.", "Trump was \"truly stunned when the judges he appointed didn't do his bidding and instead acted with integrity, following the Constitution, upholding the rule of law,\" Biden said.", "\"In more than 60 cases, in state after state after state, and then at the Supreme Court, judges, including people considered \u2018his judges, Trump judges,\u2019 to use his words, looked at the allegations that Trump was making and determined they were without any merit,\" Biden said Jan. 7, at an event where he introduced Judge Merrick Garland as his nominee for U.S. Attorney General.", "Is that accurate?
