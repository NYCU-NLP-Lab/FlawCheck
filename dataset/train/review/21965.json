However, Lawson has since (repeatedly) clarified what was obvious to some, but not others \u2014 her mispronunciation was knowing and playful, rather than being the result of a genuine misunderstanding of how \"microwave\" should be said, akin to the habit, possessed by many Americans, of jokingly mispronouncing the name of the department store chain Target as \"Tar-zhay.\"", "Lawson, who is a household name in the U.K. due to her relatively straightforward recipes and her celebration of personal pleasure in cooking, frequently interacts with fans and followers on Twitter. In the days following the episode, she repeatedly clarified that her unusual pronunciation of \"microwave\" was \"just a silly joke,\" adding, \"I do say it like that, but not because I think that\u2019s how it\u2019s actually pronounced.\"", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
