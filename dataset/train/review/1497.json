Photo by Tiffany Stoiber", "In his bid to unseat Tony Evers as state school superintendent, self-described \"kidservative\" Lowell Holtz criticizes Wisconsin\u2019s dubious distinction of graduating white high school students at much higher rates than minority students.", "On his campaign blog, Holtz says his attention to safety and discipline as Beloit school superintendent from 2006 to 2009 improved the completion rate among high school students of color.", "Specifically, he claimed: \"Our minority graduation rate went from levels below Milwaukee and Madison, to above 80%.\"", "The statement caught our attention in part because Milwaukee and Madison have well-documented struggles with low graduation rates for black and Hispanic students.", "To back up his claim, the Holtz campaign pointed to data collected by the state Department of Public Instruction. It\u2019s the best source of data in this case.", "We confined our review to graduation rates for African-American and Hispanic students because they make up most of the minority students in Beloit. Black students were 26 percent of the total enrollment there in 2006-\u201907, Holtz\u2019s first year in the district. Hispanics made up 13 percent of the student body.", "Let\u2019s look at the graduation rates from his time in Beloit, spanning three school years:", "For African Americans:", "2006-\u201907: 64 percent", "2007-\u201908: 76 percent", "2008-09: 85 percent", "For Hispanics:", "2006-\u201907: 74 percent", "2007-\u201908: 75 percent", "2008-\u201909: 84 percent", "The figures back up the part of Holtz\u2019s claim about rates climbing over 80 percent on his watch.", "What about the contention that Beloit\u2019s graduation rates started out below those of minority students in Milwaukee and Madison?", "At that time, 2006-\u201907, Beloit\u2019s rate for black students was slightly lower than in Milwaukee, but slightly above Madison\u2019s rate.", "So that\u2019s a mixed bag.", "As for Hispanic students, the graduation rate in Beloit was higher than in either of those two districts in Holtz\u2019s first year.", "But if you look back to the year before he arrived, Beloit\u2019s graduation rate for Hispanic students was significantly lower than the rates in Milwaukee or Madison.", "Again, some support.", "For context, the graduation rate for white students in Beloit was considerably higher than for black students, but the gap between the groups narrowed dramatically by Holtz\u2019s third year. That\u2019s because while the rate for whites improved (topping Milwaukee and Madison), the rate for black students rose more.", "There is another aspect to Holtz\u2019s claim -- to what degree did his policies influence the rate?", "Specific policy changes he helped enact fueled the progress, Holtz claims, pointing to improvements in safety and discipline.", "But experts, and Holtz, acknowledge that students, teachers, parents, elected officials and community members all have to play a role.", "That muddies the water on claiming credit.", "Our rating:", "Holtz says that when he ran the Beloit school district, \"Our minority graduation rate went from levels below Milwaukee and Madison, to above 80%.\"", "Rates rose significantly and topped 80 percent both for black students and Hispanic students.", "But the picture upon his arrival was not quite as bleak as Holtz claimed.", "We rate his claim Mostly True.", "Lowell Holtz campaign blog post, March 18, 2017", "Interview with Charles Sanger, president, CS Communications, spokesman for Holtz campaign, March 21, 2017", "Interview with Thomas McCarthy, communications director, Department of Public Instruction, March 21, 2017", "WINSS historical data, graduation rates, accessed through Department of Public Instruction website, March 21, 2017", "Beloit Daily News, \"Ex Beloit Superintendent Will Run for State Position,\" July 12, 2016", "LinkedIn site, Lowell Holtz, accessed March 21, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
