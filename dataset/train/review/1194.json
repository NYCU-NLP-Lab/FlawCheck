["The 2016 presidential election was the first in Wisconsin in which a photo identification was required to vote.", "While reflecting on the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton was asked why she didn\u2019t campaign more in Wisconsin -- a state that hadn\u2019t gone Republican since 1984, but one \u00a0she lost to Donald Trump.", "Appearing May 31, 2017 at a conference in California sponsored by the Vox Media site Recode, Clinton replied by saying \"we thought we were doing really well in Wisconsin,\" but that \"our information was not as reliable as I wished it had been.\"", "Then the former Democratic nominee pivoted to another issue, contending that Wisconsin\u2019s law requiring photo identification to vote caused voter suppression.", "\"The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t think we believed at the time, before the election, that it would be anything like that, anything as big as that.\"", "Clinton\u2019s claim is similar to one by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., that we rated Mostly False.", "(The Washington Post Fact Checker later gave Baldwin three Pinocchios for the claim.)", "Baldwin\u2019s claim", "Baldwin flatly stated that turnout in Wisconsin \"was reduced by approximately 200,000 votes because of\" the photo ID requirement.", "The 2016 contest was the first presidential election in which the law was in effect. Baldwin cited a May 2017 report commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Clinton and Barack Obama. When we contacted a spokesman at the Democratic National Committee, asking for information to support Clinton\u2019s claim, he referred us to the same report.", "Comparing the 2012 and 2016 elections, the report said that on average, turnout increased 1.3 percent in states in which there was no change to voter ID laws, but decreased 3.3 percent in Wisconsin.", "Had Wisconsin\u2019s photo ID law not been in effect, the report argues, Wisconsin\u2019s turnout would have been 200,000 votes higher, based on the average increase of 1.3 percent.", "Experts told us the methodology is lacking.", "Put simply: The voter ID requirement undoubtedly prevented or discouraged some individual people from voting. But the report attributes all of the lower turnout to the ID law, when there are many other reasons that could also explain it, including a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton or Trump, or perhaps a belief that Trump couldn\u2019t win Wisconsin.", "Clinton\u2019s statement isn\u2019t as bold as Baldwin\u2019s, in that she refers to an estimate. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the methodology used to make that estimate, as we detailed in the Baldwin fact check, has been widely criticized.", "A final note from Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He noted that Trump earned almost the same number of votes in Wisconsin as did Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee.", "\"Clinton, in contrast, earned 238,000 fewer voters than did Obama,\" he said. \"It would be a mistake to attribute essentially all of that decline to the voter ID requirement.\"", "Our rating", "Clinton said: \"The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote\" in the 2016 presidential election.", "A report three weeks earlier from a group that supports Democratic candidates says a decline in voter turnout between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections in Wisconsin was entirely due to the state\u2019s new photo identification requirement for voting.\n\nBut experts say that while photo ID requirements may reduce turnout to some extent, they question the methodology of the report and say there is no way to put a number on how many people in Wisconsin didn\u2019t vote because of the ID requirement.", "We rate Clinton\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "Recode.net, Transcript of Hillary Clinton remarks, May 31, 2017", "Email, Democratic National Committee spokesman Michael Tyler, June 8, 2017", "PolitiFact Wisconsin, \"Did first-time use of photo ID cause 200,000 drop in Wisconsin voter turnout in presidential race?\" May 24, 2017", "Washington Post Fact Checker, \"Do voter ID laws help or hurt voter turnout?\" May 30, 2017", "Slate, \"Did a Voter ID Law Really Cost Clinton a Victory in Wisconsin?\" May 10, 2017", "Email, Wisconsin Elections Commission public information officer Reid Magney, June 6, 2017", "Email, University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor and Elections Research Center director Barry Burden, June 7, 2017", "Email, Bucknell University political science professor and elections expert Lindsay Nielson, June 7, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
