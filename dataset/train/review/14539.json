["About this rating", "On 6 February 2017, fitness marketer Antony Newby published a video\u00a0advancing the claim that\u00a0\"copy and paste\" Facebook status updates left users unwittingly vulnerable\u00a0to people who wanted to hack into their social media accounts and, by extension, their computers:", "The narrator of the video walks viewers through his theory of copy and paste hacking, claiming that\u00a0anyone with bad intentions can copy a portion of any circulating status update, paste it into the search bar, and find\u00a0everyone\u00a0on social media\u00a0who has shared that message.", "Although the video claims to provide information about securing accounts, it instead just illustrates lack of familiarity with Facebook's security protocols. Locating users using\u00a0a search string of text does\u00a0not make\u00a0their accounts any more vulnerable to hacking, and we found\u00a0absolutely no evidence to suggest that Facebook scammers target people with status updates. Even if Facebook scammers did\u00a0unnecessarily target users with\u00a0searches,\u00a0they would still need an individual's password to log in as that user \u2014 but if they had those credentials, there would be\u00a0no need for hackers to target people\u00a0sharing \"copy and paste\" status updates.", "Best practices for Facebook security include two-factor authentication, by which each login is verified as legitimate. Unauthorized access should\u00a0not be confused with account cloning, a known issue, but one that\u00a0does not involve anyone accessing your account without permission\u00a0(instead using your public photographs and information to solicit money or personal\u00a0information from your friends and family). Copying and pasting a status update does not expose login information to Facebook scammers.", "Facebook Help Center. \u00a0 \"Hacked And Fake Accounts.\"\r\nAccessed 14 February 2017.", "Facebook Help Center. \u00a0 \"Keeping Your Account Secure.\"\r\nAccessed 14 February 2017.", "Facebook Help Center. \u00a0 \"Login Alerts And Approvals.\"\r\nAccessed 14 February 2017.", "Facebook Help Center. \u00a0 \"Phishing.\"\r\nAccessed 14 February 2017.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
