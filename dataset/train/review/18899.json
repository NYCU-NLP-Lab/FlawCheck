Biden also described how he and Harris were \u201csimpatico\u201d on their philosophies of government, and how they approached many issues.", "His full remarks:", "When we disagree, it\u2019ll be [\u2026] so far it\u2019ll be just like when Barack and I did, it\u2019s in private. She\u2019ll say I think we should do A, B, C or D, and I\u2019ll say I like A, don\u2019t like B and C, and just go okay [\u2026] Like I told Barack, if I reach something where there's a fundamental disagreement we have based on a moral principle, I'll develop some disease and say I have to resign [...] We\u2019ve discussed at length our views on foreign policy, on domestic policy, on intelligence, and the great thing is she has a background in the senate on the intelligence committee, she has a background in the senate on a whole range of things that are going to be pertinent to what we have to do.", "It is not clear what Biden meant when he said he would \u201cdevelop some disease\u201d and \"resign,\" but some outlets interpreted this as an attempt at a joke.
