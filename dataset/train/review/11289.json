["The screenshot of a tweet since removed by Twitter has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook in Canada\u00a0and South Africa.", "\u201cBREAKING: The #WorldHealthOrganization made a complete U turn and said that #coronavirus patients doesn't need to be isolated or quarantined,\u201d\u00a0reads the text in the tweet.\u00a0\u201cNo #SocialDistancing and it cannot even transmit from one patient to another. *See the video.* #coronascam.\u201d", "The posts share footage from a news segment on US news and talk cable channel Newsmax where reporter Greg Kelly and doctor David Samadi discussed a brief clip featuring\u00a0WHO\u2019s leading\u00a0technical expert on COVID-19, Maria Van Kerkhove, speaking about the asymptomatic transmission of the virus.", "\u201cFrom the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onwards to a secondary individual,\u201d Kerkhove said in the daily WHO press briefing recorded on June 8, 2020.", "Kelly and Samadi interpreted this as the WHO saying asymptomatic people cannot transmit coronavirus to others,\u00a0inferring then that there is no need for social distancing and masks.", "\u201cI believe that the headline from the World Health Organization is \u2018asymptomatic people are not infectious\u2019, they are not going to spread the disease,\u201d said Kelly.", "But this is misleading. Kerkhove did not say those words\u00a0and minutes before discussing asymptomatic people, she\u00a0emphasised\u00a0the importance of social distancing.", "\u201cI should remind you that masks alone will not protect you; face shields alone will not protect you for infection... We know that physical distancing works, of at least one metre. That is really paramount, it is really important that that is maintained\u2026\u201d", "Kerkhove clarified her remarks about asymptomatic transmission in a question-and-answer session the next day on June 9, 2020.", "\u201cI was responding to a question at the press conference, I wasn\u2019t stating a policy of WHO or anything like that, I was just trying to articulate what we know and in that, I used the phrase \u2018very rare\u2019 and I think that\u2019s misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare -- what I was referring to was a subset of studies,\u201d Kerkhove said.", "\u201cWe do know that some people who are asymptomatic or some people who don\u2019t have symptoms can transmit the virus on,\u201d she added.", "\u201cI was referring to some detailed investigations, cluster investigations, case contact tracing where we had reports from member states saying that when we follow asymptomatic cases, it\u2019s very rare and I used the post \u2018very rare\u2019 that we found a secondary transmission.\u201d", "According to the WHO website, COVID-19 transmission occurs primarily by\u00a0people already displaying symptoms or just before they develop symptoms when they are in close proximity to others for long periods of time.", "\u201cWhile someone who never develops symptoms can also pass the virus to others, it is still not clear to what extent this occurs and more research is needed in this area,\u201d the WHO says.", "The posts claim\u00a0the WHO made a complete \u201cu-turn\u201d in\u00a0its guidelines for COVID-19 patients.", "This is wrong. It still recommends the isolation of infected people and the quarantining\u00a0of their close contacts. Physical distancing is also encouraged, where possible.", "According to the WHO, the goal of self-quarantining\u00a0is to prevent transmission by keeping away from others \u201cbecause you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 even though you, yourself, do not have symptoms. During self-quarantine you monitor yourself for symptoms.\u201d", "\u201cSelf-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places.\u201d", "The UN health authority also recommends keeping a social distance of at least\u00a0one metre from others, where possible.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
