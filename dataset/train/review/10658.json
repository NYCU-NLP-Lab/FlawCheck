["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Gov. J.B. Pritzker | Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times", "Illinois kicked off February with one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country, fueling frustration among many over the program\u2019s sluggish start.", "Nearly three weeks later, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state was making progress thanks to increased supply from the federal government and the efforts of local health departments:", "\"As a result, for the month of February, Illinois has been the vaccination leader among the 10 most populous states in the country,\" Pritzker said in a prerecorded video address, which aired Feb. 17.", "Has Illinois come as far on vaccinations this month as the governor claimed? We found Pritzker's statement was supported by one metric measured over a few days, but glossed over an otherwise spotty vaccination record.", "There are many yardsticks to measure states\u2019 progress getting their residents vaccinated against COVID-19. Illinois performs well on some metrics this month but still ranks low on others.", "Illinois started off the month 43rd in the nation for total doses administered when adjusted for population, according to Our World in Data, a University of Oxford-based project that has been tracking vaccine statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By the time Pritzker\u2019s address aired, the state had improved to 34th nationally \u2014 and sixth place when only the 10 most populous states are considered.", "The state is also performing better on a different metric: the share of residents that have received at least one dose of the vaccine. By Feb. 17, Illinois had taken a narrow lead over the other nine most populous states, and it has occupied first, second or third place in that group each day since.", "That measurement goes hand in hand with another, though: the share of people fully vaccinated. There, Illinois ranked last among the 10 largest states \u2014 and has continued to rank at or near the bottom nationally each day. Experts say it\u2019s tricky to compare states on this measure, however, due to differences in state policies on how much vaccine to earmark for second doses.", "Given these mixed results, we reached out to the governor\u2019s office to find out what Pritzker was referencing when he said Illinois was the \"vaccination leader\" this month among large states.", "Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said that, per capita, Illinois leads the most populous states in vaccinations administered in February \u2014 and has done so \"for the vast majority\" of the month.", "Experts said it is fair to compare states based on the total doses administered and adjusted for population. They were split, however, on whether it makes sense to focus on a few weeks in February.", "Hemi Tewarson, a senior fellow at the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the February snapshot might be helpful to show recent improvement after a sluggish start because of issues outside state control, such as delays with the federal pharmacy partnership program created to vaccinate those in nursing homes.", "\"If they started out slow back in December or early January, it's hard to catch up,\" she said.", "Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that while month-to-month data is important for gauging a state\u2019s progress internally, it\u2019s not as useful for making comparisons because it doesn\u2019t provide a full picture of a state\u2019s vaccine rollout.", "Regardless, by Pritzker\u2019s metric Illinois\u2019 lead among large states on total doses administered per capita in February amounted to just a few days out of the month, based on our analysis of CDC figures catalogued by Our World in Data.", "To support Pritzker\u2019s claim, Abudayyeh sent us a screenshot of a spreadsheet containing figures she said the governor\u2019s office had taken from the CDC\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination tracker. The spreadsheet compares how many doses were administered from Jan. 31 through Feb. 11 per 100,000 residents in the 10 most populous states.", "Those numbers could not be directly verified because the CDC\u2019s tracker only makes available a current cumulative total on each day.", "So to check the governor\u2019s figures we turned to Our World in Data again, which makes previous days\u2019 CDC tallies available for users to download. Those numbers matched the governor\u2019s analysis.", "Day to day, however, Illinois claimed first place three times out of the first 11 days of the month, hardly the \"vast majority\" of February as Pritzker\u2019s spokeswoman claimed. The state\u2019s lead was narrow, and by the time the governor\u2019s address aired, Illinois had fallen back to second place behind Florida.", "So Priztker\u2019s claim was accurate as of Feb. 12, the last day of his office\u2019s analysis. It was not accurate when his speech first aired five days later.", "Pritzker said that \"for the month of February, Illinois has been the vaccination leader among the 10 most populous states in the country.\"", "There are many different ways to measure how states compare when it comes to vaccinating residents against COVID-19. On some, Illinois ranks high and on others it ranks low. Pritzker\u2019s office pointed to one very specific metric: total doses administered per capita during the month of February alone.", "The key issue with Pritzker\u2019s claim is that Illinois only took the lead on that metric for a handful of days prior to the governor\u2019s prerecorded address \u2014 and had already fallen back to second place by the time it aired.", "We rate this claim Half True.", "HALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.", "Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "\"COVID-19 vaccine in Illinois: Complaints of slow rollout, confusing process, unequal distribution of doses,\" WGN-TV, Feb. 1, 2021", "Video: Gov.
