Still, Greg Abbott of Texas made us wonder when he tweeted in mid-November 2017: \"The Texas unemployment rate is now the lowest it\u2019s been in 40 years & Texas led the nation last month in new job creation.\"", "Abbott, a Republican seeking re-election in 2018, accompanied his tweet with a campaign video of Abbott smiling at business groundbreakings. The ad flashes headlines about companies opening facilities and adding jobs in Texas. Tagline: \"And we\u2019re just getting started.\"", "We got started fact-checking Abbott\u2019s tweet by asking his office for his backup; we didn\u2019t get a response.", "In July 2017, Abbott made a Mostly True claim about more Texans having jobs than ever. Yet we noticed that when Abbott tweeted about the state\u2019s jobless rate \"last month,\"\u00a0 October 2017 unemployment rates had yet to be revealed.", "To get our\u00a0fix on the latest available data, we fetched Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showing that the state\u2019s\u00a0impressive 4 percent jobless rate for September 2017 tied the previous record low since 1976. According to the bureau, the state similarly had a 4 percent unemployment rate in November and December 2000,\u00a017 years ago.\u00a0The state jobless rate in fall 1977, 40 years ago, hovered at 5.2 percent.", "To our inquiry, a Dallas-based\u00a0bureau economist, Cheryl Abbot, confirmed our read of monthly seasonally adjusted Texas jobless rates since 1976.

The chart indicates 30 states fared better month to month though that folds in five states showing no percentage gains (or losses).", "There\u2019s a more encouraging longer view. The bureau\u2019s release lists Texas among 28 states with over-the-year increases in nonfarm payroll employment from September 2016 to September 2017. The release said: \"The largest job gains occurred in California (+280,300), Texas (+256,100), and New York (+93,100)--with the largest percentage gains playing out in Nevada and Utah (+2.5 percent each) followed by Maryland (+2.4 percent).\" According to an accompanying chart, Texas and Idaho each saw a 2.1 percent increase in jobs over the year, tying for fourth nationally behind Washington state, which saw a 2.2 percent percentage increase in jobs.", "Abbot wrote: \"As you can see, the largest monthly increase in jobs in September 2017 occurred in California (+52,200).
