["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on May 10, 2018 | Updated on May 11, 2018", "The White House has proposed rescinding $7 billion in unspent funds from a children\u2019s health program, a move Sen. Chuck Schumer said would be \u201ctaking money away from kids who need health care.\u201d But congressional budget experts say most of that money cannot be legally spent and the number of individuals covered would not be affected.", "The main point of contention is the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to take $2 billion from a contingency fund used if states face a shortfall and higher-than-expected enrollment in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. CHIP, which is jointly funded by the federal government and the states, is for children and pregnant women in families with low incomes, but not low enough to qualify for Medicaid.", "Since fiscal 2009, when the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was established, three states \u2014 Iowa, Michigan and Tennessee \u2014 have received payments from it, according to a 2018 report from the Congressional Research Service.\u00a0The three states spent a total of $108.6 million in contingency funding.", "\u201cStates have not had to access the contingency funds that much over time,\u201d\u00a0Robin Rudowitz, associate director for the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured, told us. But, then again, \u201cwe don\u2019t know what exactly might happen.\u201d The fund was set up as a safeguard, she said.", "Several Democrats have criticized the White House proposal, and even Republican Sen. Susan Collins questioned why there would be a \u201ccut\u201d to CHIP. Schumer, the\u00a0Senate minority leader,\u00a0said in a statement that \u201cmillions of children rely on\u201d this money \u201cduring outbreaks of the flu and other deadly illnesses.\u201d", "Schumer, May 7: It appears that sabotaging our health care system to the detriment of middle-class families wasn\u2019t enough for President Trump and Republicans; now they\u2019re going after health care dollars that millions of children rely on, especially during outbreaks of the flu and other deadly illnesses. Let\u2019s be honest about what this is: President Trump and Republicans in Congress are looking to tear apart the bipartisan Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), hurting middle-class families and low-income children, to appease the most conservative special interests and feel better about blowing up the deficit to give the wealthiest few and biggest corporations huge tax breaks.", "It\u2019s possible an outbreak of disease could cause states to need more money for CHIP, though they\u2019d have to have higher enrollment and a shortfall in funds to qualify for a payment from the contingency fund. States \u201chave to meet both of those conditions,\u201d Rudowitz said.", "At a May 8 press conference, Schumer characterized the Trump proposal as \u201ctaking money away from kids who need health care.\u201d", "Rescissions of unspent CHIP funds have occurred before, including from the contingency fund, as recently as this year, when Congress passed an omnibus spending bill.", "All told, the administration has proposed $15 billion for rescission \u2014 or pulling back of funding that had been authorized but not yet spent. Most of the funding isn\u2019t expected to be used, in fact. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote\u00a0in a blog post that \u201cmost of these rescissions,\u201d including the ones to CHIP, \u201cwould cut budget authority for money that will not otherwise be spent,\u00a0resulting in no direct effect on the deficit.\u201d", "CRFB points out that the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget estimates that the $15 billion package would only reduce federal outlays (or spending), and therefore the deficit, by $3 billion. The plan requires congressional approval.", "Overall, since fiscal 2009, federal appropriations for CHIP have been more than enough to cover CHIP spending.\u00a0Rudowitz explained that the program operates like a \u201cblock grant,\u201d so the yearly appropriations don\u2019t always equal the outlays.", "Through several appropriation bills, Congress has rescinded $42.8 billion from CHIP from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2017, the Congressional Research Service report said. Most of the rescissions from CHIP came from a performance bonus payment fund for states that increased Medicaid enrollment of children. And $11.1 billion came from \u201cunobligated national allotments,\u201d or federal funds not allocated to states. The CRS report said that $1.7 billion was rescinded from the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund in fiscal 2016 \u2014\u00a0marking the first time rescissions were made to the emergency fund.", "The largest part of the Trump administration\u2019s rescission request from CHIP is $5.1 billion from funds for fiscal 2017 \u201cthat can no longer be spent,\u201d CRFB said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office explained\u00a0in a May 8 letter that those funds can no longer be distributed to states, because the authority to do so expired in 2017.", "So, the main issue \u2014 and the focus of Schumer\u2019s criticism \u2014 is the $1.9 billion from the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund. CBO wrote that \u201cbased on information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CBO projects that the rescission from the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund would not affect payments to states over the 2018-2028 period.\u201d", "It said that rescinding the $7 billion in CHIP money \u201cwould not affect outlays, or the number of individuals with insurance coverage.\u201d", "The budget watchdog group CRFB said the contingency money \u201clikely will not be used.\u201d\u00a0As we said, since the contingency fund was established in 2009, three states have received payments from it when they faced both a shortfall and higher-than-expected enrollment of children, according to CRS. (Total federal appropriations for CHIP were still more than enough to cover all states\u2019 spending as a whole.)", "Michigan got a $52.6 million payment from the fund in fiscal 2015, according to a 2016 fact sheet from the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission. Michigan Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Angela Minicuci told us that the state had higher-than-expected enrollment, and a subsequent funding shortfall, due to federal poverty level changes in the Affordable Care Act.", "Tennessee received $226.7 million in September 2016 but only spent $27.1 million a few months later. It needed the money for \u201cretroactive CHIP expenditures as a result of changes to the CHIP eligibility standards dating back to January 1, 2014,\u201d according to Sarah Tanksley, director of communications, Division of TennCare. She said the state can no longer access the remainder of the unspent contingency payment.", "Iowa received $28.9 million in fiscal 2011, according to another MACPAC report.\u00a0Matt Highland, public information officer at the state\u2019s Department of Human Services, told us the money covered shortfalls in fiscal 2011 and 2012.", "CRFB noted that a rescission from the contingency fund was made in the bipartisan omnibus spending bill passed in March.", "The omnibus rescinded nearly $2 billion from the fund. It passed the Senate by a 65-32 vote, with many Democrats voting yes. \u201cIn other words, most who are attacking this policy now for \u2018cutting\u2019 CHIP supported nearly the same policy just a few months ago,\u201d\u00a0Patrick Newton, press secretary at CRFB, told us in an email.", "Schumer was asked in a May 8 press conference why he supported the omnibus but objects to a similar rescission now. He said the difference was that the omnibus money was used for \u201cgood things.\u201d But now Trump is \u201cnot putting the money into good things; he\u2019s just cutting.\u201d Schumer went on to say: \u201cThey\u2019re just taking money away from kids who need health care.\u201d", "We asked his office how the senator could say the rescission was \u201ctaking money away from kids\u201d when the money hadn\u2019t been allocated and isn\u2019t expected to be spent at all. Schumer\u2019s office responded in an email: \u201cIt has been used in the past though. It\u2019s there in case of emergency.\u201d", "His office maintains the contingency money might be needed and should be preserved. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be gambling with those programs and children\u2019s health care in order to pay down a fraction of a percent of the deficit that Republicans created with their massive tax breaks to the wealthy,\u201d Schumer\u2019s office said.", "One additional issue is that the new request comes on top of that omnibus rescission, leaving about $500 million in the contingency fund for fiscal 2018, which ends in less than five months on Sept. 30.", "Schumer\u2019s office referred us to comments by\u00a0Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families, who\u00a0told the Washington Post that this \u201csets a very dangerous precedent\u201d for CHIP. Alker wrote on the center\u2019s website that \u201crescinding $2 billion from the fund undermines the very assurance it was created to provide.\u201d", "The contingency fund should get a fresh influx of money in fiscal 2019, which starts Oct. 1, if current practices are followed. Edwin Park, a research professor at Georgetown\u2019s Center for Children and Families, told us that up to 20 percent of the national allotment for CHIP is allocated to the fund each budget year. That would mean up to about $4.5 billion should go into the contingency fund next fiscal year.", "Federal funding for the states for CHIP will total\u00a0$22.6 billion for 2019. States recently faced a gap in federal CHIP funding of several months while Congress debated extending the program. In measures passed in late January and early February, Congress extended CHIP funding through fiscal 2027.", "Update, May 11: We updated this story to include information on contingency fund payments to Tennessee and Iowa.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
