["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on September 8, 2016", "The FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email system while secretary of state continues to be a rich source of attack lines for her opponents. But not all of them are accurate:", "The FBI on Sept. 2\u00a0released a two-part summary of its investigation of Clinton and her staff, and their handling of classified information on her private server. As we wrote, the agency\u2019s investigation notes contradict some past statements that Clinton and her campaign made about her emails, including when her emails were deleted from her server.", "Clinton\u2019s office\u00a0disclosed\u00a0on March 10, 2015, that she gave the\u00a0State Department 30,490 work-related emails on Dec. 5, 2014, and \u201cchose not to keep\u201d 31,830 emails she deemed \u201cpersonal.\u201d It did not say when the personal emails were deleted, but the FBI learned that they\u00a0were deleted between March 25-31, 2015, about three weeks after she was served with a congressional subpoena.", "One other new piece of information was how the emails were deleted \u2014 a point that Trump has worked into recent public remarks, including in a Sept. 5 ABC News interview, and\u00a0Sept. 6 campaign events in North Carolina and Virginia.", "Trump, Sept. 5:\u00a0You see what\u2019s going on with her emails. It\u2019s a disgrace. It\u2019s a disgusting situation where she pretends like she doesn\u2019t know. I mean, she had her emails \u2014 33,000 emails \u2014 acid washed. The most sophisticated person never heard about acid washing. Acid washing is a very expensive process and that\u2019s to really get rid of them.", "Trump, Sept. 6, North Carolina: But why do you acid wash, or bleach, the emails? Nobody even heard of it before. Very expensive. Just ask yourself.", "Trump, Sept. 6, Virginia:\u00a0How about the acid wash of the e-mails that didn\u2019t mean anything? How about the 33,000 missing e-mails that were acid washed \u2014 acid washed. And Rudy was telling me, nobody does it because it\u2019s such an expensive process. OK, 33,000.", "Trump is wrong on two counts: The software used to delete Clinton\u2019s emails is free, and no chemicals were used.", "His campaign told us Trump didn\u2019t literally mean that Clinton \u201cacid washed\u201d her emails. It said that he was using a play on words, referring to Clinton\u2019s joke a year ago about \u201cwiping\u201d her server with a cloth.", "Sorry, we don\u2019t get the play on words, which was not clear in any of Trump\u2019s remarks. Let\u2019s look at the facts.", "The FBI said that Platte River Networks, which set up and maintained Clinton\u2019s server, used an open-source software program called BleachBit. (See page 18.)", "BleachBit debunks Trump\u2019s claims on its FAQ page:\u00a0\u201cBleachBit is not \u2018very expensive software.\u2019 Actually, it is completely free of charge for everyone in all situations.\u201d It also says, \u201cBleachBit is neither a chemical nor a physical device. BleachBit is an anti-forensics software application.\u201d", "The site links to a statement on Trump\u2019s website by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani that claims, \u201cThis software is very expensive and is used by criminals seeking to hide evidence from law enforcement.\u201d\u00a0It also links to a story that quotes Trump as saying Clinton \u201cbleached\u201d her hard drive and \u201cused chemicals so that nobody will ever be able to see them.\u201d", "PCWorld, the consumer magazine for computer owners, described BleachBit in a 2013 review as good for a business user, but not necessarily the novice home user. \u201cIf you\u2019re a business user looking for a truly free system cleaner, one interesting option is open-source, cross-platform BleachBit,\u201d it said.", "Andreas Haeberlen, an associate professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania, told us that the FBI description of how BleachBit was used suggests that \u201cthe data would have been physically overwritten on the disk and would be very difficult to recover, at least without specialized equipment.\u201d But he said this \u201cis certainly not the strongest method for secure deletion.\u201d", "Haeberlen said there are stronger methods, such as degaussing or physical destruction, referring us to Table 5.1 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s \u201cGuidelines for Media Sanitation.\u201d Degaussing is \u201ca demagnetizing process to erase a hard drive or tape,\u201d as explained by Data Security Inc.", "\u201cRegarding \u2018expensive,\u2019 the website says that the BleachBit software is published under an open-source license (GPL version 3 is mentioned), which would mean that it is available for free,\u201d Haeberlen wrote in an email to us. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t involve chemicals \u2013 it\u2019s just a software program.\u201d", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0c26a8ef-2ed8-4b67-b2bf-12ea7ea2e842", "Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, also cited the FBI investigation in attacking Clinton. Pence cited the fact that the FBI recovered about 14,900 emails that were not part of the 30,000 work-related emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department in December 2014.", "In a speech in Springfield, Missouri, Pence incorrectly referred to the recovered documents as \u201cmore than 15,000 additional emails dealing with national security.\u201d", "Pence, Sept. 6:\u00a0I mean Hillary Clinton said she had turned over all of her emails except for the ones having to do with yoga and wedding plans. Now we have found more than 15,000 additional emails dealing with national security.", "As we have written, the 14,900 are not all work-related emails, so Pence was\u00a0wrong when he said all of them deal with national security. The State Department is in the process of reviewing the emails to determine how many of them are work-related and, of those, how many have not yet been publicly released.", "What we do know is that very few of them included classified information.", "At his July 5 press conference announcing that the FBI would not seek charges against Clinton, FBI Director James Comey said only three emails contained information that was classified\u00a0at the time. He also said none was\u00a0\u201cup-classified,\u201d which refers to information that is deemed classified when documents are reviewed for public release.", "Comey, July 5: With respect to the thousands of e-mails we found that were not among those produced to State, agencies have concluded that three of those were classified at the time they were sent or received, one at the Secret level and two at the Confidential level. There were no additional Top Secret e-mails found. Finally, none of those we found have since been \u201cup-classified.\u201d", "Pence simply went too far when he described the recovered emails as \u201cmore than 15,000 additional emails dealing with national security.\u201d Not everything that the secretary of state receives or sends deals with national security.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6c163fae-8385-40e2-81bf-75f893e9fb4c", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
