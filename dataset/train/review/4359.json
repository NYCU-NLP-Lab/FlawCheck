["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama noted the country\u2019s progress toward energy independence.", "There is \"more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world \u2013 the first time that\u2019s happened in nearly 20 years,\" he said. Later in the speech, he added, \"The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we\u2019ve been in decades.\"", "Earlier in January, we fact-checked Obama\u2019s same claim about domestic oil production after he spoke at North Carolina State University. We rated it True after PolitiFact dug into the U.S. oil numbers. Here\u2019s what we had found:", "A White House spokesman offered up this White House blog post that explained Obama\u2019s point in more detail. According to the White House, Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995.", "We also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to their November 2013 report, the United States produced an average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October and imported 7.5 million barrels of oil per day.", "So Obama\u2019s numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point?", "Kenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports.", "\"Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,\"Medlock said.", "The reduced demand is due in part to the recession. It\u2019s no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when there\u2019s less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesn\u2019t need to import as much oil supply.", "Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University.", "Aside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing.", "We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines.", "But we can\u2019t tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades.", "Still, it\u2019s worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the country\u2019s dependency on foreign oil. In 2012, we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administration\u2019s fuel efficiency standards.", "Our ruling", "Obama said the United States is producing more oil at home than its buying from the rest of the world for the first time in nearly two decades. That claim is on the money. However, a lot of this has been in the works for awhile, including dynamics that pre-date the Obama administration. Experts told us the new dynamic is due to factors like the recession, increased fuel efficiency and ramped up domestic oil production. As a simple statement on where we stand on oil exports vs. imports, though, Obama\u2019s claim is accurate. We rate it True.", "Email interview with John Lowe, Southern Methodist University energy law professor, Jan. 15, 2014", "Email interview with Jonathan Cogan, U.S. Energy Information Administration spokesman, Jan. 15, 2014", "Email interview with Kenneth Medlock, Rice University Baker Institute for Public Policy Center for Energy Studies senior director, Jan. 15, 2014", "Email interview with Matt Lehrich, White House spokesman, Jan. 15, 2014", "PolitiFact, \"Barack Obama says U.S. oil production last year was highest since 2003,\" March 15, 2011", "PolitiFact, \"Obama says U.S. produces more oil than it imports for first time in nearly 20 years,\" Jan. 17, 2014", "PolitiFact, \"Obameter: Reduce dependence on foreign oil,\" Nov. 27, 2012", "PolitiFact Ohio, \"Barack Obama campaign says U.S. dependence on foreign oil now below 50 percent,\" Jan. 26, 2012", "PolitiFact Virginia, \"Barack Obama ad says U.S. oil production is at eight-year high,\" April 9, 2012", "U.S. Energy Information Administration, \"Short-term energy outlook,\" November 2013", "U.S. Energy Information Administration, \"U.S. field production of crude oil,\" accessed Jan. 16, 2014", "U.S. Energy Information Administration, \"U.S. imports of crude oil,\" accessed Jan. 16, 2014", "White House Blog, \"Driving toward greater energy security,\" Nov. 13, 2013", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
