Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., defended him when she spoke with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, comparing Obama\u2019s international credibility favorably in comparison with that of his predecessor, George W. Bush.", "\"You know, President George W. Bush had significantly degraded our international influence around the world,\" she said. \"We stood alone in the war in Iraq. We were roundly criticized and rightfully so. And today, we have 35 nations that signed the statement in support of the U.S.'s commitment to strike. ... So President Obama's leadership has rebuilt our credibility around the world with leaders that was decimated in the previous administration.\"", "Blitzer pushed back against her argument, noting that the British Parliament, \"our closest ally wouldn't even support potential U.S. military strikes in Syria.\"", "Wasserman is right that some countries, such as France, have backed a potential strike this time around. But Britain and others are opposed.", "Here, we\u2019ll focus on fact-checking her statement about Iraq, in which she claimed that the United States didn\u2019t have the support of other nations.

Every nation in this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our common defense,\" he said.", "Later that month, the White House released a list of 49 nations that had \"already begun military operations to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, and enforce 17 (United Nations Security Council) resolutions.\"", "We should also point out that support from British Prime Minister Tony Blair was particularly strong.", "\"Tell our allies that at the very moment of action, at the very moment when they need our determination that Britain faltered? I will not be party to such a course. This is not the time to falter,\" Blair said at the end of a long, passionate speech before the House of Commons in favor of invading.", "Great Britain had troops stationed in Iraq until 2009, while the United States pulled out in 2011.", "Our ruling", "When Blitzer asked about Obama's decision to strike\u00a0Syria,\u00a0Wasserman Schultz defended the president and argued that he has support, unlike when the\u00a0United States \"stood alone\" against Iraq.", "Although Democrats often criticize Bush for invading Iraq without more global backing, including that of the United Nations, Bush did put together a coalition.
