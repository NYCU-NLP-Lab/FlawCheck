["The U.S. may have\u00a0reached more than 77 million\u00a0coronavirus vaccines administered, but its rollout effort\u00a0lags behind countries like Israel,\u00a0where more than 50% of Israelis have received at least one dose and nearly 40% have been fully vaccinated.", "Protection against the virus is not the only thing the country of 9.2 million is providing its vaccinated citizens: It's handing out some social perks\u00a0as well, according to one social media post.", "\"Photo from Isreal (sic), where they are implementing an internal COVID-19 vaccine passport,\" writes one Facebook user to the image of green lounge chairs on a beach marked with the words \"RESERVED FOR VACCINATED PEOPLE ONLY.\"", "The post has received more than 400 interactions and shares since it was published Feb. 28, along with many comments expressing disbelief.", "\"This is called social conditioning!\" one Facebook user commented.", "\"That's messed up!\" another said.", "USA TODAY has reached out to the original poster for further comment.", "More:Fact check: False claim declares there are ID requirements to enter Washington", "The \"internal COVID-19 vaccine passport\" is a very real initiative introduced\u00a0by Israel's Ministry of Health in mid-January and released in late February in an effort\u00a0to reopen the country, and the economy, more widely.", "According to the ministry, the passport, or \"Green Pass\" \u2013 a vaccination certificate, in both digital and paper form \u2013 is available to anyone who has\u00a0received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine\u00a0through any one of Israel's four health maintenance organizations or other accredited vaccination service.", "People who have recovered from the virus, indicating acquired immunity, but have not been vaccinated are not eligible.", "Though shops, malls and museums are open to all, the Green Pass confers exclusive access\u00a0to restricted sites like hotels, gyms, theaters, music venues and other leisure facilities. Indoor dining in restaurants and bars is expected to be included sometime in March, The Guardian reported.", "Pass-holders are not required to follow COVID-19 safety restrictions such as going into isolation if coming into contact with a confirmed infected patient or after international travel from a COVID-19 \"red zone,\" or countries with high infectious rates.", "But mask-wearing\u00a0in public settings remains compulsory, as do social distancing and avoiding social gatherings.", "Other caveats are that the pass does not take effect until\u00a0a week after the second dose is administered and expires within six months, although it can be renewed many times.
