(AP)", "\u2022 Giuliani\u2019s source was an affidavit that mistook Minnesota precincts for Michigan precincts and cited 25 \u201cWayne County\u201d precincts that are not actually in Wayne County.", "\u2022 Beyond being misidentified, the data in the affidavit is not consistent with official data from the Minnesota secretary of state\u2019s office.", "\u2022 When we inquired, a Trump campaign lawyer called the numbers in the affidavit \u201ca simple mistake.\u201d", "During a Nov. 19 press conference, Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer representing President Donald Trump, charged that many precincts in Michigan \u2014 a key state won by his Democratic opponent, President-elect Joe Biden \u2014 recorded more votes than actual voters.", "In Michigan, he said, \"we have over-votes in numerous precincts of 150%, 200% and 300%.\"", "Giuliani\u2019s source for these percentages was an affidavit authored by Russell Ramsland, a security consultant and former Republican congressional candidate. The document alleges that anomalies in the vote count indicate that Michigan election results were \"manipulated.\"", "\"There were at least 19 precincts where the Presidential Votes Cast compared to the Estimated Voters based on Reported Statistics exceeded 100%,\" the affidavit reads. The document then goes on to list the 19 precincts, shown in this screenshot:", "But there\u2019s a problem, and it\u2019s a big one: All 19 of the precincts cited in the affidavit are actually located in Minnesota, not Michigan.", "A separate part of the affidavit focuses on Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit. Of 47 Wayne County precincts, the document lists 25 that allegedly showed 100% turnout. Here\u2019s that portion of the document:", "This portion of the document isn\u2019t accurate either: None of the 25 precincts listed are actually in Wayne County. Like the 19 precincts cited above, each is located in Minnesota.", "Powerline, a conservative blog, was the first to report that the affidavit cited Minnesota rather than Michigan voting jurisdictions. (A possible explanation is Michigan\u2019s postal abbreviation is MI, while Minnesota\u2019s is MN.) Other media outlets confirmed these discrepancies.", "Voters wait to cast their votes on Nov. 3, 2020, at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.

In the five townships cited as having the largest number of over-votes, the number of votes on election day was smaller than the number of registered voters.", "For example, the affidavit cites Minnesota\u2019s Benville Township as having 350% voter turnout, which would be by far the largest over-voting rate alleged in the document. Both Giuliani and Trump lawyer Sidney Powell cited the 350% figure in the Nov. 19 press conference.", "However, according to the Minnesota Secretary of State\u2019s election data, 63 people voted in the township, and 71 were registered to vote, a turnout rate of 89%.", "The Washington Post, which cross-checked numbers from the five precincts alleged to have the highest number of over-votes, found that the Ramsland affidavit overestimated the numbers in all five precincts.", "Risikat Adesaogun, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Secretary of State\u2019s office, told PolitiFact that \"we have canvassed at the county level, and we don\u2019t have any clarity about the contents of the affidavit and the source of the alleged data.\"", "Even if the data in the affidavit were accurate, it would do little to further the Trump campaign\u2019s baseless argument that massive voter fraud swung the election to Biden. For instance, election data from the Minnesota secretary of state\u2019s office shows that Benville Township voted overwhelmingly for Trump, not Biden.", "It\u2019s unclear what data Ramsland used to arrive at his percentages. We reached out to him but haven\u2019t heard back.", "L. Lin Wood, another Trump campaign lawyer, has filed the affidavit as part of a lawsuit in Georgia.
