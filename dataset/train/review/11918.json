["Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, online skeptics\u00a0questioned health officials' attempts to stop the spread of COVID-19. In recent months, social media users are using the Amish, a population known for its resistance to modern technology, to claim the threat posed by the virus is not real.", "One meme is using\u00a0an altered photo to claim Amish people are unaffected by the virus because they don't own televisions.", "\u201cWhy isn\u2019t COVID affecting you people?\u201d reads a dialogue bubble above a woman wearing a mask.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t have TV,\u201d states the bubble above a man with a long beard and straw\u00a0hat.", "Fact check:WHO recommends mask-wearing to prevent COVID-19 spread", "Versions of this meme have appeared on social media since late 2020, however, misconceptions about COVID-19\u2019s impact on the Amish community have spread for months.", "Fact checkers debunked similar claims that COVID-19 spared Amish communities in September.", "\u201c6 months later and the Amish are all still alive and Covid free. Their cure = No TV!\u201d reads a post\u00a0that circulated widely in September.", "Both versions of this claim are false. COVID-19 has affected Amish communities like any other population\u00a0in America, regardless of the fact that Amish people\u00a0don\u2019t typically own televisions.", "USA TODAY contacted several social media users that posted the claim and has yet to receive a response.", "The image in the first meme is misleading because it is altered to appear\u00a0as though it was taken since the pandemic began.\u00a0The original image was posted to travel website Viator in April 2009 by user Angela S. In the photo, the woman is not wearing a mask.", "The photo was captioned\u00a0\u201cA nice talk with Amish people\u201d and posted\u00a0with reviews for a listing for a Philadelphia and Amish Country Day Trip tour.", "The tour brings visitors to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, which is home to a large Amish community.", "Aside from the doctored image, it\u2019s inaccurate to say that Amish communities haven\u2019t been affected by COVID-19.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied an outbreak in a rural Ohio Amish community in May.
