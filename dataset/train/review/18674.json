["One Facebook post, which we've archived here, shows the top 20 cities on the list with a caption that reads: \u201cGo SA cities earning top points on 2019 crime stats. Who would have thought PMB aka sleepy hollow was the 2nd most dangerous city in the world.? oh my\u2026\u201d. The post has been shared some 1,800 times.", "More versions of the same post can be seen here and here shared hundreds of times on Facebook.", "Some social media users left sarcastic congratulations to South Africa for getting six cities into the top 20, while others questioned the likelihood of Pietermaritzburg, an eastern city with around 200,000 residents, being the second-most dangerous city in the world.", "An internet search of \u201cdangerous cities in the world numbeo.com\u201d -- the website address seen at the top of the screenshot --\u00a0shows the statistics were taken from Numbeo, a website that describes itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest database of user contributed data about cities and countries worldwide\u201d.", "Crime index levels lower than 20 are considered as very low on Numbeo, and crime levels higher than 80 are considered as being very high.", "However, the website also explains that its crime indices are \u201cbased on surveys from visitors of this website\u201d, using survey questions it deems \u201csimilar to many scientific and government surveys\u201d.", "AFP Fact Check in Johannesburg started a review of Pietermaritzburg to see the kind of questions asked. All of them are subjective, asking people to rate on a scale of 1-5 how worried they feel about certain issues.", "There are a couple of reasons to take this data with a pinch of salt.", "Firstly, the survey data is based on participants\u2019 perceptions of dangers, real or imagined -- it\u2019s possible that people responding in different places may have different ideas of what constitutes \u201cvery safe\u201d or \u201cvery unsafe\u201d.", "Secondly, a person does not need to have ever set foot in that city in order to rate how dangerous it is -- in essence, anyone from anywhere can review a city on Numbeo.", "The website shows that Pietermaritzburg briefly claimed the number one spot on the ranking in 2014, but has mostly ranked in second place since mid-2015. In 2018, however, the city dropped off the ranking altogether.", "\u201cThese data are based on perceptions of visitors of this website in the past 3 years,\u201d a disclaimer reads.", "The city has only been reviewed by 74 people -- compared to the 353 people who contributed to Caracas, Venezuela\u2019s position as the most dangerous city in the world.", "Had the posts said Pietermaritzburg is perceived to be the world\u2019s second-most dangerous city among\u00a0more than 70,000 people to have filled in Numbeo\u2019s surveys, they would have been accurate.", "According to South Africa\u2019s most up-to-date crime statistics\u00a0released for the period from April 2018 to March 2019, the precinct with the most crime reports is Cape Town Central in the Western Cape province.", "As reported by AFP, South African soldiers have been patrolling Cape Town's crime-ridden townships since July after being deployed by the government to counter a surge of shootings, gang violence and murders.", "While crime in Pietermaritzburg is high, the city doesn\u2019t feature on the list of\u00a010 worst precincts for murder in South Africa, let alone the world. All 10 positions are occupied by cities in the Western Cape province.", "As noted by this local news article published on September 13, updated crime statistics indicate that Plessislaer, a southwestern suburb of Pietermaritzburg, has seen a recent spike in murders. The figures show that the Plessislaer precinct saw murders rise to 166 in the April 2018-March 2019 period, up from 104 the previous year.", "An overview of crimes reported in Pietermaritzburg, however, shows a minor yet consistent decline over the past five years.", "Comparing homicide rates offers a\u00a0more widely accepted and objective approach to\u00a0measuring how dangerous countries or cities are\u00a0-- although this is heavily reliant on the assumption that statistics from each place\u00a0are correct and up to date.", "This report on World Atlas ranked the world\u2019s most dangerous cities \u201con the basis of murder cases per capita\u201d, listing Los Cabos, Mexico as the most dangerous city in the world with a murder rate of 111.33 per 100,000 people.", "Caracas, Venezuela came second with a murder rate of 111.19, and the first South African city is ranked in 15th place -- Cape Town, with a rate of 62.25.", "In South Africa, 58\u00a0people were killed each day on average last year, police said last month. The country is seeking the help of experts to understand why so many of those murders are committed by friends and relatives -- see this\u00a0AFP report.", "A total of 21,022 people were murdered between April 2018 and March 2019 in the country, a rise of 1.4 percent over the same months between 2017 and 2018.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
