But by email, Falk told us he reached his conclusion about the Austin district having the highest per-student funding among large districts by checking on 2016-17 per-student budgeted spending in a dozen high-enrollment districts starting from a Texas Education Agency website.", "We confirmed from TEA figures posted for the Austin district that the district budgeted $10,949 per student--an amount reached by dividing $906,180,314 shown in AISD state, local and federal receipts by its 82,766 students. That disregards $406 million in local taxes recaptured by the state.", "Falk said that from TEA-posted figures, he identified only one high-enrollment district with a greater per-student figure; the 157,787-student Dallas district, per the site, drew $11,377 in receipts per student. Falk told us he found from posted figures that 10 other districts--including Houston, San Antonio, Fort Worth, El Paso and Corpus Christi--drew less in receipts per student.", "\"First or second, my central point remains true: AISD uses recapture to give the impression they have unfair and inadequate funding,\" Falk said. \"Based on their peers, many of whom don't pay recapture, they have superior funding along with a low tax rate.\"", "We confirmed that most of the districts Falk reviewed are classified by the state as \"major urban\" districts, although that classification doesn\u2019t apply to all the districts in his comparison. The exceptions are the Katy, Cypress-Fairbanks, Aldine and Corpus Christi districts. We also learned more precision was possible.", "Taking into account all funds", "Next, we asked the state education agency and a couple of school funding experts who advocate for districts at the Capitol to assess Falk\u2019s statement and methodology.", "By email, TEA spokesperson DeEtta Culbertson said Falk\u2019s per-student figures, based on 2016-17 budgeted data submitted to the state, were accurate to a degree. Culbertson said, for instance, the posted data didn\u2019t reflect final totals of federal funds fielded by each district. She subsequently emailed us a spreadsheet showing that districts ultimately got far more, or less, federal aid than indicated in the reports Falk drew upon.", "In response to our inquiry, agency experts reviewed audited actual spending data, including federal aid, for the latest available year, 2015-16. By this sort, Culbertson said, Austin fell to eighth among the dozen districts singled out by Falk with $10,805 in per-student spending.", "Culbertson provided a chart indicating the San Antonio district topped the sampled districts with per-student spending of $12,430. At the low end, the Fort Worth ($10,507); Cypress-Fairbanks ($10,395); Corpus Christi ($10,216) and Arlington ($10,171) districts spent less per student than the Austin district.", "Also to our inquiry, lobbyist Joe Wisnoski, a former education agency official expert in school finance, similarly said the TEA data cited by Falk was incomplete, leaving unconsidered \"a lot of federal funds\" spent by districts.", "Like the education agency, Wisnoski turned to audited district revenues for 2015-16 showing \u00a0Austin eighth in per-student revenue of all kinds among the districts analyzed by Falk, though his review indicated Austin was sixth if federal aid wasn\u2019t considered.", "Wisnoski also advised: \"Spending can vary from revenues in a given year and result in a different ranking.\" Wisnoski said too that the revenue amounts \"would include money for both operations and debt service,\" a reference to what districts put into paying off bond debt rather than paying for day-to-day operations. Also, Wisnoski wrote, the \"amounts per student are without regard to any variance in the educational needs of, or program participation of, the students in the listed districts.\"", "By email, Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials concurred with Wisnoski\u2019s analysis.", "Focusing on state\u2019s highest-enrollment districts", "For our part, we noticed that Falk\u2019s sampling left out a few of the state\u2019s 12 highest-enrollment districts: in 2016-17, the latest year of state-posted counts, these were the Northside and North East districts in Bexar County, the Conroe district in Montgomery County and the Fort Bend district in Fort Bend County. Folding in actual per-student financial data for Falk\u2019s listed districts and for these other districts led us to compose a chart showing the Austin district in 2015-16 trailed eight of the state\u2019s highest-enrollment districts in such spending. Within the sample, the San Antonio district had the greatest per-student figure, at $12,430, followed by the Dallas, Katy, Houston, Ysleta, North East, El Paso and Aldine districts--before the Austin district.", "Focusing on the 10 largest districts by enrollment puts Austin sixth in per-student revenue, with the Dallas district leading at $12,069 per student.", "TEN HIGHEST-ENROLLMENT TEXAS SCHOOL DISTRICTS", "DISTRICT", "2015-16 All Funds Total Revenue/Student", "DALLAS", "$12,069", "KATY", "$11,568", "HOUSTON", "$11,450", "NORTH EAST", "$10,921", "ALDINE", "$10,905", "AUSTIN", "$10,805", "NORTHSIDE", "$10,722", "FORT WORTH", "$10,507", "FORT BEND", "$10,419", "CYPRESS-FAIRBANKS", "$10,395", "SOURCES: Email, DeEtta Culbertson, information specialist, Texas Education Agency, Nov. 13, 2017 and PolitiFact Texas research starting from a TEA website, \"PEIMS District Financial Actual Reports, 2015-16,\" accessed Nov. 15, 2017", "We shared the information provided by the agency and Wisnoski with Falk.
