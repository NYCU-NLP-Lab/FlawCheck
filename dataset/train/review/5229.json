["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on June 12, 2019", "A meme making the bogus claim that the U.S. Constitution confers rights only to citizens is circulating online. Actually, many of the rights granted in the Constitution apply to noncitizens, too.", "Many provisions in the U.S. Constitution apply to everyone in the country \u2014 citizens and noncitizens, alike.", "A popular meme, however, is circulating online with this false claim: \u201cThe entire US Constitution was written for Americans only. It\u2019s not the World Constitution, it\u2019s the US Constitution. NON-CITIZENS AND CRIMINALS DO NOT POSSESS RIGHTS UNDER THIS DOCUMENT.\u201d", "Some parts of the Constitution apply only to citizens, but the bulk of the document applies to everyone, said Kermit Roosevelt, a professor and constitutional expert at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.", "The word \u201cperson\u201d actually appears much more frequently than the word \u201ccitizen\u201d in the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights (which contains the first 10 amendments) and the other 17 amendments.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a deliberate choice,\u201d Roosevelt said, referring to the inclusion of noncitizens.", "While it\u2019s true that the Constitution was designed to benefit the U.S. and its people, that goal is accomplished in part by extending rights to citizens of foreign countries so that the same fair treatment would be conferred to American citizens abroad. In short, it generates international cooperation, Roosevelt said.", "\u201cThe idea that the interests of the United States or the American people are best served by not granting rights to non-citizens is incredibly dangerous and shortsighted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe founders were smarter than that.\u201d", "There is also extensive Supreme Court precedent recognizing the rights of noncitizens under the Constitution. In one seminal 1886 case on the issue, for example, the Supreme Court said:", "Yick Wo v. Hopkins, May 10, 1886: The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution is not confined to the protection of citizens. It says:", "\u201cNor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d", "These provisions are universal in their application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality, and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.", "As for the meme\u2019s other claim that criminals don\u2019t have rights under the Constitution, Roosevelt called it \u201cpreposterous.\u201d", "In fact, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth\u00a0amendments directly address the rights of those accused of a crime.", "One of the Facebook groups that shared the meme includes on its \u201cabout\u201d page this disclaimer: \u201cSome of the stuff we post here may not be totally factual or accurate (if at all) and might even be considered \u2018fake news\u2019.\u201d But another Facebook page that shared the same text in a different meme has only this written on its \u201cabout\u201d page: \u201cThis group was created for the sole purpose of helping out President Trump, The People\u2019s President Make America Great Again and to share the truth.\u201d", "In both cases, though, the information shared in the meme is false.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
