Bush\u2019s tenure and 27 since President Barack Obama\u2019s Jan. 20, 2009, inauguration. (Abbott himself was sworn in Dec. 2, 2002.)", "Outcomes of the 27 Obama-era lawsuits, by our count: five clear-cut \"wins,\" eight \"losses,\" four cases in which Texas agreed to dismiss its case when circumstances changed, nine cases in progress -- and one that could be called a partial win, perhaps: 2010\u2019s 26-state challenge to Obamacare that ended with the Supreme Court declaring it was legal to tax individuals without health care, but states could not be required to expand Medicaid.", "Abbott\u2019s staff, Bean said, would count eight \"wins\" during the Obama administration, including the Medicaid decision and two dismissals in which \"the state got what it wanted.\" Bean noted all but one \"win\" are final (can no longer be appealed) and of the eight \"losses,\" she said, six are being appealed and one could be appealed.", "In our count of five \"wins,\" four lawsuits were against the Environmental Protection Agency and one against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The EPA has appealed one ruling to the Supreme Court, and FERC filed for a clarification of the judgment in its case.", "In most of the 27 cases, Texas was the lead plaintiff or only plaintiff. These included lawsuits in which Abbott was acting at the request of a department or branch of Texas state government. Bean said, \"We file them on behalf of state agencies. We\u2019re the lawyer, they\u2019re the client.\"", "Twice, Texas was originally listed among other states but not as the lead plaintiff, and in 11 cases Texas and other states or parties filed similar lawsuits that were bundled together by the courts sometimes resulting in Texas not being listed as the lead, or original, plaintiff.", "Both cases in which Texas was an original plaintiff but not the lead plaintiff involved challenges to Obamacare: the 2010 lawsuit by 26 states that ended with the Supreme Court declaring it was legal to tax individuals without health care and the 2012 case in which seven states sued over a requirement that religious employers offer insurance covering certain birth control methods.", "For perspective, we reached Stefanie Lindquist, associate dean for external affairs at the University of Texas Law School with a specialty in empirical legal studies. Lindquist told us by phone that she would not attach much significance to those circumstances when trying to determine whether Texas was itself suing the federal government agency.", "\"This is situations where they\u2019re actually named parties in the suit,\" she said, rather than, for example, filing a brief lending support to one side.", "States\u2019 attorneys general often join forces to challenge laws, she said, as in the Obamacare lawsuit that eventually included 26 states. (Texas was among 14 states listed as plaintiffs in the original suit, filed by Florida.)", "\"They\u2019re lending resources, so it\u2019s not that Texas is not a real litigant,\" Lindquist said. Even when later joining other plaintiffs, she said, \"I don\u2019t think that means they\u2019re not a plaintiff, I just think it means they\u2019re one of many.\"", "Democratic activist Matt Angle, whom we asked to weigh in, did object to Abbott\u2019s inclusion of the two multi-state Obamacare lawsuits. But he raised a larger objection: the inclusion of two cases in which Texas sought preclearance under the federal Voting Rights Act for changes to its voting process.", "Angle, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Lone Star Project, told us by email that in filing these suits, Abbott \"took action as a defensive and not offensive tactic. ... No way he should get credit in these two instances.\"", "Under the Voting Rights Act, governments in certain jurisdictions (notably, several Southern states) where minority voter turnout was previously low must get federal clearance before changes in voting laws can take effect.", "To get that clearance, Lindquist said, \"you have a choice of two different avenues. One is you can request the preclearance of the election law change with the Department of Justice via letter. \u2026 Or, you can go to court to seek the preclearance\" by the action of filing a lawsuit.", "During the Obama administration, Texas has sought preclearance twice in high-profile cases -- in 2011, for redrawn legislative voting districts, and in 2012, for a measure requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls.", "In those cases, Lindquist said, \"to say yes, that the State of Texas sued the government, yes that\u2019s true.\" \u00a0But looking at the main purpose of such suits, she said, \"it\u2019s not quite the same as suing the government to force the government to change its behavior. They\u2019re suing the federal government to seek preclearance under a federal law, and they\u2019re just going to a different forum to do it.\"", "Our ruling", "Abbott said, \"I\u2019ve sued the Obama administration now 25 times.\" Since Obama became president, Texas has filed or been a party to 27 lawsuits against the federal government. This statement is True.", "Associated Press news story, \"Abbott trumpeting his conservative credentials,\" April 30, 2013", "Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, remarks to FreedomWorks Texas summit, Austin, April 27, 2013", "Associated Press news story, \"Texas spends big bucks suing federal government on state issues,\" Sept. 9, 2012", "Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office document, \"Suits Filed by the State of Texas Against a Federal Agency December 2002 through Present,\" received May 8, 2013", "Telephone and email interviews, excerpted, with Lauren Bean, deputy communications director, Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office, May 3-10, 2013", "Email interviews, excerpted, Matt Angle, Lone Star Project, May 6-9, 2013", "Telephone interview, Stefanie Lindquist, associate dean for external affairs, University of Texas Law School, May 9, 2013", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
