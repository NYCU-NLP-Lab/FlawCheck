["Hard to believe, but we have another fact check on systems development charges. After all, there was no way Charlie Hales was going to take criticism lightly on the wonky subject. Hales pointed out to Jefferson Smith that development charges have nothing to do with maintenance, which is what the question was about.\n\n\"Actually, Jefferson,\" Hales said, \"under state law, and it\u2019s something you should know, systems development charges can only be spent on capital investment. They can\u2019t be spent on maintenance. We have a maintenance problem. That\u2019s a different pot of revenue. It\u2019s not what systems development charges pays for.\"\n\nSmith argued that if we\u2019re not collecting systems development charges to pay for capital construction related to growth then that money has to come out of the general fund that should be used to pay for maintenance.\n\nWho\u2019s right?\n\nSmith is flatly inaccurate in suggesting the law has changed. (He and his campaign later clarified that he did not mean to suggest the law had changed.)\n\nOregon Revised Statutes, says systems development charges may be used only for \"capital improvement.\" That improvement \"does not include the costs of the operation or routine maintenance of capital improvements.\"\n\nWe find Hales\u2019 statement True.", "KGW/Oregonian Mayoral Debate, April 30, 2012\nEmail from Jessica Moskovitz, campaign manager for Charlie Hales, May 1, 2012\nInterview with Justin Wood, lobbyist with Home Builders Association of Metropolitan Portland, May 2, 2012\nInterview with and emails from Stacey Dycus, campaign director for Jefferson Smith, May 3, 2012\nCity of Portland, \"System Development Charges,\" (website)\nOregon Revised Statutes Chapter 223- Local Improvements and Works Generally", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
