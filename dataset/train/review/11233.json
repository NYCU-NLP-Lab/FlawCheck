Eighty-five percent of those arrests are for possession, accounting for 55 percent of all drug arrests,\" James Bell, the director of Georgia C.A.R.E.

The drug is already legal for medical use in 18 states. But marijuana remains illegal under federal laws, although Obama has said federal law enforcers have \"bigger fish to fry\" than chasing down marijuana users.", "Georgia prosecutes marijuana offenses under its Controlled Substances Act, and it has various fines and punishments for growing, buying, selling and possessing the drug. (Georgia also passed its own medical marijuana law in 1980, but the law has never been implemented.)", "Bell said his numbers are derived from estimates of FBI arrest data for the state of Georgia. Doing the math on his claim, 85 percent of the 35,000 annual arrests would equal 29,750 arrests for marijuana possession.

Do all jurisdictions report arrests?", "An explanation of arrest data on the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting program states that the report counts one arrest for each separate instance in which a person is arrested, cited or summoned for an offense. Because a person can be arrested multiple times, the FBI report doesn\u2019t reflect the number of people who have been arrested, but the number of times people are arrested.", "So what\u2019s the skinny?", "Marijuana legalization advocate James Bell said about 100 Georgians are arrested each day on charges of marijuana possession.", "Bell\u2019s claim is based on FBI crime report arrest data.
