Ashley Hinson, the Republican from Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District, voiced her opposition to Biden\u2019s immigration approach in\u00a0a tweet\u00a0on Jan. 23.

Biden\u2019s order calls Trump\u2019s declaration unwarranted and terminates it. Biden said his administration would not divert more money to the U.S.-Mexico border wall and that construction would be paused unless the Secretary of Defense or Secretary of Homeland Security made an exception.", "Biden\u2019s proclamation says the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security will assess the legality of funding and contracting methods used to build the wall and the consequences for stopping the wall\u2019s construction.", "\"Like every nation, the United States has a right and a duty to secure its borders and protect its people against threats. But building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution,\" Biden said in the proclamation. \"It is a waste of money that diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security.\"", "However, none of Biden\u2019s day one executive actions mentions amnesty. Moreover, a\u00a0Fox News articlethat Hinson responded to in a retweet of the article does not mention blanket amnesty.", "A\u00a0previous fact check\u00a0stated, \"The idea of \u2018blanket amnesty\u2019 suggests a formal, legal act, in which the government pardons a group for violating immigration policies and allows them to obtain permanent residency.\"", "The executive action Biden took\u00a0revoked\u00a0Trump\u2019s executive order, which\u00a0restricted people\u00a0from a list of countries, predominantly Musilim, from entering the United States. Biden also\u00a0restored\u00a0the Obama Administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which allowed for a two-year deferment on removing from the country immigrants who\u00a0met certain criteria.", "Biden\u00a0favors giving legal status\u00a0to people who live in the United States illegally, although they would have to clear hurdles. His executive order on\u00a0the revision\u00a0of civil immigiration enforcement policies and priorities revoked another\u00a0Trump executive action\u00a0that directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize removing immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visa. Removal was called for, especially, for those convicted of a criminal offense, charged with an offense that is not resolved, engaged in fraud, or who have abused any government program distributing public benefits, are under final order of removal but have not exited the country, of have been deemed a risk to public safety or national security by an immigration officer.", "While Biden\u2019s executive actions call for a pause of border wall construction with a goal of ending it, none of his day-one immigration related actions call for blanket amnesty. Hinson\u2019s comment on the retweet contains an element of truth \u2014 the border wall characterization.
