Comparisons to that legislation are being made to tax bills now before Congress. (Associated Press)", "U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan says not to worry that polls show most Americans don\u2019t support supporting the historic tax reform he and other Republicans are pushing toward a final vote.", "At this stage prior to the last major tax reform, in 1986, the Wisconsin Republican says, support was low, too.", "Let\u2019s see if Ryan -- suddenly in the spotlight over whether he might retire -- is right on his history.", "Ryan\u2019s claim", "Ryan made his claim during a Dec. 13, 2017 interview with Jay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Ryan referred to the 1986 reform, signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan, during this exchange:", "Weber: Are you losing the messaging war, though, with these polls showing half of the country doesn\u2019t like this plan? They clearly don\u2019t understand it.", "Ryan: Yeah, I think that\u2019s right. You know, we went back and took solace in this. Gosh, everybody looks at the Reagan tax reform as such a phenomenal success \u2026.And guess what: The thing was polling at about 18 percent right before they passed it.", "\"Polling at about 18 percent\" is a bit vague, but let\u2019s see what the evidence shows.", "The polls", "As Weber indicated, December 2017 polls about the current tax reform show not only that support is low, but that opposition is high.", "Three examples: Only 25 percent approved of the way Republicans \"are handling\" tax reform and 63 percent disapproved (Marist); 26 percent approved \"of the Republican tax plan\" and 55 percent disapproved (Quinnipiac); and, among those who said they were aware of the tax plan, 31 percent said they supported it and 49 percent were opposed (Reuters/Ipsos).", "Let\u2019s be clear on the timing in terms of weighing Ryan\u2019s claim.", "On the same morning of Ryan\u2019s interview, Republicans in Congress announced that House and Senate leaders had reached a deal on reconciling separate tax reform bills that had been approved in the House and the Senate. Details of the agreement had not been released. It was expected that the final bill would be ready for votes in the House and Senate the following week, with a goal of getting the bill to President Donald Trump before Christmas.", "It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint when the 1986 tax reform effort was at the same stage as the current effort. But mid- to late-1986 would be roughly the time frame.", "According to a New York Times chronology, on July 17, 1986, \"in a room overflowing with lobbyists from every conceivable commercial interest, 11 senators and 11 representatives (began) the conference to write the final version of the legislation.\" The final version was approved by the House and Senate in late-September 1986. Reagan signed the bill Oct. 22, 1986.", "Polling experts told us they were surprised, after looking back, how relatively little polling was done about support for the 1986 tax reform at this stage in the process.", "Ryan\u2019s office cited to us one result from a September 1986 Gallup Poll: 18 percent said they thought their taxes would decrease under the plan.", "But that question isn\u2019t on point in terms of support or approval. More importantly, that poll was taken after the House-Senate conference committee had approved the 1986 bill.

That\u2019s close to Ryan\u2019s 18 percent claim.", "But two other polls showed approval of the bill at or near 40 percent, as more respondents were willing to choose Approve or Disapprove, rather than Don\u2019t Know.
