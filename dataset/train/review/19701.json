In a Nov. 7 court order, New York state Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla wrote that the $2.8 million donated to the Trump Foundation \u201cwas used for Mr. Trump\u2019s political campaign and disbursed by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign staff, rather than by the Foundation,\u201d in violation of state law. The grants to veterans groups were announced at Trump campaign events, for example.", "Scarpulla concluded that a \u201creview of the record, including the factual admissions in the Final Stipulation, establishes that Mr. Trump breached his fiduciary duty to the Foundation.\u201d However, she also acknowledged that \u201cthe Funds did ultimately reach their intended destinations, i.e., charitable organizations supporting veterans.\u201d", "Records obtained by the state show donations totaling $2.825 million were given to 34 veterans organizations between January 2016 and June 2016.", "The state argued that the judge should order Trump to pay $2.823 million in damages based on the fundraiser matter, but Scarpulla set the amount at $2 million, she said, because veterans organizations did get the money raised for them.", "Biden made a dubious claim when he said, \u201cThe fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All.\u201d", "But the opposite is true, according to a poll published earlier that same day by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.", "The KFF poll of 1,205 adults was conducted Nov. 7-12 and found that 77% of Democrats (and 53% of all adult Americans regardless of party) said they favored \u201cMedicare-for-all.\u201d", "That\u2019s what they said when asked, \u201cDo you favor or oppose having a national health plan, sometimes called \u2018Medicare-for-all,\u2019 in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan?\u201d", "Biden would be correct to say that support is soft, and might change. An earlier KFF poll, published in January, found that overall support for the idea plunged by 23 points when voters (regardless of party) were told it would require most Americans to pay more in taxes, and by 21 points when told it would eliminate private health insurance companies.", "And CNN reported in July that its own poll showed that among potential Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, only 31% supported Medicare for All when given the alternative of a \u201cpublic option,\u201d favored by 48%. That\u2019s a government-run insurance plan that would compete with, but not replace, private insurance. CNN said 12% didn\u2019t want a national health care plan at all.", "Warren continued to bill her wealth tax as a plan that would require the wealthiest top one-tenth of 1% of Americans to \u201cpitch in 2 cents.\u201d It\u2019s true that under her plan those worth between $50 million and $1 billion would pay an annual 2% wealth tax. But the rate on assets over $1 billion would be triple that.", "Warren: You know, I have proposed a 2 cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than 50 billion dollars in assets. Your first $50 billion is free and clear. But your 50 billionth and first dollar, you\u2019ve got to pitch in 2 cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, you\u2019ve got to pitch in a few pennies more. Here\u2019s the thing, doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone. It\u2019s about saying you built something great in this country, good for you. But you did it using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You did it getting your goods on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You did it protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for. So when you make it big, when you make it really big, when you make it top one-tenth of 1% big, pitch in 2 cents so everybody gets a chance to make it.", "Under Warren\u2019s original wealth tax plan, households would pay an annual 2% tax on all assets \u2014 net worth \u2014 above $50 million (not $50 billion, as she mistakenly said in the debate), and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion.", "As we wrote in our story \u201cFacts on Warren\u2019s Wealth Tax Plan,\u201d University of California, Berkeley economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez\u00a0estimated Warren\u2019s tax\u00a0would fall on about 75,000 U.S. households (less than 0.1%) and would raise around $2.75 trillion over 10 years. As she has in past debates, Warren rattled off a list of education priorities, such as universal pre-K and free public college tuition, that the tax could pay for. (As\u00a0we have written, it is a matter of debate among economists and tax experts as to whether her plan would raise as much revenue as she expects.)", "But since then, Warren unveiled\u00a0her plan\u00a0to pay for Medicare for All, which included upping the wealth tax on assets over $1 billion to 6%. While\u00a0Forbes\u00a0estimates there are less than 1,000 billionaires in the U.S., Warren estimated the additional 3% annual wealth tax \u2014 which she dismissed as \u201ca few pennies more\u201d \u2014 would raise an additional $1 trillion over 10 years.", "Warren\u00a0said\u00a0on Nov. 1 that even with the annual tax, the net worth of the super-wealthy would continue to grow, because they \u201cwill still likely pay less than what they would earn just from putting their assets into an index fund and doing nothing.\u201d But some tax experts we spoke to doubt that\u2019s true.", "Kyle Pomerleau, formerly chief economist at the Tax Foundation and now a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told us it was unrealistic to assume billionaires could put all their wealth into an index fund. \u201cHousing, for example, is a source of wealth [that] isn\u2019t simply going to be liquidated and put into the market as a means to \u2018outperform\u2019 the wealth tax,\u201d Pomerleau said.", "An\u00a0analysis\u00a0by Zucman and Saez found that if an annual 3% tax on wealth over $1 billion had been enacted in 1982, the wealth of some of the richest Americans would be dramatically reduced. (See Table 4 for a breakdown of the projected effects on some of the wealthiest Americans.)", "Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, noted that Warren is taxing both wealth and the investment returns to that wealth, and by his\u00a0calculation, \u201cSomeone like Bill Gates would be paying wealth and capital gains taxes equal to a marginal effective income tax rate of more than 100 percent.\u201d", "Whatever one may think about that, Warren\u2019s \u201c2 cents\u201d talking point \u2014 which she even used in a\u00a0recent ad\u00a0featuring several billionaires \u2014 is only true for those with a net worth between $50 million and $1 billion; for those with a net worth over $1 billion, it\u2019s triple that.", "Gabbard asked fact-checkers to check her claim that Buttigieg recently said that he \u201cwould be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels.\u201d Buttigieg called Gabbard\u2019s claim \u201coutlandish.\u201d", "We reviewed the\u00a0Buttigieg remarks\u00a0in question, and found that Gabbard did leave out part of what he said at a\u00a0Nov. 17 forum\u00a0in Los Angeles.", "At the forum featuring five Democratic presidential candidates, a reporter brought up the\u00a0nine Americans killed\u00a0this month in northern Mexico and asked Buttigieg if he would ever consider sending U.S. troops to Mexico to help deal with the cartels, as President Trump\u00a0has\u00a0suggested.", "Buttigieg said \u201cthere is a scenario where we could have security cooperation\u201d with Mexico if it is \u201cwelcomed by our partners south of the border.\u201d But, he said, he would only send U.S. troops into conflict \u201cif there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line, and if this was necessary in order for us to uphold our treaty obligations.\u201d", "Here\u2019s the Gabbard and Buttigieg\u00a0exchange\u00a0from the debate.", "Gabbard: I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels. \u2026", "Buttigieg: I know that it\u2019s par for the course in Washington to take remarks out of context, but that is outlandish even by the standards of today\u2019s politics.", "Gabbard:\u00a0Are you saying you that didn\u2019t say that?", "Buttigieg:\u00a0I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. We\u2019ve been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships, for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?", "Gabbard:\u00a0That\u2019s not what I said. \u2026", "Buttigieg:\u00a0I\u2019m talking about building up alliances. \u2026", "Gabbard:\u00a0You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels and your answer was \u201cyes.\u201d The fact-checkers can check this out.", "And here are the relevant questions and answers from\u00a0Buttigieg\u2019s portion\u00a0of the forum:", "ABC7 reporter Adrienne Alpert, Nov. 17:\u00a0After a number of Americans were murdered in northern Mexico, President Trump suggested sending U.S. troops to help Mexico deal with the cartels. With your military experience, is there a way to deal with the cartels that doesn\u2019t violate Mexico\u2019s sovereignty?", "Buttigieg:\u00a0Well, one of the biggest things I learned during my time deployed abroad is the importance of our alliances our friendships, and this president \u2014 needless to say \u2014 has destroyed just about every relationship he can find. That makes America less safe, whether it is turning our back on Kurdish allies who put their lives on the line to help us fight ISIS, or right here in our own hemisphere alienating those very countries that we need to have a better partnership with. Remember, it is in the interest of both the United States and Mexico for Mexico to prosper with greater economic success and security than they have right now. So, if it is in the context of a security partnership, then I would welcome ways to make sure that America is doing what we can to insure that our neighbor to the south is secure. But doing it in a way that calls into question Mexican sovereignty completely misses how we got here. By the way, a lot of this is a question of the demand side on the United States. Part of what we can do is make drug trafficking less profitable by walking away from the failed war on drugs here in the United States. That is a policy that we know through experience hasn\u2019t worked. We\u2019ve got to do our part here at home and partner with other countries abroad.", "Reporter:\u00a0But mayor, specifically, do you see a time where troops could go into Mexico if Mexico welcomed it, for instance?", "Buttigieg:\u00a0There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation as we do with countries around the world. Now, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line, and if this was necessary in order for us to uphold our treaty obligations. But we could absolutely be in some kind of partnership role if, and only if, it is welcomed by our partners south of the border.", "Buttigieg\u2019s campaign\u00a0later added\u00a0that he would only consider sending troops to Mexico as a \u201clast resort.\u201d", "Harris went too far when she accused Trump of \u201cshutting down the [military] operations with South Korea for the last year and a half.\u201d In fact, those operations were scaled back significantly, but not eliminated.", "It\u2019s true that on June 12, 2018, Trump said he would stop \u201cprovocative\u201d military exercises\u00a0with South Korea. But only five months later, in November 2018, about\u00a0500 U.S. and South Korean Marines\u00a0took part in a joint drill.

But Harris was wrong to say that operations had shut down entirely.", "In making a point about economic injustice, Warren mixed up some figures on the student loan disparity between black and white students.", "Warren: Right now in America, African Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college, borrow more money while they\u2019re in college, and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out. Today in America, a new study came out, 20 years out, whites who borrowed money, 94 percent of them have paid off their student loan debt, 5 percent of African Americans have paid it off.", "The campaign referred us to a study released in September by the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University, which looked at student debt for a cohort of undergraduates who started college in 1995-1996. As Warren said, that study shows that African American students were \u201cmore likely than their White peers to take on student debt, to take larger amounts of loans, and to have debt\u201d after 20 years.", "But Warren was wrong when she said 94% of white students \u201chave paid off their student loan debt,\u201d while only \u201c5% of African Americans have paid it off.\u201d Actually, the study says 49% of white student-loan holders and 26% of black student borrowers were debt-free after 20 years.", "Instead, Warren seemed to be referring to this part of the study: \u201cTwenty years after starting college, the median debt of White borrowing students has been reduced by 94 percent \u2014 with almost half holding no student debt \u2014 whereas Black borrowers at the median still owe 95 percent of their cumulative borrowing total.\u201d", "The study goes on to say, \u201cTwo decades after beginning their degrees, the median Black student borrower has $18,500 in loans remaining, while the median White borrower holds just $1,000 in loans.\u201d", "The median figure represents the midpoint, meaning half of white student borrowers owed more than $1,000 and half owned less than $1,000.", "That is still a significant disparity, but it\u2019s not what Warren said.", "In defending his record on climate change, Biden referenced his legislative efforts more than three decades ago, saying he passed \u201cthe first climate change bill\u201d and that PolitiFact said it \u201cwas a game changer.\u201d", "In May, our fact-checking colleagues over at PolitiFact wrote about the former vice president\u2019s claim of being \u201cone of the first\u201d people to introduce a climate change bill, which the website rated as true.

Which, of course, neither Reagan nor Bush ultimately did.\u201d", "Biden\u2019s bill, which instituted a presidential task force to create a national strategy to address global warming, was introduced in 1986.
