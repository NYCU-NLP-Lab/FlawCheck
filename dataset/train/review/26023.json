["\u201cPresident Trump won by a landslide. We are going to prove it,\u201d Sidney Powell, an attorney for the president, said in a clip posted November 19, 2020 on this pro-Trump Facebook page.", "It features her speaking that day at a press conference with two other attorneys, Jenna Ellis and Rudy Giuliani, who said they were representing the president and his campaign.", "Powell\u2019s \u201clandslide\u201d claim was repeated on Facebook here in a post that called for people to \u201csurround her with prayer\u201d in her efforts to alter the election\u2019s outcome. The claim also featured in this article from the Falungong-linked Epoch Times, headlined this Daily Wire article, and captioned this YouTube clip of an interview with Powell on\u00a0Newsmax, a channel that is seeking to attract viewers from\u00a0Fox News.", "That November 18 clip was viewed almost 700,000 times.", "\u201cThe election could not have been more rigged than it was... The math just doesn\u2019t add up for anything,\u201d Powell said in the Newsmax interview. \u201cThe will of the people in this country was that Donald Trump win in a landslide. If we can get to the bottom of it, and I am determined to do that, I think we\u2019ll find he had at least 80 million votes.\u201d", "In another Newsmax interview posted November 21 on Facebook, Powell made a similar claim, that \u201croughly seven million\u201d votes were removed from Trump\u2019s tally.", "US media project that Biden won 306 Electoral College votes -- well above the 270 needed -- compared with Trump\u2019s 232. Biden\u2019s popular vote tally --\u00a0 around 80 million -- was more than six million ahead of Trump\u2019s 73.9 million, as of November 24.", "According to the Federal Election Commission, Trump won the 2016 ballot with 304 Electoral College votes, and almost 63 million popular votes. His challenger Hillary Clinton topped the popular vote -- with 65.9 million votes -- but had only only 227 votes in the Electoral College.", "In her public comments, Powell, who is licensed as a lawyer in Texas, described a conspiracy in which Dominion Voting Systems and their software, used to conduct much of the US vote, were rigged to flip votes from Biden to Trump.", "Votes for Trump were \u201cso overwhelming in so many of these states that it broke the algorithm that had been plugged into the system and that's what caused them to have to shut down\u201d in some states, forcing use of a \u201cbackdoor with all the mail-in ballots, many of which they had actually fabricated,\u201d Powell claimed.", "She said the Dominion Voting system and associated software \u201cwere created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo Chavez to make sure he never lost an election.\u201d", "In a November 17 statement, Dominion Voting Systems denied \u201cfalse assertions about vote switching and software issues with our voting systems,\u201d after Trump falsely claimed the company deleted 2.7 million of his ballots.", "Dominion added that it is a non-partisan company with\u00a0offices in the US and Canada,\u00a0that does not have \u201cany ties to Venezuela.\u201d", "AFP has previously debunked claims, partly tied to Powell, that Dominion used servers in Germany as part of the supposed election plot.", "Claims that computerized voting systems altered ballots have been dismissed by federal and state election officials including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the lead federal agency on election security. They found \u201cno evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\u201d", "Trump said the comments were \u201chighly inaccurate\u201d and fired CISA Director Chris Krebs.", "Even some Republicans and those skeptical of the election outcome said Powell had not presented evidence for her allegations.", "Former New Jersey Republican governor Chris Christie, who helped Trump prepare for a debate with Biden during the campaign, accused Powell of \u201cbeing unwilling to go on TV and defend and lay out the evidence that she supposedly has. This is outrageous conduct by any lawyer,\u201d he said on November 22.", "\u201cThey allege fraud outside the courtroom, but when they go inside the courtroom, they don't plead fraud and they don't argue fraud,\u201d Christie said.", "\u201cWe cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn't happen... The evidence has not been presented,\u201d he added.", "Trump has repeatedly failed to convince judges that there were widespread irregularities in the voting process of\u00a0 the November 3 election.", "One of the latest defeats came in a US District Court in Pennsylvania on November 21 when Judge Matthew Brann said the Trump team sought to throw out almost seven million legally cast votes in the state but presented only \u201cstrained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations\u201d.\u00a0 The case involved\u00a0two voters whose mail-in ballots were cancelled.", "That ruling prompted Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat\u00a0Toomey to say Trump, whose accomplishments he praised, had exhausted all plausible legal options to challenge the result in Pennsylvania, which subsequently certified Biden as winner in the state .", "\u201cPresident Trump should accept the outcome of the election,\u201d Toomey said.", "Asked about Powell\u2019s \u201clandslide\u201d comment, Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst said, \u201cThere does have to be proof\u2026 They have to be able to show that proof\u201d to a court. Ernst criticized as \u201cabsolutely outrageous\u201d Powell\u2019s suggestion at the press conference that both Republican and Democratic candidates \u201cpaid to have the system rigged.\u201d", "Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who maintains the election was not fair and wanted to see details of Powell\u2019s claims, said in a broadcast that she \u201cnever sent us any evidence\u201d despite many requests.", "\u201cShe never demonstrated that a single actual vote was moved illegitimately by software from one candidate to another, not one,\u201d Carlson said.", "Following the criticism of Powell, Giuliani and Ellis issued a statement on November 22, saying Powell is \u201cnot a member of the Trump Legal Team.\u201d", "A day later the General Services Administration, the US government agency supporting presidential transitions, wrote to Biden to say the process could begin, according to a letter obtained by CNN. The agency\u2019s head, Emily Murphy, cited \u201crecent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results\u201d for her decision.", "The GSA does not pick the election winner, but \u201cascertains the apparent successful candidate once a winner is clear,\u201d the agency\u2019s website says. Murphy had previously been criticized for not endorsing the transition despite Biden\u2019s being the projected victor.", "AFP has debunked dozens of false and misleading claims about the US election, including that hundreds of thousands of votes were added, dumped or mysteriously appeared for Biden in crucial states.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
