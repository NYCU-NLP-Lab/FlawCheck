Mark Pocan, D-Wis., clashed over school vouchers during a House subcommittee hearing on May 24, 2017.", "U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan tried to grill U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos about a program he opposes: vouchers that use taxpayer dollars to send low-income children to private schools.", "But while posing questions to DeVos at a House subcommittee hearing on May 24, 2017, the Madison-area Democrat made a claim that mixed up the long-standing voucher program in Wisconsin with a relatively new private school tax break that\u2019s offered to people of all income levels.", "\"The last expansion in Wisconsin of this program -- 75 percent of the parents who got this money, their kids already attended the schools,\" Pocan said, after criticizing the voucher program at length.", "\"And two-thirds of the money that went in the tax vouchers to the folks who receive this were making more than $100,000. So, largely, this is tax policy, this isn't education policy.\"", "The $100,000 claim is in reference to a tax break for people who themselves pay to send their children to private schools, not the voucher program.", "The voucher program", "The 2013-\u201915 state budget made more Wisconsin children eligible for the voucher program, which dates back to 1989, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson and a Democratic-majority Legislature created the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, the nation's first urban school voucher program of its kind in the country.", "Its aim was to improve results for poor city children in public schools by allowing them to attend private or religious schools with publicly funded vouchers.", "To be eligible for the vouchers -- tax dollars paid to the private schools for tuition -- families must meet income limits. For the 2017-\u201918 school year, the limit for a family of four is $72,900 for students in Milwaukee and Racine and $44,955 for other parts of the state.", "The tax credit", "Unlike the voucher program, there are no income limits to qualify for the tax break, which reduces the taxable income for families who send their kids to private schools.", "The break also was created as part of the 2013-\u201915 state budget. Taxpayers can subtract from their income amounts paid to private schools for tuition and mandatory student fees. For each student in kindergarten through eighth grade, the maximum deduction is $4,000; for each student in high school, the maximum is $10,000.", "Pocan\u2019s office told us the congressman made his claim based on a January 2017 news article in the Wisconsin State Journal. It says that in 2015, almost $8 million of the $12 million tax cut, or two-thirds, went to tax filers making more than $100,000. That amounted to about $388 per filer.", "But the tax break has nothing to do with the voucher program.", "Our rating", "While criticizing Wisconsin\u2019s school voucher program, Pocan said \"two-thirds of the money\" in Wisconsin\u2019s school \"tax vouchers\" went to people \"making more than $100,000.\"", "But a tax break Pocan alludes to -- for people who themselves pay to send their kids to private schools -- has nothing to do with Wisconsin\u2019s voucher program, which uses tax dollars to pay for low-income children to attend private schools.", "We rate the statement False.", "YouTube, Mark Pocan questioning of Betsy DeVos (2:45), May 24, 2017", "Email, Mark Pocan communications director David Kolovson, May 26, 2017", "Wisconsin State Journal, \"Top 13 percent of earners receiving two-thirds of private school tax benefit,\" Jan. 26, 2017", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"DeVos declines to say whether she'd send her kids to a Milwaukee voucher school,\" May 25, 2017", "PolitiFact Wisconsin, \"Scott Walker gave $10,000 private school tax break to millionaires, AFL-CIO says,\" Aug. 31, 2014", "Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, \"Private school choice programs -- frequently asked questions, 2017-\u201918 school year,\" accessed May 30, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
