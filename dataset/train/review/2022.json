["About this rating", "In February 2017, several reputable news organizations reported on a homily that Pope Francis had delivered in Rome. These stories were published with headlines indicating that the Pope had suggested\u00a0that it was better to be an atheist than a \"bad Christian\" or \"hypocritical Catholic\":", "As this news filtered down to less reputable web sites, what was previously reported as something the Pope had \"suggested\" was presented as a direct quote:", "The above-quoted statements are all paraphrases of something Pope Francis said during a homily in Rome on 23 February 2017, as he was speaking those who identify as a Christian but don't follow the tenets of their faith:", "\u201cBut what is scandal? Scandal is saying one thing and doing another; it is a double life, a double life. A totally double life: \u2018I am very Catholic, I always go to Mass, I belong to this association and that one; but my life is not Christian, I don\u2019t pay my workers a just wage, I exploit people, I am dirty in my business, I launder money ...\u2019 A double life. And so many Christians are like this, and these people scandalize others. How many times have we heard \u2014 all of us, around the neighborhood and elsewhere \u2014 \u2018but to be a Catholic like that, it\u2019s better to be an atheist.\u2019 It is that, scandal. You destroy. You beat down. And this happens every day, it\u2019s enough to see the news on TV, or to read the papers. In the papers there are so many scandals, and there is also the great publicity of the scandals. And with the scandals there is destruction.\u201d", "This translation, provided by the Vatican Radio, makes it clear that the Pope didn't directly say that it was better to be an atheist than a \"bad\"  (or \"greedy\" or \"hypocritical\") Catholic or Christian. Rather, the Pope was repeating a common phrase commenting on Catholics who conduct their lives in ways contrary to their faith.", "Vatican Radio also elaborated on the message of the Pope's homily as follows:", "Don\u2019t scandalize \u201cthe little ones\u201d with a double life, because scandal destroys. That was the message of Pope Francis in his homily at the morning Mass at the Casa Santa Marta. And so, the Pope said, we should not put off conversion.", "\u201cCut off your hand,\u201d \u201cPluck out your eye,\u201d but \u201cdon\u2019t scandalize the little ones,\u201d that is, the just, those who confide in the Lord, who believe simply in the Lord. That was the Pope\u2019s exhortation in the homily, based on the day\u2019s Gospel. For the Lord, he said, scandal is destruction", "CNN noted that the Pope's homily came in response to Thursday's mass reading which included the following passage from the Gospel of Mark:", "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin,\nit would be better for him if a great millstone\nwere put around his neck\nand he were thrown into the sea.", "Zauzmer, Julie. \u00a0\u00a0 \"Pope Francis Suggests It\u2019s Better to Be an Atheist Than a Hypocritical Catholic.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0\u00a0 23 February 2017.", "Vatican Radio. \u00a0\u00a0 \"Pope: Don't Put Off Conversion, Give Up a Double Life.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 23 February 2017.", "Burke, Daniel. \u00a0\u00a0 \"Pope Suggests It's Better to Be an Atheist Than a Bad Christian.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN. \u00a0\u00a0 23 February 2017.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
