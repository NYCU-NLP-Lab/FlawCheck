["By Robert Farley", "Posted on June 22, 2016", "Speaking to a group of evangelical Christian leaders, Donald Trump claimed there\u2019s \u201cnothing out there\u201d about Hillary Clinton\u2019s religion even though \u201cshe\u2019s been in the public eye for years and years.\u201d That\u2019s inaccurate. Clinton\u2019s religious practice as a Methodist has been well-documented and widely reported.", "Trump\u2019s comments came during a closed-to-the-press meeting with evangelical leaders in New York City, but his comments were videotaped by one of the faith leaders and posted on the internet. The video begins with Trump saying, \u201c\u2026 don\u2019t know anything about Hillary in terms of religion.\u201d", "\u201cNow, she\u2019s been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s nothing out there,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cThere\u2019s like nothing out there. It\u2019s going to be an extension of Obama but it\u2019s going to be worse, because with Obama you had your guard up. With Hillary you don\u2019t, and it\u2019s going to be worse.\u201d", "In fact, there is a lot \u201cout there\u201d about Clinton\u2019s religion, and its influence on her world view, starting with her religious involvement as a child.", "According to the Religious News Service, \u201cAs a girl, she was part of the guild that cleaned the altar at First United Methodist Church in Park Ridge, Ill. As a teen, she visited inner-city Chicago churches with the youth pastor, Don Jones, her spiritual mentor until his death in 2009.\u201d", "A Time magazine profile, which ran under the headline \u201cHillary Clinton: Anchored by Faith,\u201d had this to say about Clinton\u2019s early religious training:", "Time, June 27, 2014: Clinton grew up attending First United Methodist Church of Park Ridge in Chicago, where she was confirmed in sixth grade. Her mother taught Sunday school, and Clinton was active in youth group, Bible studies and altar guild. On Saturdays during Illinois\u2019s harvest season, she and others from her youth group would babysit children of nearby migrant workers.", "The article notes that in college at Wellesley, \u201cClinton regularly read the Methodist Church\u2019s Motive magazine,\u201d that she and Bill Clinton were married by a Methodist minister, and that in 1993, she joined a women\u2019s prayer group.", "When Bill Clinton was president, the Clinton family regularly attended Washington\u2019s Foundry United Methodist Church. Hillary Clinton spoke at the church\u2019s 200 anniversary in September. In that address, she spoke about the Methodist churches she attended as a child, in college, in Arkansas when Bill Clinton was governor, and in Washington, D.C., when he served as president.", "\u201cIn place after place after place,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cthe Methodist church and my fellow Methodists have been a source of support, honest reflection and candid critique.\u201d", "During a presidential forum in 2007, Clinton said that \u201ca lot of the talk about and advertising about faith doesn\u2019t come naturally to me.\u201d She said that faith \u201cis something that \u2014 you know, I keep thinking of the Pharisees and all of Sunday school lessons and readings that I had as a child.\u00a0But I think your \u2014 your faith guides you every day. Certainly, mine does. But, at those moments in time when you\u2019re tested, it \u2014 it is absolutely essential that you be grounded in your faith.\u201d", "CNN noted that in May 2015, Clinton impressed a voter in a bakery after she cited and discussed Corinthians 13 on the spot.", "In an interview with the New York Times in 2014, Clinton cited the Bible as \u201cthe biggest influence\u201d on her thinking. \u201cI was raised reading it, memorizing passages from it and being guided by it,\u201d she said. \u201cI still find it a source of wisdom, comfort and encouragement.\u201d", "As a senator, she participated in weekly Senate prayer breakfasts. The New York Times noted that she was also once a Sunday school teacher.", "That article goes on to say: \u201cIn a brief quiz about her theological views, Mrs. Clinton said she believed in the resurrection of Jesus, though she described herself as less sure of the doctrine that being a Christian is the only way to salvation. As for how literally to interpret the Bible, she takes a characteristically centrist view.\u201d", "Although Clinton rarely speaks about her religious faith on the campaign trail, she did \u2014 in length \u2014 when a woman asked her about it at a campaign rally in Iowa in January. Clinton began, \u201cI am a Christian. I am a Methodist.\u201d Here is some, but not all, of the rest of her answer.", "Clinton, Jan. 25: I am a Christian. I am a Methodist. I have been raised Methodist. I feel very grateful for the instructions and support I received starting in my family but through my church, and I think that any of us who are Christian have a constantly, constant, conversation in our own heads about what we are called to do and how we are asked to do it, and I think it is absolutely appropriate for people to have very strong convictions and also, though, to discuss those with other people of faith. Because different experiences can lead to different conclusions about what is consonant with our faith and how best to exercise it. \u2026", "My study of the Bible, my many conversations with people of faith, has led me to believe the most important commandment is to love the Lord with all your might and to love your neighbor as yourself, and that is what I think we are commanded by Christ to do, and there is so much more in the Bible about taking care of the poor, visiting the prisoners, taking in the stranger, creating opportunities for others to be lifted up, to find faith themselves that I think there are many different ways of exercising your faith.", "There is even an entire book devoted to Clinton\u2019s faith, \u201cGod and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life.\u201d The author, Paul Kengor, executive director of the Center for Vision & Values at the conservative Grove City College, writes in the preface that \u201csome things regarding Hillary Clinton and her faith are clear: Although no one can profess to know any individual\u2019s heart and soul, there seems no question that Hillary is a sincere, committed Christian and has been since childhood.\u201d", "In an interview with Christianity Today, Kengor said\u00a0that Clinton has often butted heads with conservative evangelical Christians on issues such as abortion, and that Clinton \u201cwalks step by step with the Methodist leadership into a very liberal Christianity. She is with them lockstep on almost all issues.\u201d", "\u201cWe do, in fact, know about Hillary\u2019s religion,\u201d Kengor wrote to us in an email. \u201cIn fact, we know enough about Hillary\u2019s faith that I was able to write a 334-page book titled God and Hillary Clinton way back in 2007, and I\u2019ve written dozens of articles and given numerous interviews on the subject since\u2014and I\u2019m not the only one. I think that what Donald Trump was telling us is that he knows nothing about Hillary\u2019s faith. For me as a conservative, that doesn\u2019t surprise me one bit, as I\u2019ve noticed painfully and repeatedly that Donald Trump also knows nothing about conservatism.\u201d", "We could go on and on about the public treatment of Clinton\u2019s faith. But suffice to say that when Trump says there\u2019s \u201cnothing out there\u201d about Hillary Clinton\u2019s religion, that\u2019s just not so.", "We should note that the Hill and others reported that Trump said, \u201cwe don\u2019t know anything about Hillary in terms of religion.\u201d The emphasis on \u201cwe\u201d is ours.", "Later in the day, David Muir of ABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d asked Trump about his comments, and Trump responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know much about her.\u201d", "Trump said his comments were prompted by a question from someone at the event.", "\u201cSomebody asked me the question,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring it up. Somebody asked me the question. I said I don\u2019t know much about her religion.\u201d", "Based on the tape, we couldn\u2019t determine whether Trump said \u201cwe\u201d don\u2019t know anything about Clinton\u2019s religion or \u201cI\u201d don\u2019t know anything about her religion.", "ABC News reported, \u201cA source who attended the meeting said that no one asked about Clinton\u2019s religion.\u201d We couldn\u2019t determine that either, based on the available video.", "We reached out to E.W. Jackson, the man who posted the clip on Twitter, to see if he had a fuller version of Trump\u2019s remarks, but we did not hear back from him. Jackson, a conservative religious leader, is\u00a0president of the national organization Ministers Taking a Stand. Nonetheless, Trump\u2019s comments extended beyond responding to what he, personally, knew about Clinton\u2019s religion, to include the claim that despite being \u201cin the public eye for years and years\u201d there is \u201cnothing out there\u201d on Clinton\u2019s religion.", "\u2014 Robert Farley, with Zachary Gross", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f61b42fd-ca9a-4bc3-8d36-b51eae25bdcb", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
