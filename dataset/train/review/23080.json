["The claim was published in this article on September 7, 2020.", "The article, titled \u201cUN Forced to Admit Gates-funded Vaccine Is Causing Polio Outbreak in Africa\u201d, states in part: \u201cThe United Nations has been forced to admit that a major international vaccine initiative is actually causing a deadly outbreak of the very disease it was supposed to wipe-out. / While international organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO) will regularly boast about \u2018eradicating polio\u2019 with vaccines\u2014the opposite seems to be the case, with vaccines causing the deaths of scores of young people living in Africa.\u201d", "It also referenced this September 1, 2020, WHO report on \u201ccirculating vaccine-derived poliovirus cases\u201d in several African countries, such as Sudan, Chad and Cameroon.", "An identical claim has also been shared on this website; on Facebook here, here and here; on Twitter here, here and here; and on Reddit here, here and here.", "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), polio is a \u201chighly infectious viral disease that largely affects children under 5 years of age.\u201d The disease is not curable, but can be prevented through two types of polio vaccines.", "However, the claim that these vaccines actively cause polio outbreaks is misleading.", "Poliovirus in vaccines is not cause of disease", "The claim is \u201cplain wrong,\u201d Oliver Rosenbauer, a spokesperson for the WHO\u2019s polio eradication effort, told AFP in a phone interview on September 14, 2020.", "\"There are these things called vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks. And they emerge in areas where you have immunity gaps,\u201d Rosenbauer said. \u201cWhat this mainly is, is a factor of low vaccination coverage. Not really a side effect of vaccination.\u201d", "Genetically different poliovirus", "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states here that \u201cpolio vaccination protects people against naturally occurring polioviruses and vaccine-derived polioviruses\u201d.", "However, vaccines would only work effectively in environments with high population immunity. The WHO explains\u00a0here that in areas with low vaccination coverage, poliovirus found in vaccines can, over a period of time, undergo genetic changes and affect under-immunised communities.", "The WHO writes: \u201cOral polio vaccine (OPV) contains an attenuated (weakened) vaccine-virus, activating an immune response in the body ...\u00a0On rare occasions, if a population is seriously under-immunized, an excreted vaccine-virus can continue to circulate for an extended period of time\u2026 In very rare instances, the vaccine-virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyse \u2013 this is what is known as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) ...\u00a0Circulating VDPVs occur when routine or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are poorly conducted and a population is left susceptible to poliovirus, whether from vaccine-derived or wild poliovirus. Hence, the problem is not with the vaccine itself, but low vaccination coverage.\u201d", "Dr. Lulu Bravo, executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, also refutes\u00a0the claim, telling AFP in a text message that outbreaks occur \u201cbecause of undervaccination, less than 90-95% coverage in the population\u201d.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
