Bernie Sanders took the debate stage last month.", "\"So Bernie and Hillary want to make the cut off date for abortions up to 36 weeks,\" the 2016 post says. \"That\u2019s right! They say a baby at that point feels no pain and has no rights to life. If anyone was wondering what a baby looks like at 36 weeks, here\u2019s a picture of my baby boy born at 36 weeks.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "We\u2019re going to focus on Sanders for this check since he is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, not former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. But Snopes looked into this claim in 2016 when Clinton was running for president and determined it was false for both Democrats.\u00a0 As it is still being shared three years later in virtually identical language, we went looking for evidence to substantiate the claim, but we found none.", "We emailed Sanders\u2019 campaign to ask about the Facebook post but did not hear back.", "Sanders doesn\u2019t mention abortion limits on his campaign website. Listed among his \"issues\" is the \"fight for women\u2019s rights,\" and there he makes two points about abortion:", "\"Fully fund Planned Parenthood, Title X, and other initiatives that protect women\u2019s health, access to contraception, and the availability of a safe and legal abortion.\"", "\"Oppose all efforts to undermine or overturn Roe v. Wade, and appoint federal judges who will uphold women\u2019s most fundamental rights.\"", "He echoed the latter position during the first Democratic presidential debate in June. As a senator, he has framed abortion as health care. And he\u2019s supported abortions since before the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Roe vs. Wade decision that made abortion legal nationwide. In 1972, the Bennington Banner newspaper reported that Sanders, then the Vermont candidate for governor, said the abortion issue should only be of concern between\u00a0a woman and her doctor, not the government.", "More recently, he has criticized states that have restricted abortion but, BuzzFeed reported in May, he \"did not delve into more specifics about what he would do to fight the laws if elected.\"", "\"The consequences will be absolutely disastrous and threaten the very lives of women,\" BuzzFeed quoted him as saying on the campaign trail. \"It is not an exaggeration to say that banning legal, medically assisted abortion \u2014\u00a0and forcing women back into the arms of quacks \u2014 will quite literally kill women.\"", "In 2018, Sanders voted against a bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks and in 2016, PBS NewsHour reported in February, he wouldn\u2019t give a specific answer when asked whether he would place any limits on abortions but \"repeatedly said he was \u2018very strongly pro-choice\u2019 and believed the decision was between a woman and her doctor.\"", "It came up that year when, during a Fox News town hall as Sanders and Clinton vied for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bret Baier asked Sanders if he could \"name a single circumstance at any point in a pregnancy in which you would be okay with abortion being illegal.\"", "\"It\u2019s not a question of me being okay,\" Sanders said. \"I happen to believe that it is wrong for the government to be telling a woman what to do with her own body.\"", "Baier said: \"I guess the genesis of the question is that there are some Democrats who say after five months, with the exception of the life of the mother or the health of the baby, that perhaps that\u2019s something to look at. You\u2019re saying no.\"", "Sanders said: \"I am very strongly pro-choice. That is a decision to be made by the woman, her physician, and her family. That\u2019s my view.\"", "Now, Sanders among other Democratic presidential candidates have cosponsored a bill that would codify Roe vs. Wade. New York did this in January when it enacted the Reproductive Health Act, a law that permits abortions within 24 weeks or later if the fetus isn\u2019t viable or the mother\u2019s health or life are threatened.", "\"As president, he would use every available executive, judicial, and legislative tool to (protect the constitutional rights of women),\" a campaign spokesman for Sanders told BuzzFeed in a statement in May, \"including by appointing federal judges who will protect Roe, by fighting unconstitutional bans and restrictions, and by building a movement that speaks out for the vast majority of Americans who believe Roe should remain law of the land.\"", "When asked during a Fox News town hall in April whether a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy up to the moment of birth, he said he thinks that happens \"very rarely\" and struck a familiar note: \"the decision over abortion belongs to a woman and her physician.\"", "Searching for \"Bernie Sanders\" and \"36 weeks\" and \"abortion\" in the Nexis news archive, we found one result: a May 2019 story in the Toronto Star about Rich Coleman, a member of Canada\u2019s legislative assembly.
