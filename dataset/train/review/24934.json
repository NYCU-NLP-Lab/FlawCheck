Eisenhower in front of a tank at Fort Meade, Md. in 1919.

Eisenhower.", "A post circulating on the internet showed a photograph of Eisenhower with the following caption:", "\"When asked if the United States should have a military parade to show off its might, this was then-President Eisenhower\u2019s response: \u2018Absolutely not.

Eisenhower was president and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev presided over large military parades showing off the latest in Soviet military might. Beschloss says some in the White House approached Eisenhower, himself a decorated military general, suggesting the U.S. do the same, to show off American might.", "\"Eisenhower said absolutely not, we are the pre-eminent power on Earth,\" Beschloss says, recalling Eisenhower's response. \"For us to try to imitate what the Soviets are doing in Red Square would make us look weak.\"", "Samantha Kenner, communications director of the Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum, and Boyhood Home in Abilene, Kan., said that their reference archivist recently researched this question and did not find instances of him using those exact words.", "But Wiliam I.

He was also steadfastly not bombastic or grandiose.\"", "Janda pointed to a passage in Eisenhower\u2019s April 16, 1953 speech \"The Chance for Peace.\"", "\"The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities.

We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.\"", "And Chester Pach, an Ohio University historian and co-author of \"The Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower,\" told Snopes that he agreed Eisenhower would have had a dim view of the idea of a parade along the lines of what Trump has sought.", "A viral image said that when asked if the United States should have a military parade to \"show off its might,\" Eisenhower said, \"Absolutely not.
