In the story, the Journal includes a chart of \u201cforeign donors\u201d that shows \u201cUkraine\u201d at the top.

He served two terms as an elected member of the Ukrainian Parliament and is a proponent of closer ties between Ukraine and the European Union.\u201d", "The newspaper also said that, in 2008, \u201cMr. Pinchuk made a five-year, $29 million commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative, a wing of the foundation that coordinates charitable projects and funding for them but doesn\u2019t handle the money. The pledge was to fund a program to train future Ukrainian leaders and professionals \u2018to modernize Ukraine,\u2019 according to the Clinton Foundation. Several alumni are current members of the Ukrainian Parliament. Actual donations so far amount to only $1.8 million, a Pinchuk foundation spokesman said, citing the impact of the 2008 financial crisis.\u201d", "Hillary Clinton came under criticism during her 2016 presidential campaign amid questions about whether foreign governments had used the foundation to leverage access to the secretary of state.", "The Clinton Foundation publicly reports, and its foundation spokesman confirmed, that other foreign entities have given more than the Pinchuk Foundation (which is listed as having given between $10 million and $25 million).
