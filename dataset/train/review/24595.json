["Press Secretary Sean Spicer tried to distance the White House from President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has come under intense scrutiny recently for alleged ties to the Russian government.", "Manfort\u2019s name was mentioned more than two dozen times in a Monday hearing before the House Intelligence committee on Russian interference in the 2016 election, and exclusive reporting today by the Associated Press alleges Manafort worked to advance Kremlin interests years before his involvement in the Trump campaign.", "\"Obviously there\u2019s been discussion of Paul Manafort, who played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time,\" Spicer said in a March 20 White House press briefing, responding to a reporter\u2019s question about references to Manafort during the\u00a0hearing.", "That struck us as wrong, and Spicer seemed to walk back his comments in a subsequent press conference\u00a0-- while still downplaying Manafort\u2019s role.", "\"I know I commented on this the other day and clearly, I should have been more precise with respect to Paul's role, so let me clarify this and kind of go through the facts,\" Spicer said.", "Given the White House's continued efforts to distance itself from Manafort, we decided to review the facts ourselves around his involvement in the Trump campaign.", "Manafort\u2019s early role in the Trump campaign", "In March 2016, then-candidate Trump tapped Manafort to manage the Republican National Convention. In a press release announcing the hiring, Trump praised Manafort as \"a great asset and an important addition\" in consolidating the support Trump won during the primary season.", "\"Paul Manafort, and the team I am building, bring the needed skill sets to ensure that the will of the Republican voters, not the Washington political establishment, determines who will be the nominee for the Republican Party,\" Trump said in a statement that highlighted Manafort\u2019s extensive political experience in \"dozens of international political campaigns.\"", "About a week later, Trump expanded Manafort\u2019s portfolio to include all functions related to the nomination process, as well as additional roles coordinating outreach efforts and establishing a new office in Washington, D.C.", "\"I am organizing these responsibilities under someone who has done this job successfully in many campaigns,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Paul is a well-respected expert in this regard and we are pleased to have him join the efforts to Make America Great Again.\"", "Manafort also began appearing on\u00a0national television to represent the campaign. Manafort\u2019s April 24 appearance on Fox News Sunday was posted on the Trump campaign\u2019s official website, for example. (The post has since been removed, but can be seen here.) In his Sunday show interview, Manafort defended Trump\u2019s campaign style and evolving strategy, and went on offense against then-Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, calling Trump\u2019s most formidable rival for the Republican nomination a \"liar.\"", "Manafort\u2019s promotion to Trump campaign chairman and chief strategist", "On May 19, Trump promoted Manafort to campaign chairman and chief strategist.", "Trump campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks said that Corey Lewandowski, who had been managing the Trump campaign, would \"continue overseeing day-to-day operations and will work with Manafort on political strategy and communications, among other things, through the general election.\"", "In weeks leading up to the July Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign announced it had hired veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway to \"serve as senior advisor to the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\"", "Roughly one month after the July GOP convention, with Trump\u2019s poll numbers in decline and the campaign dealing with ongoing controversy, Trump announced Manafort\u2019s resignation, concluding Manafort\u2019s 20-week tenure with the campaign.", "\"This morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign,\" Trump said in an August 19 statement.\" I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success.\"", "Our ruling", "Spicer said Manafort had a \"limited\" role with the Trump campaign, but even Spicer admitted himself that characterization wasn\u2019t correct. Not only did Manafort work to consolidate \u00a0Trump's support ahead of the Republican National Convention, but he was later promoted to campaign chairman and chief strategist. He made multiple media appearances on behalf of Trump and worked alongside Trump\u2019s closest advisers.", "We rate Spicer\u2019s statement False.", "White House press briefing, March 20, 2017", "Transcript, House Intelligence Committee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. Election, March 20, 2017", "Trump Campaign press release, \"Donald J.
