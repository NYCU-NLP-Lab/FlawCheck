["Posts shared on Facebook and Twitter argue against the removal of the smiling black figure from Aunt Jemima\u2019s packaging, claiming that to do so would be to erase \u201cher wishes and legacy.\u201d", "\u201cNancy Green was her real name and she was born into slavery. When free she created this product and named it herself under contract with General Mills. She died one of Americas first black millionaire\u2019s (sic),\u201d the post reads.", "While Nancy Green was the face of the Aunt Jemima brand for several decades and contributed to its popularity until her death in 1923, she did not die a millionaire.", "Green was a freed slave who moved to Chicago where she worked for a white family as a cook and personal attendant. She was later hired by the R.T. Davis Milling Company to be the face of the Aunt Jemima pancake mix.", "A talented storyteller, Green travelled the United States to promote the brand, cooking pancakes and drawing crowds at shows, including the 1893 World\u2019s Fair in Chicago.", "\u201cFrom all the articles and newspaper count that I\u2019ve read, none of them ever mentioned that she had any wealth,\u201d Sherry Williams, president of the Bronzeville Historical Society in Chicago, told AFP.", "Maurice Manring, an independent historian and author of the book \u201cSlave in a Box; The Strange Career of Aunt Jemima,\u201d corroborated Williams\u2019 account. \u201cThere\u2019s no contemporaneous evidence that she was rich. There\u2019s no suggestion that she was ostentatiously wealthy,\u201d he told AFP.", "The Aunt Jemima pancake mix was developed in 1889 by Chris Rutt and Charles Underwood, who sold their company to R.T. Davis, according to the company\u2019s website.", "\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of that in the last couple of weeks, where people say that Nancy Green invented the Aunt Jemima pancake mix and that\u2019s not true,\u201d Manring told AFP. Manring said that such stories are often the result of Aunt Jemima pamphlet ads that featured stories of the fictional character, who was eventually conflated with Green.", "One obituary for Green asserts that Green herself sold her pancake\u00a0recipe to the milling company, though others state that it was her popular dish that made her a perfect spokeswoman for the new ready mix.", "Manring told AFP that the accepted story on the name is that Rutt saw a performance of the song \u201cOld Aunt Jemima\u201d at a minstrel show, and decided to adopt it for his brand due to its popularity.", "The brand icon, like the song it was named after, portrays a mammy, a Southern US archetype of black women who worked in white households and nursed white children. The mammy figure is rooted in the history of slavery, and will be removed from product packaging\u00a0for that reason.", "\u201cWe recognize Aunt Jemima\u2019s origins are based on a racial stereotype,\u201d Kristin Kroepfl, Quaker Foods vice-president said in a news release.", "Green worked as a housekeeper until her death, despite a lifelong contract as Aunt Jemima.", "She died in 1923, and was buried without a grave marker in the corner of a Chicago cemetery.", "Williams, who worked to locate the probable location of Green\u2019s remains, has been raising money to buy a headstone. She told AFP that recent media attention brought donations from $1,300 to $5,000.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
