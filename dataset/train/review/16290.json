Jeanne Shaheen -- the New Hampshire Democrat in a nip-and-tuck race for another term -- had begun making the rounds on social media.", "The Daily Caller, a web-based publication aligned with conservatives, ran a story headlined, \"BOMBSHELL MEMO: Jeanne Shaheen Conspired With White House Insider On IRS Targeting Scandal.\"", "The story was posted at 9:36 p.m. the night before the election. The story accuses Shaheen of being \"principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama\u2019s political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election.\"", "The night before Election Day is an unusually late moment for a \"bombshell\" to emerge in a Senate contest. But readers asked PolitiFact to take a look, even if our analysis would be published well into Election Day. So we did.", "Early in the election cycle, New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn said that Shaheen \"got behind the idea of using the IRS to target American citizens for their political views.\"", "In our fact-check published Oct. 23, 2013, we concluded that what Shaheen actually \"got behind\" was the DISCLOSE Act, which requires nonprofit groups to share information about their campaign contributions. We determined that it was a stretch to suggest that Shaheen favored going after citizens \"for their political views,\" so we rated Horn\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "Tuesday\u2019s story is a little different because it accuses Shaheen of being part of \u00a0a \"plot\" of harassment against conservative groups.", "As evidence the story cited \"letters exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller.\"", "Those letters were the result of a Freedom of Information request that was fulfilled on Oct. 9, 2014, according to documents provided to PolitiFact New Hampshire.", "Of the nine pages of documents provided, five of them reprint letters from Shaheen and six other Democratic Senators to Douglas Shulman, Commissioner of the IRS, asking the IRS to investigate any nonprofits that are avoiding being taxed while they \"are focused on federal election activities.\" The remaining four pages are responses to that request.", "The IRS was noncommittal in its responses to making any changes.", "\"To ensure that section 501(c)(4) organizations meet the requirements for tax exemption under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS has ongoing programs that review the activities of organizations seeking IRS recognition of tax exemption,\" wrote Steve T.

Bush in 2008.", "As for a \"program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups,\" the letters do not urge a partisan or ideological focus to the effort.
