But the edit \u2014 shared in some cases by social media accounts supportive of President Donald Trump \u2014 shows only 18 seconds of what Biden said during his hour-long rally.", "The edited video shows Biden saying only: \u201cCulture, our culture, our culture. It\u2019s not imported from some African nation, or some Asian nation. It\u2019s our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture.\u201d It deceptively omits key words at the start and end of his remarks.

And it was within that context that he made the remark in question (50:28):", "Biden, Dec. 30: Folks this is about changing the culture, our culture, our culture.
