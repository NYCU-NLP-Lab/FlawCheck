["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on January 31, 2019", "The recent five-week partial government shutdown will reduce real U.S. gross domestic product by $3 billion, on net, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. At least twice, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer has said CBO put the cost at $11 billion, neglecting to explain that the agency figures the economy will regain $8 billion of that this year.", "For example, Hoyer said this at his news briefing this week:", "Hoyer, Jan. 29: I think you probably saw the CBO report about the cost of the shutdown. $11 billion is their estimate. Those are direct costs as opposed to indirect which I think were very substantially greater. And the real cost was the extraordinary undermining of confidence of not only federal employees, but also contractors with the government and the American people themselves.", "He also said \u201cthe five-week Trump-McConnell shutdown directly cost our economy at least $11 billion in GDP\u201d in a statement released Jan. 28.", "Both times, the No. 2 House Democrat left out the other part of CBO\u2019s analysis.", "The nonpartisan budget analysts say the partial government shutdown \u2014 which lasted from Dec. 22, 2018, until Jan. 25, 2019 \u2014 \u201cdampened economic activity mainly because of the loss of furloughed federal workers\u2019 contribution to GDP, the delay in federal spending on goods and services, and the reduction in aggregate demand\u201d in the private sector.", "It \u201creduced GDP in the fourth quarter of 2018 by $3 billion,\u201d and is expected to \u201con net, reduce GDP in the first quarter of 2019 by $8 billion,\u201d CBO\u2019s report says.", "But CBO also projects that most of that $11 billion loss will be negated once previously unfunded agencies receive their appropriations and federal workers get back pay.", "For the \u201cremainder of 2019,\u201d the report says, \u201cGDP will be boosted by $8 billion,\u201d and \u201cabout $3 billion in forgone economic activity will not be recovered.\u201d", "So, overall, $3 billion in real GDP is how much CBO expects the economy to lose\u00a0based on an estimated annualized real GDP of $21.16 trillion.", "Unlike Hoyer, some other Democrats, such as Sens. Chuck Schumer and Tammy Duckworth in their own Jan. 29 news briefing, have made that important detail known.", "Now, it\u2019s true CBO\u2019s estimate doesn\u2019t include \u201cmore difficult to quantify\u201d indirect economic costs, as the budget office notes. It also stipulates that its estimates of the shutdown\u2019s effects \u201care subject to considerable uncertainty\u201d for various reasons.", "To that last point, members of the Trump administration, including Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, have argued that, in the end, any losses will be recovered in full or nearly so.", "\u201cWith respect, once again we disagree with the CBO,\u201d Kudlow said in a Jan. 29 Fox Business interview with Maria Bartiromo. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to lose anything. This is completely temporary. None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.\u201d", "The same day, Mnuchin, whom Bartiromo also interviewed, had a slightly different take.", "\u201cKevin Hassett, [chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers], is working on final numbers for us,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cI think his view is that there\u2019s no question that there was some cost, but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system \u2026 he views that it will almost all be recovered.\u201d", "But CBO is not alone in projecting economic losses due to the shutdown.", "Analytics firm S&P Global Economics, based on its own analysis, figured the \u201cU.S. economy lost at least $6 billion dollars by the close of business\u201d on Jan. 25. It\u2019s not clear if the economic group projects that any of those billions will be recouped.", "Either way, citing CBO\u2019s estimate of $11 billion in lost real GDP, without mentioning an estimated $8 billion will be gained back, amounts to telling half the story.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
