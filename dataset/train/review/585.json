That\u2019s harder to do than meets the eye. People aren\u2019t identical.

The whole approach is designed to take human foibles out of the picture.", "To really minimize the human factor, not only do you randomly assign patients to groups, but the patients and the health care workers themselves don\u2019t know what group they are in. So everyone gets a pill, but for half of them, the pill might be just sugar or something equally neutral.
