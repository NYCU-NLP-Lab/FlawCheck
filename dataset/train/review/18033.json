["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on May 22, 2020", "The Kentucky Senate race \u2014 likely pitting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell against Democratic challenger, and former Marine fighter pilot, Amy McGrath \u2014 is playing out on the airwaves. But the recent TV ads don\u2019t always square with the facts.", "McGrath, who unsuccessfully ran for a House seat in 2018, is vying to unseat McConnell, who was first elected to the Senate in 1984 and has been the Senate majority leader since 2015. Polls taken in January showed a possible general election race could be tight, assuming McGrath wins the party\u2019s nomination. The Democratic primary is June 23.", "The McGrath TV ad, which began airing May 16, according to Advertising Analytics, features McGrath saying, \u201cWhat is leadership? And where are we seeing it in the middle of everything we\u2019re going through right now?\u201d She then mentions Republican Govs. Mike DeWine of Ohio and Larry Hogan of Maryland, as well as Democratic Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Andy Beshear of Kentucky.", "Those politicians are \u201cshowing us what real leadership is and political party has nothing to do with it. I lived this kind of leadership as a Marine,\u201d she said.", "\u201cBut Sen. McConnell sees it differently,\u201d McGrath continues. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to pass what he calls \u2018Blue State Bailouts,\u2019 even though Kentucky would get badly needed help, too. It\u2019s why he said we should just declare bankruptcy.\u201d", "The McConnell campaign issued a response ad on May 19, featuring an image of McGrath from her ad and claiming she was \u201cfalsely attacking\u201d McConnell. McGrath has a point that the senator made the issue political with the \u201cblue state\u201d characterization \u2014 and as we\u2019ll explain, he and some governors differ on what they\u2019d like to see in future federal aid to states \u2014 but she misrepresents what he said about bankruptcy.", "McConnell was criticized by governors of both parties for his remarks, made in an April 22 radio interview on \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show,\u201d and his Senate office headlined part of his comments \u201cOn Stopping Blue State Bailouts\u201d in a press release.", "But he didn\u2019t say that states \u2014 or Kentucky specifically \u2014 \u201cshould just declare bankruptcy,\u201d as McGrath claimed. Instead, he said, \u201cI would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route,\u201d when asked about states with budgetary woes predating the pandemic.", "While he hasn\u2019t committed to another relief bill that would provide assistance to state and local governments \u2014 and in that radio interview said \u201cwe\u2019re going to push the pause button here, because I think this whole business of additional assistance for state and local governments need to be thoroughly evaluated\u201d \u2014 he also said a few days after that interview, \u201cThere probably will be another state and local funding bill,\u201d and that Republicans \u201care open to considering another bill.\u201d", "Here are McConnell\u2019s remarks in the April 22 interview:", "Hewitt, April 22: A lot of the state governments are going to be smashed up by this. But there is no Chapter 8 in the bankruptcy code. Who are you going to, you know, for states, no states can go bankrupt. Local governments can go bankrupt and reorganize. Who are you going to task to lead the effort on deciding what to do or not to do for the states?", "McConnell: Yeah, well, I think it\u2019s going to be a broad discussion without, you know, throughout the conference. I mean, we all represent states. We all have governors regardless of party who would love to have free money. And that\u2019s why I said yesterday we\u2019re going to push the pause button here, because I think this whole business of additional assistance for state and local governments need to be thoroughly evaluated. You raised yourself the important issue of what states have done, many of them have done to themselves with their pension programs. There\u2019s not going to be any desire on the Republican side to bail out state pensions by borrowing money from future generations.", "So this is a much bigger conversation than we\u2019ve had providing assistance for small business because the government shut them out, put them down, put them out of business, or assistance to hospitals which were overwhelmed by the COVID-19 disease. This is a very different decision. These are all taxing authorities, just like we are, and I think that\u2019s why we need to have a fulsome conference-wide discussion among Senate Republicans before we go down this path.", "Hewitt: I agree. I think people do not understand how badly mismanaged some states have been, and their unfunded liabilities. And if they were in the private sector, they would have to reorganize under the bankruptcy code. But there is no bankruptcy code chapter. Do you think that we need to invent one for states so that they can discharge some of these liabilities that were put in place by previous governors like, I mean, Jerry Brown ran a giveaway program for public employee unions that was just astonishing, and as did Gray Davis, as did, you know, a lot of Democratic governors, Illinois is probably the worst, and Connecticut. They\u2019ve just given money away for years to people who aren\u2019t working.", "McConnell: Yeah, I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route. It saves some cities. And there\u2019s no good reason for it not to be available. My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don\u2019t have to do that. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to be in favor of.", "The senator\u2019s comments didn\u2019t go over well with governors of both parties. Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, said, \u201cMitch McConnell probably regrets saying that. If he doesn\u2019t regret it yet, I think he will regret it. And I think he\u2019s going to change his mind about that.\u201d", "Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York, called the bankruptcy suggestion \u201cone of the really dumb ideas of all time,\u201d and objected to McConnell\u2019s office framing the issue as a \u201cblue state bailout.\u201d", "Hogan and Cuomo, chair and vice chair, respectively, of the National Governors Association, had called for $500 billion in federal aid directly to the states to help cover \u201cdrastic state revenue shortfalls\u201d due to the pandemic and stay-at-home orders meant to combat it. \u201cWe must be allowed to use any state stabilization funds for replacement of lost revenue, and these funds should not be tied to only COVID-19 related expenses,\u201d the NGA said in an April 11 press release.", "McConnell, in the April 22 interview and others, has said he wants any further state and local government funding tied specifically to COVID-19.", "The McGrath campaign told us: \u201cIn fact, Kentucky\u2019s largest newspaper, the\u00a0Louisville Courier Journal, reported that it was McConnell\u2019s preference that states file for bankruptcy over large-scale federal aid,\u201d pointing to an article in the paper that said McConnell had said \u201che would rather let state governments file for bankruptcy than give them a federal \u2018blank check\u2019 amid the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d", "In the radio interview, McConnell did say, \u201cwe\u2019re not ready to just send a blank check down to states and local governments to spend anyway they choose to. We had a tranche for them in the first bill, the $2.2 trillion dollar bill. It has to be coronavirus-related. And I think we need to have a full debate not only about if we do state and local, how will they spend it.\u201d He added: \u201cLook, the only solution is ultimately to begin to open up,\u201d meaning allowing businesses to reopen.", "But in subsequent interviews in the days after his \u201cbankruptcy\u201d comment, McConnell stressed that he was saying it should be \u201can option\u201d and that he didn\u2019t want any future federal aid to \u201cfix age-old problems\u201d in states \u201cwholly unrelated\u201d to the coronavirus pandemic.", "\u201cI wasn\u2019t saying they had to take bankruptcy. I think it\u2019s just an option to be looked at, that unfortunately states don\u2019t have that option now, cities do,\u201d he said in an April 27 Fox News Radio interview. \u201cI wasn\u2019t necessarily recommending it, but I was pointing out that they have their own fiscal problems that predate the coronavirus, and I was not interested in borrowing money from future generations to fix age-old problems that states have that they created themselves wholly unrelated to this.\u201d", "He said there \u201cprobably will be another state and local funding bill\u201d and that \u201cwe do want to help them with expenses that are directly related to the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d But, he said, \u201cwe need to make sure that we achieve something that will go beyond simply sending out money.\u201d", "In a Fox News TV interview on April 30, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think many states would choose that option,\u201d meaning bankruptcy. \u201cBut the point is we\u2019re not interested in borrowing money from future generations to send down to states to help them with bad decisions they\u2019ve made in the past unrelated to the coronavirus epidemic.\u201d", "And he made similar comments in an April 27 Fox News interview, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re certainly open to considering additional assistance to state and local governments, that\u2019s on top of what we have already done in the CARES Act.\u201d", "The CARES Act, or the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, provided $150 billion to state and local governments to \u201coffset expenses stemming from the pandemic,\u201d as an analysis of the legislation from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office described it.", "In an op-ed published in the Courier-Journal on May 14, McConnell said Kentucky had received more than $1.7 billion and had \u201cflexibility\u201d to use the money for \u201csalaries of first responders, health care professionals and others fighting this pandemic,\u201d as well as the \u201ccosts of testing and contact tracing\u201d or distributing money to Kentucky families. He also argued that the impact on the state from the legislation is greater than that, since the act included money for housing assistance, forgivable loans for businesses, airport funding and more. That\u2019s the law that expanded unemployment benefits and provided rebates to Americans earning less than certain income thresholds.", "But state and local officials, such as the NGA, have called for even more flexible funding that would allow them to cover tax revenue losses sustained because of the economic impact of the pandemic, losses that they warn could lead to layoffs of government employees and cuts to government services. On April 20, two days before McConnell spoke on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s show, the Louisville Metro Council wrote to McConnell, asking for such \u201cgeneral fund relief.\u201d", "The McGrath campaign noted the CARES Act \u201cdid not include funding to cover states\u2019 budget shortfalls due to the coronavirus pandemic\u201d and pointed us to a news article on an April 30 report from the Kentucky state budget director estimating the state could face up to a $500 million revenue shortfall this fiscal year, which ends June 30, due to the economic fallout of the pandemic.", "We asked McConnell\u2019s campaign if the senator supported additional funding that states could use to cover those coronavirus-related revenue shortfalls.", "\u201cLeader McConnell has repeatedly said further state and local assistance must be for problems brought on by the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d campaign Press Secretary Katharine Cooksey responded, citing another April 22 interview in which McConnell said, \u201cWe\u2019re interested in trying to help them with anything related to the coronavirus. \u2026 We\u2019re going to weigh the impact of what we\u2019ve already added to the national debt and make certain that if we provide additional assistance for state and local governments, it\u2019s only for coronavirus related matters. We\u2019re not interested in solving their pension problems for them.\u201d", "On May 11, McConnell said of the prospect of another coronavirus relief bill, \u201cWe\u2019re basically assessing what we\u2019ve done already.\u201d He told CNN, according to the cable network: \u201cI don\u2019t think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately. That time could [come], but I don\u2019t think it has yet.\u201d Four days later, the Democratic-controlled House passed another relief bill that includes nearly $1 trillion for states, cities and Native American tribes, but it faces Republican opposition. The New York Times described the bill as \u201cmore a messaging document than a viable piece of legislation.\u201d", "So, McConnell hasn\u2019t committed to the kind of flexible, not-tied-to-COVID-19-expenses relief some local and state officials, such as the NGA, have requested. And he, and his Senate office, have indicated he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to pass what he calls \u2018Blue State Bailouts,\u2019\u201d as McGrath says in the campaign ad. But that glosses over the fact McConnell has said he\u2019s \u201copen\u201d to further state and local aid, provided it\u2019s coronavirus-related.", "And the ad is wrong to claim he said Kentucky \u201cshould just declare bankruptcy.\u201d He said it should be a legal option for states facing budget woes unrelated to the pandemic.", "In its response ad, the McConnell campaign uses an audio clip of McGrath from a 2018 fundraiser saying, \u201cI am further left, I am more progressive than anybody in the state of Kentucky.\u201d", "In yet another TV ad, launched May 20, McGrath counters, \u201cMitch McConnell wants you to believe\u201d she said that quote, \u201cbut that\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s doctored audio.\u201d", "How is the audio doctored? The McGrath campaign told us: \u201cThe audio has been edited to deliberately alter its meaning and Senator McConnell should release the entire audio.\u201d", "The McConnell camp used the clip last year as well. In a radio ad response, which the McGrath campaign shared with us, McGrath said McConnell \u201ccut out half the sentence.\u201d She went on to say she was talking about \u201cnot taking money from gun lobbyists\u201d and that she \u201ccompared myself to anyone in Kentucky who had served in that office.\u201d", "The campaign also told us that it \u201cdid not record that audio,\u201d when we asked if the McGrath camp could provide it.", "We asked the McConnell campaign if it would share the full audio of the event with us, so we could settle the dispute. But we had no luck there, either.", "Cooksey, the McConnell campaign press secretary, told us McGrath\u2019s responses to the audio clip have been \u201cevolving.\u201d", "\u201cHer 2018 campaign\u2019s original response to this audio was to acknowledge that her views \u2018on many things are pretty progressive.\u2019 Then McGrath couldn\u2019t recall the context of the quote, said \u2018it was essentially a joke,\u2019 and now she claims it\u2019s doctored,\u201d Cooksey said.", "But that\u2019s not quite right.\u00a0The full quote from her 2018 campaign manager in the first instance was that: \u201cAmy\u2019s positions on many things are pretty progressive. Others are less so.\u201d And he also said, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader, that he wasn\u2019t sure of the context. That was in August 2018, after Rep. Andy Barr, whom McGrath was trying to unseat, used the clip, reportedly from a fundraiser in Massachusetts, in an attack ad.", "In a September 2018 TV interview, McGrath was asked whether her comment was \u201ca joke\u201d by the reporter. She responded: \u201cThat was, yeah, I mean, it was essentially a joke, but it was based off of one issue, right. And I was talking about the fact that I was more progressive than anyone who has ever held this seat, on a particular issue.\u201d", "We simply can\u2019t determine whether McGrath has a legitimate complaint about the use of the audio clip without the full remarks, which the McConnell campaign wouldn\u2019t provide.", "The McGrath campaign noted that she \u201cwas an independent for 12 years and considered running for Congress as an independent in 2018.\u201d", "The McConnell ad also claims McGrath is \u201c100% pro-abortion even in the 9th month.\u201d McGrath responded to that in her ad as well, saying,\u00a0\u201cOf course I don\u2019t support late-term abortions.\u201d", "The McGrath campaign also told us the claim is \u201cfalse\u201d and that McGrath \u201csupports current federal restrictions on abortion.\u201d", "The citation in the ad is for an article about an April 2018 radio interview in which she doesn\u2019t answer whether there should be any limitations on abortion when asked. But the campaign later said she respected current law, which includes restrictions, and McGrath herself has since said restrictions on abortion are \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cenough.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t think there should be any limitations at all on abortion?\u201d radio host Larry Glover asked McGrath in the April 2018 interview, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. \u201cI don\u2019t think government should be involved in making a decision on a woman\u2019s body.\u201d When pressed again \u2014 \u201cSo you think a woman on the way to the hospital to give birth could decide to abort it instead?\u201d Glover asked \u2014 McGrath repeated her response: \u201cI don\u2019t think the government should be involved in a woman\u2019s right to choose what is happening to her body.\u201d", "But McGrath talked about supporting current restrictions in subsequent interviews. In an October 2018 interview with Lawrenceburg, Kentucky\u2019s Anderson News, she said: \u201cThe claim that I\u2019m somehow for abortion in the ninth month is offensive and ridiculous. \u2026 There are ample restrictions on abortions and I am opposed to late term abortions (except when it comes to issues of the life of the mother).\u201d In a July 2019 interview with Louisville\u2019s Courier-Journal, she said: \u201cI think there are enough restrictions on abortion and they\u2019re reasonable. So right now, you can\u2019t walk into a clinic eight months pregnant and get an abortion, you can\u2019t do it and that\u2019s reasonable.\u201d", "As we\u2019ve written before, late-term abortions are rare. The most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on abortions in the U.S. found that 1.2% were performed at or after 21 weeks gestational time, according to 2016 data, and 65.5% of abortions were performed in the first eight weeks of gestation. The CDC reported similar figures for 2015.", "Abortion restrictions vary by state; federal restrictions block Medicaid and other federal health programs from covering abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment of the woman\u2019s life. Kentucky prohibits abortions after 20 weeks unless there\u2019s a threat to the mother\u2019s health. Forty-three states total have some type of gestational limit, according to the Guttmacher Institute, with exceptions for the health and/or life endangerment of the mother.", "The ad also says McGrath \u201cwanted President Trump impeached,\u201d and it\u2019s true she said, \u201cI would have voted to impeach and convict on both counts.\u201d And it features a 2018 TV interview in which McGrath said building a border wall, as Trump supports, is \u201cabsolutely stupid.\u201d She went on to say that \u201cit\u2019s a ninth century solution to a 21st century problem\u201d and that she would vote \u201cno\u201d on funding for a wall \u201cunless it came in some sort of package where we got DACA recipients to be full citizens.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
