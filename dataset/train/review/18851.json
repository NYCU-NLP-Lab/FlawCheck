That's what's inside my heart. Thinking about higher, uhm, that's not yet on my mind.", "Davila: You're not thinking yet of running for a higher office.

The public is suffering. I'm thinking, the solution, I'm currently researching about it, studying it, and then, I'm doing a powerpoint presentation for an economics solution.", "Davila: Before we drop this, I just want to ask you, in the debates now, it's being asked, do you think a college degree is needed if one wants to be a senator, a college degree if you run for president?
