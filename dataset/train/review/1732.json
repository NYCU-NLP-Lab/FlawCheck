These quotes rarely reflect politicians' actual words or beliefs; instead, they're intended to reinforce existing negative perceptions of those figures. These fabrications are often shared with clarifying statements opining that although the offered quote may be a fake, it \"might as well be real\" because it \"sounds like something [that person] would say\":", "\"The plastic straw ban is important for gun control.
