Scott Walker, who is seeking a third term. But on Dec. 1, 2017, six days before her Facebook announcement, Roys used social media in a different way to criticize tax reform efforts by President Donald Trump and other Republicans.", "She posted this tweet:", "Never let the GOP tell you again that they support low taxes. They don\u2019t\u2014unless you\u2019re already a billionaire or a massive corporation. #TaxBill", "(Attached was the graphic shown above.)", "Many have criticized the proposed GOP tax cuts as favoring the richest.", "But 99.8 percent of Americans wouldn\u2019t get any tax cut?", "That\u2019s not correct. Not close.", "The estate tax", "Roys told us she was referring to an April 2017 Facebook post by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.", "That post blasted Trump\u2019s proposal to repeal the estate tax, and it included the figures about the Waltons, the Koch brothers and Trump\u2019s family that were part of Roys\u2019 tweet. Sanders\u2019 post also said \"99.8 percent of Americans would not benefit by one nickel under Trump\u2019s plan to repeal the estate tax.\"", "So, Sanders was clearly referring to only one tax reform provision: repeal of the estate tax.", "We\u2019ve rated True a claim by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., that what some call the \"death tax\" was paid by only \"two out of every 1,000 people\" in 2016. That\u2019s the equivalent of 99.8 percent. The tax applies only if an estate\u2019s value exceeds $5.45 million, or $10.9 million, if there is a surviving spouse, and is paid by only about 5,000 estates per year.", "But Roys\u2019 tweet was making a general reference to Trump\u2019s tax plan -- with no indication that the numbers referred only to the estate tax.", "And its bottom-line claim was that \"under Trump\u2019s new tax plan \u2026 99.8% of Americans\" get \"not one nickel\" in tax cuts.", "Roys told us she now realizes that what she posted did not make it clear she was referring only to the estate tax. Indeed, a reader could only assume her claim was about the tax plan generally, with the \"#TaxBill\" reference she used and the \"Trump\u2019s new tax plan\" in the headline.", "As for the House and Senate tax reform plans now in play, with Republicans hoping to finalize a plan for Trump\u2019s signature before the end of 2017, several tax-cut provisions benefit the rich specifically.", "But the tax cuts would be widespread: Both plans would lower individual income tax rates for the middle class, and most people in lower-income households would see cuts, as well.", "Our rating", "Roys said that \"under Trump\u2019s new tax plan \u2026 99.8% of Americans\" get \"not one nickel\" in tax cuts.", "Roys said she was referring to the Republican proposal to repeal the federal estate tax, which would only benefit the wealthiest and does not apply to 99.8 percent of Americans.", "But her tweet made no reference to the estate tax. It gave the impression she was referring to Trump\u2019s overall tax plan. That plan has its critics, including those who believe it gives too much to the rich.
