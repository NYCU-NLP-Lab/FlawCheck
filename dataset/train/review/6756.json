["The leaders of Florida\u2019s two major political parties squared off less than a year before Election Day, throwing partisan jabs over health care and immigration.", "Florida Democratic Party chairwoman Terrie Rizzo called out Republican efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act established under former President Barack Obama. Republican Party of Florida chairman Joe Gruters said it is Democrats with a health care problem.", "Gruters, a state senator from Sarasota, referenced the first presidential primary debate in June, in which moderators asked the crowded field to raise their hands if they supported certain positions.", "\"All the Democrats on the entire stage \u2014 every Democratic candidate said they want to give free health care to illegals,\" Gruters said during a Tampa Bay Times forum Nov. 6. \"That\u2019s them saying, that\u2019s what they said in the debate. It wasn\u2019t me saying it. They raised their hands \u2014 every single one of them \u2014 free health care for illegals.\"", "In the middle of his reply, Rizzo said: \"Fact-check it!\"", "It wasn\u2019t the first time PolitiFact heard this claim. President Donald Trump used a similar attack in a July ad for his re-election campaign, and it rates Mostly False. Gruters\u2019 statement is not more accurate, and here\u2019s why.", "At the first Democratic presidential debate in Miami in June, NBC debate moderator and Today show cohost Savannah Guthrie asked a group of candidates to \"raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.\"", "All candidates on stage raised their hands.

(Hickenlooper, Gillibrand and Swalwell have dropped out.)", "The candidates were not asked if that coverage would be free. Guthrie then asked two candidates \u2014 Buttigieg and Biden \u2014 to comment. Neither one said they would give \"free\" health care to undocumented immigrants.", "Buttigieg spoke about people buying into a system and said that undocumented immigrants pay certain taxes.", "\"This is not about a handout,\" Buttigieg said. \"This is an insurance program.\"", "Biden agreed, and spoke about the contributions by undocumented immigrants, including paying taxes.", "So the debate Gruters mentioned doesn\u2019t actually support what Gruters claimed. But there is some question about how Medicare for All, a proposal some of the Democratic candidates support, would treat health care costs for undocumented immigrants.", "Sanders\u2019 version is a single, national health insurance program that would cover everyone who lives in the United States. There would be no out-of-pocket costs to individuals \u2014 no deductibles, no copays or coinsurance \u2014 but anyone with a job or self-employed would pay into the system through taxes. In that sense, coverage would not be free for anyone who works.

Elizabeth Warren, one of the top contenders and another advocate for Medicare for All, was not on the debate stage that night. (She went the night before.)", "Her detailed financial plan for Medicare for All includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which would increase federal revenue for Medicare for All as new people come into the system and pay taxes.", "When PolitiFact told Gruters what we found \u2014 mainly that the debate question did not include the condition that it would be free coverage \u2014 he replied: \"Illegal Immigrants have little more than what they are carrying with them when they cross the border, so as a result the only logical conclusion is that it would be free.\"", "Gruters said, \"All the Democrats on the entire stage \u2014 every Democratic candidate said they want to give free health care to illegals.\"", "The question from the debate moderator did not specify if coverage for undocumented immigrants would be free.
