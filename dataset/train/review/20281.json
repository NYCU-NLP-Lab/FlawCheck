Schmitt-Matzen\u2019s snowy beard is the real thing, albeit regularly bleached to maintain its whiteness. His shag is so spectacular, in fact, it won first place in the \u201cnatural full beard, styled moustache\u201d division of a 2016 national contest sponsored by the Just For Men hair products company.", "There\u2019s more.", "He\u2019s professionally trained. Custom-tailored in red. Was born on Dec. 6 (that\u2019s Saint Nicholas Day, of course; are you surprised?) Works approximately 80 gigs annually. Wife Sharon plays an authentic Mrs. Claus. His cellphone, with a \u201cJingle Bells\u201d ringtone, continually counts down the days until Christmas. Even his civilian attire always includes Santa suspenders.", "The whole shtick is designed to spread joy and have fun.", "Which it does \u2013 except for the role he played several weeks ago at a local hospital.", "\u201cI cried all the way home,\u201d Schmitt-Matzen told me. \u201cI was crying so hard, I had a tough time seeing good enough to drive.", "\u201cMy wife and I were scheduled to visit our grandchildren in Nashville the next day, but I told her to go by herself. I was a basket case for three days. It took me a week or two to stop thinking about it all the time. Actually, I thought I might crack up and never be able to play the part again.\u201d", "This is what happens when a terminally ill child dies in Santa\u2019s arms.", "\u201cI\u2019d just gotten home from work that day,\u201d recalled Schmitt-Matzen, 60, a mechanical engineer and president of Packing Seals & Engineering in Jacksboro.", "\u201cThe telephone rang. It was a nurse I know who works at the hospital. She said there was a very sick 5-year-old boy who wanted to see Santa Claus.", "\u201cI told her, \u2018OK, just let me change into my outfit.\u2019 She said, \u2018There isn\u2019t time for that. Your Santa suspenders are good enough. Come right now.\u2019 \u201d", "Schmitt-Matzen got to the hospital in 15 minutes. He met the lad\u2019s mother and several family members.", "\u201cShe\u2019d bought a toy from (the TV show) PAW Patrol and wanted me to give it to him,\u201d he said, voice growing husky. \u201cI sized up the situation and told everyone, \u2018If you think you\u2019re going to lose it, please leave the room. If I see you crying, I\u2019ll break down and can\u2019t do my job.\u2019 \u201d", "Nobody entered with him. They watched, sobbing, from a hallway window in the Intensive Care Unit.", "I\u2019m now going to relay what happened next, just as Schmitt-Matzen spoke to me. Space does not allow inclusion of the numerous pauses he took while struggling to maintain composure:", "\u201cWhen I walked in, he was laying there, so weak it looked like he was ready to fall asleep. I sat down on his bed and asked, \u2018Say, what\u2019s this I hear about you\u2019re gonna miss Christmas? There\u2019s no way you can miss Christmas! Why, you\u2019re my Number One elf!", "\u201cHe looked up and said, \u2018I am?\u2019", "\u201cI said, \u2018Sure!\u2019", "\u201cI gave him the present. He was so weak he could barely open the wrapping paper.

Before I could say anything, he died right there. I let him stay, just kept hugging and holding on to him.", "\u201cEveryone outside the room realized what happened. His mother ran in. She was screaming, \u2018No, no, not yet!\u2019 I handed her son back and left as fast as I could.", "\u201cI spent four years in the Army with the 75th Rangers, and I\u2019ve seen my share of (stuff). But I ran by the nurses\u2019 station bawling my head off. I know nurses and doctors see things like that every day, but I don\u2019t know how they can take it.\u2019\u201d", "In despair, Schmitt-Matzen was ready to hang up his suit. \u201cI\u2019m just not cut out for this,\u201d he reasoned.", "But he mustered the strength to work one more show.", "\u201cWhen I saw all those children laughing, it brought me back into the fold. It made me realize the role I have to play.", "\u201cFor them and for me.\u201d", "Eric Schmitt-Matzen's account of an encounter with a 5-year-old boy was first printed by the Knoxville News-Sentinel on 12 December 2016, before it was picked up by USA Today.\u00a0 Schmitt-Matzen himself did interviews with both local and international outlets.", "According to the story by columnist Sam Venable, Schmitt-Matzen, a mechanical engineer who moonlights as a part-time Santa Claus, was contacted by a friend working as a nurse at a local hospital and asked to visit the boy. Schmitt-Matzen arrived moments before the boy's death, having just enough time to hold him in his final moments.", "Venable told us that Schmitt-Matzen has refused to identify the family, the hospital, or the nurse involved in the story in follow-up interviews. However, Schmitt-Matzen did backtrack from his initial claim that he reached the facility in 15 minutes, saying instead that it was in East Tennessee.", "According to Venable, the News-Sentinel was still investigating Schmitt-Matzen's claim, proclaiming: \"Certainly, if we are in error on this, we want to be the very first to come out and say -- if there is an error -- it's on us.\"", "We contacted several hospitals in Knoxville for comment. Both the East Tennessee Children's Hospital and the University of Tennessee Medical Center confirmed that a visit like the one Schmitt-Matzen described did not occur at their respective facilities. Tennova Healthcare, which manages several hospitals in the area, told the Washington Post that it did not take place at any affiliated facility.", "It is unclear whether a scenario like the one Schmitt-Matzen described constitutes privacy violations for the patient and his family under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. We contacted both the Tennessee Department of Health and the federal Department of Health and Human Services seeking comment.", "On 14 December 2016, the News-Sentinel released a separate story, attributed to Venable and Editor Jack McElroy, saying they could not verify the story:", "The News Sentinel cannot establish that Schmitt-Matzen\u2019s account is inaccurate, but more importantly, ongoing reporting cannot establish that it is accurate.", "Therefore, because the story does not meet the newspaper\u2019s standards of verification, we are no longer standing by the veracity of Schmitt-Matzen\u2019s account.", "Another Knoxville news outlet, WBIR-TV, posted a story a day later saying that it \"verified several critical details of this story\" while agreeing not to publish them.", "The station's story cited interviews with Schmitt-Matzen's wife, Sharon Schmitt-Matzen, as well as a friend identified as Daniel Cunningham. It also cited -- but did not quote -- text messages sent from Eric Schmitt-Matzen's phone to Cunningham and another friend on the night of the alleged visit, which WBIR said took place in October 2016. It does not, however, state whether the station confirmed this account with any healthcare facility. Reporter Becca Habegger told us:", "We're pointing everyone to our web story online and letting that speak for itself.", "Since Schmitt-Matzen has reiterated his account of the visit, we cannot say with absolute certainty that it didn't happen \u2014 nor do we want to have to say it. He did not respond to a request for comment from us but did tell the Post:", "If some people want to call me a liar ... I can handle that better than I can handle a child in my arms dying. It\u2019s sticks and stones.", "However, it's also impossible to say that it did, because of an apparent lack of vetting of his claims by the multiple media outlets that ran with the story without following up on Venable's initial reporting or finding a second source for the claim.", "In this way, this particular Santa tale served an instructive purpose: it showed how an unvetted story can spread regardless of how true it might be, with each news outlet repeating it making it seem that much closer to the truth until it is, at last, uncritically reported as fact.", "Venable, Sam. \u00a0 \"Story of Santa with Dying Child Can't Be Cerified.\" \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 USA Today. \u00a0 14 December 2016.", "Konstantinides, Anneta and Hannah Parry. \u00a0 \"Terminally-Ill Boy, Five, Dies in Santa Claus' Arms After Fulfilling One Last Wish to See Him.\" \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Daily Mail. \u00a0 12 December 2016.", "McElroy, Jack and Sam Venable. \u00a0 \"Story of Santa Claus with Dying Child Can't Be Verified.\" \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Knoxville News-Sentinel. \u00a0 14 December 2016.", "Crowe, Michael and Becca Habegger. \u00a0 \"Facts Verified in Santa's Hospital Visit Story.\" \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 WBIR-TV. \u00a0  15 December 2016.", "Larimer, Sarah et al. \u00a0 \"Everyone Forwarded This Viral Santa Story.
