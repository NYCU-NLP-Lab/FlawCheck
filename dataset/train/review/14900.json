In Wisconsin, that range would yield a number in the 333,000 range that Gruber\u2019s organization cites.", "But there are several big problems.", "First, Gruber\u2019s estimate came from the total state population, while the Impact Study Commission report she cites actually focuses strictly on the adult population.", "That mismatch significantly raises the Wisconsin estimate she uses.", "Second, we couldn\u2019t find the 5 percent to 7 percent range in the 1999 study, nor could she point us to it.", "Third, the study is almost 15 years old.", "The Wisconsin council\u2019s national umbrella organization, the National Council on Problem Gambling, says more recent research shows that 1 percent of U.S. adults are estimated to meet criteria for pathological gambling in a given year.

That would boost the number of problem gamblers past the adult figures we\u2019ve discussed. Our experts said, though, that it\u2019s hard to quantify how much because of problems inherent in studying juvenile gambling.
