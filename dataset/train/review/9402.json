["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on February 21, 2020", "A Virginia bill that would have banned the sale of \u201cassault firearms\u201d has been tabled for a year, but misinformation about it continues to circulate online \u2014 including a false claim that the state will confiscate guns.", "Thousands of demonstrators from around the country, some of them heavily armed, descended on Virginia\u2019s Capitol last month to protest a bill there that would have banned the sale of guns defined as \u201cassault firearms.\u201d Concerns about the protest prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency, but the demonstration was ultimately peaceful and without serious incident.", "The bill grew into a lightning rod for the gun-control debate as national attention turned to Virginia following an election in November that gave Democrats control of both chambers in the state legislature for the first time since 1993.", "During a press conference the day after the election, Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, committed to passing what he termed \u201ccommon-sense gun legislation.\u201d Referring to gun violence, he said, \u201cI really think a large part of the results that we saw yesterday were Virginians saying that they\u2019ve had enough.\u201d", "Northam had proposed a package of gun control measures in July, about a month after a shooting killed 12 people at a municipal building in Virginia Beach. Among the proposed measures was a ban on assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks and silencers.", "The bill introduced in Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates on Jan. 7 came from that proposal. It passed Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates on Feb. 11, but stalled a week later in the Senate, where the judiciary committee shelved it for a year and sent it to the state\u2019s crime commission for review.", "While the bill was working its way through the legislature, it attracted national attention and generated coverage that got the details wrong as it spread widely on social media.", "For example, President Donald Trump last month weighed in on Twitter, saying, \u201cYour 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia. That\u2019s what happens when you vote for Democrats, they will take your guns away. Republicans will win Virginia in 2020. Thank you Dems!\u201d", "The bill did not include a provision that would \u201ctake\u201d anyone\u2019s gun away. But the idea that it did has circulated online, ranging from memes with the false claim that the state would confiscate guns to suggestive headlines, like, \u201cVirginia Dems Officially Force Through \u2018Assault Weapons\u2019 And Magazine Confiscation Law.\u201d", "One YouTube video, which has received more than 70,000 views, carries a headline that says, \u201cVirginia To Confiscate All Guns\u2026Is The Rest Of America Next?\u201d", "First of all, the bill has not become law; it passed only one chamber of the legislature. Also, it had no gun \u201cconfiscation\u201d provision.", "Here\u2019s what it actually proposed: Making the sale and purchase of \u201cassault firearms\u201d illegal. It defined an \u201cassault firearm,\u201d largely, as a semi-automatic rifle, pistol, or shotgun.", "Those who already owned such a weapon wouldn\u2019t have been affected, except for restrictions on the sale or transfer of such weapons. The bill would have banned sales and laid out several rules governing the transfer of an \u201cassault firearm,\u201d such as giving it as a gift to a family member, conveying it as part of an estate, or transferring it to avoid \u201cimminent death or great bodily harm.\u201d", "Exempted from the ban were police and military personnel who use the weapons in the course of their work.", "While the bill never included a ban on the possession of already owned \u201cassault firearms,\u201d it did include a ban on the possession of high-capacity magazines. Those were defined as holding more than 12 rounds of ammunition.", "Selling or purchasing such a magazine would have been a felony offense, while possessing one would have been a misdemeanor.", "The bill laid out various options for those who already own such a magazine: Owners could render it inoperable, transfer it to someone in another state where its possession is legal, take it out of the state, or turn it in to police.", "Those found in possession of a working high-capacity magazine, however, would have been subject to an already existing state law\u00a0that says illegally held weapons \u201cshall be forfeited to the Commonwealth.\u201d That law currently applies to a type of shotgun commonly called a \u201cstreetsweeper,\u201d plastic firearms, and weapons brought into prohibited areas, like schools, courthouses, and airport terminals.", "In addition to those two often cited provisions, the bill proposed to ban bump stocks, which increase the rate of fire from semi-automatic weapons and have already been banned on the federal level. The bill also banned the purchase and sale of silencers, although possession of a silencer would still have been legal.", "A short-lived bill introduced in the state Senate in November may have contributed to some of the misconceptions about the House bill. The proposed law in the Senate would have banned the possession of \u201cassault firearms,\u201d drawing ire from the National Rifle Association. But Northam made it clear in December that he would support legislation only if it included a grandfather clause. The sponsor withdrew his bill on Jan. 13.", "Virginia\u2019s bill isn\u2019t the first of its kind. There was a federal ban on such firearms in effect from 1994 to 2004 and similar laws have been on the books for decades in other states. California, for example, passed an \u201cassault weapon control act\u201d in 1989. Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Washington all have various bans on semi-automatic guns. Puerto Rico bans them, too, and Washington, D.C. effectively bans them since it doesn\u2019t allow them to be registered. Hawaii has banned \u201cassault pistols.\u201d", "Some counties and municipalities have also instituted bans on what are often termed \u201cassault weapons.\u201d For example, both Chicago and Cook County, where the city is located, have bans, as does the Chicago suburb of Highland Park.", "Also, legislation related to \u201cassault weapons\u201d was introduced in 13 states in 2019, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.", "The NCSL has counted the number of states with a ban on high-capacity magazines, too. There are nine \u2014 California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont \u2014 plus Washington, D.C. Those state laws typically define a high-capacity magazine as holding 10 or more rounds of ammunition, but they vary from as low as seven rounds to as high as 15 rounds.", "Delegate Mark Levine, who sponsored the Virginia bill, said in an interview with FactCheck.org, he looked primarily to the federal legislation when drafting it, but took into account other states\u2019 laws. Asked if he expects to propose similar legislation next year, Levine said, \u201cMy plan is to come back. I haven\u2019t changed my views on this.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found here.", "Virginia House of Delegates. \u201cHB 961 Assault firearms, certain firearm magazines, etc.; prohibiting sale, transport, etc., penalties.\u201d (as passed by the House 11 Feb 2020).", "Trump, Donald (@realDonaldTrump). \u201cYour 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
