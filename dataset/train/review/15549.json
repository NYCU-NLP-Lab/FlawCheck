An international diplomatic scuffle, apparently.", "In 2003, when the United States was readying to go to war with Iraq -- ostensibly vowing to destroy Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and end Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime -- France expressed its firm opposition to that action. In response, Republican U.S. Rep. Walter B. Jones Jr. suggested to Rep. Bob Ney, who was House Administration Committee chairman and thus in charge of congressional cafeterias, that french fries be renamed \u201cfreedom fries\u201d in the U.S. Capitol.", "What was envisioned as a \u201clighthearted gesture\u201d in a small ceremony by the representatives involved became a media sensation.
