["About this rating", "Hyperpartisan fake news and propaganda reached new inflammatory extremes during the 2016 presidential election, as one meme produced by the right-wing web site and Facebook page \"Silence Is Consent\" illustrates.", "The meme shows what appears to be left-wing protesters holding a banner which calls for the assassination of Republicans. In November 2016, Silence Is Consent published a version of the meme which likened \"liberals\" to \"Muslim terrorists.\"", "See the difference between Muslim terrorists and liberals? Neither do I.", "In the spring of 2018, what appears to be a modified version of the meme circulated online, including on the right-wing web site CultureKill.com. In this iteration, the following text is added: \"Openly calling for assassination. Guess what comes next...war.\"", "In reality, protesters did not carry a sign which urged \"Assassinate Republicans that defeat Democrats.\" Both of these inflammatory memes are derived from shoddy image editing of a real photograph from a real protest against Donald Trump that took place in Chicago in March 2016. (The Trump campaign, citing security reasons, cancelled a planned rally in the city on 11 March 2016, in light of a fervent and at times impassioned counterprotest by his opponents.)", "The original photograph can be seen in this report by local Fox affiliate WFLD. The banner actually read \"Trump makes America hate, our students make America great.\" It bore the insignia of the progressive group MoveOn.org, and \"Stop Trump Chicago.\"", "Several photographs taken at the counterprotest show the same individuals marching with the same banner:", "Proud to be a #Chicago girl this morning after learning about the protests against #Trump in my hometown. pic.twitter.com/6hRPQffFra", "\u2014 Lindsey Fitzharris (@DrLindseyFitz) March 12, 2016", "Chicago to Trump: Bye Felicia ?? #TrumpRally pic.twitter.com/9KBSvzNKyf", "\u2014 the Baxter Bean (@TheBaxterBean) March 12, 2016", "The \"assassinate Republicans\" memes are just two examples of countless efforts during and since the 2016 presidential election to inflame anger and divisiveness using image manipulation, disinformation, and outright propaganda.", "Flannery, Mike; Placko, Dane.\u00a0 \"Trump Rally at UIC Cancelled for 'Security Reasons.'\"\r\n\u00a0 WFLD. 11 March 2018.", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
