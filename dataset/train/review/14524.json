No, it was not a depiction of violence or even a vile sexual scene it was a vase full of well, raw cotton.", "Yes, that is what has pushed the left over the edge after the \u201cdisturbing\u201d image of raw cotton was posted on Facebook. Apparently, now selling cotton as a decoration is racist and must be removed from Hobby Lobby\u2019s shelves immediately. If you think this is a joke it isn\u2019t and sadly it shows exactly where we are as a country.", "Over the last several years, the left has been doing all they can to divide the country and it has worked. Now everyone is a racist if you don\u2019t agree with them, white men are sexists, and all President Trump supporters are white supremacists. Seriously, Alice\u2019s Wonderland makes more sense than these liberals running amuck in America, however, this is the world we live in.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Sometimes it is OK to agree to disagree, but division comes through hate,\u201d Rider said, adding she was still kind to everyone who sent her hate mail.", "Rider sounded sincere about her Hobby Lobby cotton decor complaint, but she also identified herself as an individual speaking solely on her own behalf. We were unable to find any indication that any group (\"liberal\" or otherwise) took similar offense, that any person or group had organized a boycott against Hobby Lobby over the issue, or that anything other than Rider's single Facebook post suggested the chain was \"under fire\" over the cotton stalks.
