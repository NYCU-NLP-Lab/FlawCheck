It was actually published by a \"satirical\" web site called Medusa Magazine in June 2017:", "Without porn to look at, more men will just masturbate to fantasies they create in their mind of women they know in real life. This is even worse than just jacking it to porn. Sex workers are aware that their image will be sexualized and accept that but when a man masturbates to a woman he know in real life without her consent, that is telepathic rape. It\u2019s sick.

I'll get a couple of Shitlords together, and we'll write tons of satirical articles, but from a Feminist perspective, to make the site look more believable.
