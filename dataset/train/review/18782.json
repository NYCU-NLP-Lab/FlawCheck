Then he claimed that he had found classified advertisements of mine in gay Websites, seeking young men for sex, and indeed I subsequently received few offers (which I politely declined); I didn't post the ads, so I presume someone planted them in an attempt to harass me. Then he contacted Paypal.com and asked them to close my account because, he said, I was a slanderer (Paypal refused). He then tried to block my e-mail account at Pobox.com by again claiming that I was a slanderer (Pobox refused). There have also been two separate instances in which my e-mail address was used as apparent source of a spamming campaign.
