This is not America. It is not the America I came to 35 years ago.\"", "We didn\u2019t divine how to pin trends in insults.

It says the group received 1,516 complaints from community members over the year involving the lives of more than 2,250 people, most of whom \"were subjected to incidents of bias-motivated harassment and violence\" including several murders, the report says. The report says its complaint count was up 300 percent from the year before. \"Excluding the September 11 backlash incidents,\" the report says, \"this year's normal reporting period contains 525 valid complaints, up from 366 in 2000/2001--a 43 percent increase.\"", "Our ruling", "Rachid said: \"Muslims in America have been subjected to more insults, attacks and hate crimes in the last two or three years than ever before, specifically more than after 9-11.\"", "Incidents confirmed by the pro-Muslim CAIR support this statement.
