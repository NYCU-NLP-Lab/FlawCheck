["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic Senate candidate from Kentucky, says that as Mitch McConnell\u2019s wealth has grown, he has hindered Kentucky\u2019s prosperity.", "Recently, we looked at an ad in which Grimes said McConnell, the incumbent Senate minority leader, made millions while in public office. We rated that claim Mostly False. But that was only one of several claims in the ad that attacked McConnell for being out-of-touch with average Kentuckians and biased toward the wealthy.", "Another claim caught our attention: McConnell voted \"three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas.\"", "We\u2019ve noticed that this claim -- that a candidate voted for tax breaks that send jobs overseas --\u00a0is a trending talking point among Democratic candidates, and we\u2019ve found that often the claim is simplistic and misleading. So we decided to see whether or not Grimes\u2019 claim about McConnell stacks up.", "The votes", "The ad makes it sound as if McConnell voted three times to approve corporate tax breaks that incentivize outsourcing specifically. This is not the case.", "For\u00a0evidence for its claims, the Grimes campaign pointed us to information\u00a0on their website.", "All three \"no\" votes were on legislation that sought to close already-existing corporate tax deductions. These deductions\u00a0did not pertain to outsourcing specifically because under current law, there is no special provision that gives corporations a deduction or any kind of\u00a0tax break\u00a0for moving employees out of the country.", "McConnell\u2019s first \"no\" vote was in 2010 on the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act. The second and third \"no\" votes were on the Bring Jobs Home Act, which was proposed in 2012 and again in 2014. These votes, split almost exclusively along party lines, were on procedural measures that ultimately prevented the bills from receiving a final passage vote.", "Both laws would have given a tax benefit to companies that insource\u00a0jobs and denied an already-existing tax break to companies that outsource\u00a0them.", "The tax breaks that the law would have stopped are actually standard business expense deductions. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax-deductible -- including relocation. But this isn\u2019t a special provision just for businesses that move outside of the United States. A business would get the same deductions for money spent moving from New York to California.", "Tax experts we spoke with said the law was almost entirely symbolic. The amount of money associated with these standard deductions is minuscule, compared to corporate tax revenue overall. So minuscule, in fact, that getting rid of deductions for business expenses associated with outsourcing would not be nearly enough to affect a company\u2019s decision to engage in foreign activity.", "\"It adds up to a trivial amount of money,\" said James Hines, a professor of law and economics at the University of Michigan. \"Given how many big multinational firms we have, it\u2019s impossible that it has any effect on their behavior.\"", "Eliminating standard deductions for costs associated with outsourcing would result in an average $14.2 million a year in revenue, according to Joint Committee on Taxation estimates. That\u2019s not much in the grand scheme of things.", "For some perspective, the Internal Revenue Service took in $273.5 billion in corporate income taxes in 2013 alone, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research group, based on Office of Management and Budget data. Revenue from eliminating that deduction would amount to 0.005 percent of total revenue.", "Among Republicans\u2019 reasons for opposing the Bring Jobs Home Act, the policy would have lost revenue and added to the deficit, according to Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation. The government would have spent more money on the tax credit for insourcing than it would have raised by eliminating deductions related to outsourcing. Overall, the policy would have resulted in an estimated $214 million loss over 10 years.", "Our ruling", "Grimes said McConnell voted \"three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas.\"", "The ad makes it seem like McConnell voted to approve corporate tax breaks that incentivize outsourcing. Actually, he voted \"no\" on legislation that would have eliminated the standard business expense deductions -- which exist for all businesses -- for costs associated with outsourcing. (Current law includes no provision that specifically addresses insourcing or outsourcing.) These bills had little chance of passing, and they were largely symbolic.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "Alison for Kentucky, \"What Can Happen,\" Aug. 15, 2014", "PolitiFact, \"Alison Lundergan Grimes ad says Mitch McConnell made millions in public office,\" Aug. 25, 2014", "Email interview with Charly Norton of the Grimes campaign, Sept. 12, 2014", "Washington Post, \"Grimes\u2019 attack on McConnell\u2019s wealth and votes falls short,\" Sept. 5, 2014", "Tax Policy Center, U.S. tax revenue by source, accessed Sept. 10, 2014", "U.S. Congress, Joint Committee on Taxation, revenue estimate of S. 2569, July 21, 2014", "U.S. Government Printing Office, 26 U.S.C. 162, trade or business expenses, accessed Sept. 10, 2014", "GovTrack, S. 2569 (113th): Bring Jobs Home Act, accessed Sept. 10, 2014", "GovTrack, S. 3816 (111th): Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act, accessed Sept. 10, 2014", "GovTrack, S. 3364 (112th): Bring Jobs Home Act, accessed Sept. 10, 2014", "Phone interview, James Hines, professor of law and economics at the University of Michigan, Sept. 5, 2014", "Phone interview, Tax Policy Center fellow Roberton Williams, Sept. 5, 2014", "Email interview, McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore, Sept. 12, 2014", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
