["About this rating", "Dozens of people on the set of \"Titanic,\" including actor Bill Paxton and director James Cameron, were sickened after someone laced the seafood chowder with PCP.", "The movie's stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, were not on set at the time, and the incident did not occur on the final day of shooting.", "On 30 April 2019, the Facebook page \"Historical Pictures\" renewed interest in an old news story involving the movie Titanic, seafood chowder, and the drug PCP (Phencyclidine, or angel dust):", "The Facebook page reads: \"On the last night of filming Titanic, someone laced the cast and crew\u2019s food with PCP. 80 cast and crew members, including James Cameron and Bill Paxton, started hallucinating and had to be hospitalized.\"", "This Facebook post recounts a genuine news story from the set of Titanic. However, some of the details are misleading or inaccurate. For instance, this incident occurred during the final day of shooting at one specific location but not the final day overall for the film:\nThe location was the Halifax area on the Akademik Msislav Keldysh research vessel that Cameron used to film the underwater sequences, a year earlier. Fifty crew members made the trip to Nova Scotia for what was supposed to be a pit stop to the main event. However, on 9 August 1996, three weeks into filming, all hell broke loose when several people fell violently ill after a dinner break. \nMore importantly, the included image in this Facebook post is misleading, as neither of the movie's stars, Leonardo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet, were on set at the time of the incident. \nOn 26 August 1996, the Canadian press reported that nearly 80 people were taken to the hospital from the set of Titanic for what was initially thought to be food poisoning. However, the Halifax regional police investigated the incident and found that someone had laced the seafood chowder with PCP:\n Thu, Aug 29, 1996 \u2013 30 \u00b7 Star-Phoenix (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada) \u00b7 Newspapers.com\nThough the movie's lead stars were not on set during this incident, other big names attached to the film, such as actor Bill Paxton and director James Cameron, were on set and did eat the PCP-laced chowder.\nPaxton was quoted by Entertainment Weekly in 1996 saying that he typically didn't eat the catering on the set but on that night, for whatever reason, he decided to join Cameron for a bowl of the chowder:\nExactly who spiked the chowder remains a mystery \u2014 and the source of an ongoing criminal investigation \u2014 but for actor Bill Paxton (Twister), who plays a modern-day treasure hunter, it was truly a night to remember.

By the time we got back from eating, after about 30 minutes, that's when I started noticing something was wrong. Everyone seemed confused.

They were all gathering outside of the giant doors of the building we were working in.\nI also heard later on that as soon as James Cameron realized something had been put in the chowder, he ran up to his room and forced himself to throw up.\nThis incident is also mentioned in a biography of DiCaprio. In it, actor Lewis Abernathy was quoted describing how Cameron allegedly looked after eating the drug-laced chowder:\nActor Lewis Abernathy, who played a cynical sidekick to Bill Paxton's relic hunter, recalled: \"There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics.\"\n\"I thought it was food poisoning,\" he continued (luckily he had eaten in his hotel that night). \"Really bad seafood can make you hallucinate and this caterer was big on clams. Jim was being loaded into the back of this van - I was just shocked at the way he looked. One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye - a pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd been sniffing glue since he was four.\"\nCameron confirmed that he had eaten the chowder but said that he avoided a trip to the hospital by forcing himself to throw up the contaminated food. \nWhile police confirmed that numerous people on the movie set were sickened after eating PCP-laced seafood chowder, investigators never found out who was responsible.
