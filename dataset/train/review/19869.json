["By Robert Farley", "Posted on October 22, 2018", "Q: Is it true that Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema said it is OK for Americans to join the Taliban and/or terrorists?", "A: Sinema made what she called an \u201coffhand comment\u201d when a radio interviewer in 2003 posed a hypothetical about making a \u201cpersonal decision\u201d to fight for the Taliban.", "Locked in a tight\u00a0U.S. Senate race in Arizona, Republican Martha McSally charged in a recent debate that a comment made by her Democratic rival, Kyrsten Sinema, about the Taliban in 2003 amounts to saying it\u2019s \u201cOK to commit treason.\u201d", "McSally has kept up that line of attack, saying on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Sinema\u2019s comment was \u201ctotally out of step with American values, when she clearly says in this radio interview she has no problem with an American going to join the Taliban.\u201d", "President Donald Trump echoed that attack as well during a rally in Mesa, Arizona, on Oct. 19. \u201cAfter 9/11, Martha McSally heroically led air strikes against radical Islamic terrorists. Very successful,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut while Martha was bravely fighting the Taliban, Kyrsten Sinema said she had no problems with Americans defecting from our country to join the Taliban. How does that happen?\u201d", "The comment at issue came during a radio interview Sinema gave in February 2003 to publicize an antiwar protest in Phoenix.\u00a0The host, libertarian Ernest Hancock, seemed to object to using U.S. tax dollars in foreign countries for war or\u00a0humanitarian purposes. \u201cYou can do whatever you want with your money, not mine,\u201d he said.", "At one point, Hancock posed a hypothetical in which he made a \u201cpersonal decision\u201d to \u201cgo fight in the Taliban army.\u201d Sinema responded, \u201cFine. I don\u2019t care if you want to do that, go ahead.\u201d Moments later, Sinema tried to steer the conversation back to her purpose for the interview, to talk about the following day\u2019s protest of U.S. military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Asked about her Taliban comment during an interview with the Arizona Republic editorial board on Oct. 17, Sinema said, \u201cThat was an offhand comment to direct the conversation back to what I wanted to talk about, which was my concerns around this war. I was against the war \u2014 15 years later, I think there are good reasons for that.\u201d", "\u201cBut you can see how that comment about the Taliban could be offensive to people on the ground?\u201d she was asked.", "\u201cI think understanding the context in which that conversation occurred, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve had an opportunity to listen to the tape, and heard Mr. Hancock, who is, again, a very interesting fellow, it was a very difficult conversation,\u201d Sinema said. \u201cI was really struggling to be able to talk about what I wanted to speak about and so an offhand comment to get us back on track was what I did to try to talk about the issue.\u201d", "An audio recording of the interview provides as much context as we are going to get. Below is a transcript of the full exchange (starting at the 2:15 mark).", "\u201cDeclare Your Independence with Ernest Hancock\u201d show, Feb. 14, 2003:", "Hancock: The point that I\u2019m making is is that, you know, a lot of people would make the argument, \u201cWe owe the world something. Because we\u2019re so successful, we owe something to the world.\u201d And I\u2019m going, \u201cReally?\u201d Now you would say, \u201cMaybe we do owe something to the world, as long as it\u2019s nice and sweet and peaceful and what you want to do.\u201d", "Sinema: Well, it\u2019s not so much a candy cane kind of theory as you\u2019re making it stand out. But I do think that those of us who are privileged to have more do owe something to others.", "Hancock: By force? By me, as an individual, if I want to go fight in the Taliban army, I go over there and I\u2019m fighting for the Taliban. I\u2019m saying that\u2019s a personal decision \u2014 individuals. Knock yourself out.", "Sinema: Fine. I don\u2019t care if you want to do that, go ahead.", "Hancock: If I want to go in World War II and I want to join the RAF and fight the Germans bombing London, I\u2019m all over it. I want to go get paid in how many Japanese zeros I can take down as a flying tiger in China, you know, I\u2019m all over it. As an individual, I have no problem. You can do whatever you want with your money, not mine.", "Sinema: Right, well, I think what we\u2019re talking about here are two different things. When you say we owe something to the world, my definition of owing something to the world does not involve war and destruction.", "Hancock: But if you steal money from me to go give them something that\u2019s nice and peaceful and warm and fuzzy \u2014 inoculations, shots, some help in any kind of aspect of what we can improve their lives or their lifestyle, well then it\u2019s OK to steal from me.", "Sinema: Well I think that maybe we have different definitions of \u201csteal.\u201d So, um, I\u2019d like to get back to reasons for opposition to the war.", "Hancock: Of course you would.", "Sinema: Of course I would, because I don\u2019t want to debate, you know, ah, any kind of, I don\u2019t know, fiscal opportunities with you. I\u2019m interested in talking about the war. Specifically I\u2019m interested in talking about opposition to the war that\u2019s happening tomorrow.", "The winner of the McSally-Sinema race will succeed Sen.
