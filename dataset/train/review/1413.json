And multiple police departments, fire officials and the FBI\u2019s Portland field office have debunked rumors that antifa has anything to do with wildfires on the West Coast.", "While the cause of many fires is under investigation, all evidence points to a mix of weather, downed power lines and fires set by people trying to enjoy the outdoors.", "Public safety officials battling dozens of deadly wildfires on the West Coast have also found themselves battling online misinformation.", "Some rumors claimed that antifa, a broad coalition of left-wing activists, was behind the fires, which have killed at least 33 people. Others said law enforcement had arrested several arsonists associated with the movement and that Black Lives Matter activists shot at firefighters.", "Police departments, fire officials and journalists have all debunked those claims.

Jeff Smith of the Clackamas County Sheriff\u2019s Office.

Not confirmed, but I mean, it's pretty specific: being armed with chainsaws falling telephone poles in the hopes of starting further fires.\"", "Later in the meeting, when pressed on the source of his information about antifa sightings in Clackamas County, Smith said he heard it from a \"sergeant on the street.\"", "\"I don't know who his informants are at this time,\" he said.", "We reached out to the Clackamas County Sheriff\u2019s Office for more information, but we haven\u2019t heard back.", "We can\u2019t verify whether a sheriff\u2019s sergeant in Clackamas County did or didn\u2019t receive reports about people trying to down power lines and start more fires.", "The Clackamas County Sheriff\u2019s Office has issued statements debunking rumors that it arrested arsonists suspected of setting fires nearby.
