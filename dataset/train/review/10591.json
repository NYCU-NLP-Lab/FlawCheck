["In an interview with the AP, the president stretched the facts on China, his border wall and job creation.", "By Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley and Lori Robertson", "Posted on April 25, 2017 | Corrected on October 27, 2017", "In an interview with the Associated Press, President Donald Trump put some spin on what he has done \u2014 and hasn\u2019t done \u2014 as he nears the completion of his first 100 days in office:", "The president also repeated several false and misleading claims, including taking too much credit for job creation.", "The Associated Press interviewed Trump in the Oval Office on April 21, and published a transcript of the interview on April 24. The interview comes as the president nears completion of his first 100 days in office \u2014 which will occur on April 29 \u2014 and dealt in part with the promises he made during the campaign.", "During the campaign, Trump issued a \u201c100-day action plan to Make America Great Again.\u201d One of those promises dealt with China\u2019s history of devaluing its currency to gain a trade advantage. In his action plan, Trump said on his first day in office he would \u201cdirect my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.\u201d", "That has not happened. In fact, the Treasury Department issued a report\u00a0on April 14 that declined to label China a currency manipulator.", "The president told the Associated Press that \u201cthings change\u201d and he needs \u201cflexibility\u201d once he takes office. He said\u00a0the decision was in part political, as he is trying to convince China to lean on North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program.", "But then he twisted the facts about China\u2019s history of devaluing its currency.", "Trump said he decided not to label China a currency manipulator, in part, because it has not manipulated its currency since he took office. Trump claimed credit for that, saying \u201cthere\u2019s a certain respect\u201d that China\u2019s President Xi Jinping has for him and \u201che knew I would do something\u201d if China devalued its currency.", "In fact, China has not been devaluing its currency to create a trade advantage since 2014, years before Trump took office.", "Trump, April 21: But [Chinese] President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because there\u2019s a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he\u2019s helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, \u201cBy the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you\u2019re a currency manipulator.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work that way. \u2026", "And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know some of them either don\u2019t get it, in which case they\u2019re very stupid people, or they just don\u2019t want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t call them a currency manipulator.\u201d Well, for two reasons. Number One, he\u2019s not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think it\u2019s like generalities, it\u2019s not. They have \u2014 they\u2019ve actually \u2014 their currency\u2019s gone up. So it\u2019s a very, very specific formula. And I said, \u201cHow badly have they been,\u201d \u2026 they said, \u201cSince you got to office they have not manipulated their currency.\u201d That\u2019s Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea.", "As the Washington Post explained, \u201cThe value of a currency is determined by supply and demand, and currency manipulation occurs when a country buys or sell [sic] large amounts of its own currency on global markets to change the price. But U.S. policy\u00a0is really directed at countries that sell large volumes of their own currency to lower its price \u2014 a practice that makes\u00a0a country\u2019s exports relatively cheap on global markets, hurting American exporters.\u00a0In previous years, when China artificially lowered the value of its currency, it helped the country export products to the United States, and U.S. industries and workers balked at what they saw as an unfair competitive edge.\u201d", "The Treasury report found that \u201cafter engaging in one-way, large-scale intervention to resist appreciation of the RMB [the Chinese currency] for a decade, China\u2019s recent intervention in foreign exchange markets has sought to prevent a rapid RMB depreciation that would have negative consequences for the United States, China, and the global economy.\u201d", "Moreover, the report notes that China\u2019s \u201clack of intervention to resist appreciation\u201d has been occurring \u201cover the last three years.\u201d In other words, China didn\u2019t make a change in its policy since Trump took office, or because \u2014 as Trump said \u2014 of a perceived threat that Trump would \u201cdo something.\u201d", "Economists broadly agree that China has not been holding down its currency since 2014 or 2015.", "\u201cThe accusation that China is manipulating its currency in order to gain an unfair advantage for its exports is not supported by economic facts,\u201d Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and formerly head of the IMF\u2019s China Division, told us in an email. \u201cSince mid-2014, the Peoples\u2019 Bank of China (PBC, China\u2019s central bank) has in fact been intervening in currency markets to prevent the renminbi (RMB) from falling too sharply in value against the dollar. Over the past three years, China has burnt up $1 trillion of its stock of foreign exchange reserves in order to support its currency and prevent it from depreciating as much and as fast as market forces seem to want.\u201d", "\u201cThus, China has, if anything, been doing the U.S. a favor by not letting the RMB depreciate as much and as fast against the dollar as indicated by market pressures,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cThe reason it has done this is largely to forestall any domestic financial instability from panic-driven capital outflows if it were to allow the RMB to depreciate a lot, especially over a short period.\u201d", "Brad Setser, a senior fellow and acting director of the Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations, said conventional wisdom is that China shifted from buying reserves to selling reserves several years ago.", "\u201cIf by manipulation, you mean \u2013 when did China stop accumulating reserves to hold its currency down, it stopped manipulating in 2014 or 2015,\u201d Setser told us via email.", "But Setser said the issue is made more complex, \u201cbecause China has held its currency relatively stable against the dollar this year, and that is arguably a change (though holding the currency stable against the dollar has been relatively easy for China because the dollar has been relatively stable or even weakened a bit against the other big currencies).\u201d", "Some consider manipulation to mean any government intervention in the market at all, not just depreciating currency, Setser said.", "But it is clear from Trump\u2019s statements that he was concerned about China holding down its currency to gain a trade advantage, to the detriment especially of U.S. manufacturers. Economists say that\u2019s exactly what China was doing for more than a decade, but as Eduardo Porter put it for the New York Times, \u201cTrump Isn\u2019t Wrong on China Currency Manipulation, Just Late.\u201d", "Trump said his decision to not label China a currency manipulator was partly political, since he is trying to convince China to pressure North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program. We take no position on that.", "But Trump\u2019s claim that China stopped manipulating its currency when he took office \u2014 and more, that it did so \u201cbecause there\u2019s a certain respect, because [Xi] knew I would do something or whatever\u201d \u2014 is another example of Trump taking credit for something that long predates his presidency.", "During the campaign, Trump also promised to build a \u201cbig, fat beautiful wall\u201d along the southern border. In his 100-day action plan, Trump said he would work with Congress to fully fund the wall \u201cwith the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall.\u201d", "The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as we will explain later, has moved forward with the project, so that promise is a work in progress.", "But in the AP interview, Trump lowballed the estimated cost of the project, claiming it will cost \u201c$10 billion or less.\u201d", "Trump, April 21: Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I\u2019m seeing. I\u2019m seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive.", "Associated Press: What do you think the estimate on it would be?", "Trump:\u00a0Oh I\u2019m seeing numbers \u2014 $24 billion, I think I\u2019ll do it for $10 billion or less. \u2026 \u00a0The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. It\u2019s not going to cost anywhere near that.", "Associated Press: You think $10 billion or less.", "Trump: I think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But it\u2019s not going to be anywhere near (those) kind of numbers.", "We can\u2019t predict the future, but the estimates to date have been much higher than $10 billion:", "The cost of the wall will depend on many factors \u2014 such as the height and length of the wall, the construction materials used, and whether parts of the wall are substituted with fencing or other barriers.", "Let\u2019s take a look at what the Trump administration envisions and how much it might cost.", "On March 17, U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued two requests for proposals \u201cto acquire multiple conceptual wall designs with the intent to construct multiple prototypes.\u201d One RFP is for a \u201csolid concrete border wall,\u201d and the second RFP is for \u201cother border wall.\u201d For the \u201cother border wall,\u201d the RPF says: \u201cPrototypes constructed in response to this solicitation must offer designs that are alternatives to reinforced solid concrete walls (i.e. no solid concrete external faces).\u201d", "So, we know that the administration is at least considering not just a solid concrete wall, but a combination of walls and other barriers.", "The wall \u2014 whether solid concrete or an alternative design \u2014 must be between 18 feet and 30 feet tall and 2\u00a0feet wide, according to the RFPs. It also must go 6 feet below the ground to prevent people from tunneling under the wall.", "As for the length of the wall, the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,933 miles. But the DHS document obtained by Reuters indicated that the administration will not seek to build new barriers the full length of the border.", "\u201cThe plan lays out what it would take to seal the border in three phases of construction of fences and walls covering just over 1,250 miles (2,000 km) by the end of 2020,\u201d Reuters wrote on Feb. 9. \u201cWith 654 miles (1,046 km) of the border already fortified, the new construction would extend almost the length of the entire border.\u201d", "The 654 miles of existing barriers is a reference, as we have written before, to the\u00a0Secure Fence Act of 2006, which called for the construction of 700 miles of fencing and enhanced surveillance technology. In its report, Bernstein Research wrote that under the 2006 law \u201c18ft tall steel \u2018primary fencing\u2019 is used in many urban areas \u2026 to less substantial \u2018vehicle fencing\u2019 in lower-risk areas.\u201d", "The cost of the primary fencing, also known as pedestrian fencing, averaged about $6.5 million per mile under the 2006 law, according to\u00a0a September 2009 report\u00a0by the Government Accountability Office.\u00a0At that per-mile average price (not adjusted for inflation), a 1,250-mile \u201cwall\u201d constructed entirely of pedestrian fencing would cost more than $8 billion.", "More recently, Trump\u2019s chief budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told talk show host Hugh Hewitt in March that the per-mile cost \u201cstarts at $8 million per mile\u201d and \u201cgoes up to about $25 million per mile.\u201d", "The range of Mulvaney\u2019s per-mile cost estimates would place the total cost at between $10 billion and $31.25 billion for 1,250 miles of walls and fences. Mulvaney added that the total cost \u201cjust depends on \u2026 what you decide to build in what areas.\u201d", "As we said, Homeland Security estimated that the 1,250-mile combination of fences and walls under the Trump administration plan could cost as much as $21.6 billion.", "Bernstein Research estimated the cost at between $15 billion and $25 billion. The firm \u2014 which provided its estimate during the campaign, when Trump gave no details on the size and scope of the project \u2014 assumed construction of a 1,000-mile concrete wall\u00a0at 40 feet tall and 7 feet deep, but only 10 inches thick.", "MIT Technology Review provided its cost estimate in October. The magazine\u2019s cost estimate of between $27 billion and $40 billion assumes construction of a 1,000-mile concrete wall that is 50 feet tall and 10 feet underground \u2014 which is taller and deeper than the specifications ordered by DHS, but not as long.", "We don\u2019t know what the wall will cost, but independent analyses and Trump\u2019s own Department of Homeland Security say a border wall could cost twice as much as Trump\u2019s figure.", "In his interview, Trump also repeated claims we have fact-checked before \u2014 most of them dealing with his campaign promise to be \u201cthe greatest jobs president God has ever created.\u201d", "Trump once again claimed too much credit for job creation, saying, \u201cwe create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since.\u201d As we wrote two weeks ago, under Trump, the U.S. job growth has been 317,000 jobs in February and March. That\u2019s according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "The January job numbers \u00a0\u2014 an additional 216,000 jobs \u2014 were based on a survey that was done before Trump was inaugurated.", "This job growth is a continuation of a trend that began pre-Trump: The economy added more than 250,000 new jobs a month in 20 of the 96 months under President Obama, and as of March, the U.S. has had 78 straight months of job growth.", "The president also cited examples of his job creation, and in some cases he took too much credit.", "Trump: As an example, Ford, General Motors. I\u2019ve had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma [chairman of Alibaba Group], he comes up, he says, \u201cOnly because of you am I making this massive investment.\u201d Intel, only because of you. \u2026 The press never writes that.", "But, as we\u2019ve written before, investments made by Ford and GM were part of longtime trends and market decisions.\u00a0Ford CEO Mark Fields, for example, praised Trump\u2019s promises to cut taxes and regulation, but said recent investments in U.S. plants were market-based. Asked on Fox Business News if he would have made the investments had Trump not won the election, Fields said,\u00a0\u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d", "As for Intel, we wrote in February\u00a0that Trump had a stronger case in that instance. The Intel CEO credited Trump\u2019s pro-business policies for a $7 billion investment in an Arizona factory, though Intel had announced a $5 billion investment in that facility in 2011. The project wasn\u2019t completed.", "\u201cWe\u2019re making this investment now to meet demand that we now expect,\u201d Intel spokesman William Moss said. \u201cThat said, we certainly join other companies in supporting the administration\u2019s pro business and pro investment goals.\u201d", "And Jack Ma, of Alibaba, the e-commerce Chinese company, told Trump in early January that he would add 1 million U.S. small businesses to the online platform over the next five years, a move Alibaba said could add 1 million jobs (one each per small business).", "Trump also again took credit for saving hundreds of millions on the F-35 jet made by Lockheed Martin, savings that were in the works before he was sworn in.", "\u201c[A]\u00a0little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget,\u201d he said, going on to say that he called Lockheed and said he would have to \u201cbid this out to another company, namely Boeing\u201d and that \u201cI started getting competing offers back and forth.\u201d", "Trump claimed he saved $725 million. In the past, he has claimed a savings of $600 million. But as the Washington Post\u2018s Fact Checker found, Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the head of the F-35 Joint Program Office, had already announced on Dec. 19 \u2014 before Trump met privately with Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson \u2014 that the cost of the F-35 would come down.\u00a0His cost reduction estimate came out to $549 million to $630 million, according to the Post\u2019s calculation.", "Aviation Week\u00a0also wrote\u00a0that Trump \u201coverstates\u201d his role and that the price reduction on the jet had been \u201congoing.\u201d", "In addition, the president rehashed a campaign claim that distorts the facts on the vetting process required for those entering the U.S.", "Trump: We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country.", "Trump didn\u2019t specify that he was talking about refugees, but he indicated he was speaking about his \u201cstance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d", "Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump made similar claims. For instance, in a late August speech on illegal immigration, he said that Syrian refugees seeking admission to the U.S. have \u201cno documentation\u201d and \u201cno paperwork.\u201d That\u2019s false.", "As we wrote, Barbara Strack, chief of the refugee affairs division of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Congress in October 2015 that \u201cwe\u2019ve found with Syrian refugees \u2026 in general they have many, many documents.\u201d Documents were also one part of the vetting process, she said. Those applying for refugee status are also interviewed by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and go through security checks by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. There\u2019s a health screening and a three-day \u201ccultural orientation,\u201d too.", "Editor\u2019s Note: We will be doing more on Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office later this week, so be sure to return to our website as the new president approaches the milestone.", "Correction, Oct. 27: The U.S. had 78 straight months of job growth through March, not 77 as we originally wrote.", "U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of International Affairs. \u201cReport to Congress: Foreign Exchange Policies of Major Trading Partners\u00a0 of the United States.\u201d 14 Apr 2017.", "Trump Campaign Website. \u201cDonald J.
