The latter publication also didn't go into much detail about the research, simply referencing famous people\u00a0with big buttocks and the strategic consumption of cookies:", "Someone tell Kim Kardashian and Beyonce Knowles to have a celebratory buck's fizz, because a study conducted by the University of Oxford reveals women with bigger bums are stereotypically smarter and healthier.", "If ever there were an excuse to have another chocolate chip cookie in the hope it makes your arse bigger, this would be it.", "The claim popped up again in April 2016 on health and lifestyle\u00a0blogs,\u00a0framed as a novel new discovery:", "Here\u2019s something you surely didn\u2019t know by now \u2014 according to a study conducted at the University of Oxford, women with big butts are smarter and healthier than their average-sized butt counterparts! Girls with big butts also had lower cholesterol levels and good hormones which help them process sugar better, effectively reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.", "The research on which these reports were based (which was rarely linked to by these stories) was often portrayed as breaking scientific news, using the same facile summaries:", "A new study by the University of Oxford uncovers evidence that curvaceous women are more intelligent and most resistant to chronic illnesses. According to results, ladies with bigger backsides have lower levels of cholesterol, less heart problems and are less likely to get diabetes.", "Scientists at Oxford argue that fat from the lower body produces \u201chormones that help to better metabolize sugars and other lipids, unlike abdominal fat secretes hormones with the opposite effect.\u201d", "As noted earlier, this \"news\" repatedly rehashed as welcome health information\u00a0for curvy women wasn't new at all. Researchers from Oxford University published the far less sexy-sounding\u00a0\"Gluteofemoral Body Fat as a Determinant of Metabolic Health\" in the International Journal of Obesity way back on 12 January 2010.", "That research was a review (not a study), and it began\u00a0by stating that the \"proportion of abdominal to gluteofemoral body fat, as measured, for example, by the waist-to-hip ratio, correlates with obesity-associated diseases and mortality and is a stronger cardiovascular risk marker than BMI.\" \u00a0In other words, the issue is not how much fat is deposited, but where.  That focus was reflected in the study's conclusion, which reiterated that gluteofemoral adipose tissue\u00a0potentially offers cardiovascular benefits and merits further research:", "Body fat distribution is a major determinant of metabolic health and gluteofemoral adipose tissue exerts specific functional properties that are associated with an improved metabolic and cardiovascular risk profile. The protective properties of gluteofemoral fat have been confirmed in large population studies. Evidence arising from in vitro and in vivo studies suggests that this is due to a differential regulation of lower-body fatty acid release and uptake at the level of the adipocyte that results in the long-term entrapment of fatty acids in this depot and protection from ectopic fat accumulation. This becomes even more evident in states of gluteofemoral fat loss as in glucocorticoid excess and lipodystrophic syndromes that are associated with increased metabolic and cardiovascular risk. In addition, gluteofemoral adipose tissue could convey protection through a beneficial adipokine profile. This is suggested by the favorable association of leptin and adiponectin levels with gluteofemoral fat mass, while it remains to be proven for other emerging adipokines. The recent discovery of novel gene loci involved in the regulation of body fat distribution, beyond the male\u2013female dichotomy, provides an appealing area for further investigation. Future research will also show if the protective properties of gluteofemoral body fat can be used to attenuate metabolic and cardiovascular risk, as already observed in the redistribution of body fat associated with the clinical use of thiazolidinediones", "No portion of the Journal of Obesity's review definitively stated that women with big butts were \"healthier\" or \"smarter\" than other women, and the authors simply contrasted findings about gluteofemoral fat versus abdominal fat (while other body types, or absence of either kind of fat, were\u00a0not mentioned):", "Several population studies support the fact that obesity-associated health risks depend on the accumulation of abdominal fat. Abdominal obesity is associated with increased blood pressure and plasma triglyceride (TG) levels. It is also an independent predictor for the development of type 2 diabetes.", "The adverse effect of abdominal obesity arises from the combination of subcutaneous adipose tissue dysfunction and the accumulation of visceral fat that becomes apparent when individuals with increased waist-to-hip ratio are studied with imaging techniques. The particular importance of visceral fat accumulation versus subcutaneous fat depot dysfunction has recently been challenged, as there is mounting evidence to support that visceral adipocytes are phenotypically different from subcutaneous adipocytes.", "That research largely pertained to \"waist-to-hip ratio\" and not just the presence of large derrieres. The same physiological profile was examined by the University of Pittsburgh and the University of California, Santa Barbara, in\u00a02007 research [PDF] published in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior. Again,\u00a0in that research waist-to-hip ratio (rather than\u00a0big butts) was the scientific focus:", "Upper-body fat has negative effects and lower-body fat has positive effects on the supply of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that are essential for neurodevelopment. Thus, waist-hip ratio (WHR), a useful proxy for the ratio of upper-body fat to lower-body fat, should predict cognitive ability in women and their offspring. Moreover, because teenage mothers and their children compete for these resources, their cognitive development should be compromised, but less so for mothers with lower WHRs. These predictions are supported by data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Controlling for other correlates of cognitive ability, women with lower WHRs and their children have significantly higher cognitive test scores, and teenage mothers with lower WHRs and their children are protected from cognitive decrements associated with teen births. These findings support the idea that WHR reflects the availability of neurodevelopmental resources and thus offer a new explanation for men's preference for low WHR.", "So, research undertaken in 2010 contrasting central obesity with gluteofemoral fat stores was widely misinterpreted several years later to suggest that women with big butts were \"smarter and healthier\" than other women. In fact, the research simply reviewed already-published\u00a0data about different types of obesity and suggested further study based on a collected series\u00a0of prior findings, and no portion of the 2010 review undertaken at Oxford University pertained to intellect.
