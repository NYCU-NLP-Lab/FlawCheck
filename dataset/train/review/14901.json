Ron Johnson.", "The question was posed by host Mike Gousha at a Jan. 26, 2016 forum at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee.", "Feingold, who lost the Senate seat to Johnson in 2010, commented on Obama\u2019s record in the international arena.

How many American \u00a0 \u00a0 troops would you support sending overseas to accomplish this mission?", "Johnson: Well, I'm not a military expert. The model I use is what George H.W. Bush did when Saddam Hussein went into Kuwait \u2026.", "Gousha: And I know you're not a military guy, but is it 10,000? Is it 20,000? Give us some idea of what you're talking about in terms of an American presence overseas.", "Johnson: I've been told by military experts that ISIS -- in terms, militarily -- is not particularly capable \u2026 militarily, it really would not be that difficult. Probably it wouldn't take anywhere near the effort that the first Gulf War did. I've been hearing 25,000 troops, a total coalition of maybe 100,000. I really don't know the exact numbers, but we have to be committed to the goal \u2026.", "So, Johnson didn\u2019t commit to a number.", "And he hasn\u2019t in other interviews.", "The previous month, Johnson said he didn\u2019t know how many U.S. troops would be needed in Syria, although that was in reference to responding to a refugee crisis.", "And the following month, Johnson indicated to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he was open to the numbers of American troops that were being discussed.
