["About this rating", "Following the Oct. 13, 2020, confirmation hearing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court, dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster updated its definition and usage guidelines its entry of \u201csexual preference\u201d to include a statement to the effect that use of the term is \u201coffensive.\u201d", "Barrett's use of the term during the hearing incited anger in the LGBTQ community from those who argue that the phrase is outdated and linked to anti-gay sentiments.", "This claim that Merriam-Webster added the comment is true \u2014 but the reason for the change isn't what had been largely assumed.", "The screenshot below was taken from the Merriam-Webster website\u2019s definition of \u201csexual preference,\u201d and reflected the most current definition at the time of this writing (highlight added).", "Though Merriam-Webster didn't change its usage guidelines because of Barrett's comments, a spokesperson with the dictionary told Snopes that the public attention focused on the term after her comments prompted the update. The dictionary update came after Barrett was questioned by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on her position surrounding LGBTQ issues. She responded by noting that she had \u201cnever discriminated on the basis of sexual preference and would not ever discriminate on the basis of sexual preference.\u201d", "In its update, the 150-year-old dictionary publisher argued that using the term \u201csexual preference\u201d implies the \u201csuggestion that a person can choose who they are sexually or romantically attracted to.\u201d", "Peter Sokolowski, editor-at-large for Merriam-Webster, told Snopes in an email that the work of revising the dictionary is ongoing and continuous \u2014 and the update was a routine part of the job.", "\u201cOur scheduled updates, which add new words and also add new definitions, usage guidance, and example sentences to existing dictionary entries, take place several times per year,\u201d said Sokolowski. \u201cFrom time to time, we release one or some of these scheduled changes early when a word or set of words is getting extra attention, and it would seem timely to share that update: the public is implicitly asking us a question by looking up a word, and we are immediately able to provide additional information.\u201d", "\u201cIn this case, we released the update for sexual preference when we noticed that the entries for preference and sexual preference were being consulted in connection with the SCOTUS hearings. A revision made in response to an entry's increased attention differs only in celerity\u2014as always, all revisions reflect evidence of use,\u201d noted Sokolowski, adding that similar updates were issued in March 2020 for terms connected to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "The controversy arose on the second day of her confirmation hearing when Barrett was asked by Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., to comment on whether the nominee agreed with LGBTQ-related opinions held by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whom Barrett spent decades clerking for, particularly whether Barrett agreed that the \u201cU.S. Constitution does not afford gay people the fundamental right to marry.\u201d", "During his career, Scalia wrote dissenting opinions when it came to LGBTQ issues, defending a state\u2019s ability to openly discriminate against the LGBTQ community (Romer v. Evans in 1996), defending a state\u2019s right to criminally prosecute someone for same-sexual activity (Lawrence v. Texas in 2003), and defending the federal government\u2019s right to deny federal recognition of same-sex marriages (U.S. v. Windsor in 2013). Many news publications and political commentators have argued that Barrett\u2019s religious roots in a conservative Christian community may hinder her ability to objectively rule, particularly when it comes to issues of abortion, gay rights, and racial injustice.", "Barrett replied with the following:", "Senator, I have no agenda, and I do want to be clear that I have never discriminated on the basis of sexual preference and would not ever discriminate on the basis of sexual preference. Like racism, I think discrimination is abhorrent. On the questions of law, however, because I\u2019m a sitting judge and because you can\u2019t answer questions without going through the judicial process, can\u2019t give answers to those very specific questions.", "Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, noted that Barrett used the term sexual preference \u201cnot once, but twice,\u201d even though it was considered to be an \u201coffensive and outdated term.\u201d", "\u201cIt is used by anti-LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a choice. It is not. Sexual orientation is a key part of a person\u2019s identity,\u201d responded Hirono, who added that she didn\u2019t think its use was \u201can accident.\u201d", "Barrett responded to Hirono, saying that she did not mean to imply that she thought sexual orientation was an \u201cimmutable characteristic or that it\u2019s solely a matter of preference,\u201d and denied meaning to make any offense, citing a case that allowed same-sex couples to marry.", "\u201cSenator, I\u2019m saying I was not trying to make any comment on it. I fully respect all the rights of the LGBTQ community. Obergefell is an important precedent of the court. I reject any kind of discrimination on any sort of basis,\u201d furthered Barrett.", "https://www.c-span.org/video/?476316-1/barrett-confirmation-hearing-day-2-part-1&live=", "The dictionary update went viral after Steve Krakauer shared a tweet on Oct. 13, 2020, in which he pointed out that Merriam-Webster previously included a definition of \u201cpreference\u201d as \u201corientation\u201d or \u201csexual orientation,\u201d and later updated to include the word \u201coffensive.\u201d", "\"As recently as last month, Webster's Dictionary included a definition of 'preference' as 'orientation' or 'sexual preference.' TODAY they changed it and added the word 'offensive.' Insane\u2014I just checked through Wayback Machine and it's real,\" Krakauer tweeted.", "Krakauer\u2019s claim is also accurate. An analysis of pages archived using the internet archival website Wayback Machine found that Merriam-Webster's definition of \u201cpreference\u201d included hyperlinks to both \u201corientation\u201d and \u201csexual preference,\u201d but did not include the word \u201coffensive\u201d as of Sept. 28. By Oct. 14, the definition had been updated to include the word \u201coffensive.\u201d", "Barrett's use of the term \"sexual preference\" sparked outrage within the LGBTQ community and was described as \u201carchaic\u201d because its use implies that sexuality is a choice.", "\u201cThe word \u2018preference\u2019 signals that sexual orientation is a choice, rather than an immutable characteristic. That assumption has been used to undermine protections for people based on sexual orientation,\u201d Nick Morrow, deputy communications director at the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), told Snopes in an email.", "The organization, which advocates for equal rights and protections for LGBTQ communities, has voiced concerns over Barrett\u2019s nomination, noting that she is \u201chostile to the rights of LGBTQ people.\u201d", "\u201cThere is no room for hate or discrimination on the Supreme Court. If Barrett is confirmed, our marriages, our families, our health care and our LGBTQ youth would be at risk,\" said Alphonso David, president of the HRC, in a statement sent to Snopes. \"This upcoming term and beyond, we expect crucial cases about the future of LGBTQ rights to appear before the Court. Amy Coney Barrett poses a clear threat to any progress we can expect to see from the Court, and her record shows she will take every opportunity to oppose us and scale back our rights.\"", "Phillips, Morgan. \u00a0 \"Merriam-Webster Changes Its Definition of \u2018Sexual Preference\u2019 As Barrett Gets Called Out for Using Term.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Fox News. \u00a0 14 October 2020.", "Williams, Janice. \u00a0 \"Merriam-Webster Dictionary Adds \u2018Offensive\u2019 to \u2018Sexual Preference\u2019 Definition After Amy Coney Barrett Uses Term in Hearings.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Newsweek. \u00a0 14 October 2020.", "Miller, Ryan. \u00a0 \"Merriam-Webster Dictionary Updates \u2018Sexual Preference\u2019 Entry After Amy Coney Barrett Hearing.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 USA Today. \u00a0 15 October 2020.", "Stern, Mark Joseph. \u00a0 \"Why Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s Use of \u2018Sexual Preference\u2019 is So Alarming.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Slate. \u00a0 13 October 2020.", "\"United States v.
