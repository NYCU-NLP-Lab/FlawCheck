["About this rating", "On 26 July 2017, Astronomy-Physics.com published a now-viral story reporting that this year\u2019s Perseid meteor shower will be the brightest meteor shower in human history:", "There is going to be a meteor shower on 12th of August, 2017. According to astronomers this will be the brightest shower in the recorded human history. It will light up the night sky and some of these [sic] might even be visible during the day. This meteor shower is being considered as once [sic] in a lifetime opportunity as the next meteor shower of such kind will be after 96 years.", "The meteor shower in question, the Perseids, will indeed peak on 12 August 2017 (though meteors from this shower can be seen from the end of July through the end of August).", "Unfortunately, as exciting as it sounds, claims that this will be the brightest meteor shower in recorded human history are woefully unsupported. In fact, this year's Perseid meteor shower will likely not even be the brightest Perseid shower of the past two years, according to NASA\u2019s \"2017 Meteor Shower Activity Forecast for Earth Orbit\":", "Most meteor showers will display typical activity levels in 2017. Perseid activity is expected to be higher than normal but less than in 2016; rates may reach 80% of the [number of meteors a single viewer would see in an hour of peak activity] in 2016.", "That 2016 Perseid shower, despite being above average, was also not the largest Perseid meteor shower ever recorded. That award goes to the 1993 Perseids, according to NASA Meteoroid Environment Office director Bill Cooke. He told us:", "Even last year [...] didn't rival 1993, when the Perseid rates topped 300 per hour.... The best Perseid shower we have a record of occurred back in 1993.", "That event actually grounded the Space Shuttle at that time. Still, despite some good fireballs produced by the Perseids in years past, the Perseid shower, in general, is likely not the right one to look at if you are interested in seeing something truly record-setting \u2014 both the Leonids and the Draconids, historically, have produced showers far more intense, Cooke told us:", "The Perseids are not noted for producing what we would consider very spectacular meteor showers. The Leonids and the Draconids, in the past, have produced far more spectacular meteor showers than the Perseids. The Leonid meteor shower has had rates hit 100,000 per hour, which is enormous.", "The Perseids occur each year when Earth passes through the trail of debris left behind by the massive Swift-Tuttle comet. The intensity of a meteor shower is, generally speaking, a function of two things: the light environment at the time of viewing, and the thickness of the debris trail through which Earth passes. The exact nature of the trail of debris at that point dictates the nature of the meteors one can expect to hit the atmosphere. The light environment is most affected by the phase of the moon, and it determines how bright a meteor must be to be visible.", "While the region Earth will be passing through is expected to generate an above-average number of meteors, the phase of the moon \u2014 it will be nearly full at the Perseid peak \u2014 may well cancel out that benefit. \"Given the moon and the fact that the rates are slightly better than normal, you may end up with a normal looking display this year,\u201d Cooke told us.", "As there is no evidence to support the claim that this year\u2019s event will be the brightest shower in the recorded human history and plenty of evidence to refute it, we rank this claim as false.", "Physics-Astronomy.com. \u00a0 \"Get Ready! the Brightest Meteor Shower in the [sic] Recorded Human History Is Happening\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 26 July 2017.", "NASA Solar System Exploration. \u00a0 \"Meteors & Meteorites: Perseids\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 1 August 2017.", "Moorhead, Althea, et al. \u00a0 \"2017 Meteor Shower Activity Forecast for Earth Orbit.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NASA Technical Reports Server. \u00a0 1 January 2017.", "Associated Press. \u00a0 \"Shuttle Crew Back for Third Try at Launch\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 10 August 1993.", "Rao, Joe. \u00a0 \"The Leonid Meteor Shower Revealed: Shooting Star Show's Brilliant History.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Space.com. \u00a0 12 November 2010.", "Beatty, Kelly. \u00a0 \"A Deluge of Draconids?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Sky and Telescope. \u00a0 6 October 2010.", "Lewin, Sarah. \u00a0 \"August 2017 Brings Perseid Meteor Shower, and a Lunar and Total Solar Eclipse!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Space.com. \u00a0 1 August 2017.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
