It stated that this was the second public execution for a similar offence in the country\u2019s capital controlled by Shia Houthi rebels after 41-year-old Muhammad al-Maghrabi was executed for raping and murdering a three-year-old girl in July 2017.", "In the image posted below, a screenshot from the video is compared with a Getty Images photo to corroborate that it\u2019s a video of the same incident.", "Moreover, the claim that the man was executed within 15 minutes of committing the crime is false.
