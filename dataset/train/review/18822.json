["In an interview on Citizen TV titled \u2018The Ruto story\u2019, deputy president William Ruto tackled various topics of national interest.", "In a lively interview titled \u2018The Ruto story\u2019 Kenyan deputy president William Ruto went on national TV where he tackled various topics of public interest.", "He was mostly correct in claims about the firing of ministers and the development of public land, and was correct about the party\u2019s manifesto pledge on dams.", "Ruto was also mostly correct about the extent of Kenya\u2019s arid regions, but incorrect when he said the sacked ministers hadn\u2019t been tried in court.", "The fight against corruption and the threat of hunger posed by an unpredictable climate are never too far from Kenya\u2019s fast-paced news cycle.", "\u201cWe asked six ministers (in the) last term to step aside.\u201d", "We contacted the deputy president\u2019s office for his evidence for the claims. We will update this report with their response.", "In his 2015 state of the nation address, President Uhuru Kenyatta asked officials named in a confidential Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission report to step aside until they were cleared.", "Two weeks later, the president\u2019s office suspended four cabinet secretaries: Felix Koskei, Michael Kamau, Kazungu Kambi and Davis Chirchir. Another minister, Charity Ngilu, stepped down days later.", "Seven months later the five were dropped from cabinet in a reshuffle. A few days before, minister Anne Waiguru had resigned on health grounds. But she\u2019d been under public pressure following a reported loss of funds from her ministry.", "So Ruto wasn\u2019t all that accurate to say six ministers were asked to step aside - five were. Waiguru\u2019s resignation brought the number to six. We therefore rate this claim as mostly correct.", "\u201cNone of [the dropped ministers] even made it to court because the allegations that were made [against them] did not have any basis.\u201d", "In 2015 the anti-corruption agency charged former transport cabinet secretary Michael Kamau in court for failing to comply with procurement laws. So Ruto wasn\u2019t correct when he said none of the ministers dropped by Kenyatta were charged in court.", "Former lands minister Charity Ngilu was also charged, for \u201cbreach of trust\u201d by a public official.", "They were both acquitted after successfully challenging the composition of the ethics agency. But Kamau was back in court in April 2019, on the same charges.", "\u201cThe law says, if you are allocated a piece of land, you must develop it within two years. If you do not develop it within two years, it is supposed to revert to government.\u201d", "The Land Act sets out how public land can be allocated to private individuals, businesses and foreign governments.", "\u201cWhere the land allocated \u2026 is not developed in accordance with the terms and conditions stipulated in the lease, that land shall automatically revert back to the national or county government, as the case may be,\u201d the law says.", "\u201cThe presumption is that when you are given [public] land you must put it into good use as stipulated in the lease agreement. That is what guides the transaction,\u201d David Mufuayia of land rights lobby the Kenya Land Alliance told Africa Check.", "For example, public land provided under the export processing zone law must be developed within two years.", "But it is not always this clear cut. \u201cIt is very difficult to apply [the two-year-rule] across the board, because the land is normally leased specific to the use,\u201d said Ibrahim Mwathane, chair of the Land Development and Governance Institute.", "\u201cThe government would normally attach a whole lot of conditions on a lease, and one would need to look at those conditions and decide whether they have been complied with or contravened.\u201d Mwathane is also a columnist on land issues for the country\u2019s Daily Nation newspaper.", "\u201885% of Kenya is arid and semi-arid.\u2019", "If Kenya was to be fed, much if not all of the \u201c85%\u201d of the country that was \u201carid and semi-arid\u201d would need to be irrigated, deputy president Ruto said.", "The country\u2019s development plan for northern Kenya and other arid areas, released in 2012, classifies nine of Kenya\u2019s 47 countries as arid, and 14 counties as semi-arid.", "These 23 counties account for 89% of the country\u2019s total land area and four in every 10 Kenyans live there, the document says. It was produced as part of Kenya\u2019s Vision 2030 growth plan.", "The arid and semi-arid areas are prone to drought, it says, and lag behind the national average on many development indicators. The main challenge \u201cis how to ensure food and nutrition security\u201d there.", "In its new strategic plan for 2019 to 2029, Kenya\u2019s agriculture ministry also estimates the share as 89%.", "But the devolution ministry gives the share as 83%, as did the World Bank in an April 2019 paper that urged more irrigation to reduce dependence on unreliable rainfall.", "\u2018We put it in our manifesto, to construct 57 mega dams\u2026\u201d", "The Jubilee party had pledged in its manifesto to build \u201c57 mega dams\u201d to provide more food and water to Kenyans, Ruto said.", "The party\u2019s 2017 manifesto commits to complete \u201c57 large-scale dams currently under construction\u201d within the next five years. Some of the projects are listed on the presidency\u2019s delivery website.", "But different numbers and timelines for the dams have been given recently. In a March 2019 speech on World Water Day, water minister Simon Chelugui said the 57 dams would be built between 2018 and 2028.", "The same month, the principal secretary for irrigation said \u201c10 large dams\u201d would be constructed.", "And the final version of the water ministry\u2019s strategic plan for 2018 to 2022 waters them down to 57 \u201cmedium size\u201d dams.", "Please complete this form to receive the HTML sharing code.", "We examine three claims in a Cape Talk interview with the National Sea Rescue Institute on world drowning prevention day.", "Covid has trained a spotlight on causes of death and how deaths are recorded across the world.
