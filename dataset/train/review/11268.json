But I do think that, for those weapons of war\u00a0 \u2014 AR-15s, AK-47s \u2014 these were designed and sold to the militaries of the world to kill people on a battlefield and there are more than 16 million of them in America. And we\u2019ve seen the devastating effect that they can have in Dayton, Ohio, or El Paso, Texas, or Odessa, not too far from where I live. Those must be bought back or else each of them are an instrument potentially of terror in this country.\"", "In reality, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s answer isn\u2019t clear at all. We\u2019ll help you sort out the mental gymnastics.", "In both the El Paso and the Dayton mass shootings, assault-style weapons, legal in both states, were used. Each weapon was semiautomatic \u2014 the gunmen could fire as quickly as they could pull the trigger \u2014 and carried\u00a0enough ammunition to potentially kill dozens of people in minutes.", "The El Paso shooter used a semi-automatic Kalashnikov-style rifle (also known as an AK-47-style rifle), which typically uses a magazine that has 30 rounds.", "The Dayton shooter used an AR-15-style pistol, modified to act as a rifle, with a drum magazine that can hold up to 100 rounds.", "At least two times previously, O\u2019Rourke was asked whether he would support confiscation of guns he calls weapons of war. He said yes.", "Sept. 12 Democratic presidential debate", "Co-host David Muir: \"Some on this stage have suggested a voluntary buy-back for guns in this country. You've gone further. You've said, quote, \u2018Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.\u2019 You know that critics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns? And how would this work?\"", "O\u2019Rourke: \"I am, if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield. ...When we see that being used against children, and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland (Texas), there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time, hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\"", "Sept. 18\u00a0CNN\u2019s \"Cuomo Prime Time", "Host Chris Cuomo: \"All right, so let's state the proposition. Are you, in fact, in favor of gun confiscation?", "O'Rourke: \"Yes, when it comes to AR-15s and AK-47s, weapons designed for use on a military battlefield. ...So, when it comes to those weapons, Chris, the answer is yes. But when it comes to firearms used for hunting or self-defense, the answer is no.\"", "On the same day as the \"Morning Joe\" interview, CNN \"New Day\"\u00a0host Alysin Camerota asked O\u2019Rourke: \"How do you plan to get assault weapons away from people who don\u2019t want to give them up?\"", "O\u2019Rourke replied: \"It\u2019s pretty simple. As with any law in this country, we would expect our fellow Americans to follow the law.\"", "Later, Camerota pushed back by saying mass shooters would not follow such a law. Then she said of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal: \"It sounds like confiscation.\"", "O\u2019Rourke replied: \"No, I\u2019m not suggesting that. And I think that\u2019s why people use the word confiscation, because it scares people. What I\u2019m talking about is a mandatory buyback, where Americans who own an AR-15 or an AK-47 will sell that weapon back to the government.", "O\u2019Rourke made similar comments on \"Morning Joe.\"", "Scarborough asked what the federal government would do if owners of AR-15s and AK-47s refused to sell. O\u2019Rourke said:", "\"Just as in any law that is not followed or flagrantly abused, there have\u00a0to be consequences or else there is no respect for the law. So, in that case, I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and to make sure that it is purchased, bought back, so that it cannot be potentially used against somebody else.\"", "(Update: We\u2019ve added some additional context from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement after initially publishing this fact-check.)", "Asked later in the interview about going door to door to take conventional handguns, O\u2019Rourke said they aren\u2019t as lethal as assault-style weapons and there is a legitimate use of handguns for protection in a home.", "O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign website says he is calling for \"a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons and a voluntary buyback program for handguns,\" and that \"individuals who fail to participate in the mandatory buyback of assault weapons will be fined.\"", "\"Beto has been clear that he is talking about a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons, which is not confiscation,\" his campaign told us.", "O\u2019Rourke\u2019s argument that his plan isn\u2019t confiscation ultimately rests on the fact that the government would buy the guns away from its owner. But that\u2019s misleading.", "Gun owners wouldn\u2019t have a say in the matter, and just because they\u2019d be compensated, some likely wouldn\u2019t see the trade in terms of equal value. Owners would be required to sell, and if they didn\u2019t, what happens next is murky.", "O\u2019Rourke says people might be fined, and that they might be somehow compelled to turn their weapons in through the buy-back program. As you game out scenarios how this might play out, they all lead to something that most people would consider confiscation.", "Clearly, many gun owners who legally purchased and own weapons that the government would take would view that as confiscation, even if they were paid for the guns.", "\"It is unreasonable to call what Mr. O\u2019Rourke is proposing anything other than confiscation,\" gun law expert George Mocsary, a law professor at the University of Wyoming, told PolitiFact.", "\"Imagine the situation when an owner of one of the weapons refuses to sell. He or she is issued a fine. The owner still has the weapon, however. Does paying the fine mean that he or she can now keep the weapon and it is perfectly legal?\u00a0 Certainly not,\" Mocsary said.", "\"There is no scenario under which the owner of one of the designated weapons gets to keep it. That is confiscation.\"", "O\u2019Rourke said: \"To be clear, I\u2019m not talking about confiscating anybody\u2019s guns.\"", "O\u2019Rourke has said \"yes\" and \"hell, yes\" when asked about confiscating assault-style weapons.
