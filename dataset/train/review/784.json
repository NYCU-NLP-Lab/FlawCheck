["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on January 24, 2019", "Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted that \u201cmore than half of older workers have no retirement savings.\u201d But that figure includes retirees, not just \u201colder workers,\u201d and does not include workers with pension plans.", "In all, 73 percent of older workers \u2014 age 55 to 64 \u2014 have\u00a0defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans and IRAs, and/or defined-benefit plans, such as employer-provided pensions, according to a\u00a02015 report\u00a0the Government Accountability Office produced at the request of the senator.", "Sanders, a Vermont independent, ran a populist campaign for president in 2016, before losing the Democratic nomination to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He is\u00a0considering running\u00a0again for the Democratic presidential nomination.", "The senator tweeted about retirement savings over the weekend.", "Today, in America, more than half of older workers have no retirement savings \u2013 zero. That is unacceptable. We must create an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy few.", "\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 19, 2019", "The senator\u2019s office said the tweet refers to a May 2015 GAO report, which examined the financial status of workers approaching retirement and retirees. The senator requested the report, and his office issued a press release\u00a0in June 2015 about its findings. The senator\u2019s press release said that \u201cmore than half of all American households with someone 55 or older have no retirement savings.\u201d", "That press release is correct. GAO reported that \u201c52 percent of households age 55 and older have no retirement savings in a DC plan or IRA.\u201d", "But in his tweet, Sanders refers only to \u201colder workers,\u201d and the GAO says 59 percent of \u201cworkers approaching retirement\u201d \u2014 households headed by those between the ages of 55 and 64 \u2014 have \u201csome retirement savings.\u201d", "Josh Miller-Lewis, a spokesman for the senator, said the tweet was in error. \u201cWe meant to write \u2018more than half of older Americans\u2019 not workers,\u201d he said. The senator\u2019s Twitter feed, which is maintained by his staff, now includes a correction,\u00a0added after we contacted the senator\u2019s staff about the claim.", "More important, however, GAO\u2019s definition of \u201cretirement savings\u201d includes only assets accrued in \u201cdefined contribution (DC) plans such as 401(k) plans as well as individual retirement accounts (IRA).\u201d It\u00a0\u201cdoes not include savings held outside of a retirement account,\u201d and it does not include \u201cdefined benefit (DB) plans, \u2018traditional\u2019 pension plans that provide benefits based on a formula.\u201d (Defined-benefit plans determine retirement payments according to a\u00a0fixed formula based on salary, years of service and age.)", "Table 1 of the GAO report shows that 41 percent of \u201chouseholds age 55 to 64\u201d have no \u201cretirement savings,\u201d but 32 percent of them have a defined-benefit plan.", "\u201cPerhaps of greatest concern are the 27 percent of all households age 55-64 that have neither retirement savings nor a DB plan,\u201d the report said, meaning that 73 percent have one or both types of retirement assets.", "GAO\u2019s report was based on the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, which is conducted every three years by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\u00a0The Fed\u2019s 2016 survey is the most recent available. Little has changed since then for those nearing retirement (55 to 64), but there has been improvement for those 65 and older.", "The latest Fed survey shows that 59.3 percent of households headed by those between the ages of 55 and 64 have \u201cretirement accounts\u201d \u2014 unchanged from 2013. (The Fed term \u201cretirement accounts\u201d is the same as the GAO\u2019s term \u201cretirement savings.\u201d The Fed describes \u201cretirement accounts\u201d as \u201cincluding individual retirement accounts (IRAs), Keogh accounts, and certain employer-sponsored accounts, such as 401(k), 403(b), and thrift savings accounts,\u201d but not Social Security payments or \u201cemployer-sponsored defined-benefit plans.\u201d)", "For those 65 and older, the Fed report shows an increase in the percentage of those with \u201cretirement accounts,\u201d particularly for older Americans. It went up from 48 percent in 2013 to 49.8 in 2016 for those between the ages of 65 and 74, and jumped from 29 percent to 40.8 percent for those 75 and older.", "Sanders\u2019 point is well taken: The GAO report shows that a\u00a0substantial portion of older workers have little or no savings, and the percentage of employers providing pension plans has been decreasing.\u00a0The GAO report, citing the Department of Labor, said that about 75 percent of private-sector workers had pension plans in 1975. As of March 2017, only 18 percent of private-sector employees had access to employer-provided defined-benefit plans, according to the department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "But 59 percent of workers nearing retirement have some retirement accounts, and, in all, 73 percent of them have assets in either defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, or in defined-benefit plans, such as pensions.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
