["About this rating", "In March 2018, a false (and potentially harmful) viral message spread around WhatsApp groups and social networks in India, warning recipients of an impending major earthquake in and around the capital city of Delhi.", "The message, which was riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, typically went something like this:", "According to NASA, the biggest earthquake will hit Delhi soon.

As the United States Geological Survey explains:", "Neither the USGS nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake. We do not know how, and we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future. An earthquake prediction must define 3 elements: 1) the date and time, 2) the location, and 3) the magnitude.", "Yes, some people say they can predict earthquakes, but here are the reasons why their statements are false:", "An earthquake measuring 9.1 or 9.2 on the Richter scale (not \"Rector's\") would rank among the largest in recorded history, according to USGS data, so it's perhaps not surprising that some people were concerned enough about the well-being of their friends and family to share the alert.", "It's not clear what the origins of the hoax were, or whether it was intended simply as a prank or with more malicious motivations in mind. The Delhi urban area has a population of around 26 million people and a sudden mass exodus could potentially have serious consequences.", "Times Now.\u00a0 \"Viral WhatsApp Message Claims Delhi To Be Hit By a 9.1 Magnitude Earthquake -- What's the Truth?\"\r\n\u00a0 Times Now.\u00a0 21 March 2018.", "U.S. Geological Survey.\u00a0 \"FAQs -- Can You Predict Earthquakes?\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0U.S. Geological Survey.\u00a0 Unknown publication date.", "U.S. Geological Survey.\u00a0 \"20 Largest Earthquakes in the World.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0U.S. Geological Survey.\u00a0 Unknown publication date.", "United Nations.\u00a0 \"The World's Cities in 2016.\"\r\n\u00a0 United Nations.\u00a0 2017.", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
