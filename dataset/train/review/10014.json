Incidentally, Swarajya also quoted a statement of Commissioner of Police KK Rao which hinted at Mahipal\u2019s Christian leanings but did not establish that the murder was being probed as an act of \u2018fanatical evangelism\u2019. \u201cInvestigations are on and we are still to know the real motive. Yes, he had been speaking about the Bible,\u201d said Rao.", "Unlike most of the before-mentioned Hindi news organisations, Swarajya did not directly link the murder to religious conversion or the family\u2019s opposition to it, however, the prejudiced language used in the report attempted to prematurely blame Mahipal\u2019s spiritual inclination for the crime.", "OpIndia\u2019s reportage was similar to that of Swarajya\u2019s. Its October 14 article was titled \u2013 \u201cGurugram double shooting being perceived as a result of fanatic evangelism by a neoconvert.\u201d", "In the first paragraph, the media outlet \u2013 \u201cthe initial investigation insinuates that the shooting may be a result of fanatical evangelism of the gunman.\u201d Incidentally, the source hyperlinked for this information was Swarajya.", "OpIndia\u2019s article was largely similar to Swarjya\u2019s report. Though in the title there was an attempt to subtly suggest a link between religious conversion and the shooting, the outlet did not go as far as to directly connect the dots.", "Following the October 13 incident, Gurugram police began probing the possible motive behind the crime. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) was also formed for the purpose. The police were investigating all facets that might have led Mahipal to shoot his employers, and during the probe, Mahipal\u2019s religious inclination was discovered. Many news organisations declared this as the motive behind the murder. However, there were several others that reported it only as a police discovery and refrained from prematurely linking it to the murder.", "NDTV published several reports on the incident (1, 2, 3, 4). None of these either linked the crime to fanatic evangelism or quoted any police officer as saying that the motive behind the murder was Ritu\u2019s opposition to embrace Christianity.", "The Times of India also extensively covered the crime. In the report where the media organisation talked about Mahipal\u2019s religious leanings, the title of the article itself explicitly mentioned that the cops were \u201cclueless\u201d and searched for the accused\u2019s spiritual guru. This report was published on October 15, the same day Dainik Jagran, Dainik Bhaskar and One India declared fanatic evangelism as the motive behind the murder.", "The Times of India also reported that the police\u2019s investigation found that Mahipal\u2019s \u2018guru\u2019 and \u2018guru ma\u2019 had a strong influence on him. However, the media outlet followed this statement with \u2013 \u201cbut none of this has yet helped them (police) understand what led a man with no history of misconduct or violent behaviour to shoot at a family he was assigned to protect\u2026\u201d", "In an October 16 report, The Times of India quoted a judicial officer, who is also Judge Kant\u2019s colleague, as saying, \u201cthe guard was heard saying \u2018devil\u2019 and \u2018shaitan\u2019 while firing (at Ritu and Dhruv). The use of this kind of words indicates something else. This doesn\u2019t reflect normal stress and frustration.\u201d This was comprehended by several media organisations as \u2018Satanic\u2019 terms. However, DCP Sulochana Gajraj, who is heading the SIT probe into the attack, was quoted by The Times of India as saying that Mahipal told the cops during interrogation that the words meant \u201cbad and dirty person.\u201d", "Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Sumit Kumar gave an identical statement about the use of the words \u2018devil\u2019 and \u2018shaitan\u2019 to Hindustan Times. This was reported in an October 14 article.", "In a subsequent October 15 report published by the media outlet, DCP Kumar also said that \u201cMahipal had been watching videos related to religion and it is suspected that he had been attending \u2018conversion\u2019 camps.\u201d However, Hindustan Times clarified in the following sentence that the news organisation \u201ccould not independently verify the claim\u201d and that \u201cthe police also could not explain as to how his alleged attendance at such camps could be connected to Saturday\u2019s shooting.\u201d", "A report published by The Tribune was used by several media outlets to claim that Mahipal was speaking about the Bible. This report was published by the news organisation on October 14 and it indeed mentioned that Mahipal spoke about the Bible with investigation officials. He said that \u201cit was every Christian\u2019s duty to eliminate demons.\u201d However, in the immediate paragraph, The Tribune quoted Commissioner of Police KK Rao who said, \u201cInvestigations are on and we are still to know the real motive. Yes, he had been speaking about the Bible.\u201d", "Another reportage that stood out was an October 16 article published by News18. The news organisation visited the accused\u2019s village and spoke to family members to understand what provoked him to kill. According to News18\u2019s ground investigation, Mahipal had a troubled personal life and in 2014, he changed his religion to Christianity, which several of his relatives resisted. However, they were shocked to hear the news of the attack as his demeanour gave them no reason to suspect.", "Haryana Police chief B S Sandhu said the motive was still not clear as there was no record of violent behaviour before. \u201cWe are trying to ascertain the reason behind this ghastly act. Our top priority is to solve the case,\u201d he said, per News18. While some of Mahipal\u2019s friend\u2019s said that he was unhappy with the job as the judge\u2019s family made him run household chores, the police were yet to ascertain the motive behind the attack.", "The Haryana police held a press conference on October 16 to provide details about its investigation into the attack. \u201cAfter probing all aspects of the case, we have reached the conclusion that Mahipal left the car unattended when the judge\u2019s wife and son went shopping in Arcadia market, Gurgaon. When he was questioned and rebuked for not returning on time, he shot the duo in a fit of rage,\u201d said DCP (crime) Sumit Kumar.", "One of the reporters questioned if this was the sole motive behind the murder, to which DCP Kumar replied, \u201cMahipal praised the judge\u2019s family during interrogation and said that they never troubled him.\u201d He added that the accused did seem to have a temper, and the sole motive behind the murder was the rage he felt when his absence was questioned and he was asked to hand over the car keys.", "DCP Kumar also clarified that the claims suggesting that Mahipal\u2019s family said that he was under tremendous work pressure were not discovered by the police and only reported by the media.", "Alt News contacted DCP Kumar and questioned if the probe revealed any connection between \u2018fanatic evangelism\u2019 and the attack, to which, the officer perspicuously reiterated that the sole motive behind the murder was \u201csudden rage\u201d.", "After the press conference, news organisations that had previously linked the murder to \u2018religious conversion\u2019 also reported the police\u2019s statements. However, none of them provided any clarification on their earlier misreporting based on which the \u2018evangelism\u2019 angle was viral on social media.", "A journalist with Swarjya, Vikas Saraswat, made an entire thread of tweets based on faulty media reports and portrayed that the murder was linked with fanatic evangelism.", "Gurugram double shooting a result of fanatic evangelism?
