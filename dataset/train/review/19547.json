["By Robert Farley", "Posted on October 9, 2017", "President Donald Trump misleadingly claimed Sen. Bob Corker \u201cgave us the Iran Deal.\u201d Corker, who opposed the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by the Obama administration, helped craft a bipartisan bill that allowed the House and Senate to review the agreement.", "The review act passed the Senate 98-1.", "Senate Republicans did ultimately review the Iran deal, and introduced legislation to kill it. But they were not able to garner enough votes to overcome a Democratic-led filibuster, and the deal moved forward.", "Trump\u2019s revisionist history is the latest in a war of words with Corker, a Republican who has announced that he will not run for reelection after 2018. In a swipe at the president, Corker told reporters last week that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly \u201care those people that help separate our country from chaos.\u201d", "Trump fired back with a series of tweets criticizing the Tennessee senator. Trump said Corker \u201cbegged\u201d Trump to endorse him for reelection, but that when he told Corker \u201cNO,\u201d Corker \u201cdropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement).\u201d", "Trump also alleged Corker was \u201clargely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal.\u201d", "..my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said \"NO THANKS.\" He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017", "Later on Oct. 8, Trump again tweeted about Corker and alleged Corker \u201cgave us the Iran Deal.\u201d", "Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017", "Corker disputes Trump\u2019s account of him deciding not to run because Trump refused to endorse him \u2014 indeed, Corker says Trump urged him to run and offered to endorse him. We can\u2019t referee these he-said/he-said accounts, but the record on the Iran nuclear deal is well-documented.", "Corker had nothing to do with the creation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal. It was negotiated by officials from the U.S., China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom, and representatives of the European Union and Iran.", "So why does Trump say Corker is responsible for the deal?", "Some conservatives \u2014 such as those writing for\u00a0Breitbart.com\u00a0and the Washington Times\u00a0\u2014 have blamed Corker for helping to craft a bipartisan bill, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\u00a0Critics of the bill say it paved the way to deny Congress an up-or-down vote on ratification of the deal.", "When the Iran deal was still being negotiated in early 2015, Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, expressed concerns\u00a0that the Obama administration would move forward with the deal without any congressional review. Indeed, the Obama administration had contended that the deal was not a \u201ctreaty\u201d \u2014 which would be subject to Senate approval.", "Corker negotiated a bill with Democrats that would allow Congress 30 days to review a nuclear deal, and potentially \u2014 if it had enough veto-proof votes \u2014 to kill it.", "On May 7, 2015, the review bill passed the Senate 98-1. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton cast the lone dissenting vote. A week later, the bill passed the House 400-25, and it was signed by Obama on May 22, 2015.", "The Iran nuclear deal was announced in July, and it did get a public airing in Congress after Republicans proposed a resolution to reject the deal. But it never did get a straight up-or-down vote in the Senate. Rather, a procedural measure on Sept. 10, 2015, failed by two votes (58-42) to reach the 60 needed to break a Democratic filibuster.", "A few days later, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made a final push to quash the deal. He tried again for a procedural vote to move for a vote to kill the deal, but it again fell short, this time\u00a056-42. And finally, on Sept. 17, 2015, McConnell scheduled a procedural vote on an amendment to block sanctions relief for Iran unless it recognized Israel\u2019s right to exist and released American prisoners being held in the country. That vote fell short 53-45. In every case, Corker voted along with McConnell and other Republicans to kill or strengthen the Iran deal.", "Indeed, in March 2015, then-Secretary of State John Kerry told Congress\u00a0that the administration was \u201cnot negotiating a legally binding plan\u201d and therefore did not need congressional approval.", "Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and co-founder of the Lawfare blog, wrote\u00a0that it\u2019s \u201csimply wrong\u201d for critics of the Iran Review Act to claim that the \u201cPresident could not have implemented the deal through domestic sanctions relief without first winning the support of the Senate or Congress.\u201d", "Goldsmith, July 14, 2015: It is very important to note that but for the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, President Obama could have lifted U.S. sanctions today under waivers and related provisions that Congress in the past gave him. The Iran Review Act disabled the President from lifting those sanctions for a period\u201460 days from when Congress receives the official documents\u2014so that Congress can review the deal and decide to approve it, oppose it, or do nothing. It is true that Congress will have a hard time killing the deal, and that to do so it will need to find veto-proof super-majorities in both chambers. But the only reason it has a chance to do so, the only reason Congress and the nation can debate the deal before the President implements the domestic sanctions relief side of it, is the Iran Review Act.", "The notion that continues to be peddled in some quarters that absent the Iran Review Act, the President could not have implemented the deal through domestic sanctions relief without first winning the support of the Senate or Congress is simply wrong. For those who continue to make this point, I ask: What would have prevented President Obama from exercising today his pre-existing authority to give Iran domestic sanctions relief had Congress not enacted the Iran Review Act? Not the Constitution, which does not require the President to seek congressional or Senate approval for this non-binding deal. And nothing in any statute either.", "In a November 2015\u00a0letter, the State Department clarified that the Iran nuclear deal \u201cis not a treaty or an executive agreement, and is not a signed document\u201d but rather \u201creflects political commitments\u201d between the negotiating countries.", "State Department letter, November 2015: The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is not a treaty or an executive agreement, and is not a signed document. The JCPOA reflects political commitments between Iran, the P5+1 (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, China) and the European Union. As you know, the United States has a long-standing practice of addressing sensitive problems in negotiations that culminate in political commitments.", "The success of the JCPOA will depend not on whether it is legally binding or signed, but rather on the extensive verification measures we have put in place, as well as Iran\u2019s understanding that we have the capacity to re-impose \u2013 and ramp up \u2013 our sanctions if Iran does not meet its commitments.", "Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, told us the Iran deal simply \u201cwas not a treaty between the U.S. and these other countries that required Senate advice and ratification.\u201d", "And for Trump to call Corker responsible for the JCPOA is \u201cjust not accurate,\u201d Kimball said.", "The Review Act negotiated by Corker merely \u201ccreated a process by which the Senate could have blocked the agreement if it got a sufficient number of votes,\u201d he said.", "Without knowing the political background, some might misread Trump\u2019s tweets to mean that Corker helped negotiate the Iran nuclear deal, or that he cast a deciding vote in its favor. He did not. Corker opposed the deal reached by the Obama administration. And he voted to kill it.", "Corker\u2019s bill allowed Congress to debate the deal, and if Congress had a veto-proof majority, it would have allowed Congress to kill the deal. Ultimately, Congress didn\u2019t have the votes to pull that off.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
