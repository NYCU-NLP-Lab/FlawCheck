["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Both Republican and Democratic super PACs are jumping in local races to criticize candidates this year. One tit-for-tat war has broken out in North Carolina, where the Senate Majority PAC, a pro-Democratic group, has publicized two-year-old dirt from the office of Thom Tillis, the state\u2019s House Speaker and leading contender for the GOP Senate nomination.", "The Senate Majority PAC, which supports Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan, released an ad on April 15 reminding viewers of how two Tillis staffers -- one of whom he shared an apartment with -- got caught having affairs with lobbyists just days apart.", "\"Thom Tillis\u2019 reaction?\" the narrator said. \"He claimed he was surprised by his roommate\u2019s affair, but then rewarded both aides with taxpayer-paid bonuses.\"", "The ad also specified that the staffers -- Charles Thomas and Amy Hobbs -- resigned. Tillis\u2019 Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, released a similar radio ad.", "Two days later, Tillis\u2019 campaign offered a decidedly different take.", "\"Seen those ads attacking Thom Tillis?\" the narrator said. \"They\u2019re false. Tillis fired the staffers.\"", "Who\u2019s right here? PolitiFact concludes that the Senate Majority PAC\u2019s description of the situation -- not Tillis\u2019 -- is closer to the truth.", "What happened in 2012", "The News & Observer, a newspaper based in Raleigh, N.C., reported that Charles Thomas, Tillis\u2019 chief of staff and roommate, resigned in April 2012 after his affair with a lobbyist was caught on video. Less than one week later, policy analyst Amy Hobbs resigned after an affair of her own was exposed, the paper reported.", "Tillis then offered the two former staffers a payment of one month\u2019s salary -- $12,500 for Thomas and $6,833.33 for Hobbs. The listed purpose was \"payment in lieu of notice,\" a term he took from Wikipedia that referred to a British policy. Under North Carolina law, Tillis wasn\u2019t obligated to pay either staffer a month\u2019s salary upon resignation.", "In defending his decision to pay staffers, Tillis said, \"I stand by my decision to accept their resignation while recognizing the difficult transition period they are now entering.\"", "In other words, Tillis at the time did not claim that he had fired the staffers -- only accepted their resignations. This supports the pro-Democratic ad, and clashes with what Tillis\u2019 2014 ad claims.", "Indeed, after our colleagues at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker expressed skepticism about Tillis\u2019 ad, his office now appears to be backing off the term \"fired.\"", "\"Speaker Tillis initiated the action that resulted in the termination of employment. He asked for their resignations,\" Tillis spokesman Jordan Shaw told PolitiFact.", "That\u2019s closer to Tillis\u2019 initial phrasing, that he \"accepted\" the resignations, but it\u2019s still not the same thing as \"fired.\" And in any case, Tillis\u2019 response ad was not aired with the \"forced resignations\" terminology that Tillis\u2019 office began using after the fact.", "Our ruling", "Tillis\u2019 ad called a pro-Democratic ad \"false\" for saying that he allowed two disgraced staffers in 2012 to \"resign.\" But the news coverage at the time painted a different picture -- he accepted their resignations. This generally supports the Democratic ad\u2019s description, so we rate Tillis\u2019 claim Mostly False.", "Email interview with Jordan Shaw, Thom Tillis campaign spokesman, April 25, 2014", "Email interview with Ty Matsdorf, Senate Majority PAC spokesman, April 25, 2014", "FactCheck.org, \"Tillis response ad cries \u2018false,\u2019 \" April 22, 2014", "Washington Post, \"A claim of \u2018false\u2019 when the ad is basically true,\" April 23, 2014", "Kay Hagan for Senate, \"Tillis tries to rewrite history in new ad,\" April 17, 2014", "News & Observer, \"Charles Thomas, N.C. speaker\u2019s top aide, linked to lobbyist,\" April 27, 2012", "News & Observer, \"House speaker Tillis defends payments to ex-staffers,\" May 17, 2012", "News & Observer, \"Second Tillis staffer admits to inappropriate relationship with a lobbyist,\" May 1, 2012", "News & Observer, \"Speaker\u2019s staffers receive a month of pay after resignations,\" May 17, 2012", "Phone and email interviews with Sadie Weiner, Kay Hagan campaign spokeswoman, April 25, 2014", "Senate Majority PAC, \"Apartment,\" April 15, 2014", "Thom Tillis, \"Meddling,\" April 17, 2014", "WRAL, \"Hagan radio ads,\" April 17, 2014", "WRAL, \"Senate Majority PAC uses staffer scandal against Tillis,\" April 15, 2014", "WRAL, \"Tillis defends severance payments for disgraced staffers,\" May 17, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
