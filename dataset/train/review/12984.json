Bernie Sanders.", "Sanders, a Vermont independent and Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, shared a stage with the Rev. William Barber II at Duke University in Durham on April 19 to talk about systemic inequality during their\u00a0event\u00a0to honor Martin Luther King Jr.", "To drive home his point about U.S. defense spending, Sanders said, \"We\u2019ve spent\u00a0more money on the military than the next 12 nations combined.\"", "\"That,\" Sanders added, \"you will never hear in the media.\"", "Be careful what you ask for, Senator.", "A familiar claim", "PolitiFact has checked claims about military spending before. And if Sanders\u2019 claim sounds familiar, that may be because President Barack\u00a0Obama made a similar claim\u00a0during his 2016 State of the Union address.", "\"We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined,\" Obama said.", "It\u2019s been two years since we rated Obama\u2019s claim Mostly True on our Truth-O-Meter.", "At the time, PolitiFact relied on the\u00a0Stockholm International Peace Research Institute\u00a0(SIPRI), a think tank, for information to rate Obama\u2019s claim. By that group\u2019s calculation, the United States in 2014 \u2014 the most recent year available at the time \u2014 spent more than the next seven countries combined.", "Updated SIPRI numbers\u00a0show that the United States spent $611 billion in 2016, more than eight other countries combined \u2014 but not 12.

China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, India, Japan, France, Germany, South Korea, Australia, Brazil and Italy spent a combined $601 billion in 2016.", "However, the\u00a0most recent IISS report\u00a0shows the U.S. spending is ahead of the next 10 countries. The\u00a0United States spent $602.8 billion, while the next 10 countries spent a combined $593 billion.", "The change in ratio has more to do with foreign countries than it does with the U.S. military budget. While U.S. spending dipped slightly, Saudi Arabia boosted spending by nearly $20 billion. China and Brazil increased spending by about $5 billion apiece.", "PolitiFact alerted Sanders\u2019 office to the updated IISS numbers.", "\"We will update our talking points,\" Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis said.", "Our ruling", "Sanders said the U.S. government has spent \"more money on the military than the next 12 nations combined.\"", "He cited a 2016 chart that supported his claim, but it has been updated recently to a new pecking order of military spending.
