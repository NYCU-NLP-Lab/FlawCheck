["About this rating", "The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and its former grand wizard David Duke have endorsed U.S. President Donald Trump since his initial campaign in 2016, although the Trump administration has repeatedly rejected that endorsement. Scientific American took an unprecedented step in 2020 by endorsing Democratic candidate Joe Biden, marking the first time in its 175-year history to weigh in on a presidential election.", "A spokesperson for the Taliban denied endorsing Trump, whose campaign also rejected the alleged 2020 backing from the group. The New England Journal of Medicine said the country's current political leaders \u201chave demonstrated that they are dangerously incompetent\" and \"this election gives us the power to render judgment,\" but it did not refer to Biden or Trump by name.", "Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.", "As the 2020 U.S. presidential election inched closer, the internet was flooded with misleading memes about both candidates, including the allegation that extremist organizations like the Taliban and Ku Klux Klan supported U.S. President Donald Trump, while the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and other bipartisan groups openly endorsed Democratic candidate Joe Biden.", "The claims were first put forth by screenwriter and author Bess Kalb, whose work has been featured on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and The New Yorker. In a Twitter post shared on Oct. 11, she suggested that extremist groups supported Trump while implying that more even-keeled organizations backed Biden. At the time of publication, the tweet had received more than 370,000 likes.", "Although Kalb didn't specify in the tweet which candidate received endorsements from whom, it was perfectly clear to anyone following news about the presidential campaigns at the time which was which: Biden's endorsers included the magazine Scientific American, and the Trump campaign had publicly rejected an alleged endorsement from the Taliban.", "To verify Kalb's claim, we broke it down into four sections to address each of her assertions. Like much viral content, her statement contained kernels of truth that had been taken out of context or were inaccurately represented.", "In October 2020, CBS News claimed to have spoken with Zubihullah Mujahid, a spokesperson of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, or Taliban, who allegedly told the publication that the extremist group believed that Trump would win the November 2020 election. In an exclusive telephone interview, Mujahid reportedly said that Trump had \"proved himself a politician who accomplished all the major promises he had made to American people.\"", "Another \u201csenior Taliban leader\u201d said that the organization hoped Trump \u201cwill win the election and wind up U.S. military presence in Afghanistan.\" CBS News added that the Taliban\u2019s enthusiasm for Trump \u201cis grounded in the goal they share of getting U.S. troops out of Afghanistan after 19 years of war \u2014 a longtime promise of the president.\u201d", "However, Mujahid denied the claims made by CBS News and wrote in an Oct. 10 tweet that the publication had misinterpreted his remarks.

Our message to the Trump campaign also went unanswered.", "At the announcement of Trump\u2019s 2016 bid, the KKK published a full-page spread supporting Trump in its official quarterly newspaper, The Crusader. In an interview with MSNBC, Trump said that that he disavowed former KKK leader David Duke and that his campaign rejected the endorsement, issuing the following statement to news outlets in 2016:", "\u201cMr. Trump and the campaign denounces hate in any form. This publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign.\u201d", "The KKK endorsement followed the Trump presidency for years. It resurfaced again in January 2020 when a manipulated photo claimed to show a group of KKK members marching behind a campaign sign for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. A message accompanying the meme at the time claimed, \u201cThis is all you need to know about why you should vote Blue in 2020. As our previous fact check concluded, the photograph in question was not genuine \u2014 it was taken during a march in Pulaski, Tennessee, in July 2009.

In a video shared to Twitter by verified photojournalist Mykal McEldowney of the Indy Star (which has been archived here) from the Aug. 12, 2017, Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the former KKK leader offered support to the president.", "\u201cWe\u2019re going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That\u2019s what we believed in. That\u2019s why we voted for Donald Trump \u2014 because he said he\u2019s going to take our country back. And that\u2019s what we had to do.\u201d", "Trump expressed disapproval of Duke and disavowed white supremacy on \"Good Morning America\" in 2016.

Rather, it laid blame on a failing leadership and administration that inadequately responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, further polarizing and politicizing Americans while disenfranchising vulnerable communities and leaving behind health care professionals who have \u201cput their lives on the line.\u201d", "By making masks \u201cpolitical tools rather than effective infection control measures,\u201d continuing to push inaccurate guidelines, and deferring to pandemic responses at the state level \u2014 many of which did not have adequate resources to fight such a public health crisis without the support of the federal government \u2014 the publication argued that U.S. leaders ignored and \u201ceven denigrate[d] experts,\u201d furthering that the COVID-19 response a was a failure that had \u201ctaken a crisis and turned it into a tragedy.\u201d", "The editorial went on to say the following:", "The response of our nation\u2019s leaders has been consistently inadequate. The federal government has largely abandoned disease control to the states. Governors have varied in their responses, not so much by party as by competence. But whatever their competence, governors do not have the tools that Washington controls. Instead of using those tools, the federal government has undermined them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which was the world\u2019s leading disease response organization, has been eviscerated and has suffered dramatic testing and policy failures. The National Institutes of Health have played a key role in vaccine development but have been excluded from much crucial government decision making. And the Food and Drug Administration has been shamefully politicized, appearing to respond to pressure from the administration rather than scientific evidence. Our current leaders have undercut trust in science and in government, causing damage that will certainly outlast them. Instead of relying on expertise, the administration has turned to uninformed \u201copinion leaders\u201d and charlatans who obscure the truth and facilitate the promulgation of outright lies.", "[\u2026]", "Anyone else who recklessly squandered lives and money in this way would be suffering legal consequences. Our leaders have largely claimed immunity for their actions. But this election gives us the power to render judgment. Reasonable people will certainly disagree about the many political positions taken by candidates. But truth is neither liberal nor conservative. When it comes to the response to the largest public health crisis of our time, our current political leaders have demonstrated that they are dangerously incompetent. We should not abet them and enable the deaths of thousands more Americans by allowing them to keep their jobs.", "It is unclear what \u201cbroad bipartisan coalition\u201d Kalb refers to in her tweet; however, both candidates indeed have a long list of endorsements from both sides of the political aisle. Most notably, in mid-September Scientific American backed Biden, marking it the second publication to break stride in endorsing a presidential candidate for the first time in its history. Again, the editorial board cited Trump\u2019s rejection of science and pandemic response as a catalyst.", "\"The evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has badly damaged the U.S. and its people \u2014 because he rejects evidence and science. The most devastating example is his dishonest and inept response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which cost more than 190,000 Americans their lives by the middle of September,\" wrote the publication.", "\"He has also attacked environmental protections, medical care, and the researchers and public science agencies that help this country prepare for its greatest challenges. That is why we urge you to vote for Joe Biden, who is offering fact-based plans to protect our health, our economy and the environment. These and other proposals he has put forth can set the country back on course for a safer, more prosperous and more equitable future.\"", "A list of endorsements from political leaders and labor unions can be found on Biden\u2019s official campaign website, but as with most political candidates, the majority of his endorsers are partisan. Those include activist groups built around the platforms of LGBTQ, environmental, animal, women\u2019s reproductive rights, and labor unions representing dozens of industries from across the nation. That being said, a number of established newspapers have also endorsed the former vice president, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Boston Globe.
