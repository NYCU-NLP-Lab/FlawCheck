["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on March 26, 2021", "A video making the false claim that the Pfizer CEO \u201crefuses\u201d to get a COVID-19 vaccine has been circulating on Facebook. But the pharmaceutical company\u2019s chief executive has said that he\u2019s gotten his first shot.", "No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.", "One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS \u201cis not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.\u201d", "Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it\u2019s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.", "Another monitoring system is the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.", "In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.", "The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.", "For more, see \u201cHow safe are the vaccines?\u201d", "Link to this", "The chief executive officer for Pfizer, Albert Bourla, has gotten his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, he told Axios in early March.", "But a video posted to Facebook on March 24 is blaring the false claim: \u201cPfeizer CEO refuses [vaccine],\u201d with an emoji that looks like the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a syringe.", "The video was shared by a page called \u201cTru York,\u201d which has recently shared several other videos discouraging viewers from getting vaccinated. The page\u2019s administrators are based in Canada and describe it as an \u201cEntertainment Website \u00b7 Political Party \u00b7 Media/News Company.\u201d", "The video features a clip from an interview Bourla did with CNBC in December, in which he said that he would take the vaccine as soon as he could, but he didn\u2019t want to set an example for \u201ccutting the line\u201d to get it earlier. Bourla described himself as \u201c59 years old, in good health \u2026 not working on the frontline,\u201d so he wasn\u2019t prioritized for the shot.", "Even though that statement is included in Tru York\u2019s video, comments from viewers suggest that the written claim at the top of the video made a bigger impression. One such comment said: \u201cTRANSLATION \u2026 I\u2019m too rich and self important to kill myself taking a poison vaccine that I made.\u201d", "But, as we said, Bourla said in that interview that he intended to take the vaccine \u2014 and he has now gotten his first shot. So the claim that he \u201crefuses\u201d to take it is false.", "The video also\u00a0seems to suggest that\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,\u00a0was hesitant to get a COVID-19 test. The video shows Fauci\u00a0saying in an interview, \u201cI have no symptoms, there\u2019s no reason for me to take a test.\u201d", "But that interview was from March 15, 2020, about nine months before the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to the first COVID-19 vaccine. At the time, testing for the disease wasn\u2019t widely available.", "CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar had asked Fauci if he would be tested following a public appearance where he had touched the same microphone and podium that had been touched by several other people.", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m not taking a test for the simple reason: I have no symptoms \u2026 I have been practicing pretty good social distancing,\u201d Fauci said.", "In an event that was covered by the media, Fauci received a COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 22. (See SciCheck\u2019s articles on each vaccine: \u201cA Guide to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine,\u201d \u201cA Guide to Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine\u201c and \u201cA Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine.\u201d)", "As he was receiving his first shot, Fauci explained that he was taking the vaccine because he sees patients at the National Institutes of Health clinical center and \u201cas important, or more important, as a symbol to the rest of the country that I feel extreme confidence in the safety and the efficacy of this vaccine and I want to encourage everyone who has the opportunity to get vaccinated so that we could have a veil of protection over this country that would end this pandemic.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
