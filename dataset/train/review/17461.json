["The article -- linked to in posts here and here -- is headlined: \u201cSupreme Court Can Extend Trump\u2019s Term By Up To 3 Years If He\u2019s Acquitted In The Senate.\u201d", "\u201cIs this possible?\u201d one of the posts on a pro-Trump Facebook page says.", "Comments on the post indicate that some readers believe it is in fact possible, though others identified the article as satire.", "\u201cNow this is great news!\u201d wrote one person, while another commented: \u201cFabulous. I would be happy if he remained President indefinitely.\u201d", "The article says that if Trump is acquitted by the Senate -- where he is currently on\u00a0trial on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress -- his term could be extended until 2023 unless the top US court struck down a 1970s-era law allowing this to happen.", "It was published on dailyworldupdate.us, a website whose banner says the site provides \u201cSatire for Flat Earthers, Trumpsters, and Y\u2019all Qaeda.\u201d", "Dailyworldupdate.us is part of the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u201d network of websites, which was founded by Christopher Blair, a resident of the US state of Maine.", "Articles on Blair\u2019s sites make outrageous claims written as fact, albeit with clear indications they are not real.", "The articles are nonetheless shared in droves by people who apparently believe they are true amid a hyper-partisan American political environment.", "Legal experts also told AFP by email that\u00a0Trump\u2019s current term cannot be extended.", "\u201cThis is absolutely, 100 percent wrong. The Supreme Court cannot in any way, under any circumstances or for any reason, grant any president any sort of \u2018extension\u2019 of their term in office,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, the president of the Constitutional Accountability Center.", "It \u201cis categorically untrue and there is no basis in the text or interpretive history of the Constitution to support that claim,\u201d said Fernando Laguarda, Director of the Program on Law & Government at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law.", "The US president has repeatedly joked about remaining in office past the constitutionally-mandated two-term limit during campaign rallies and official speeches, as well as on Twitter.", "Claims that Trump\u2019s acquittal by the Senate would nullify his first term and allow him to serve two more have also circulated online in recent months, including here and here.", "But legal experts said the only way Trump could stand for more than two terms would be through an amendment to the Constitution.", "\u201cThe Constitution forbids any person to be elected more than twice to the office of president. Frankly, it\u2019s deeply worrisome that some Trump supporters are even contemplating such an unconstitutional, anti-democratic, un-American idea,\u201d Wydra said.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
