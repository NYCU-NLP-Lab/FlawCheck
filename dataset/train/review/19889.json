["About this rating", "A photo purportedly showing a copperhead snake inside the mouth of a fish is frequently circulated online along with the claim that several anglers have been bitten in similar situations. One popular version\u00a0was posted to Facebook in September 2015:", "Fellow Anglers beware. Several snake bites this season have came from baby copperheads found alive inside of feeding fish.
