The message had also been circulated in Marathi.", "The bird seen in the video is a condor. The condor is a common name for two species of vultures- the Andean Condor which is found mainly in the Andes mountain range of South America, and the California Condor which inhabits California and parts of Arizona and Utah in the USA. These are two of the largest flying birds, with a wingspan of up to 3.2 metres for Andean Condors.", "The video circulated on social media platforms is not recent.
