That's how far back we go in this battle, okay?\"", "We wondered whether the bishops\u2019 support for comprehensive health care really goes back nearly a century.", "Experts pointed us to the history of the National Catholic Welfare Council, the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

Ryan, published the Bishops\u2019 Program of Social Reconstruction, a guide to overhauling U.S. social justice. Dolan was referring to a section on social insurance, his spokesman said.", "\"The state,\" the guide read, \"should make comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment, and old age.\"", "That wasn\u2019t the last time the USCCB has supported health care expansions. For example, the group has publicly supported a variety of proposals, including former President Bill Clinton\u2019s ultimately defeated health care plan in 1993.", "\"The flap is over the (contraception) issue,\" said Maria Mazzenga, a Catholic history archivist at The Catholic University of America. \"That\u2019s where it comes to appear that they\u2019re against universal health care.\"", "Mazzenga said that, despite opposition to one specific part of Obamacare, all but the most conservative bishops have consistently supported health care efforts over the years.", "Our ruling", "Dolan said U.S. bishops have supported expanding health care since 1919. He\u2019s correct that the National Catholic Welfare Council published pro-health-care expansion literature that year, and experts told us that the bishops have regularly supported proposals to expand health care over the years, despite disagreements over specific provisions enacted under Obama, including contraception regulations.
