The text of the social media posts, as well as the graphic, were both taken from a 13 August 2015 Facebook post by WSYX.

The 93-year-old Carter still has \"no cancer,\" the center confirmed:", "Stories in the last day on social media stating that Jimmy Carter has cancer again are based on old news reports in 2015.
