["About this rating", "In August and September 2020, readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy of a widely shared Facebook post that claimed no fewer than 27 Republican lawmakers had endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. The Aug. 24, 2020, post described the mass endorsement for the former vice president as \"unprecedented\" and listed the names of the endorsers as follows:", "The image in the Facebook post was a screenshot of a news release sent out by the campaign for Biden and vice presidential running mate Kamala Harris on Aug. 24, 2020. It's true that each of the referenced 27 Republicans did endorse Biden for president, although some of them had done so well before Aug. 24, and the meme had the potential to mislead readers by not stipulating that the listed persons were no longer members of the U.S. Congress. (By contrast, the campaign press release stated clearly that the endorsers were former Republican members of Congress.)", "\u2022 U.S. Sen.

Endorsed Biden on Aug. 24.", "The list of names of 27 former Republican members of the U.S. Congress was accurate and authentic. The group comprised just one of several waves of endorsements of Biden by hundreds of prominent Republicans, whose number and significance constituted what could reasonably be described as an unprecedented level of support among former lawmakers and officials for the presidential candidate of an opposing party.", "According to CNN, a small number of national security officials broke party lines to support Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter in 1980, and historically rifts within major parties have, from time to time, grown so bitter that they resulted in full-on splits, third parties, and contested conventions, as the Pew Research Center noted in 2016.", "Republican dissatisfaction with Trump hasn't yet grown to that level in 2020, but the volume of cross-party endorsement of Biden has undoubtedly been remarkable, as the following breakdown shows:", "In the 1972 presidential election, John Connally, Democratic former Texas governor and U.S. Treasury secretary, led a campaign committee called \"Democrats for Nixon,\" in which prominent Democratic office-holders appealed to voters to reject the populist, anti-war platform of the party's candidate, U.S. Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota, in favor of re-electing Nixon.", "Among the Democrats who endorsed Nixon were: Connally himself; former Florida Governor Farris Bryant; Nashville Mayor Beverly Briley; Former Boston Mayor John Collins; Frank Fitzsimmons, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; Miami Mayor David Kennedy; and Leonard Marks, former director of the United States Information Agency (a now-defunct federal agency for U.S. public relations overseas). Nixon also obtained public support from John and James Roosevelt, the sons of former U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in 1972.", "Nixon's cross-party endorsements included the names of high-profile sitting Democratic office-holders (including the mayors of Nashville and Miami), while Biden's Republican supporters were largely retired, and none of the 27 names listed in the widely-shared Facebook meme were still in office. Nonetheless, we could not find a previous instance in which dozens of former members of Congress endorsed a presidential candidate from the other major party, outside a scenario in which a party was undergoing a schism.", "The sheer volume of Republican support for the former vice president, along with the prominence and influence of some of those endorsing him (especially Kasich, Snyder, Warner and Dent, each of whom governed or represented potential battleground states in 2020), means a reasonable argument can be made that the overall level of Republican endorsement of Biden, if not the 27 names listed in the meme, has been unprecedented in the modern era of U.S. presidential elections.", "Flake, Jeff.\u00a0 \"Here's Who I'll Be Supporting for President, And Why.\"\r\n\u00a0  \u00a0 Medium. \u00a0 24 August 2020.", "Schapiro, Jeff.
