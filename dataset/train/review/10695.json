So when Maddow went on a rant about a recent stump speech Paul gave on behalf of Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, at first it seemed like business as usual.", "During remarks Oct. 28 at Liberty University, Paul ventured into a diatribe against eugenics -- a sensitive topic in Virginia, where until 1979 it was legal to sterilize the mentally disabled -- when he brought up the 1997 sci-fi thriller Gattaca, starring Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law.", "It\u2019s at that point Maddow said he got into trouble, claiming Paul\u2019s comments about the movie were \"totally ripped off of Wikipedia.\"", "\"Rand Paul wants to be president,\" she added. \"But right now he\u2019s just lifting whole sections of this Wikipedia entry hoping that nobody\u2019s going to notice and he can call it his speech.\"", "It\u2019s not the first time a politician has been accused of (ahem) borrowing his words from someone else. But from Wikipedia? It seemed too sophomoric a slipup for someone like Paul, who filibustered for 13 hours straight on the Senate floor earlier this year without any accusations of lifting his remarks.", "It\u2019s true the campaign trail isn\u2019t the classroom, where copying and pasting from secondary sources is a fatal sin. But Paul is a major political player in Washington, and is considering a run for president in 2016. So a bold accusation like Maddow\u2019s raised our eyebrow.", "Paul shrugged it off as a phony controversy ignited by Maddow, who he said has been \"spreading hate on me for about three years now.\"", "\"This is really about information and attacks coming from haters,\" Paul said.", "We\u2019re more than familiar with the \"haters gonna hate\" defense, just as we fact-checkers know what it\u2019s like to be on the receiving end of Maddow\u2019s scorn. But it was a serious enough claim that we decided to check it out anyway.", "What Wikipedia says", "We wanted to review the Gattaca Wikipedia page for ourselves.

At first, we thought it might be possible that a reader edited the movie\u2019s Wikipedia entry to match Paul\u2019s speech after-the-fact. However, the history shows no change to the page between Sept. 25 and Oct. 29, the day after he stumped for Cuccinelli.", "Let\u2019s check several examples of Paul\u2019s words against the Sept. 25 version of the page:", "\"In the not-too-distant future, eugenics is common and DNA plays a primary role in determining your social class.\"", "The Wikipedia entry reads, \"In \u2018the not-too-distant future\u2019, liberal eugenics is common and DNA plays the primary role in determining social class.\" That looks nearly identical.", "\"Due to frequent screenings, Vincent faces genetic discrimination and prejudice.
