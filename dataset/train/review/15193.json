(Getty)", "On the opening night of the Republican convention, Donald Trump told Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly he was grateful it was held in Cleveland.", "\"I wanted it to be here, and we had lots of choices,\" Trump said. \"I wanted it to be in Ohio. I recommended Ohio. And people fought very hard that it be in Ohio. It's a tremendous economic development event, and you look at the way it's going so far, it's very impressive. I wanted it be here, the Republicans wanted it to be here.\"", "We wondered, did Trump get involved in picking Cleveland?", "If he did, we couldn\u2019t find a trace of it.", "We asked the Trump campaign for details, and we\u2019re still waiting to hear back.", "Trump\u2019s statement seems odd because of the timing.", "The Republican National Committee named a site selection committee in January 2014.

It\u2019s possible that he put in a good word for either Cleveland or Cincinnati (both are in Ohio), but there\u2019s no record of him saying anything about either one. He was not a candidate when Cleveland was picked in 2014, and he made no public statement at the time.", "The Trump campaign hasn\u2019t published any evidence of an early recommendation, nor could we find any in a Nexis search.
