The story ended sadly the next morning when searchers found her body.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook).", "The writer\u2019s use of the word \"works\" muddles the issue a bit, since the item was posted before the girl\u2019s body was found, showing the alert unfortunately had not worked. So we\u2019ll interpret that to be a general reference to which children are the subjects of Amber Alerts.", "Is the poster right to allege racial bias? We\u2019ll check it out, but first, there\u2019s some important background to note.", "The first slew of comments on the Facebook post supported the statement, with posters saying they thought the same thing. Later comments were more critical of the post as news of the tragic outcome spread.", "The post likely spread in part because in Milwaukee, particularly in the Black community, there are concerns police do not respond quickly enough in missing child cases.", "This issue came sharply into focus in a bizarre incident June 23, 2020, in which a civilian-led search for two teenage girls spiralled over the course of several hours to involve three people shot, 10 officers and a firefighter injured, police firing tear gas and rubber bullets into a crowd and protesters setting fire to a house they believed to be connected to the girls and sex trafficking.", "Police later said there was no evidence of sex trafficking and that the girls hadn\u2019t met the criteria for an Amber Alert since authorities had no reason to believe their lives were in danger. The girls, ages 13 and 15, were later found several miles away.", "An hourslong livestream of the situation included one community activist talking about the difficulty of \"getting a missing person\u2019s report going,\" and how community members had set up their own system for missing people on social media.", "Some comments on the Facebook post about Amber Alerts referenced this incident.", "Wisconsin has been issuing Amber Alerts since 2003, but only 41 alerts have been sent out in that span, according to state Department of Justice records.

The last two alerts were from Baraboo, the other sent in February 2020 for a missing 15-year-old girl who was later found.", "To be sure, the frustration that underlies the post may be more about whether the system is used often enough \u2014 particularly when it comes to Black children. To make that determination, however, one would need to understand the circumstances of each case, and whether ones that met the criteria were not issued.", "In the post at hand, though, the claim \u2014 strictly speaking \u2014 is about whether it is used at all in cases of missing Black children, or whether it is disproportionately used for non-Black children.
