They even teach police to speak Chinese so that the Chinese people don't struggle to communicate with them.\u201d", "The tweet was also\u00a0commented on by Julius Malema, president\u00a0of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) opposition party, receiving\u00a0over 200 comments and more than 1,100\u00a0likes.", "The post has been retweeted 2,962 times, has 2,740 likes and approximately 1,300 comments varying from questions about what legal powers the centre holds to comments about being \u201ccolonised\u201d by the Chinese.", "Various versions of this narrative are published on\u00a0other\u00a0websites.", "\u201cThese Co-operation centres are NOT police stations and are NOT manned by the South African Police Service staff,\u201d said Colonel Priscilla Naidu of the Eastern Cape South African Police Service (SAPS) via email.", "\u201cThe SAPS is mandated by the Constitution of this country to serve and protect all citizens in this country and as mandated our powers cannot be conferred upon to any other.\u201d", "Colonel Naidu told AFP that the SAPS were invited to the opening of the centre in Port Elizabeth and this is when they were informed by the CCPCC that 13 centres have been opened across the country.", "The CEO of the CCPCC, Jie Lee Zhang says the first centre was launched in 2005 in Johannesburg and that a centre\u2019s location depends on how big the population of Chinese nationals is in the region.", "To date 14 Chinese centres have been opened in South Africa to accommodate Chinese nationals living in the country. The CCPCC estimates that there are 250-350,000 Chinese nationals living in the country of some 57 million.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not a so-called Chinese police station,\u201d said Lee Zhang.", "The main purpose of the centre is to \u201cestablish good relationship with SAPS, metro police and the community police. We [are] not an enforcement organisation, we are a non-profit organisation \u2013 the catalyst between the two countries and two communities but we do get a lot of support from both governments.\u201d", "He says the CCPCC cannot arrest or detain individuals and that the picture of uniformed Chinese nationals added to\u00a0confusion about the function of the centre.", "\u201cThat\u2019s how people get confused, they see the uniform and they think it\u2019s a real Chinese station being opened. The one is a police counsellor visiting the embassy in Pretoria and his colleague. It\u2019s the protocol and that is their profession, they are the police officials from China so that\u2019s why they wear uniform,\u201d said Zhang.", "The CEO added that the Chinese representatives were there to support a function involving Chinese nationals.", "\u201cThey think that this is a Chinese station and that can never be the case, you can\u2019t violate the constitution and South African law\u201d.", "The Chinese are however offering free basic mandarin lessons to members of the SAPS to aid in communication between their community and the SAPS.", "\u201cWe wish to set the record straight that the Chinese do NOT have their own police station and should they require any assistance relating to crime or other matters, they must report to their nearest SAPS for assistance,\u201d concluded Colonel Naidu.", "At this stage, Zhang does not foresee any more centres being opened as the Chinese are \u201ccovered\u201d throughout the country.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
