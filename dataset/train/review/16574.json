As an irrational and transcendental number, it will continue infinitely without repetition or pattern. While only a handful of digits are needed for typical calculations, Pi\u2019s infinite nature makes it a fun challenge to memorize, and to computationally calculate more and more digits,\u201d wrote the test preparation company Mometrix on its webpage dedicated to Pi Day.", "The Google tool prompted users to enter the numerical sequence for pi, as was reported by The Verge.", "Screengrab/Google", "Clicking the twinkling asterisks around the pi symbol in the upper left corner of the calculator revealed the first three digits (3.14). You could then type those three into the calculator and click enter. The calculator kept track of your attempts in calculating pi out \u2014 as well as your highest score \u2014 in the area near the pi symbol. And if you really wanted to get serious, you could view the 100,000 digits of pi here.
