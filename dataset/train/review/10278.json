["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on April 16, 2018 | Updated on April 16, 2018", "House Speaker Paul Ryan misleadingly claimed that corporate tax revenues are \u201cstill rising,\u201d even though the 2017 tax law cut tax rates. In the first six months of fiscal year 2018, corporate tax receipts have declined by 22.3 percent from a year ago. Revenues are also projected to be less over the next 10 years than they otherwise would have been because of the law.", "Ryan, who recently announced he is leaving Congress in January 2019, discussed his legacy as speaker during an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Ryan pointed to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on Dec. 22, 2017,\u00a0as an example of his achievements.", "The bill, among other things, reduced the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective in the 2018 tax year.", "Host Chuck Todd asked Ryan to respond to criticism that the Republican\u00a0\u201ctax bill spiked the deficit.\u201d The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the fiscal year 2018 deficit will total $804 billion \u2014 $139 billion more than in fiscal 2017.", "In response, Ryan blamed rising deficits on mandatory spending. He went on to claim that corporate tax revenues are \u201cstill rising,\u201d even though the rate \u201cdropped 40 percent.\u201d", "Todd, April 15: I want you to respond to something Bob Corker said. He said this: \u201cThis Congress and this administration likely will go down as one of the most fiscally irresponsible administrations and Congresses that we ever had.\u201d And he\u2019s referring to the fact that this tax bill spiked the deficit. It\u2019s higher than even what was projected. And as \u2014 we\u2019re gonna get trillion dollar, you walk away with trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see \u2014", "Ryan:\u00a0That was going to happen. The baby boomers\u2019 retiring was going to do that. These deficit trillion-dollar projections have been out there for a long, long time. Why? Because of mandatory spending, which we call entitlements. Discretionary spending under the CBO baseline is going up about $300 billion over the next 10 years. Tax revenues are still rising. Income tax revenues are still rising. Corporate income tax revenues. Corporate rate got dropped 40 percent, still rising.", "Ryan is right that $1 trillion deficit projections \u201chave been out there for a long, long time.\u201d In a June 2017 report, before the tax bill became law, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimated that the federal deficit would top $1 trillion in fiscal year 2022 and remain above that level.\u00a0It\u2019s also true that overall tax revenues are up for the first six months of fiscal year 2018.", "But corporate tax revenues are down for the first six months of the fiscal year, and they are projected to be less over the next 10 years than they otherwise would have been because of the law.\u00a0In fact, revenues in general will be less than they otherwise would be \u2014 resulting in even larger projected deficits.\u00a0The CBO now projects $1 trillion annual deficits starting in FY2020.", "Each month, the CBO issues an analysis of federal spending and tax revenue collections for the previous month and the fiscal year to date \u2014 a report known as the\u00a0Monthly Budget Review.", "In its most recent report on April 6, CBO said total tax receipts were up\u00a02 percent in the first half of fiscal year 2018, from October to March, compared with the same six-month period in fiscal year 2017.", "However, that same report said corporate tax revenues for the first six months of the year were down $22 billion \u2013 a 22.3 percent decline from the first six months of fiscal year 2017.", "Corporate tax revenues\u00a0declined $10 billion in the final three months of calendar year 2017, from October to December, and fell an additional $12 billion in the first three months of 2018, from January to March, for a total cumulative drop of about $22 billion, according to the CBO monthly reports.", "In its latest\u00a0Budget and Economic Outlook report, which projects spending and revenue for 10 years, the CBO said it expects \u201ccorporate tax receipts to fall by $54 billion in 2018, to 1.2 percent of GDP, largely because of the enactment of the 2017 tax act.\u201d", "CBO projects the federal government will take in $243 billion in corporate tax receipts in fiscal 2018 and $276 billion in fiscal 2019 \u2014 both below the $297 billion that the federal government collected from corporations in fiscal 2017.\u00a0(See Table 3-1.)", "In an email, Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman AshLee Strong told us that the speaker was referring to revenues over a 10-year budget window. She said corporate tax revenue \u201cwill nearly double between 2018 and 2028 \u2013 from $243 billion to $448 billion,\u201d citing the CBO\u2019s economic outlook report.", "Actually, the increase is about 50 percent, not double, when measured from fiscal year 2017 \u2013 before the tax laws changed. Also, CBO projects tax revenues will be less than what the government otherwise would have collected from corporations if the tax laws did not change.", "Over the next 10 fiscal years, from 2018 to 2027, CBO projects that the federal government will take in about $409 billion less in corporate income tax revenue because of legislative changes, mostly those in the new tax law.", "\u201cCBO also reduced its projection of corporate tax revenues \u2014 by $94 billion in 2018,\u00a0and by $409 billion over the 2018\u20132027 period \u2014 to reflect legislative changes,\u201d CBO said in the Budget and Economic Outlook, which was released earlier this month. \u201cMost of that reduction is attributable to the 2017 tax act, which modified the corporate income tax system in many important ways.\u201d", "That $409 billion estimate does not include the potential economic benefits of reducing tax rates. However, when factoring in the economic effects of the new tax law (plus $476 billion) and other technical revisions related to the tax law (minus $333 billion), the CBO estimates a net drop of $266 billion in corporate tax revenue relative to what the government would have collected over 10 years without the 2017 tax law. (See Table A-1.)", "Overall, CBO says the new tax law \u201cincreases the total projected deficit over the 2018\u20132028 period by about $1.9 trillion,\u201d mostly because of a reduction in individual income tax revenue and an increase in debt service.", "Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us in a phone interview that there may be months or even years when corporate tax revenues increase. There were so many corporate tax changes in the 2017 law that \u201cit\u2019s uncertain when the dollars will show up\u201d in federal coffers. But he said over time the federal government will take in less corporate tax revenue as a result of the new tax law.", "\u201cThe whole point of this is to cut corporate taxes,\u201d Mazur said.", "Update, April 16: Ryan\u2019s office responded to us after we posted this item. We have updated our story to reflect its response.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
