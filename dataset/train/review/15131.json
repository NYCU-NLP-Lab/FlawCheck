["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on September 26, 2018", "Q: Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez say \u201cwe\u2019ll never have to worry about China attacking us\u201d because of the country\u2019s time difference?", "A: No. There is no evidence she made the statement used in a viral meme.", "A\u00a0meme\u00a0that has gained momentum through thousands of shares on Facebook uses a false quote to take aim at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll never have to worry about China attacking us!\u201d the meme reads. \u201cThey are 12 hours ahead, so we\u2019ll have plenty of time to shoot down their missiles!\u201d", "The\u00a0Democratic nominee\u00a0for New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District seat, who gained prominence after her primary\u00a0victory\u00a0over a 10-term incumbent, never made that illogical comment.", "Corbin Trent, a spokesman for her campaign, told us \u201cthe entire quote was fabricated.\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019s never even discussed Chinese missiles. Period,\u201d Trent said. \u201cHer foreign policy topics have been about peace not war.\u201d", "While Ocasio-Cortez has been criticized for some remarks relating to foreign policy, we could find no evidence of her making any comments similar to the alleged quote. Instead, we found that the meme in question gained popularity when it was\u00a0posted\u00a0Sept. 4 on the Facebook page of America\u2019s Last Line of Defense.\u00a0That online publication uses numerous websites and its Facebook page to publish content that it deems satire, but that is routinely mistaken for valid news.", "Its Facebook post did not explicitly identify the meme as satire, though its page\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d section has a disclaimer that notes: \u201cNothing on this page is real. It is a collection of the satirical whimsies of liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives. You have been warned.\u201d", "The meme was also published by others across\u00a0social media\u00a0in recent weeks, including on the Facebook page of James Harris, a conservative radio host with hundreds of thousands of followers on the platform.", "Harris\u00a0posted\u00a0a version of the meme Sept. 21 with additional text that doubles down on the deception, which was also popular on other conservative pages. The add-on reads: \u201cDid she REALLY say that? Yep, you\u2019re looking at the future of the Democrat party\u2026\u201d", "Some users interacted with the post as if the quote was real, leaving comments questioning her intelligence. \u201cHow did she get out of the 6th grade?\u201d one person asked.", "Others suspected it couldn\u2019t be real and asked for proof of its veracity. \u201cI love ya\u2013but can you please give a source? I can\u2019t find one, & I won\u2019t share until I verify it,\u201d another user wrote.", "Many others did not wait for verification. Almost 30,000 Facebook users shared the meme.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cAbout.\u201d Trumpbetrayed.us.
