Gretchen Whitmer gives a speech on the state of the coronavirus pandemic in Michigan on Oct. 21 (Michigan Office of the Governor via AP)", "Michigan\u2019s governor took actions to limit the spread of the coronavirus, most of which were lifted by June 1.", "Today, Michiganders are allowed to dine out, attend school, get a haircut and go bowling.", "During the final presidential debate, President Donald Trump repeated his call for keeping schools and\u00a0 businesses open amid the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that Michiganders have been subject to excessive restrictions.", "\"Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan,\" Trump said, referring to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who issued a stay-at-home order and a number of other emergency measures in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Under her leadership, \"it's been like a prison,\" Trump claimed.", "Trump has made similar claims this month. \"She keeps her state closed,\" he said of Whitmer during an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Oct. 8. \"The churches are closed. The schools are closed, and the whole state is closed.\" In a virtual rally two days later, he told Michigan supporters \"your governor has to open up her state.\"", "Trump\u2019s comments seem to place\u00a0Michigan residents and businesses\u00a0under a lockdown. That\u2019s not the case. Whitmer declared a state of emergency on March 10 as the state discovered its first two confirmed cases, and issued the stay-at home order and business restrictions on Mar. 23. But her order was lifted statewide by Jun. 1.", "Bars and restaurants across the state reopened shortly afterward, followed by barbershops, spas and salons in mid-June. Casinos in Detroit were allowed to reopen in early August. Schools across the state were allowed to resume in-person learning in the fall, with local districts setting their own criteria for reopening. And by early October, gyms, movie theaters and bowling alleys were cleared to reopen with safety precautions in place. Churches and houses of worship in Michigan were exempt from penalties under the state's order.", "We reached out to the Trump campaign to explain his comments but didn't hear back.", "While many governors across the country issued stay-at-home orders at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, Whitmer\u2019s was criticized as extreme or arbitrary. For instance, Michiganders were prohibited from traveling to vacation homes, and big-box stores were required to rope off areas selling nonessential items, such as paint and garden supplies.", "On April 15, thousands of people participated in a protest outside the state Capitol in Lansing against Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order, and drew support from Trump. On April 23, dozens of protesters gathered outside Whitmer\u2019s Lansing residence. And a week later, armed protesters entered the Michigan Capitol.", "Whitmer\u2019s actions have also faced pushback from the GOP-controlled Legislature, which challenged her emergency powers in court. After the Michigan Supreme Court ruled Oct. 2 that she did not have the authority under state law to issue additional emergency declarations, her administration and the Legislature began working together to enact new laws to respond to the pandemic.", "Public opinion polls have shown consistent support for Whitmer\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis.", "But with the restrictions lifted, the number of COVID-19 cases in Michigan is now increasing in the vast majority of the state\u2019s counties. On Oct. 21, Michigan reported an daily average of 1,704 new COVID-19 cases in the last seven days, the state\u2019s highest seven-day average yet.", "Trump claimed that \"it\u2019s been like a prison\" in Michigan under Whitmer\u2019s leadership during the coronavirus pandemic.", "Whitmer implemented strict emergency measures in March, but they were mostly lifted across the state by June 1.
