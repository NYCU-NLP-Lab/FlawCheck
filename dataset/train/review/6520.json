["A set of videos is circulating on social media with the narrative that these depict child-kidnappers who sell kidneys of children for money. Alt News was asked to verify the videos which are currently shared on WhatsApp to fuel rumours. The message used to share the video claims \u2013 \u201cThese videos were circulated from district morena of Madhya Pradesh. They were extracting kidneys and heart from children.\u201d The visual description of the four videos from top-left is as follows:", "Alt News was able to ascertain that out these four videos, three are unrelated to the child-kidnapping. We have traced the origins of each video with their actual narrative.", "With the help of digital verification tool InVid, we obtained multiple frames of the video which were then used to perform a reverse image search on Google. One of the earliest references to the incident happens to be in an American news website Breitbart. The 2018 article includes screenshots of the gory video and claims that the incident took place at a ranch near the boundary between Michoacan and Guerrero states in Mexico. The same video was uploaded on the video-sharing platform BitChute with a similar narrative. While Alt News is unable to confirm any other details of the incident, it is clear that the video is not from India and has no links to any child-kidnapping incident. The people in the video are not conversing in any Indian language. Alt News is not posting the video here due to its graphic nature.", "This incident took place in Neemuh district of Madhya Pradesh earlier this year in mid-July. According to a Dainik Bhaskar report, a mob near Bhadwa Mata temple caught three young men red-handed while they were stealing goats offered at the holy place. The mob took the law in their own hands by thrashing the men for stealing the goats and burning their motorcycle.

SP Rakesh Kumar Sagar said, \u201cThe accused were arrested and produced before the court.\u201d Neemuch City police also informed Alt News that all the accused are released on bail.", "The video, therefore, has nothing to do with child-kidnapping.", "This video was earlier debunked by Alt News when it was shared with a similar narrative of organ trafficking. It was found that the clip depicts the aftermath of a riot which broke out in Alca\u00e7uz prison in Brazil on January 14, 2017. The people in the video are conversing in Portuguese with a Northeast Brazilian accent. On January 14, a riot between rival gangs had broken out in Alca\u00e7uz prison which led to the death of at least 30 inmates.
