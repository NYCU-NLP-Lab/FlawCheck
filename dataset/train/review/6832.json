(AP)", "Cruz\u2019s claim is based on a specific poll and the total percentage of respondents in a survey who agreed \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cstrongly\u201d with the statement: \u201cI am concerned that the election is rigged.\u201d", "But another question in the survey asked people more directly about their view of the election.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, challenged Arizona\u2019s presidential election results on the Senate floor, he claimed that it\u2019s not just Republicans who think the election was \"rigged.\" A sizable percentage of independents and Democrats believed so, too, he claimed.", "\"Recent polling shows that 39% of Americans believe the election that just occurred was \u2018rigged.\u2019 You may not agree with that assessment, but it is nonetheless a reality for nearly half the country,\" said Cruz. \"I would note it is not just Republicans who believe that. 31% of independents agree with that statement. 17% of Democrats believe the election was rigged.\"", "President-elect Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election.

For that, we use a separate question in the same survey,\" Chris Jackson, an Ipsos pollster, told PolitiFact.", "The survey also asked: \"What comes close to your view of the 2020 election?\" The choices were \"legitimate and accurate,\" \"the result of illegal voting or election rigging,\" or \"don\u2019t know.\"", "\"The result of illegal voting or election rigging\" was chosen by 28% all respondents, 20% of independents, and 6% of Democrats.
