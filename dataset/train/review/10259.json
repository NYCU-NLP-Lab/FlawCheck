["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on September 20, 2018", "Q: Is Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault as retribution for her parents\u2019 foreclosure case in the 1990s?", "A: There is no evidence to support that claim, and her parents still live in that house.", "After President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh in July to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, a woman alleged in a confidential letter that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.", "Christine Blasey Ford came out publicly as the woman who made the allegations in a Sept. 16 story in the Washington Post.", "Since then, the backlash against her has been fast and fierce \u2014 from death threats to viral internet rumors.", "One of the first rumors to emerge online claimed that Ford was motivated to come forward with her allegation because Kavanaugh\u2019s mother had been one of the judges to preside over a foreclosure case against her parents and their suburban Maryland home.", "That claim has been featured on several websites. The Gateway Pundit\u2019s story \u2014\u00a0which falsely claimed \u201cJudge Kavanaugh\u2019s mother foreclosed on Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s parents\u2019 home\u201d \u2014 was shared on social media pages with a combined following of more than 3 million, according to data from CrowdTangle.", "However, there is no evidence that Ford\u2019s decision to come forward with her allegation against Kavanaugh is connected to her parents\u2019 foreclosure proceeding in the 1990s.", "While it\u2019s true that Martha Kavanaugh was one of two judges who handled the foreclosure case, initially filed in 1996, she was actually the judge who granted the bank\u2019s motion to dismiss the case after the Blaseys refinanced.", "The couple stayed in the house and they still own it to this day, according to Maryland\u2019s Department of Assessments and Taxation.", "So, stories that make claims such as, \u201cMartha Kavanaugh ruled against the parents of Christine Blasey-Ford in a foreclosure case,\u201d are wrong. She didn\u2019t rule against the Blaseys and she didn\u2019t foreclose on them, either.", "For her part, Ford told the Post that she had decided to come forward publicly with her allegation after initially wanting to avoid the exposure. \u201cNow I feel like my civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation,\u201d she said in the Sept. 16 story.", "Ford hasn\u2019t mentioned anything publicly about her parents\u2019 foreclosure proceeding, so any connection between it and her decision to come forward is pure speculation.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "CNN. \u201cRead the letter Christine Blasey Ford sent accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.\u201d CNN.com. 17 Sep 2018.", "Brown, Emma. \u201cCalifornia professor, writer of confidential Brett Kavanaugh letter, speaks out about her allegation of sexual assault.\u201d The Washington Post. 16 Sep 2018.", "Katz, Debra and Banks, Lisa.
