["By Lori Robertson, Eugene Kiely, D'Angelo Gore, Robert Farley, Jessica McDonald and Rem Rieder", "Posted on November 2, 2020", "After months of campaigning, President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made their final pitches to voters at campaign rallies in key swing states and on TV airwaves.", "Here we fact-check claims the candidates made in rallies on Nov. 1 and 2, and in a few of the TV ads they are airing in the waning hours before Election Day.", "We reviewed Trump\u2019s rallies in Michigan, North Carolina, Iowa and Florida and Biden\u2019s rallies and remarks in Pennsylvania and Ohio.", "The Trump campaign has spent $10.5 million on TV and digital ads in the final week of the campaign, according to data collected by Advertising Analytics. The campaign is still spending heavily on misleading ads attacking Biden on taxes, health care and protests for racial justice.", "Taxes.\u00a0Since Oct. 29, the campaign has spent nearly $1 million on\u00a0an ad\u00a0that shows Biden,\u00a0in February, saying, \u201cif you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut.\u201d Then it shows Biden,\u00a0in October, saying, \u201cAnd here\u2019s how it works. I\u2019m going to raise taxes.\u201d But in neither case was he talking about raising taxes for everyone.", "Biden has pledged not to directly raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. The\u00a0most recent estimate\u00a0by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center on Oct. 15 calculates that the net result of all of Biden\u2019s tax proposals in 2022 would be, on average, a tax cut for the bottom 80% of households, with the top one-tenth of 1% of earners bearing 70% of Biden\u2019s proposed tax increases.", "Health insurance.\u00a0In recent days, more than $4 million has been spent on a Republican National Committee/Trump\u00a0ad\u00a0that claims \u201cJoe Biden and Kamala Harris\u2019 government-run health care plan\u201d could \u201cgive benefits to illegal immigrants.\u201d But Biden doesn\u2019t support the Medicare for All plan proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden, in addition to private health insurance,\u00a0has proposed\u00a0offering a Medicare-style public option only as a choice. The ad cites a conservative think tank\u2019s argument that a public option would lead to a government health care system, but that\u2019s not what Biden has proposed. He\u00a0has also said\u00a0immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be able to buy health insurance plans, not get them for free.", "Violent protests.\u00a0In addition, the Trump campaign has spent more than $400,000 to run an ad that says, \u201cWhile America\u2019s cities burned, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris fan the flames, refusing to strongly condemn violence, supporting bail funds that helped let rioters, looters and dangerous criminals out of jail.\u201d", "But\u00a0Biden\u00a0and\u00a0Harris\u00a0both have condemned violent protests, riots and looting. As early as late May, for example, Biden\u00a0issued\u00a0a\u00a0widely\u00a0reported\u00a0statement\u00a0saying: \u201cProtesting such brutality is right and necessary. It\u2019s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not. The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest. It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.\u201d", "And, to be clear, in June,\u00a0Harris asked\u00a0the public to contribute to the Minnesota Freedom Fund to specifically \u201chelp post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota.\u201d She did not mention \u201crioters, looters and dangerous criminals\u201d \u2014 some of whom were also aided by the nonprofit.", "The Biden campaign has spent nearly $50 million on TV and digital ads in the final week of the campaign, according to data collected by Advertising Analytics. But there are not a lot of facts to check in Biden\u2019s ads.", "The campaign of the Democratic presidential nominee is running largely positive ads about Biden\u2019s character and ads designed to increase voter turnout. There have been numerous ads telling voters how to cast ballots in key swing states, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona.", "The issues covered in the Biden campaign ads include COVID-19, health insurance, the economy, Social Security, taxes and racial injustice.", "One ad\u00a0that has been in heavy rotation leaves the false impression that Trump has a plan to \u201cwipe out Social Security in just three years.\u201d The campaign has spent $7.1 million on the ad since Sept. 25, including nearly $1.9 million in the last seven days.", "\u201cThe Social Security Administration just released a report saying that if a plan like the one Trump is proposing goes into effect, the Social Security trust fund will be, and I quote, \u2018permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023,\u2019\u201d Biden says in the ad, which also displays text on the screen that says, \u201cTrump\u2019s Plan would wipe out Social Security in just three years.\u201d", "But Trump has no such plan, as we have\u00a0written before\u00a0\u2014 including elsewhere in this article.", "The campaign also has spent more than $8 million in the last month on a TV ad called \u201cGets It Done\u201d that among other things says Biden\u2019s economic plan \u201craises wages by as much as $15,000 a year.\u201d It\u2019s not clear in the ad, but that pay raise applies to a subset of workers. And it would not reach that level for years even for them.", "The campaign tells us Biden\u2019s support for a $15 minimum wage would translate into a $15,000 a year increase for full-time employees working 40 hours per week at the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour.", "But there are caveats to that $15,000 pay raise. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia currently have higher minimum wage rates than the federal rate,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of Labor. Also, Biden hasn\u2019t provided details on his plan, but the Democratic-controlled House\u00a0passed\u00a0a bill last year that would phase in the increase over six years. That could mean Biden\u2019s $15 minimum would not take effect until 2027.", "Auto plants. Trump made several false claims about how the auto industry in Michigan fared both before and after he took office. The fact is, Michigan has lost motor vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs under Trump, even before the coronavirus pandemic caused economic shutdowns. Those jobs declined by 2,400 during Trump\u2019s time in office through February, and they\u2019ve dropped by another 15,800 since.", "General Motors\u00a0built a light vehicle assembly plant\u00a0in Lansing Delta Township, completed in 2006, the company\u2019s \u201cnewest plant\u201d in the country, it says, and the most recent light vehicle assembly plant built in the state prior to 2017, as we\u2019ve written. But in a Nov. 1 rally, Trump falsely told Michiganders that \u201cno new [auto] plants had been built in Michigan in decades and decades before I got here.\u201d", "He wrongly claimed that \u201cwe brought back your car industry. Your car industry was finished. You would\u2019ve had nothing left.\u201d Automaker investments in the state were higher during the last three years under the Obama administration than they have been under Trump, as we\u2019ve explained. The value of investments dropped 29% under Trump, according to data provided by the independent Center for Automotive Research.", "Also, on a yearly basis, both domestic production and light weight vehicle sales have been lower under Trump\u2019s presidency than they were in 2016, the year before he took office.", "Trump also repeated a tale involving former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and an announcement of \u201cfive companies moving to Michigan from Japan.\u201d As we\u2019ve written, there have been five new\u00a0investments by Japanese automakers in Michigan, but only one of them is a manufacturing facility, announced just 10 days after Trump took office.\u00a0Honda and GM\u00a0announced\u00a0the joint venture to produce hydrogen fuel cell systems.", "Ethanol.\u00a0Campaigning in Dubuque, Iowa, Trump\u00a0falsely claimed\u00a0that \u201cif Biden gets in you can forget about ethanol, you can forget about everything. You would have that terminated.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign website\u00a0states: \u201cFrom day one, President Biden will use every tool at his disposal, including the federal fleet and the federal government\u2019s purchasing power, to promote and advance renewable energy, ethanol, and other biofuels.\u201d The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0noted\u00a0that Biden made the promise to promote ethanol over the objections of some environmentalists.", "COVID-19 vaccine.\u00a0In Fayetteville, North Carolina, the day before the election, the president exaggerated the timeline for a coronavirus vaccine. \u201cWe will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks,\u201d Trump\u00a0said. \u201cIt will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the China plague once and for all. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state.\u201d", "It\u2019s not clear when a COVID-19 vaccine will be ready, assuming one or more candidates are found to be safe and effective in phase 3 clinical trials. But the most optimistic estimates do not include distributing a vaccine in a few weeks \u2014 and certainly not at a scale that would end the pandemic.", "The leading U.S. candidate in terms of speed is Pfizer\u2019s mRNA vaccine. The company, however, has said that because the Food and Drug Administration is seeking to have two months of safety data on at least half of the trial participants, it doesn\u2019t plan to even submit its application for an emergency use authorization to the agency until the\u00a0third week of November.", "The FDA would then have to review the application and make a decision before distribution could begin. That also assumes the results are positive, which is not guaranteed.", "Even if the Pfizer vaccine receives authorization before December, it would not mean a speedy end to the pandemic. Only a limited number of doses will be available to start \u2014 prioritized for those at highest risk \u2014 and it is\u00a0likely\u00a0to take well into 2021 for most Americans to be vaccinated.", "Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned\u00a0on Oct. 27 that \u201cit will be easily by the end of 2021, and perhaps even into the next year, before we start having some semblances of normality.\u201d", "Trump, who\u00a0once said\u00a0he thought a vaccine was probable in October and\u00a0has\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0claimed\u00a0a vaccine is coming to the masses soon, also misleads by saying that the shots will \u201cquickly eradicate the virus.\u201d As we\u2019ve\u00a0explained, even with a vaccine, the coronavirus will not necessarily disappear completely, as it is likely to stick around, cropping up seasonally in a more mild form.", "The president is also wrong that Biden \u201cis promising to delay the vaccine.\u201d Biden has\u00a0expressed concerns\u00a0about the vaccine approval process being transparent, but has said he would listen to scientists and that he wants a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible. \u201cIf I could get a vaccine tomorrow, I\u2019d do it,\u201d he said in September. \u201cIf it cost me the election I\u2019d do it. We need a vaccine and we need it now.\u201d", "Looting. Trump\u00a0falsely claimed\u00a0that Biden \u201cdoesn\u2019t even want to condemn\u201d \u201crioters, looters, arsonists\u201d\u00a0following\u00a0the fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr. in Philadelphia on Oct. 26. In fact, the day after the shooting, Biden put out\u00a0a statement\u00a0in which he condemned violent responses. \u201cNo amount of anger at the very real injustices in our society excuses violence,\u201d Biden stated. \u201cAttacking police officers and vandalizing small businesses, which are already struggling during a pandemic, does not bend the moral arc of the universe closer to justice. It hurts our fellow citizens. Looting is not a protest, it is a crime. It draws attention away from the real tragedy of a life cut short.\u201d", "Biden made similar comments after he voted in Wilmington on Oct. 28, when a reporter asked him about the situation in Philadelphia.\u00a0Biden responded, \u201cWhat I say is that there is no excuse whatsoever for the looting and the violence, none whatsoever. I think to be able to protest is totally legitimate, totally reasonable. But I think that the looting is just, as the victim\u2019s father said, \u2018Do not do this. It\u2019s not what my son \u2026 You\u2019re not helping, you\u2019re hurting. You\u2019re not helping my son.\u2019\u201d", "\u2018Rounding the turn.\u2019\u00a0In speeches in\u00a0Michigan\u00a0and\u00a0North Carolina, the president\u00a0repeated\u00a0the\u00a0false\u00a0notion that the U.S. is \u201crounding the turn\u201d on the COVID-19 pandemic. On the contrary,\u00a0data\u00a0from the COVID Tracking Project show that new daily cases are at a\u00a0record high,\u00a0and\u00a0hospitalizations\u00a0and\u00a0deaths\u00a0are on the upswing.\u00a0Public health officials also dispute Trump\u2019s assessment, with the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci,\u00a0telling\u00a0the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0on Oct. 30 that America \u201ccould not possibly be positioned more poorly\u201d as temperatures drop and more people spend time together indoors.", "Fauci. As the crowd in Opa-locka, Florida, chanted, \u201cFire Fauci!\u201d \u2014 referring to a lead member of the Trump administration\u2019s White House Coronavirus Task Force who has\u00a0criticized\u00a0the president\u2019s mixed messages on wearing masks \u2014\u00a0Trump said\u00a0that might happen \u201ca little bit after the election.\u201d Trump then misleadingly claimed Fauci has \u201cbeen wrong on a lot,\u201d noting that Fauci said, \u201cDo not, under any circumstances, wear a mask.\u201d", "As\u00a0we have reported, in the early months of 2020, Fauci did tell the general public not to wear face masks because he was\u00a0concerned\u00a0it could lead to a shortage of masks for health care workers. However, as health officials learned more about the virus, and how often it was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, Fauci and other White House health officials reversed course in early April and began recommending people wear masks in public when socially distancing is difficult. \u201cAnybody who has been listening to me over the last several months knows that a conversation does not go by where I do not strongly recommend that people wear masks,\u201d Fauci said in\u00a0an interview\u00a0on Sept. 30.", "Man of the year. Trump repeated an old chestnut: that he \u201cgot Man of the Year in Michigan, 12 years ago.\u201d There\u2019s no evidence for that. As we\u2019ve written, it appears Trump is referring to a 2013 dinner hosted by a county Republican Party organization, which presented him with token gifts, not an award.", "Economy. Trump falsely claimed that prior to the pandemic\u00a0the U.S. \u201chad the greatest economy in the history of the world.\u201d The economy has grown faster under other presidents \u2014 and so have jobs.", "He also claimed that after what he called \u201cthe plague,\u201d the economy has rebounded: \u201cSo, we got it going,\u201d he said in Michigan, pointing to a record annual gross domestic product growth rate of 33.1% in the third quarter. In Iowa, he called it \u201ca super V\u201d recovery and claimed, \u201cWe\u2019re all set.\u201d\u00a0But as we\u2019ve explained, the GDP figures show an economy still far from fully recovered.", "Private insurance. The president falsely claimed in Iowa that the Biden ticket \u201cwill eliminate the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans.\u201d Biden doesn\u2019t support such a plan. Instead, he has proposed building on the Affordable Care Act by increasing subsidies to buy private insurance and adding a Medicare-like public option as a choice.", "Immigrants. Biden hasn\u2019t \u201cpledged \u2026 free health care for illegal aliens,\u201d no matter how many times Trump says it. Biden\u00a0has said\u00a0those who are now in the country illegally should be able to buy insurance, without any subsidies \u2014 not get it for \u201cfree\u201d \u2014 on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, as\u00a0we\u2019ve written before.", "2 million \u2018saved\u2019 lives.\u00a0As he has\u00a0before, Trump referenced an Imperial College London\u00a0report\u00a0to claim that he saved 2 million American lives from the coronavirus. \u201cRemember the model? It said 2.2 million people would die,\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0in North Carolina. \u201cWell, we saved 2 million people by acting quickly.\u201d He\u00a0repeated\u00a0the claim in Iowa. That distorts what the March report said. The projection of 2.2 million American deaths was\u00a0not meant\u00a0to be a realistic estimate of what the losses would be, but rather a kind of worst case scenario in which people did not change their behaviors and no mitigation measures whatsoever were taken.", "Fracking. Trump suggested Biden would eliminate fracking, saying in Michigan: \u201c\u2019Will not frack!\u2019 You know, he said that for a year, and then when he came to Pennsylvania, goes like, \u2018Oh yeah, I guess it\u2019s okay.\u2019 No, no, there won\u2019t be energy.\u201d Biden\u2019s plan calls for prohibiting permits for new oil and gas drilling on federal land and waters. That would allow fracking to continue under existing permits and in nonfederal areas \u2014 where the vast majority of U.S. oil and natural gas is produced, as we\u2019ve said.", "Suburbs. In both Michigan and Iowa, Trump claimed he \u201cgot rid of the regulation that will ruin the suburbs,\u201d or \u201cdestroy\u201d them. he\u2019s referring to ending a Department of Housing and Urban Development 2015 rule on fair housing.\u00a0But\u00a0experts told us\u00a0the rule didn\u2019t mandate low-income housing or rezoning, as Trump previously\u00a0has\u00a0claimed\u00a0or\u00a0suggested. The rule changed the way jurisdictions that receive HUD funding\u00a0develop and report\u00a0plans to address fair housing issues in their communities.", "Guns. Trump falsely told North Carolinians and Floridians that Biden and Harris \u201cwant to take away your guns\u201d or \u201cconfiscate your guns.\u201d Not so. Biden called for a ban on the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines for ammunition. He said he wouldn\u2019t confiscate the affected assault weapons that had already been purchased legally.", "China tariffs. Trump repeated false claims about tariffs he placed on goods imported from China, telling North Carolinians \u201cwe\u2019ve taken in tens of billions of dollars a year first time ever with China; we never took in 25 cents.\u201d The U.S. has collected billions in customs duties on Chinese imports for years. The amount did increase greatly under Trump\u2019s trade war.", "In Iowa, the president boasted of giving $28 billion to farmers hurt by that trade war, claiming that China \u201cpaid for it, you didn\u2019t pay.\u201d As we\u2019ve explained, the tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. importers in the form of customs duties, and to some extent by U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices. A Government Accountability Office report put the 2018/2019 total paid to farmers because of trade disruptions at $23.1 billion.", "COVID-19 lockdowns.\u00a0Trump incorrectly said at\u00a0multiple\u00a0rallies\u00a0that certain Democratic states were still closed due to the pandemic and suggested \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that states would announce reopenings the day after the election. He also falsely claimed that Biden is \u201call about lockdowns.\u201d", "\u201cAnd by the way, tell your governor to open up North Carolina,\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0in Hickory, North Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s time. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s ridiculous. They\u2019ll probably announce it on November 4th.\u201d", "North Carolina is not under a lockdown. Given concerning indicators that the coronavirus was picking up steam, Gov. Roy Cooper\u00a0paused reopening\u00a0on Oct. 21. The pause left the state in\u00a0phase 3\u00a0for three more weeks rather than moving to phase 4 \u2014 and allows many businesses, including movie theaters, amusement parks and bars, to operate, but with capacity limits in place.", "\u201cThe Biden Plan is to imprison you in your home,\u201d Trump similarly said to supporters in Macomb County, Michigan,\u00a0adding, \u201cthat\u2019s what you\u2019re going through right now with this governor.\u201d", "That\u2019s a gross exaggeration of the situation in the Wolverine state,\u00a0which\u00a0lifted\u00a0its stay-at-home order on June 1 and is, like\u00a0most states, in the process of reopening. Following a rise in coronavirus cases, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u00a0moved\u00a0a portion of the state back from phase 5 to phase 4 on Oct. 29, which imposes more restrictions,\u00a0such as\u00a0capacity limits in restaurants, but is hardly equivalent to home imprisonment.", "Trump also falsely\u00a0said\u00a0Pennsylvania was \u201call locked down\u201d \u2014 even though the state has been largely\u00a0open\u00a0since\u00a0July 3.", "As we\u2019ve\u00a0written, Biden said in an\u00a0ABC News interview\u00a0that he would follow scientists\u2019 advice if they recommended shutting down again, but later clarified that he does not think such action will be necessary.", "Puerto Rico pharma.\u00a0As he has before, Trump\u00a0exaggerated\u00a0Biden\u2019s role in the loss of pharmaceutical jobs in Puerto Rico. Trump said, \u201cAnd we\u2019re returning the pharmaceutical industry back to Puerto Rico. You know, Biden is the one that took it out.\u201d", "In 1996, Biden, then a senator, joined all of the Democrats who voted and a majority of Republicans, who controlled the Senate at the time, in\u00a0approving\u00a0a wide-ranging bill focused largely on small businesses. As we have\u00a0written, it is true that the legislation, in an effort to\u00a0limit \u201ccorporate welfare,\u201d phased out a tax exemption for companies manufacturing products in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. Loss of the exemption did impel many pharmaceutical companies to move their operations off of the island. But the island\u2019s drug manufacturing industry has not been shut down.\u00a0According to the Food and Drug Administration, in 2016 about 30% of Puerto Rico\u2019s gross domestic product consisted of drug and medical device manufacturing, and 8% of U.S. pharmaceutical expenditures were for products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The island is home to 49 pharmaceutical plants,\u00a0according to the Puerto Rican government. Biden was hardly \u201cthe one that took it out.\u201d And Trump did not focus on the issue until late in his term as the election approached.", "\u2018Super predators.\u2019\u00a0Trump wrongly\u00a0said in Michigan that Biden \u201copenly called young black men \u2018super predators.\u2019\u201d He repeated the claim in North Carolina. There is no\u00a0record\u00a0of the former vice president using the term, which Hillary Clinton uttered in 1996 about some \u201cgangs of kids\u201d in support of the 1994 crime bill.", "Travel restrictions.\u00a0In\u00a0two\u00a0North Carolina rallies, the president repeated his claim that Biden was against Trump\u2019s travel restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus,\u00a0saying\u00a0in Fayetteville that Biden is \u201con record all over the place, knocking me two and a half months later for closing too soon and closing it all. He said, \u2018Don\u2019t close. He\u2019s xenophobic.\u2019\u201d\u00a0There is no record of Biden saying, \u201cDon\u2019t close.\u201d\u00a0In fact, Biden\u2019s campaign\u00a0said on April 3\u00a0that the former vice president supported the travel restrictions. Biden did use the word \u201cxenophobic\u201d to describe Trump\u00a0on the day\u00a0the travel restrictions from China were announced, but it\u2019s not clear whether he was alluding to the restrictions. Biden\u2019s campaign has said the \u201creference to xenophobia\u201d wasn\u2019t about the travel restrictions but rather \u201cTrump\u2019s long record of scapegoating others.\u201d", "ISIS.\u00a0In Florida, Trump, as he often does,\u00a0embellished\u00a0his administration\u2019s record on dealing with the Islamic State, or ISIS, and\u00a0falsely portrayed the performance of the Obama administration. Trump said, \u201cWe obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate and it was a mess. Let me tell you, when I took over, it was a mess. It was all over the place. It\u2019s gone, 100%.\u201d As we have\u00a0written, according to figures provided by Trump\u2019s own administration, about half of the territory held by ISIS had been regained under President Barack Obama.", "Border security.

Can you believe? \u2018Let\u2019s take down the wall and let everybody pour into our country.\u2019 He wants to take down.\u201d Biden hasn\u2019t said that. He has said he would end funding for Trump\u2019s project, but hasn\u2019t said he would tear down what has been built. \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure that we have border protection, but it\u2019s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. And at the ports of entry \u2014 that\u2019s where all the bad stuff is happening,\u201d\u00a0Biden said\u00a0in an interview on Aug. 5.", "Meadows on the pandemic.\u00a0At a\u00a0drive-in rally\u00a0in Philadelphia, Biden mischaracterized what White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said about the Trump administration and COVID-19.

As we have\u00a0written, the actuary analyzed\u00a0\u201chypothetical legislation\u201d\u00a0that would eliminate the payroll tax that funds Social Security \u2014 not a proposal from Trump.
