["By Robert Farley", "Posted on December 1, 2020", "A Republican TV ad falsely suggests that \u201cliberal megadonors\u201d are spending $1 billion in \u201cdark money\u201d to help Democrat Jon Ossoff in Georgia\u2019s Senate runoff race. That\u2019s how much multiple experts estimate may be spent on all candidates\u00a0in both Georgia Senate elections for the entire 2020 campaign cycle.", "In fact, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, slightly more dark money \u2014 where the source of the money is not disclosed \u2014 has been spent on behalf of Ossoff\u2019s opponent, Republican Sen. David Perdue.", "The narrator in the ad, which is from the Senate Leadership Fund, says \u201cliberal megadonors are backing Ossoff with untold millions in dark money,\u201d while viewers see an image with the words \u201c$1 billion in political spending.\u201d In smaller print below the $1 billion figure, the ad cites an article in MarketWatch.", "If that graphic wasn\u2019t enough to convince viewers the ad was suggesting that $1 billion in dark money would be spent on behalf of Ossoff in the runoff election, a shorter, 15-second version of the ad draws an arrow between the $1 billion figure and Ossoff.", "But the MarketWatch article does not speculate that $1 billion might be spent solely on behalf of Ossoff. The full headline of the story is: \u201cGeorgia\u2019s two Senate runoff elections could spark $1 billion in political spending, analysts say.\u201d", "The other Georgia Senate race pits Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler against Democrat Raphael Warnock. If Democrats win both Jan. 5 runoff races, they would control both houses of Congress and the presidency.", "The $1 billion estimate in the story was based on comments provided by three political analysts during an interview on Atlanta radio station WABE\u2019s \u201cCloser Look\u201d program on Nov. 9.", "MarketWatch, Nov. 12: \u201cAll eyes are going to be on Georgia. Probably $1 billion is going to be spent by the Democratic Party here in Georgia to try and take those two seats,\u201d a Republican analyst, Julianne Thompson, said on the program, leading host Rose Scott to sound incredulous.", "But an Emory University professor of political science, Bernard Fraga, and a Democratic strategist, Fred Hicks, then indicated to Scott that Thompson\u2019s estimate wasn\u2019t way off.", "Both parties combined could spend $1 billion in Georgia, said Fraga, describing that outlay as \u201creally possible.\u201d Hicks said $1 billion in total spending is \u201ca lot of money, but there\u2019s a lot at stake.\u201d", "Fraga clarified to us via email, \u201cMy statement that $1 billion dollars is \u2018possible\u2019 would have to include all spending to support the Democratic and Republican candidates for U.S. Senate in Georgia this year across all stages of the process (primaries, general, and general runoff), including by groups that are not coordinating with the campaigns.\u201d", "So the analysts were talking about all money being spent on the two races, and not just dark money.\u00a0The article also noted that \u201cother spending estimates for the Georgia runoffs are more modest, with a\u00a0CNBC report\u00a0suggesting outlays of more than $200 million.\u201d", "Other political experts have also suggested total spending in the two races could reach $1 billion. But again, that\u2019s on behalf of all candidates in two races, and for all spending in the 2020 cycle, not just in the runoff.", "An analysis of Federal Election Commission data shows that during the entire 2020 election cycle, \u201c$2.76 million in dark money was spent in support of Ossoff or against Perdue and $2.83 million was spent in support of Perdue or against Ossoff,\u201d Anna Massoglia, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, which operates the website OpenSecrets.org, told us via email. She is responsible for researching dark money for OpenSecrets.org.", "The term \u201cdark money\u201d refers to spending by politically active groups that do not disclose the source of their money, such as \u201csocial welfare\u201d groups that are organized under Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(4). Although all groups must report to the FEC any spending that explicitly advocates for or against federal candidates, 501(c)(4) nonprofits are not legally required by the IRS to disclose their funding.", "Most of the dark money supporting Ossoff comes from Majority Forward, a 501(c)(4) organization that is affiliated with Democratic Senate leadership, Massoglia said.", "\u201cNone of this dark money spending was reported during the runoff but there is always a chance that there was additional spending on things like digital \u2018issue\u2019 ads boosting or attacking a candidate without explicitly calling for their election or defeat since those ads are generally not required to be disclosed to the FEC,\u201d Massoglia said.", "More substantial has been the tens of millions of dollars in so-called \u201cgray money\u201d poured into the Georgia race by super PACs that receive contributions from dark money sources.", "As the Center for Responsive Politics explains, \u201cOpaque nonprofits and shell companies may give unlimited amounts of money to super PACs. While super PACs are legally required to disclose their donors, some of these groups are effectively dark money outlets when the bulk of their funding cannot be traced back to the original donor.\u201d", "Most of that \u201cgray money\u201d in the Georgia Senate races is being spent by super PACs aligned with Senate leadership from both parties. And more of that gray money has been spent on Perdue\u2019s behalf than on Ossoff\u2019s.", "\u201cOut of $49 million in total grey money spending on the right, $47.9 million of that came from Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Republicans,\u201d Massoglia said. \u201cSenate Leadership Fund has spent over $4.3 million of that during the runoff and spent nearly $44 million before Election Day in November.\u201d", "Again, the Senate Leadership Fund \u2014 which was\u00a0established\u00a0in 2015 by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 is the group responsible for the ad attacking Ossoff saying that \u201cliberal megadonors\u201d are backing him with \u201cuntold millions in dark money.\u201d", "\u201cOut of $33.6 million in total grey money spending on the left, $31.2 million of that came from Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC aligned with Senate Democrats,\u201d Massoglia added.", "\u201cOnly around $5 million in grey money spending has been reported to the FEC during runoff but FEC filings are continuing to roll in,\u201d Massoglia said. \u201cOf the grey money spending during the runoff, a little over $250,000 has come from the left and $4.8 million from the right.\u201d", "Almost all of that gray money spending during the runoff has been by Senate Leadership Fund, she said.", "Overall, outside groups have spent more money to help Perdue than Ossoff, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Outside spending in support of Ossoff or in opposition to Perdue totaled $44.4 million, while spending in support of Perdue or in opposition to Ossoff added up to $84.2 million, as of Dec. 1.", "As for his candidate committee, Ossoff received $17.7 million in large individual donations, accounting for about 55% of the money he raised, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.", "Perdue got less from large individual donors, about $10.2 million. That accounted for 48.2% of the money Perdue raised.", "But, Ossoff also got a lot more in small individual contributions, $12.8 million. That\u2019s nearly 40% of his total. By comparison, Perdue got about $2 million in small individual contributions, a little less than 10% of his total.", "And as we have written, Perdue has gotten a lot more than Ossoff from PACs during the 2020 election cycle. Ossoff has raised a total of $32.3 million, but only $322,000, or 1%, came from PACs. By comparison, Perdue received $3.3 million from PACs, which represents nearly 16% of his total contributions, including nearly $2.7 million from business PACs.", "We should note that the ad also misleadingly claims that Ossoff took \u201cmoney from Chinese communists and terrorist sympathizers.\u201d We addressed that claim last month when we wrote about an earlier Senate Leadership Fund ad. As we wrote at the time, Ossoff\u2019s TV production company received payments from a Hong Kong media company and Al Jazeera \u2014 among many others \u2014 for the rights to air investigative pieces.", "Clarification, Dec. 2: This story has been updated to make clear that Massoglia, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, says tens of millions of dollars in gray money \u2014 not dark money \u2014 have been spent on the Georgia Senate race.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
