A version of that story was later published on millytips.com, where it was flagged by Facebook users as potentially fake news.", "Politicot.com is one of a few websites from Newslo, which claims to be \u201cthe first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.\u201d We\u2019ve written about stories from Newslo before, and it is on our list of websites that post either fake or satirical news articles.", "Newslo\u2019s tagline is \u201cJust Enough News,\u201d as its stories often start with a paragraph of genuine news followed by several more paragraphs of false information and quotes.", "However, stories posted on Newslo affiliated websites have \u201cshow facts\u201d and \u201chide facts\u201d buttons that allow readers to differentiate between the parts of the story that are real or fake.

The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception coverage outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women while in fact endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. Gov. Mike Pence signed it Thursday night.", "The bill is one of those omnibus anti-choice bills Republicans are fond of these days, a giant bill stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can\u2019t get legally at all.", "The legislation that Pence signed primarily prohibits an abortion if the doctor knows that the woman is seeking to end her pregnancy specifically because of the fetus\u2019 race, sex, national origin, ancestry or disability. The bill also restricts fetal tissue donation, and requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital.", "But it\u2019s completely false, as the Newslo story says, that Pence told the Huffington Post that allowing rape victims to get abortions would lead to \u201can epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion.\u201d Nor did Pence suggest that \u201cwomen would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work\u201d to recover from having an abortion. Those quotes were made-up by the fake story\u2019s author.", "In his official statement about the bill, Pence said: \u201cI believe that a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable \u2014 the aged, the infirm, the disabled and the unborn. HEA 1337 will ensure the dignified final treatment of the unborn and prohibits abortions that are based only on the unborn child\u2019s sex, race, color, national origin, ancestry, or disability, including Down syndrome.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label viral\u00a0fake news\u00a0stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Newslo. \u201cMike Pence: Allowing Rape Victims to Have Abortions Will Lead to Women Trying to Get Raped.\u201d Politicot.com. 17 Jul 2016.", "Daily Tips. \u201cMike Pence: Allowing Rape Victims to Have Abortions Will Lead to Women Trying to Get Raped.\u201d Millytips.com.
