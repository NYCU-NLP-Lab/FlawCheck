["Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai apartment more than two months ago. As time goes by, the media\u2019s obsession with the case is rapidly soaring. Singh\u2019s family had filed an FIR blaming his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty for his demise. Chakraborty, however, claimed that Singh\u2019s relationship with the family soured after his sister Priyanka molested her in April. The actor\u2019s family members subsequently released several videos to \u2018prove\u2019 that he was neither depressed nor had a bad relationship with them. In this backdrop. Aaj Tak\u2019s editor-in-chief Anjana Om Kashyap tweeted a video claiming it shows Singh dancing with his niece. \u201cSee this video of Sushant Singh Rajput.
