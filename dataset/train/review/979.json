Or killed off by the vaccine.", "\u201cThe vaccine is more dangerous then measles. The maker is in a lawsuit right now.

This means there are more unvaccinated children, adolescents, and adults in our communities.", "\u201cChoosing to not vaccinate your children not only leaves them susceptible to measles, but also exposes other children to measles.
