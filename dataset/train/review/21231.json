But Trump's supporters backed him up by pointing to newspaper accounts from 1991 reporting that he had once confronted a baseball-bat-wielding mugger on the streets of New York City:", "Remember the time Donald Trump saw a bat wielding mugger and ran after him and stopped him: pic.twitter.com/MLqZlwpvti", "\u2014 MARK SIMONE (@MarkSimoneNY) February 26, 2018", "Many readers reacted with skepticism to this information, disbelieving it because it seemed conveniently and suspiciously new to them after the contentious 2016 presidential campaign in which Trump's actions over the course of his life came under scrutiny.
