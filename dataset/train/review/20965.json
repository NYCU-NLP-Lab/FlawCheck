["To hear U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., you\u2019d think the former lumberjack and reality TV star might like to take a chainsaw to government spending and, um, bring it into the \"real world.\"", "Indeed, the one-time county prosecutor came ready with what he considered to be evidence of waste when he appeared on the March 10, 2013, edition of \"Upfront with Mike Gousha,\" a public affairs program on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee.", "Noting U.S. unemployment was edging down, Gousha asked:", "\"Don\u2019t you, your party, the president, don\u2019t all of you in Washington feel under pressure to make sure that government doesn\u2019t muck up what appears to be a rebounding economy?\"", "Duffy acknowledged the improving jobs picture, then said:", "\"We\u2019re going in the right direction; that\u2019s positive. But to think that you can\u2019t cut -- we spend $2.2 billion on free cell phones, $27 million on Moroccan pottery classes; we pay for the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama. There are -- story after story about wasteful spending in government. Let\u2019s cut that.\"", "(Duffy made the same multi-part claim two weeks earlier in emotional statements to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke during a congressional committee meeting. In that exchange, Duffy also said the government spent $700 billion to see how long shrimps can run on a treadmill. His staff later told a reporter he meant to say $700,000.)", "So, federal funds for free cells, pottery classes and a watermelon queen?", "Let\u2019s check this out.", "For each of the three parts of Duffy\u2019s claim, we\u2019ll look at evidence provided by Duffy\u2019s staff and information we collected ourselves. Duffy relied in part on \"Wastebook 2012,\" which is produced by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.", "1. Cell phones", "To back his claim that the federal government spent $2.2 billion on \"free cell phones,\" Duffy cited a February 2013 article in The Wall Street Journal and a 2012 Federal Communications Commission report.", "The Journal revealed that the government spent $2.2 billion in 2012 on phone subsidies for the poor, but that more than 2 million people served by the Lifeline program hadn\u2019t proved they were eligible.", "Lifeline, which is funded by fees paid by all cell and landline customers, is available to low-income people, including those on Medicaid, food stamps and other assistance.", "Wireless carriers often offer free phones to Lifeline customers, the FCC report says.", "PolitiFact National in 2012 and PolitiFact Texas in 2013 examined similar claims about free cell phones -- although those claims, unlike Duffy\u2019s, tied the program directly to Obama.", "Lifeline started in 1985 to subsidize home phone service; cell service was added in 2008 under President George W. Bush. Subsidies for cell service now make up 75 percent of the program.", "Lifeline doesn\u2019t actually give away phones, but rather pays an average of $9.25 (the subsidy varies by state) to a user\u2019s phone company toward monthly home or cell service.", "However, many people end up with a free phone from a cellular carrier if they sign up for cell service with Lifeline. Assurance Wireless, for example, advertises a variety of Lifeline plans, as well as a free phone. Both the Coburn report and the FCC report also note that, to attract Lifeline customers, many carriers offer free phones.", "So, most but not all of the $2.2 billion in the Lifeline program subsidizes cellular bills. And, although the program itself doesn\u2019t give away phones, it\u2019s common for customers to end up with a free phone as a result of Lifeline.", "2. Pottery classes", "Duffy cited a December 2011 federal audit to support his statement that the United States \u00a0spends \"$27 million on Moroccan pottery classes\" (a claim that\u2019s also been made by conservative talk show host Bill O\u2019Reilly).", "The audit evaluated a $27 million project of the U.S. Agency for International Development that was begun in 2009 \"to provide technical assistance to improve Morocco\u2019s economic enabling environment by improving the business climate, using water sustainably for agricultural growth and strengthening workforce development.\"", "So, the program is broader than what Duffy claimed, although the audit did single out pottery classes. Local residents reported that the classes from a U.S.-based trainer were ineffective, partly because the trainer spoke only English and the trainer\u2019s translator wasn\u2019t fluent in English.", "Coburn\u2019s book also highlighted the pottery classes, but noted that only part of the $27 million went toward them.", "So, Duffy is wrong on this part of his claim.", "3. Watermelon queen", "The third part of Duffy\u2019s claim was that the federal government \"pays for the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama.\" He cited a U.S. Department of Agriculture document on fruit and vegetable projects funded in all 50 states in fiscal 2012.", "Alabama got $401,366 for 13 projects, including one to \"partner with the Alabama Watermelon Association to promote the consumption of Alabama\u2019s watermelon through appearances of the Alabama Watermelon Queen at various events and locations.\"", "The Coburn book said $25,000 in federal money went toward the queen\u2019s travel expenses.", "So, Duffy is correct on this part of his claim, although it should be made clear that Uncle Sam picks up only part of the queen\u2019s tab.", "Our rating", "Duffy said the federal government spends \"$2.2 billion on free cell phones, $27 million on Moroccan pottery classes\" and pays for \"the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama.\"", "Overall, Duffy\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.", "WISN-TV, interview (quote at 4:50) with U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, broadcast March 10, 2013", "Email interview, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy spokesman Andrew Fasoli, March 15, 2013", "Interview, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy chief of staff Pete Meachum, March 19, 2013", "PolitiFact Texas, \"Steve Stockman says president is spending $2.2 billion to give away \u2018ObamaPhones,\u2019\" March 15, 2013", "PolitiFact National, \"Adam Putnam: Obama campaign gives free cell phones to supporters,\" Oct. 31, 2012", "The Wall Street Journal, \"Millions improperly claimed phone subsidies,\" Feb. 11, 2013", "U.S. Office of the Inspector General, \"Audit of USAID/Morocco\u2019s economic competitiveness project,\" December 15, 2011", "U.S. Department of Agriculture, \"Fiscal year 2012 description of funded projects\"", "U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, \"Wastebook 2012\"", "U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, news release on \"Wastebook 2012,\" Oct. 15, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
