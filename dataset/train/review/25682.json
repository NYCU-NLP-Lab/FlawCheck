One was about a so-called single-payer health care system, in which the government pays for care for all citizens.", "\"The interesting this is, I'm not the guy who's saying we should have completely socialized medicine,\" Ribble said Sept. 8, 2015 on WTMJ-AM (620).", "\"I want to repeal Obamacare and replace it with (a) free-market system.

Why were you for that then and why aren\u2019t you for it now?\"", "Trump answered first by speaking about foreign policy, then said:", "\"As far as single payer, it works in Canada.
