["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on September 13, 2018", "Former President Barack Obama stood up for a free press in his first political speech of the 2018 campaign season, but he engaged in a bit of revisionist history when it came to his administration\u2019s dealings with Fox News.", "\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be Democratic or Republican to say that we don\u2019t threaten the freedom of the press because they say things or publish stories we don\u2019t like,\u201d Obama said in a Sept. 7 speech in Illinois. \u201cI complained plenty about Fox News, but you never heard me threaten to shut them down or call them enemies of the people.\u201d", "The Democratic president did more than complain. His administration at times took action against the cable network. The Obama Justice Department surveilled one of Fox News\u2019 reporters, and a White House spokesman acknowledged excluding Fox News from interviews.", "And while he may never have called Fox News \u201cenemies of the people\u201d \u2014 a phrase President Donald Trump has used repeatedly\u00a0for the media at large \u2014 Obama did say that its \u201cpoint of view\u201d was \u201cultimately destructive\u201d to the U.S.", "Here are some of the times when the Obama White House took aim at Fox News.", "Obama Snubs Chris Wallace", "On Sept. 20, 2009, Obama appeared on five Sunday talks show \u2013 NBC, CBS, CNN, ABC and Univision to talk about health care. But he did not appear on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d", "The snub came less than two weeks after Fox Broadcasting Network did not carry the president\u2019s joint address to Congress on health care. The Sept. 9, 2009, speech was carried by the Fox News Channel, but not the Fox network \u2014 which aired an episode of \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance,\u201d from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. that night.", "Robert Gibbs, the Obama White House press secretary at the time, complained about it during an appearance on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d prior to the speech.", "When it came time to schedule Obama for the post-speech Sunday talk show circuit, Fox News was the only major Sunday show that did not have Obama as a guest.", "Then-White House spokesman Josh Earnest deflected questions about why Obama would not\u00a0appear on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d by saying: \u201cWe figured Fox would rather show \u2018So You Think You Can Dance\u2019 than broadcast an honest discussion about\u00a0health insurance reform.\u201d", "\u201cThey are the biggest bunch of crybabies I have dealt with in my 30 years in Washington,\u201d Chris Wallace, anchor of \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d said about White House snub.", "Obama did not appear on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d until his last year in office.", "White House Labels Fox News Illegitimate", "Anita Dunn, who was then the White House director of communications, told the New York Times in an interview on Oct. 11, 2009, that Fox News was not a legitimate news organization.", "\u201cWe\u2019re going to treat them the way we would treat an opponent,\u201d Dunn told the Times. \u201cAs they are undertaking a war against Barack Obama and the White House, we don\u2019t need to pretend that this is the way that legitimate news organizations behave.\u201d", "She also said, when asked about snubbing \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d with Chris Wallace, \u201cwe\u2019re not going to legitimize them as a news organization.\u201d", "White House Willing to \u2018Exclude Fox News\u2019 from Interviews", "In October 2009, the Obama administration and Fox News got into a public dispute over whether the Treasury Department intentionally attempted to exclude Fox News from on-camera TV interviews with the administration\u2019s so-called \u201cpay czar,\u201d Kenneth Feinberg.", "A Treasury Department spokesman described the dispute as a miscommunication \u2013 \u201cmuch ado about absolutely nothing\u201d \u2013 that ended with Fox News interviewing Feinberg on camera for the Oct. 22, 2009, nightly news. Fox News reported that the administration \u201cfailed in its attempt to exclude Fox News\u201d only after \u201cthe Washington bureau chiefs of the five TV networks consulted and decided that none of their reporters would interview Feinberg unless Fox News was included.\u201d", "Whatever the intent, White House spokesman Josh Earnest acknowledged\u00a0that the Obama White House had a history of freezing out Fox News.", "A day after the Feinberg flap, Talking Points Memo quoted Earnest as saying, \u201cThis White House has demonstrated our willingness to exclude Fox News from newsmaking interviews, but yesterday we did not.\u201d", "Obama Calls Fox News \u2018Destructive\u2019", "Obama may never have called Fox News \u201cenemies of the people,\u201d but he did say that its \u201cpoint of view\u201d was \u201cultimately destructive\u201d to the U.S.", "In a Rolling Stone magazine interview in 2010, Obama compared Fox News to William Randolph Hearst and his style of so-called \u201cyellow journalism.\u201d He called its point of view \u201cultimately destructive for the long-term growth\u201d of the U.S.", "Rolling Stone:\u00a0What do you think of Fox News? Do you think it\u2019s a good institution for America and for democracy?", "Obama: [Laughs]\u00a0Look, as president, I swore to uphold the Constitution, and part of that Constitution is a free press. We\u2019ve got a tradition in this country of a press that oftentimes is opinionated. The golden age of an objective press was a pretty narrow span of time in our history. Before that, you had folks like Hearst who used their newspapers very intentionally to promote their viewpoints. I think Fox is part of\u00a0that\u00a0tradition \u2014 it is part of the tradition that has a very clear, undeniable point of view. It\u2019s a point of view that I disagree with. It\u2019s a point of view that I think is ultimately destructive for the long-term growth of a country that has a vibrant middle class and is competitive in the world. But as an economic enterprise, it\u2019s been wildly successful. And I suspect that if you ask Mr. Murdoch what his number-one concern is, it\u2019s that Fox is very successful.", "Obama Justice Department Labels Fox News Reporter \u2018Co-conspirator\u2019", "In 2010, when investigating possible leaks of classified information about North Korea, the Obama Justice Department collected Fox News reporter James Rosen\u2019s telephone and email records and tracked his movements at the State Department, according to the Washington Post.", "The Post, which broke the story in 2013, wrote that it had obtained a court affidavit that showed the Justice Department used security badge access records to track Rosen\u2019s visits to the State Department, traced his calls to a department security adviser suspected of sharing classified information, and obtained a search warrant to seize two days\u2019 worth of emails with the department official.", "In the affidavit for a search warrant, FBI agent Reginald Reyes said there was evidence that Rosen \u2014 the chief Washington correspondent for Fox News \u2014 broke the law.
