(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)", "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden appeared Monday in Pittsburgh and defended his position on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking \u2014 a controversial drilling technique that has lifted the economy in western Pennsylvania.", "\"I am not banning fracking. Let me say that again. I am not banning fracking. No matter how many times Donald Trump lies about me,\" said Biden, who spoke at a Carnegie Mellon robotics institute.", "Biden\u2019s remarks came after Trump, speaking Thursday on the final night of the Republican National Convention, accused him of wanting to \"abolish\" natural gas production in the U.S. Fracking is used to extract natural gas from reservoirs deep beneath the earth\u2019s surface.", "We\u2019ve examined Biden\u2019s position on fracking before, so we know he has not called for banning the practice entirely. He wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public lands but would allow existing fracking operations to continue.", "The Biden campaign also noted in an email that 90 percent of fracking takes place on private land.", "Biden\u2019s position on fracking became muddled earlier this year when he misspoke during a March debate with Bernie Sanders, his last opponent standing in the Democratic primary.", "Here\u2019s an excerpt of their exchange:", "\"I\u2019m talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,\" Sanders said. \"I\u2019m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet \u2014 no ifs, buts, and maybes about it.\"", "\"So am I,\" Biden replied.", "\"Well, I\u2019m not sure your proposal does that,\" Sanders said.", "\"No more \u2014 no new fracking,\" Biden said.", "Biden seemed to be saying he wanted to ban fracking \u2014 a sharp departure from his official position. And the former vice president\u2019s opponents pounced.", "Republican operatives quickly cut a short video of Biden\u2019s remarks to use as a cudgel in races against moderate House Democrats, the Washington Post reported. And Sanders supporters accused Biden of misleading voters about his policy, which wouldn\u2019t ban fracking, like Sanders wanted to do.", "The Biden campaign retracted his remarks the night of the debate, but that hasn\u2019t stopped conservative media outlets from inaccurately reporting that Biden supports a total ban on fracking.", "Biden said he\u2019s \"not banning fracking\" if he wins in November. To ban means to prohibit, and Biden doesn\u2019t want to prohibit fracking entirely. He would allow existing fracking\u00a0 to continue. Biden does, however, want to stop issuing new permits for fracking on public lands, and he left that part out of his speech in Pittsburgh. Biden\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification.
