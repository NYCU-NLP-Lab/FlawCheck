["About this rating", "On 17 November 2016, the disreputable web site Conservative Daily Post published an article reporting that people protesting Donald Trump's presidency were now being charged with terrorism under a new law:", "The Conservative Daily Post has a history of severely misrepresenting real events. For instance, they claimed that Donald Trump's first act as president would be to make flag burning a \"treasonous act\" (he merely said he thought it should be illegal), and that Loretta Lynch ordered for all confederate flag tattoos to be immediately removed (this claim was based on a 2016 report about a hate crime which mentioned a Confederate flag tattoo).", "In this case, the \"real event\" is that Republican Senator Doug Ericksen said in a news release in November 2016 that he planned on proposing a bill that would classify some forms of protesting as \"economic terrorism.\" Ericksen said that the bill would target protests that disrupt businesses or shut down streets:", "Washington State Sen. Doug Ericksen said Wednesday he is preparing a bill that would create a new crime of \"economic terrorism\" that would allow felony prosecution of protesters who block streets, cause property damage, threaten jobs and put public safety at risk.", "\u201cI respect the right to protest, but when it endangers people\u2019s lives and property, it goes too far,\u201d the Republican said in a news release. \u201cFear, intimidation and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression.

In reality, however, a lawmaker announced that he was planning to propose a bill that would classify some forms of protest as \"economic terrorism.\"", "While Ericksen's proposed bill is a long way away from becoming a law, the American Civil Liberties Union is still worried about its implications:", "Doug Honig, of the ACLU of Washington, said in reaction: \u00a0\u201cThe statement throws out a lot of broad rhetoric, and we\u2019ll need to see an actual bill. \u00a0But we\u2019re already concerned that some of its loose terms \u00a0appear to be targeting \u00a0civil disobedience as 'terrorism.' \u00a0That\u2019s the kind of excessive approach to peaceful protest that our country and state do not need.\"", "\"Let\u2019s keep in mind that civil rights protesters who sat down at lunch counters could be seen as 'disrupting business' and 'obstructing economic activity,' and their courageous actions were opposed by segregationists as trying to 'coerce business and government.'\"", "While it is true that a Republican senator announced that he was planning to propose a bill which would classify some forms of protest as \"economic terrorism,\" no new laws were passed in November 2016 to begin charging people protesting Trump's presidency with terrorism.", "\"Republican lawmaker proposes creating new crime of \u2018economic terrorism\u2019 aimed at protesters.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Fox 6 Now. \u00a0 17 November 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
