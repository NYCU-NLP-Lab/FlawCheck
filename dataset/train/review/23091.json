["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on October 14, 2020", "At campaign rallies and in tweets, President Donald Trump falsely said the World Health Organization changed its position and \u201cadmitted that Donald Trump was right\u201d about lockdowns. But the agency has said no such thing.", "The president first made the inaccurate claim in a tweet just before the start of an Oct. 12 rally in Sanford, Florida.", "The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2020", "At the rally, Trump echoed that sentiment after stating that former Vice President Joe Biden would institute a lockdown if elected president.", "Trump, Oct. 12: Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate Florida\u2019s economy with the draconian unscientific lockdown. That\u2019s what he wants to do, lock it down. Lock it down, everybody. \u2026", "But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago and they admitted that Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states where they\u2019re locked out, sealed up, suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, death by so many different forms.", "We\u2019ve previously explained that Biden said in an Aug. 21 interview with ABC News that he would shut down the country if that\u2019s what scientists advised. He has since emphasized that he doesn\u2019t think a lockdown would be necessary.", "A day after the Florida rally, Trump repeated the claim in a tweet attacking National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2014 who has pushed back against a Trump television ad that Fauci said took his words \u201cout of context.\u201d", "\u201cWHO no longer likes Lockdowns \u2013 just came out against. Trump was right,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe saved 2,000,000 USA lives!!!\u201d", "In another rally that night in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the president again said that the WHO \u201csaid Trump was right\u201d and boasted about having saved 2 million lives.", "The Trump campaign told us that the president was referencing statements recently made by WHO officials and directed us to two news articles highlighting comments by Dr. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme, and David Nabarro, one of the WHO\u2019s special envoys on COVID-19.", "In one of the articles cited by the campaign, Ryan was quoted as saying this during an Oct. 9 press briefing: \u201cWhat we want to try and avoid \u2014 and sometimes it\u2019s unavoidable, we accept that, but what we want to try and avoid are these massive lockdowns that are so punishing to communities, to societies and everything else.\u201d", "Nabarro\u2019s remarks came from an Oct. 8 interview with the British magazine The Spectator. While Nabarro spoke at length, news outlets focused on his plea to world leaders to \u201cstop using lockdown as your primary control method.\u201d", "But Trump\u2019s description of their remarks is inaccurate and incomplete. Neither man mentioned Trump or the U.S., and the WHO told us that its position on lockdowns has not changed \u2014 it has never recommended them as the primary strategy to control the virus, but recognizes that in some cases they may be needed.", "Trump also incorrectly suggested that \u201cDemocrat-run states\u201d are currently in lockdown, when no state is shut down the way many were in the spring.", "Confusingly, Trump simultaneously claimed that 2 million American lives were saved \u2014 a dubious estimate \u2014 even though the stay-at-home orders most states issued this spring likely limited the number of COVID-19 deaths.", "While Trump\u2019s takeaway from Ryan and Nabarro\u2019s comments was that the WHO was reversing itself, that\u2019s an inaccurate interpretation.", "\u201cWHO has never advocated for national lockdowns as a primary means for controlling the virus. Dr Nabarro was repeating our advice to governments to \u2018do it all,\u2019\u201d the agency\u2019s press office told us in an email.", "\u201cGovernments, employers, communities should apply a package of proven public health measures that we know are effective for preventing transmission, including hand and respiratory hygiene, physical distancing, mask wearing, staying home if you\u2019re sick, etc. as well as having robust systems for testing, isolating, tracing and quarantining, etc.,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cMeasures to control COVID-19 depend on local risk assessments. Movement restrictions may be among a range of measures that governments can consider in certain geographical areas.\u201d", "\u201cIf clusters and outbreaks do appear, they should be slowed and then suppressed promptly and that is why localised and targeted movement restrictions, implemented jointly by local actors and national authorities, are needed from time to time,\u201d the press office added.", "Nabarro\u2019s statements in the interview are entirely consistent with that assessment. He explained that the WHO backed a \u201cmiddle way\u201d strategy involving a robust testing, contact tracing and isolation system, along with getting the public on board with physical distancing, wearing masks and other similar measures.", "\u201cIf we can combine those various steps, what we call \u2018doing it all,\u2019 in our organization\u2019s speak, then we can get on top of it,\u201d he said, noting that that is exactly what many East Asian countries have done, along with Germany and parts of Canada.", "\u201cWe think lockdowns only serve one purpose, and that is to give you a bit of breathing space to stop everything,\u201d Nabarro said. \u201cThe virus stops moving, and while you\u2019ve got that breathing space, you should really be building up your testing, building up your contact tracing, building up your local organization.\u201d", "Later, he emphasized that point again, saying, \u201cWe in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as a primary means of control of this virus. The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted.\u201d", "In an Oct. 13 Twitter thread, the agency also iterated its position, noting that lockdowns were not ideal, but might be necessary.", "\u201cWe understand that sometimes such measures \u2013 although not sustainable \u2013 are needed to swiftly suppress the virus and avoid health systems being overwhelmed,\u201d the WHO said. \u201cLockdowns are not sustainable solutions because of their significant economic, social & broader health impacts. However, during the #COVID19 pandemic there\u2019ve been times when restrictions were necessary and there may be other times in the future.\u201d", "Related to Trump\u2019s claim about the WHO is the idea that certain states \u2014 namely, Democratic states \u2014 are in lockdown and should reopen. But that\u2019s a straw man argument, as no state is still under a highly restrictive stay-at-home order.", "According to a New York Times tracker, many states still have some kind of restriction in place, such as closures or capacity limits on certain businesses, most commonly restaurants and bars or entertainment venues and cinemas that are at higher risk for spreading the virus.", "These limits, however, are quite different from the more stringent orders 42 states and territories implemented in March through May, which frequently involved closing all nonessential businesses and required people to stay at home unless they were out for an essential activity.", "Previously, the president has inaccurately said that Michigan is \u201cclosed,\u201d as we\u2019ve written, even though the governor lifted the state\u2019s stay-at-home order on June 1.", "As for New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced new temporary restrictions for specific hotspot areas on Oct. 6, but this doesn\u2019t mean the entire state is under a lockdown. Only six portions of five counties, which are concentrated in the New York City area, are affected.", "In the worst-off areas in New York, identified as \u201cred zones,\u201d only essential businesses can remain open; dining is limited to takeout only; in-person schools are closed; and there\u2019s a capacity limit for houses of worship.", "The targeted approach, which the state developed with public health experts, is consistent with the WHO\u2019s advice to keep movement restrictions localized.", "At the same time Trump is disparaging lockdowns in his tweets and rallies, he also mentions that 2 million American lives were saved \u2014 an odd feature to highlight, since state-issued stay-at-home orders likely helped avoid COVID-19 deaths.", "\u201cWe saved 2 million lives,\u201d Trump said during his Johnstown rally. \u201cThey said 2.2 million people, we saved 2 million lives and you know we get nothing.\u201d", "As of Oct. 14, more than 216,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, according to the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 tracker \u2014 although the true death toll is almost certainly\u00a0higher.", "We\u2019ve explained before that an early model from Imperial College London projected in March that the U.S. could lose 2.2 million people to the pandemic. But that high death toll assumed no mitigation measures were used at all \u2014 and that people also wouldn\u2019t modify their behavior.", "In other words, it\u2019s not necessarily a realistic benchmark against which to measure the administration\u2019s success.", "Research does support the idea that lockdowns \u2014 which were instituted by states, not Trump \u2014 saved lives earlier this year, although it\u2019s hard to say how many.", "A paper published in the journal Nature concluded that lockdowns prevented some 60 million infections in the U.S., but didn\u2019t venture a guess as to how many deaths were averted.", "Similarly, Columbia University researchers estimated that if the U.S. had implemented social distancing one week earlier in March, 36,000 fewer people would have died.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
