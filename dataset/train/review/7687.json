["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on June 7, 2016", "Donald Trump falsely claimed Iran is \u201ctaking over the oil\u201d in Iraq. Experts told us Iran does not control any Iraqi oil fields, and we could find no evidence of it.", "In fact, despite its political instability, Iraq produced and exported a record amount of crude oil last year, and it has\u00a0reclaimed\u00a0smaller oil fields in northern Iraq that had been taken by the terrorist Islamic State group, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS.", "\u201cIraq\u2019s oil is still the property of the people of Iraq,\u201d said Jim Krane, a fellow at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University who is an expert in geopolitical aspects of energy.", "Trump spoke about Iraq on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d where he once again claimed without evidence that he opposed the Iraq war before it started because he felt it would destabilize the Middle East. \u201cI was against it from before it started,\u201d Trump said.", "As we\u2019ve written, there is no public record of his opposition before the war started March 19, 2003. In fact, Trump is on record as giving a halfhearted endorsement for going to war with Iraq six months before it started. (\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d he said when asked by radio personality Howard Stern.) Our timeline of Trump\u2019s comments on the war show he was an early critic once the war started, but on the grounds that it was financially wasteful \u2014 not because it would upset the balance of power in the Middle East.", "Anchor Jake Tapper challenged Trump to produce the evidence of his pre-war opposition. Trump responded by saying, \u201cI think there is evidence. I will see if I can get it.\u201d", "It was in this context that Trump made his claim that Iran is \u201ctaking over the oil\u201d in Iraq.", "Trump, June 5:\u00a0So, I was against the war a long time ago, and it destabilized the Middle East. And that\u2019s exactly what I said was going to happen.\u00a0I also said Iran will take over Iraq, because we ruined the balance of those two militarily. We destroyed \u2014 we knocked out one of the two balancing prongs. And Iran is taking \u2014 as sure as you\u2019re sitting there, Iran is taking over Iraq. They\u2019re taking over the oil. They\u2019re taking over everything.", "Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond when we asked it to explain Trump\u2019s comments. It may be that he was talking about what may happen in the future, but Trump used the present tense that \u201cIran is taking over Iraq\u201d and that \u201cthey\u2019re taking over the oil\u201d \u2014 and none of that is happening, experts tell us.", "We reached out to Middle East experts to ask about Iran-Iraq relations in general and Iraqi oil.", "In general,\u00a0Ken Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Middle East Policy, told us Trump\u2019s comments that \u201cIran is taking over Iraq\u201d are \u201cexaggerated by any measure.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that Iran\u2019s influence increased \u201cdramatically\u201d in 2014 when \u201cIran rushed in to help defend Baghdad\u201d from ISIS, Pollack said, as\u00a0Iran-backed militias\u00a0took the lead in that fight.", "\u201cAll across Baghdad you saw billboards thanking Iran, thanking Ayatollah Khamenei and thanking the Revolutionary Guards,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cAnd in that period, Iran was the most influential power in Iraq by far, but even then it was limited.\u201d", "However, Iran\u2019s influence has begun to wane more recently as the U.S. has reasserted itself in Iraq, Pollack said.", "\u201cIn recent months, Iran\u2019s influence has diminished again pretty noticeably, and American influence has rebounded because the military aid being provided by the United States is having a much greater impact on the battlefield than that provided by Iran and because the U.S. is now helping Iraq secure billions of dollars in loans and desperately needed financial aid to help them deal with their budget crisis,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cSo paradoxically, Trump\u2019s statement comes when U.S. influence in Iraq was once again rising, at the expense of Iranian influence, although neither side truly controls Iraq.\u201d", "The concern, as expressed in a Jan. 8 article in The Telegraph, is that the Iranian-backed militias fighting ISIS in Iraq could attempt to take control of Iraq if and when ISIS is defeated.", "Martin E. Dempsey, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in March 2015 that \u201cthe activities of the Iranians to support the Iraqi Security Forces is a positive thing\u201d if it does not worsen sectarian tensions. \u201cBut we are all concerned about what happens after the drums stop beating and ISIL is defeated, and whether the government of Iraq will remain on a path to provide an inclusive government for all of the various groups within it,\u201d Dempsey said.", "Pollack said that \u201cwould be disastrous\u201d if \u00a0the Iranian-backed militias fighting ISIS in Iraq could attempt to take control of Iraq if and when ISIS is defeated. \u201cBut we are still a long way from that,\u201d he said.", "As for now, Pollack said he doesn\u2019t know what Trump is talking about when the presumptive Republican presidential nominee says Iran is \u201ctaking over the oil\u201d from Iraq.", "\u201cIran is not taking over any Iraqi oil fields,\u201d Pollack wrote to us in an email. \u201cIf it means that Iran has its personnel there running them, then NO. If it means they are taking the oil and selling [it] themselves, then again, NO. None of that is happening.\u201d", "Krane, of Rice University, agreed that the current instability in Iraq doesn\u2019t mean that Iran is \u201ctaking over the oil\u201d in Iraq, as Trump claimed.", "\u201cThe fact that there is Iranian influence in neighboring Iraq is a long way from Iranian control over the Iraqi oil sector,\u201d Krane said.", "The country has contracts with international oil firms \u2014 mostly big-name companies such as Shell, BP and Gazprom \u2014 to maintain and operate the oil fields, Krane said. And it has been successful.\u00a0Iraq last year set a record for oil production and exports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.", "Krane said he is not even aware of any Iranian companies working in Iraqi oil production.", "\u201cIraq\u2019s oil is still the property of the people of Iraq. It is produced by Iraqi and international firms, often under production sharing agreements,\u201d Krane said. \u201cTo my knowledge, there are no Iranian firms directly involved in Iraqi oil production. It is possible that Iran-based contractors are working in the Iraqi energy sector, but if they did, they would be in minor roles alongside firms from many other countries including the United States.\u201d", "Madeleine Moreau, a senior analyst for Global Risk Insights who specializes in investment risk in the Middle East, recalled that for a few days in December 2009 \u201cIran briefly occupied the Fakka oil field in Maysan province,\u201d in southeastern Iraq. But, she said, Iran was \u201cforced to back off because it angered a strong contingent of Iraq\u2019s population.\u201d", "Moreau said she knows of no \u201chard evidence\u201d that Iran has any control of Iraqi oil \u2014 not even after the Iran-backed militias helped Iraq last fall to\u00a0recapture the Baiji oil field north of Baghdad.", "\u201cMoving forward, I would argue that the recent high oil production rates in Iraq, likely at Iran\u2019s expense, has the potential to heighten tensions between the two countries in the longer run,\u201d Moreau said. \u201cBut for now, I think Iran\u2019s \u2018priorities of influence\u2019 in Iraq is current military operations to recapture ISIL-held territories and the current political situation.\u201d", "Trump would be right to say that Iran has influence in Iraq, and he is free to express his opinion that Iran may attempt to take control of Iraq in the future. But there\u2019s no evidence that Iran is \u201ctaking over the oil\u201d in Iraq.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2ef2e495-d2ec-434f-800a-6e4dda185dad", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
