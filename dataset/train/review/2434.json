Mike Rogers, R-Ala., introduced the Border Wall Funding Act of 2017 to levy a 2 percent fee on money sent by individuals in the United States to recipients in nations \"south of the U.S. border,\" funds known as remittances.", "\"This bill is simple \u2013 anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall,\" Rogers said in a March 30 press release.", "He added some large numbers about remittances to bolster his\u00a0case.", "\"Remittances, or wire transfers, are commonly used by illegal immigrants to move money from the U.S. to their home countries,\" Rogers said. \"In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the U.S., while other South and Central American countries received over 15 percent of their GDPs in the form of remittances.\"", "Remittances serve as a source of income for migrants\u2019 families who generally use the money to pay for housing, food and other living expenses.", "To an extent, Rogers\u2019 two-fold statement is backed by data.
