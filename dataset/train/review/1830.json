Several videos showed what appeared to be law enforcement officers slashing these tires, and posts on social media indicated that tires on most if not all of the cars in this lot were slashed. Video also showed law enforcement officers slashing tires parked on a street the next day.", "These events, featured in a story in Mother Jones magazine, were well-documented, in part because numerous journalists and news producers were among those whose tires were slashed. This included Star Tribune reporter Chris Serres, New Yorker reporter Luke Mogelson, WCCO news anchor Jeff Wagner, Radio Canada reporter Philippe Leblanc, and Los Angeles television producer Andrew Kimmel. Speaking of the parking lot when he returned to his car, Kimmel said that \u201cevery tire on my rental car\u201d had been slashed \u201cas well as every tire of every car in this parking lot.\u201d Serres told the Star Tribune that, \u201cAs far as I could see, it looked like all their tires had been slashed.\u201d", "As videos of these events emerged, so too did denials. These came from various law enforcement agencies including the Minneapolis Police Department, the Hennepin County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and the National Guard.", "On June 8, however, two law enforcement agencies confirmed to the Star Tribune that they had punctured the tires: the Minnesota State Patrol and the Anoka County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Department of Public Safety spokesman Bruce Gordon, whose department oversees the State Patrol, confirmed to the Star Tribune that troopers cut tires in \u201ca few locations\u201d:", "\u201cState Patrol troopers strategically deflated tires ... in order to stop behaviors such as vehicles driving dangerously and at high speeds in and around protesters and law enforcement,\u201d Gordon said.", "Gordon said the patrol also targeted vehicles \u201cthat contained items used to cause harm during violent protests\u201d such as rocks, concrete and sticks.", "\u201cWhile not a typical tactic, vehicles were being used as dangerous weapons and inhibited our ability to clear areas and keep areas safe where violent protests were occurring,\u201d he said. \u2026 Deputies from Anoka County followed state orders and joined the patrol and also cut the tires on vehicles on Washington Avenue, said Anoka County Sheriff\u2019s Lt. Andy Knotz.", "By email, Snopes sent a detailed list of questions to Gordon requesting further clarification on a range of issues, including the apparent disconnect behind the idea of cutting tires when threatening objects were allegedly located inside, and the video or firsthand accounts indicating that every car in the Kmart parking lot had their tires slashed. We asked what purpose slashing tires would serve in cases where dangerous objects had been located, if any of the cars located in the Kmart lot contained dangerous items, and if any arrests had been made or charges brought against any of the individuals whose tires had been slashed. In response, we were sent what appears to have been, in effect, the same statement on which we were seeking clarification. Our response to that email has not been returned at the time of this reporting.", "In sum, we do not know what specific order these officers were following, but the law enforcement agencies the officers work for \u2014 the Minnesota State Patrol and the Anoka County Sheriff\u2019s Department \u2014 confirmed that the actions did take place. As such, the videos authentically show actions taken by Minnesota law enforcement officers during George Floyd protests in late May 2020.", "Lurie, Julia. \u00a0 \u201cVideos Show Cops Slashing Car Tires at Protests in Minneapolis.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Mother Jones. \u00a0 6 June 2020.", "Walsh, Paul. \u00a0 \"Officers Slashed Tires on Vehicles Parked Amid Minneapolis Protests, Unrest.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Minneapolis Star Tribune. \u00a0 8 June 2020.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
