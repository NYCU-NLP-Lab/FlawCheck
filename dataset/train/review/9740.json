["About this rating", "On 7 December 2016, the Facebook page \"American President Donald J. Trump\" shared a video claiming that it shows a\u00a0Muslim man slapping a Christian woman\"", "Muslim man slaps a Christian female teacher at school when his girl says there's blasphemy in classroom. Other men just watch.", "The incident shown in this video (a higher quality version is included below) is real, but this footage has nothing to do with Islam and little to do with Christianity.", "This video has been online since at least 2014, when it was posted to the web site LiveLeak.  It shows Alexander Shevtsov, the leader of what is apparently a Russian cult. There are several videos of Shevtsov leading his \"classes\" in which he hits his students on a regular basis:", "While the exact context of this footage is still unclear, it appears that the incident took place during one of Shevtsov\u2019s lectures at his \"Academy of Self-Knowledge.\" The program, according to aplinkkeliai.lt, is a mixture of magic, martial arts, psychology, and includes a \"cleansing of the soul\" (similar to an exorcism) which may be what is depicted above:", "In many cases it borders on the folk magic rites. A special role is assigned to boasting as a means to set an ideal goal and stimulate spiritual concentration need for achieving it.", "Kresenie is essentially \u201cburning out\u201d (dulit, \u0434\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c) of evil influences which infected the soul from outside, or, simply speaking, possession (oderzhanie, \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435). These influences, or porcha, as well as various auto-generated obstacles (gamukha, \u0433\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0445\u0430) must be \u201cburnt\u201d just like the litter in Russian peasant\u2019s house had to be burnt in the oven.
