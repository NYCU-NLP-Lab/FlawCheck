Bloomberg had opposed higher taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers since at least 2009.", "But Bloomberg spokesman Stu Loeser said that overlooks what Bloomberg did when he first became mayor in 2002.", "\"Mike\u2019s response comes in the context of having drastically raised taxes on wealthy New Yorkers, both personal income tax and property taxes,\" Loeser said.", "New York City has an income tax and rates on the wealthiest varied but ended up higher during Bloomberg\u2019s stint as mayor from 2002 to 2013. A report from the city\u2019s Office of Management and Budget shows that people making over $500,000 a year saw their tax rate go from 3.648% in 2002, to 4.45% in 2003 through 2005.

He would argue that if you needed to raise revenues, do it another way.\"", "Doulis also said that tax policy at the city level is quite different from tax policy at the national level.", "In a December 2012 op-ed, Bloomberg argued for a grand deal to begin to dial down the nation\u2019s deficits.", "Unlike his stand on taxes in New York City, this concerned the entire country, and as part of a package deal, Bloomberg voiced support for higher taxes on well-to-do Americans.", "\"There have been signs that Congress and the White House are beginning to move toward an agreement that would include modest tax increases and spending cuts, as well as a commitment to enact broader-based tax and entitlement reforms in 2013,\" Bloomberg wrote. \"While the tax revenue and entitlement cuts being discussed are both less than what I and many others believe are necessary to maximize long-term growth, the specifics of the deal are to some extent less important than the act of getting one.\"", "The context here was deficit negotiations between President Barack Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner.

Bloomberg said the majority of the money \"is going to come from the wealthy.\" And then he added, \"you have to do it with meaningful cuts done in a time frame that is believable.\"", "The constant theme is that when Bloomberg talked about cutting Medicare and Social Security it was in the context of deficit reduction. And his plan for the deficit included tax hikes. To be sure, if he had his way, those increases would fall on both middle class and wealthy families, but he wouldn\u2019t exempt the wealthy.
