["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on July 17, 2016", "Donald Trump introduced Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate July 16, but, in doing so, oversold Indiana\u2019s economic performance under Pence:", "As the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump introduced his running mate to voters at a July 16 campaign event in New York. Pence has been Indiana\u2019s governor since Jan. 14, 2013, and the economy in Indiana, and elsewhere in the country, has improved since then, as the country slowly recovered from the Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009.", "At the event, Trump read from a list of Indiana\u2019s economic statistics, which his campaign later emailed to the media. (He starts speaking about Pence at 20 minutes into the C-Span video.) The statistics he cited were accurate. But, in some cases, the businessman embellished the stats with his commentary.", "Trump said the \u201cprimary reason\u201d for selecting Pence was the decline in his state\u2019s unemployment rate, which Trump said dropped to \u201cless than 5 percent\u201d this year. That\u2019s close to accurate.\u00a0As of May, the state\u2019s rate was 5 percent \u2014 down from 8.4 percent in January 2013, when Pence became governor, as Trump said.\u00a0That\u2019s a drop of 3.4 percentage points, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "However, Indiana\u2019s unemployment rate has roughly tracked the national average. During that same time, the national unemployment rate declined from 8 percent to 4.7 percent \u2014 a drop of 3.3 percentage points, according to BLS.", "Trump also praised Pence for adding private sector jobs. \u201cPrivate sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s, like, very unusual.\u201d", "It\u2019s not unusual at all.", "Indiana has added 147,800 jobs since 2013, according to BLS. But 18 other states added more jobs. Predictably, larger states such as California (1.3 million) and Texas (840,000) had larger gains, but so did states with smaller populations, such as South Carolina (152,000) and Oregon (157,000).", "More importantly, Indiana\u2019s private-sector job growth rate \u2014 the percent change in the state\u2019s number of private-sector jobs \u2014 lagged behind 20 states and the District of Columbia, according to our analysis of BLS data.", "Indiana\u2019s job growth rate was 5.9 percent. Florida led the way with a 12.7 percent increase, followed by Utah (12.4 percent) and Oregon (11.5 percent).", "Trump also praised Pence for balancing the state budget, suggesting that it was unusual. But it is not at all unusual at the state level because of constitutional and legal requirements.", "Trump, July 16:\u00a0Governor Pence balanced the budget \u2014 can you imagine a balanced budget? Our budget is so out of whack in this country we don\u2019t know what we are doing. We\u2019re going to owe very soon $21 trillion dollars. He balanced the budget. They don\u2019t know what that means.", "Like nearly all states, Indiana is legally required to balance the budget. \u201cAll the states except Vermont have a legal requirement of a balanced budget,\u201d according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.", "Trump also touted Indiana\u2019s bond rating. \u201cIt\u2019s also rated triple A \u2014 their bonds, are rated triple A. Very few states have that,\u201d Trump said.", "Indiana does have a AAA bond rating, but that has been the case since July 18, 2008, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s latest \u201cHistory of U.S. State Ratings.\u201d That\u2019s nearly five years before Pence took office.", "As of July 11, 2016, 14 other states currently have AAA ratings, so Trump exaggerates when he says that \u201cvery few states have that.\u201d They are:\u00a0Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming. That\u2019s nearly\u00a0one third of all states.", "Trump correctly said that Indiana\u2019s labor force has increased by more than\u00a0186,000 people under Pence. But then he suggested that it was unusual for a state to see an increase in its labor force, based on his experience campaigning in other states.", "Trump, July 16:\u00a0Since January 2013, Indiana\u2019s labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs. You have to understand I\u2019ve gone around to all these states \u2014 I\u2019ve gone to all of them \u2014 and every time I have statisticians, and I say, \u201cGive me the stats on a state,\u201d and it\u2019s always bad. Down, down, down. Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases. Here\u2019s somebody where it\u2019s gone up.", "Indiana has seen an above average increase in its labor force. The addition of 186,527 people in the state\u2019s labor force since January 2013 represents a 5.9 percent increase, according to BLS. Our analysis shows that only six states and the District of Columbia have seen greater growth rates, with Delaware (8.9 percent) leading the way.", "However, to imply that no other state has seen an increase \u2014 or that they have seen steep decreases \u2014 is wrong.", "A total of 41 states and the District of Columbia have all seen increases in their labor force. Nine states have seen decreases. They are\u00a0Virginia, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Alaska, Vermont, Wyoming, West Virginia, Maine and Kentucky.", "Trump is hardly the first to overstate economic achievements. We have written numerous such stories over the years. He is just the latest to do so.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5137a5c6-73e3-4c9a-ae1c-6b3695619494", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
