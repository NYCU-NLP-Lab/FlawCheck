["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on November 21, 2018", "Q: Was \u201cvoter fraud\u201d responsible for Democratic wins in Orange County, California?", "A: There have been no credible complaints of voter fraud in Orange County following the midterm elections.", "The traditionally Republican stronghold of Orange County, California helped to elect seven Democrats to Congress in the Nov. 6 midterm elections.", "That shift has prompted writers across the political spectrum to publish\u00a0thoughtful analytical\u00a0pieces examining the forces that attributed to the change. One bogus story, however, claimed that the outcome was due to voter fraud, and it has been shared on social media with a combined 3.8 million followers.", "That story, posted on the conservative site Gateway Pundit, proclaimed in its headline: \u201cVOTER FRAUD: Orange County Numbers DON\u2019T ADD UP \u2013 Democrats Had 300,000 More Votes for Congressional Seats than for Governor.\u201d", "But it offered no evidence to support the claim of voter fraud and incorrectly calculated the vote totals.", "The story claims:", "Gateway Pundit, Nov. 19: 300,000 (299,931) more Democrats voted for the Democrats in the Orange County Congressional races than voted for Democrat Gavin Newsom for governor.", "This screams of voter fraud.", "And Republican John Cox beat Newsome [sic] by 12,000 votes in Orange County.", "This makes no sense and points to fraud.", "The story reaches that conclusion by adding up the number of votes cast for the Democratic congressional candidates in six districts within Orange County and subtracting the number of votes cast in the county for Newsom, the Democratic candidate for governor.", "But there are a few things wrong there:", "For example, the 49th Congressional District lies mostly in San Diego County with only part of the district in Orange County. In that district, Orange County voters cast 31,958\u00a0ballots for Democrat Mike Levin out of a districtwide total of 150,536\u00a0ballots for Levin. Although Levin won the district, his Republican opponent, Diane Harkey, got more votes in Orange County. Harkey received\u00a036,978\u00a0votes in the county.", "Counting only the votes cast by Orange County voters for Democratic congressional candidates (including the 38th District), the difference between that total and the number of votes cast for Newsom is 37,027, not 300,000, as of Nov. 21.", "That means that 37,027 people may have split their votes between parties, if they voted in both the congressional and gubernatorial races.", "Gateway Pundit later updated its story, changing the headline and adding county vote tallies, too. But, the story says, \u201cThis (still) screams of voter fraud,\u201d without offering any evidence to support the fraud claim.", "Neal Kelley, the registrar of voters for Orange County, didn\u2019t see anything suspect in the numbers. About a third of the county\u2019s voters aren\u2019t registered with a party, he said in an interview with FactCheck.org, and those voters frequently split their votes between parties. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing doesn\u2019t surprise me at all,\u201d he said.", "Kelley also said that none of the complaints of potential voter fraud that his office has investigated have resulted in a legitimate case.", "Stuart Rothenberg, a senior editor at Inside Elections and a nonpartisan political observer, offered another explanation for the split ballots in an interview with FactCheck.org. Voters see congressional midterm elections as a referendum on the sitting president, he said, and \u201celecting a governor is a completely different matter.\u201d", "Also, Rothenberg said, college-educated white suburban women moved substantially away from supporting Republican candidates for federal office in the midterms. \u201cThose are the demographics in Orange County,\u201d he said, adding that those voters might well maintain support for Republican candidates in state or local elections.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Orange County. Unofficial results. 6 Nov 2018.", "Hoft, Jim. \u201cVOTER FRAUD: Orange County Numbers DON\u2019T ADD UP \u2013 Democrats Had 300,000 More Votes for Congressional Seats than for Governor.\u201d TheGatewayPundit.com. 19 Nov 2018.", "Orange County.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
