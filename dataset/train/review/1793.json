Trump cast the Russian land grab essentially as a done deal.", "But Kennedy said the Ukrainian response went beyond a few officials. He said the Ukrainian anti-Trump effort came from the very top.", "\"Russia was very aggressive, and they're much more sophisticated,\" Kennedy told NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd Dec. 1. \"But the fact that Russia was so aggressive does not exclude the fact that (former) President Poroshenko actively worked for Secretary Clinton.\"", "Todd pushed back, noting the only person pushing that theory is Russian President Vladimir Putin.", "\"Wait a minute, Senator Kennedy, you now have the president of Ukraine saying he actively worked for the Democratic nominee for president,\" Todd said. \"I mean, now come on.\"", "Kennedy invited Todd to read news reports, especially articles from The Economist magazine.", "\"Do you believe The Economist magazine is a reputable journal?\" Kennedy said. \"It's been around, I think, since 1843.\"", "Kennedy\u2019s office sent us a list of eight articles to support Kennedy\u2019s claim.", "None of them back him up.", "Given Kennedy\u2019s focus on the work of The Economist, it\u2019s noteworthy that little in The Economist\u2019s coverage matches Kennedy\u2019s words.", "An Oct. 12 article about the U.S.-Ukraine relationship and corruption in Ukraine said, \"President (Poroshenko), who had favoured Hillary Clinton in the American elections of 2016, was keen to patch things up with Mr. Trump.\"", "The rest of the article does the Republicans no favors, laying out the political work of Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort in Ukraine, and corruption under the previous president.", "\"We are a bit puzzled by Sen.

In the campaign, Trump often talked about building closer ties to Russia, and warned at rallies that undoing Russia\u2019s hold on Crimea could trigger World War III.", "\"Mr. Poroshenko did not make his feelings secret in Ukraine,\" Prideaux said. \"But nor did he direct any government agencies to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, which is what Mr. Putin did.\"", "Kennedy mentioned The Economist three times in his interview, but he also listed other news organizations.", "\"It's been well documented in the Financial Times, in Politico, in The Economist, in the Washington Examiner, even on CBS, that the prime minister of Ukraine, the interior minister, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, the head of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption League, all meddled in the election on social media and otherwise,\" he said.", "None of those stories put Poroshenko at the heart of a plan to interfere in the U.S. election.", "They do paint a picture of leaders fearful of Russia and of Trump\u2019s comments that took a more conciliatory stance on Russian aggression.", "The Financial Times focused on Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko, who revealed over $12 million in secret payments to Manafort from Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russia party.

Republicans frequently mention that article. We vetted it and found that the GOP has used its findings selectively.", "RELATED: The Politico story at the center of a Ukraine conspiracy", "The article specifically said there was little evidence of a top-down effort in Ukraine.", "The Washington Examiner published many opinion and analysis pieces that put Ukrainians\u2019 actions in a dark light, but its straight reporting pieces tracked with the accounts in other publications.", "Kennedy\u2019s office also cited Daily Beast and New York Times reports of a 2018 court ruling that the disclosure of payments to Manafort represented \"meddling\" in the American election.
