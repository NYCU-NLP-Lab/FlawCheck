They provided proof of transaction by posting a photograph of the family\u2019s passbook. The entire process was handled electronically with funds being transferred directly from Ketto into the account of the victims\u2019 families.", "Here are 3 screenshots of the #Kathua funds transferred.

I have heard nothing from the family. I also tried to find out from my colleagues in the area whether there were any complaints that the funds were not made available to the family, but I heard nothing of the sort.
