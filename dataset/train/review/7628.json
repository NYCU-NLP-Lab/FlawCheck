Instead, the funds will come from military construction projects across the United States and abroad.", "Trump gained access to those funds after declaring a national emergency at the southern border. Congress has voted twice \u2014 first in March and then in late September \u2014 to block the emergency declaration. But both times, Democrats were unable to secure a two-thirds majority and Trump vetoed the measures.", "After the most recent vote, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee called out Tillis, who voted against blocking the president\u2019s emergency declaration.", "The DSCC\u2019s tweet said, \"Thom Tillis yet again voted to support Trump\u2019s irresponsible emergency declaration \u2014 even though he knows it will allow the administration to raid $80 million from North Carolina. Tillis\u2019 vote is putting military communities in harm\u2019s way.\"", "We wondered if it\u2019s true that Tillis supported the emergency declaration and whether North Carolina actually stands to lose $80 million.", "Trump used the National Emergencies Act to secure border wall funding", "During the 2016 campaign, President Trump promised to build a wall on the southern border and have Mexico pay for it. When Congress reached a stalemate over funding border security, Trump decided to act on his own. He declared a national emergency at the southern border, an initial step toward building the wall.", "He acted under the National Emergencies Act, which authorizes the administration to \"undertake military construction projects \u2026 not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.\"", "The move angered some members of Congress who believed that Trump was abusing the National Emergencies Act. Tillis even wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post that said the emergency declaration \"was not the right answer.\"", "But when Congress voted to overturn the emergency declaration in March, Tillis sided with Trump. He voted to uphold the president\u2019s action both times. (The reversal earned Tillis a Full Flop on PolitiFact\u2019s Flip-O-Meter.)", "On the Senate floor, he explained that he did not take issue with Trump\u2019s action, but instead was concerned that the National Emergencies Act gives future presidents too much power.", "\"My main concern with this executive action is future potential abuses. I have a concern with the executive action that the president took, the emergency order. That\u2019s why I voiced it,\" Tillis said. \"But I\u2019m sympathetic to what he was trying to do \u2026 and I thought we could view this as an opportunity to where maybe we could have a discussion about the National Emergencies Act and potentially make a real difference here.\"", "Tillis is a co-sponsor of the Article One Act, which was introduced days before the March vote and would automatically end emergency declarations after 30 days. The measure has stalled in the Senate since then.", "But in the meantime, Tillis is supporting Trump\u2019s decision to divert funding from military bases around the world. The National Emergencies Act requires the money for the wall come from other military construction projects that have been appropriated, but not obligated, by Congress. That means the administration has to take money from dozens of projects, such as a fire and crash rescue station at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, a dining facility at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and a small arms range at Truax Field in Wisconsin.", "NC to lose $80 million", "The Pentagon listed each project affected by the national emergency at the southern border. It includes four at North Carolina military bases, and they do in fact total $80 million as the DSCC claims.", "The North Carolina projects are a new battalion complex and ambulatory care center at Camp Lejeune, an elementary school at Fort Bragg, and a tanker storage facility at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. None of the projects were scheduled to break ground until 2020.", "But while the DSCC\u2019s statement is accurate, there\u2019s an important caveat. Almost $33 million of the $80 million would have been reallocated anyway because the $32.9 million Fort Bragg school project had already been canceled \"due to declining enrollment.\" The construction of the school would have been canceled regardless of Trump\u2019s emergency declaration and its funding could have been reallocated to other projects in North Carolina or elsewhere. (Fort Bragg has several urgent needs, including a $21 million fire station.)", "In a September town hall, Tillis acknowledged the $80 million shift in funding but said, \"Half of that was for a project at Fort Bragg that was not moving forward.\"", "Funding for the other three projects remains uncertain, but Tillis has given assurances that Congress can replenish the money. In an op-ed in the Greensboro News & Record, Tillis wrote that Congress \"has plenty of time to re-allocate funding\" and called on other members of Congress to vote for the National Defense Authorization Act.", "Our ruling", "The DSCC said Tillis supported Trump\u2019s emergency declaration, which enabled the administration to raid $80 million from North Carolina military projects.", "The group is correct that the Trump administration diverted $80 million that had been appropriated by Congress for four military projects in North Carolina. But that included an elementary school at Fort Bragg that had already been canceled.", "The claim is accurate but needs additional information.
