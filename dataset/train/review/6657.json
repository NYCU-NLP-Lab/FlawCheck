Biden didn\u2019t say exactly what the best data show, but the comparison is largely accurate.", "Tallies of deaths by two national groups show that COVID-19 has killed more law enforcement officers than gunfire and other hazards of the job in 2020. The caveat to Biden\u2019s claim is there is some statistical fuzziness regarding who is a cop and what it means to be on patrol.", "Roughly one-third of these tallies include corrections and detention center officers who work inside institutions where the virus can spread more readily. Some Customs and Border Protection field officers and other first responders are also included. While these occupations are counted as part of law enforcement, they might not come to mind as the cops\u00a0that Biden referred to.", "The COVID-19 death toll is still the greatest single cause of death when those occupations are excluded.", "The National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial Fund lists 101 dead officers from COVID-19 compared with 87 from anything else, including gunfire, car accidents or other causes.

Deaths in the line of duty due to any cause tend to average about eight each month.", "FBI data on deaths in the line of duty further back this point. The FBI numbers distinguish between accidental and felonious deaths of officers in the community. They show that in a typical month, criminal acts kill less than five officers a month.", "Excluding the corrections and detention officers, the toll from COVID-19 remains at about 70 in the Officer Down count \u2014 still double the loss of life due to gunfire, but not higher than the sum of other causes of death.", "Biden said that more cops have died from COVID-19 than while on patrol.", "COVID-19 by itself has killed more law enforcement officers than all other causes combined, according to two groups that track these numbers.", "No matter how we parsed the data \u2014 by excluding correctional and detention center officers, or by focusing on felonious deaths to officers that could be considered \"on patrol\" \u2014 COVID-19 posed the greatest single threat to officers\u2019 lives.", "We rate this claim Mostly True.", "C-SPAN, Joe Biden Delivers Remarks on Public Safety and Law Enforcement, Aug. 31, 2020", "Officer Down Memorial Page, Fallen Officers From the COVID-19 Pandemic, Aug. 31, 2020", "Officer Down Memorial Page, 2020 Honor Roll of Heroes, Aug. 31, 2020", "Fraternal Order of Police, COVID-19 Line-of-Duty Deaths, accessed Aug. 31, 2020", "National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, Preliminary 2020 Fallen Officer Fatalities, Aug. 31, 2020", "National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, COVID-19 and its impact on law enforcement, Aug. 31, 2020", "Federal Bureau of Investigation, Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted, accessed Sept. 1, 2020", "Email exchange, Jessica M.
