And the accomplishments don\u2019t end there.", "\"We\u2019re saving Medicare,\" Trump said Sept. 5. \"The Democrats want to destroy Medicare. If you look at what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re going to destroy Medicare. And we will save it. We will keep it going. We\u2019re making it stronger. We\u2019re making Social Security stronger. We\u2019re making our whole country stronger.

It\u2019s primarily health insurance for people 65 and older, but it also helps millions of citizens with disabilities.", "Medicare\u2019s core program, Part A, covers hospital care, and it\u2019s an entitlement. Anyone who qualifies gets the coverage and the government funding is automatic, not subject to the annual budget decisions of Congress.", "The money for Part A comes out of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Payroll taxes provide about 90 percent of the trust fund\u2019s income. Coming in a distant second are taxes on wealthier Social Security recipients, which provide about 8 percent of total revenues.", "In their 2018 report, the Medicare Trustees forecast that fund would run out of money in 2026. A year earlier, they said it would last until 2029. On Trump\u2019s watch, it lost three years of solvency.", "In a presentation at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, the chief actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Paul Spitalnic said two of the lost years were due to lower than expected wage growth.", "But the other lost year came from the Republican tax cuts.", "\"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 decreased individual tax rates and as a result, there is somewhat less income coming into the trust fund,\" Spitalnic said. \"That does have an effect of making depletion of the trust fund a year earlier.\"", "The tax cut law had a similar impact on Social Security. Social Security has two parts --\u00a0the Old Age and Survivors Trust Fund, which served 51 million people in 2017, and the Disability Trust Fund, which served 10 million.

So that\u2019s a loss of one year of solvency.", "The trustees listed several factors for the worsening situation, including the tax cut law, the expected end of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an immigration program Trump opposes), and lower-than-expected wage increases. All three reduced the dollars coming into the trust fund.", "The one bright spot was with the Disability Insurance Trust Fund. While by far the smaller of the two, its projected solvency date was extended by four years, driven by a fall in the number of people claiming benefits.", "White House staff noted that the economy is growing and growth helps Social Security and Medicare.
