And so you would think that people charged with the World Health Organization facts and figures would be on top of that.\"", "\"People should know the facts,\" she added.", "The comment came one day after President Donald Trump announced his intention to halt U.S. funding to the WHO and review its handling of the virus.", "But the name of the disease doesn\u2019t mean the WHO had 18 chances to learn about coronaviruses before the latest strain hit.", "COVID-19 is short for \"coronavirus disease 2019,\" a name that reflects the year in which the disease was first identified.

It\u2019s COVID-19.\"", "Facing blowback for her \"Fox & Friends\" comment, Conway tweeted the clip from her interview with Bartiromo.
