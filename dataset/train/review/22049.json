["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on August 29, 2016", "Sen. John McCain\u2019s primary opponent implied that if reelected, McCain\u00a0may not live long enough to fulfill another six-year term. Actually, the odds are in his favor.", "Kelli Ward,\u00a0a\u00a0doctor and former Arizona state senator, noted that McCain would be 86 years old in 2022. \u201cThe life expectancy of the American male is not 86,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s less.\u201d It\u2019s true that the life expectancy is 76.28 years for American males at birth in 2013, but it\u2019s actually 88.2 years for an average male who has made it to 80 years old.", "Ward\u00a0made her claim during an interview with Politico\u00a0in Phoenix.", "Politico, Aug. 25.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a doctor. The life expectancy of the American male is not 86. It\u2019s less,\u201d Ward said in an interview here.", "The same day, Ward also\u00a0told\u00a0MSNBC anchor Chuck Todd,\u00a0\u201cJohn McCain has fallen down on the job. He\u2019s gotten weak. He\u2019s gotten old.\u00a0\u2026 He\u2019s going to be 80 on Monday and I want to give him the best birthday present ever: the gift of retirement.\u201d", "Today is, indeed, McCain\u2019s 80th birthday. And the Arizona Senate primary is tomorrow, Aug. 30.", "Whether or not McCain \u2014 the\u00a02008 Republican presidential nominee\u00a0and currently\u00a0the eighth oldest senator\u00a0\u2014 has \u201cfallen down on the job\u201d because of his age is a matter of opinion. But,\u00a0according to the Social Security Administration, a man McCain\u2019s age will live an average of 88.2 years \u2014 beyond the end of another six-year Senate term.", "Life expectancy at birth is less than at age 80 because it\u00a0factors in\u00a0mortality rates for all age groups, including\u00a0infants\u00a0who die at birth,\u00a0which brings the average down for the population as a whole. Conversely, life expectancy calculations for an 80-year-old\u00a0only consider\u00a0mortality rates for individuals who\u2019ve already made it to that age.", "For comparison, the life expectancy at birth in Western Europe in the Middle Ages was between 25 and 35 years old.\u00a0But individuals who reached\u00a0the age of 25 might\u00a0have expected to make it on average to at least their early 50s, according to \u201cMiracle Cures,\u201d a book on medieval pilgrims by\u00a0Robert A. Scott, a sociologist and\u00a0associate director emeritus of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.", "In the Middle Ages, many children died before the age of 5\u00a0due to poor nutrition and sanitary conditions, says Scott.\u00a0In 2014, more than\u00a023,000 infants under the age of 1\u00a0died from causes ranging from injuries (e.g. suffocation) to complications during pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These 23,000 deaths are factored into life expectancy for Americans.", "When we contacted Ward\u2019s campaign for comment, Stephen Sebastian, Ward\u2019s spokesman, pointed us to a USA Today article from October 2014, which said the average male life expectancy in the U.S. is 76.4 years.", "This is \u201cless than age 80,\u201d Sebastian told us by email. \u201cThe reason [Ward]\u00a0quoted age 86 is because Senate terms are 6 years each, and if McCain is re-elected at age 80, he would be 86 at the end of that sixth six year term,\u201d he added.", "But as the USA Today article itself states, 76.4 years is the\u00a0life expectancy estimate for males born in 2012. The article goes on to explain that for a\u00a0male\u00a0who was 65 years old in 2012, the average life expectancy is 82.9 years.", "\u201cLife expectancy\u201d looks at the average length of life within\u00a0populations. \u201cLifespan,\u201d on the other hand,\u00a0is the number of years a particular person lives. Thus, while the average 80-year-old alive today is predicted to live to 88.2, some individuals may have shorter or longer lifespans,\u00a0depending on\u00a0both environmental and genetic factors.", "In fact, a study\u00a0in mice published in Nature in 2013 found that genetic mutations inherited from one\u2019s mother can speed up\u00a0the process of aging and may influence lifespan. While later\u00a0studies have supported this\u00a0finding, the mechanism explaining this correlation has yet to be uncovered.", "Given this research, it\u2019s worth pointing out that McCain\u2019s mother is still living and is\u00a0104 years old.", "Sebastian told us Ward didn\u2019t make a claim\u00a0concerning the life expectancy of an 80-year-old male, but about the life expectancy of the American male in general. We agree; she didn\u2019t.", "But in discussing the average\u00a0American male\u2019s life expectancy at birth, along with\u00a0McCain\u2019s age and longstanding position in the Senate, Ward misleadingly compared apples to oranges. The life expectancy of an 80-year-old American male, which is 88.2 years, is a better indicator of McCain\u2019s lifespan than that of an\u00a0American male born\u00a0today.", "Editor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/425d681e-ef15-4949-84a1-9a86a0769ec3", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
