According to the Craigslist ad, \u2018Bachelor degree required \u2013 any field welcome,\u2019\" Answer Sheet said, adding that the coalition was urging legislators and the TEA to find a way to \u00a0ensure only English teachers graded student essays in the exams.", "A few days later, KDFW-TV, Channel 4 in Dallas, aired a news report saying Pearson Testing \"uses Craigslist to solicit people to grade\" the state test, which had been revised and renamed the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness. This story included a statement from the TEA stating the agency was \"fully aware that the Pearson Testing company utilizes multiple employment avenues to secure and adequately train qualified candidates. Pearson carefully trains the graders, and experienced supervisors oversee the work to ensure that essays are graded in a fair and consistent manner.\"", "On its website, KDFW included information attributed to Pearson stating Pearson exhaustively searches for the best people to score student tests relying on the same employment resources school districts use to promote career opportunities. Pearson said its search for scorers in Texas extended to ads with 21 organizations and publications including", "the National Council of Teachers of English, the Austin American-Statesman and the Texas Workforce Commission--as well as Craigslist, ClassifiedAds.com and the Austin Chronicle among venues, Pearson said.", "\"All test scorers hired by Pearson must have at least a four-year degree and undergo very rigorous, state-approved training before they are allowed to begin work,\" Pearson said, according to KDFW. \"As part of this rigorous training, applicants must complete and pass practice sets before being eligible to work. The rigorous training program for scorers was developed with the Texas Education Agency, and TEA must approve all final training materials.\"", "We double-checked this additional information, confirming from Pearson that the company posts ads on Craigslist and numerous other outlets.", "By email, Debbie Ratcliffe, a TEA spokeswoman, provided Pearson\u2019s 2013 statement on the Craigslist criticism. She also guided us to Dave Clark, a Texas-based Pearson official, who said by phone Craigslist is among 21 advertising venues used by Pearson when it\u2019s hunting for qualified test scorers.", "Clark said: \"We have to blanket the entire state to find scorers; it\u2019s seasonal work.\"", "Asked if using Craigslist leaves the impression that the recruitment of scorers is slapdash, Clark replied that if so, people would have to reach a similar illogical characterization of the other places where Pearson advertises such jobs.", "To our inquiry, Brandon Pinette, a Washington, D.C.-based Pearson spokesman, emailed a statement similar to the one circulated in 2013.", "Among recent applicants to grade the Texas exams, Pinette advised, 11 percent fulfilled Pearson\u2019s requirements. Among the successful applicants, he said, 71 percent had at least a year of classroom teaching experience, 83 percent had writing-intensive four-year college degrees and 27 percent had a degree in English.", "Our ruling", "Van de Putte, who has said she opposes high-stakes state-imposed student testing, said the company that scores the existing state tests \"goes on Craigslist to get examiners to read our students\u2019 essays.\"", "There\u2019s a strand of truth here; scorer positions have been advertised on Craigslist. But this statement leaves a loosey-goosey impression by not acknowledging the testing company spreads the word about its scorer jobs in a wide range of \u00a0venues. Also unnoted, the company further screens applicants to ensure they\u2019re up to the job.
