["\"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd used this map to illustrate a point about states with toss-up Senate races.", "Chuck Todd kicked off his hosting duties on Meet the Press by landing an interview with President Barack Obama. But because he\u2019s widely known as a politics junkie, the show also spent a lot of time discussing the 2014 Senate races.", "Over the weekend, the White House announced Obama wouldn\u2019t be taking executive action on immigration reform before the midterms. Obama told Todd it wasn\u2019t about the upcoming elections, but the Meet the Press pundits disagreed.", "\"Democrats are playing defense this year in the race for the Senate. They\u2019re playing in red states where this issue is always going to red hot,\" said Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report, one of the show\u2019s panelists. \"Taking executive action on anything Republicans could call amnesty would boost the Republican base.\"", "Conversely, if you look at demographics, action on immigration may not play a significant role for boosting Democratic turnout in the Senate races, Todd pointed out.", "\"Look at this map, you have this great stat,\" Todd said. \"Eight out of the nine states with competitive Senate races, Hispanics make up less than 10 percent of the electorate.\"", "We thought Todd\u2019s statement was interesting, so we\u00a0decided to take a deep dive into the numbers.", "Competitive seats", "Out of the Senate seats up for election this year, the Cook Political Report rates nine races as toss-ups, meaning either party has a chance of winning. The Cook Report also counts three more races as competitive but leaning toward one party.", "There is some deviation on the number of competitive races. On the high end, CNN considers 12 races competitive, dividing them into six seats \"up for grabs\" and six with \"tilts\" towards a party. On the low end, FiveThirtyEight, which doesn\u2019t label the races competitive or otherwise, lists five seats in which leaders have less than a 60 percent chance of winning.", "Cook Political Report", "FiveThirtyEight", "CNN", "Alaska", "Toss-up", "Toss-up", "Toss-up", "Arkansas", "Toss-up", "Leaning Republican", "Toss-up", "Colorado", "Toss-up", "Toss-up", "Leaning Democrat", "Georgia", "Toss-up", "Leaning Republican", "Leaning Republican", "Iowa", "Toss-up", "Toss-up", "Toss-up", "Kansas", "Leaning Republican", "Toss-up", "Safe Republican", "Kentucky", "Toss-up", "Leaning Republican", "Toss-up", "Louisiana", "Toss-up", "Leaning Republican", "Toss-up", "Michigan", "Toss-up", "Leaning Democrat", "Leaning Democrat", "New Hampshire", "Leaning Democrat", "Leaning Democrat", "Leaning Democrat", "North Carolina", "Toss-up", "Toss-up", "Toss-up", "West Virginia", "Leaning Republican", "Safe Republican", "Leaning Republican", "Nonetheless, while projections of tilts and toss-ups differ, nine seems to be a popular number of competitive states, the same number reported by the\u00a0New York Times, Huffington Post, and the Rothenberg Political Report.", "Hispanic voters", "Todd\u2019s chart on Hispanic voter numbers listed the source as a New York Times article, which extrapolated figures from past Census Bureau surveys to project 2014 elections.", "For good measure, we\u2019ll compare the Times\u2019 estimates for the nine states to 2012 Census results for 12 states considered to be competitive.", "Actual Hispanic voter turnout in 2012 and the projected number of likely Hispanic voters in 2014 are both lower than the share of eligible voters.", "By both sources, Todd is right to say that Hispanic voters comprise less than 10 percent of the total voters in states that are toss-ups. \u00a0Whether that\u2019s out of the top five, top nine, or top 12 most competitive states, only one, Colorado, has a Hispanic voting population above 10 percent.", "Mindy Romero, director of the University of California-Davis Civic Engagement Project, agrees with the Times\u2019 conclusion that the Hispanic voting population will only have a little impact in the competitive 2014 Senate races. But that\u2019s not without caveats.", "\"Latinos will still impact congressional races, though they may not change the outcomes in these races,\" Romero said.", "In the short\u00a0term, Latino voters may not alter the toss-up races significantly, but Romero said they\u2019ll definitely matter in the long run. Take a look at California, a once red and then purple state that\u2019s now solidly blue, in part thanks to Latino voters.", "\"(California senators) Boxer and Feinstein are very safe, and Latinos are a large part of the story of why those two seats are safe, Romero said.", "The ruling", "Todd said, \"Eight out of the nine states with competitive Senate races, Hispanics make up less than 10 percent of the electorate.\"", "Though there\u2019s some deviation in the number of competitive states, nine seems like a pretty safe bet, and the number reported by a good portion of news sources.
