["Minister in the presidency for planning, monitoring and evaluation, Jeff Radebe, made a bold claim about Africa\u2019s population growth at South Africa\u2019s annual presidency budget vote.", "While emphasising the potential of the African continent and its growing middle class, Radebe said that \u201cby 2050, it is projected that Africa will have the same population as China and India combined\u201d.", "A reporter flagged the claim to us.", "Director of media and communications in Radebe\u2019s department, Tshegofatso Modubu, pointed out that Radebe went off script while delivering his speech.", "An online copy of his speech shows that he was meant to say \u201cby 2050, it is projected that Africa will have the same population as China and India combined today\u201d [our emphasis].", "Modubu said that this, entirely different claim, was backed up by the data in the 2015 edition of the United Nations World Population Prospect Report.", "\u201cIt is estimated that the population of India is about 1.311 billion and China 1.371 [billion],\u201d she said. \u201cCombined, they have a population of about 2.6 billion. It is estimated that the population of Africa will grow close to that figure by 2050.\u201d", "To be fair, Africa Check decided to judge each claim separately.", "\u201cBy 2050, it is projected that Africa will have the same population as China and India combined\u201d", "Let\u2019s start with what Radebe said. When he spoke in parliament he made no mention of comparing Africa\u2019s 2050 population with India and China\u2019s 2015 population.", "The United Nations report provides population projections for 2015, 2030, 2050 and 2100.", "In 2015, Africa\u2019s population was estimated at 1.2 billion. The combined total for India (1.3 billion) and China (1.4 billion) came to 2.7 billion.", "Fast forward 35 years and Africa\u2019s population is expected to double. By 2050, the continent is predicted to be home to 2.5 billion people.", "That same year just over 1.7 billion people are expected to call India home, compared to 1.3 billion in China. Their combined population will come in at 3.1 billion.", "The claim that the continent \u201cwill have the same population\u201d as India and China combined is therefore incorrect.", "Source: 2015 United Nations World Population Prospect Report", "\u201cBy 2050, it is projected that Africa will have the same population as China and India combined today.\u201d", "Now we can move onto fact-checking what the minister was meant to say.", "An online copy of Radebe\u2019s speech shows that he should have added the word \u201ctoday\u201d at the end of the sentence. It\u2019s a small but important difference.", "By 2050, Africa\u2019s population of 2.5 billion is still expected to be lower than India and China\u2019s combined 2015 population estimate of 2.7 billion.", "This is a difference of around 210 million people. Or, put another way, a shortfall of about 1 Nigeria, 3 South Africas or 26 Lesothos when current population sizes are considered.", "The minister\u2019s online speech is closer to the truth, although still an exaggeration.", "Edited by Anim van Wyk", "Please complete this form to receive the HTML sharing code.", "Africa Check values your trust and is committed to the responsible management, use and protection of personal information.
