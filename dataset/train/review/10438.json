President Obama, from what they tell me, was under a similar kind of a thing \u2014 didn\u2019t give one letter. They didn\u2019t do anything. They didn\u2019t give one letter of the request.

On occasion, the administration opposed turning over documents. This happened in the investigations over Solyndra, Fast & Furious, and Benghazi.

The Obama administration gave hundreds of thousands of documents to Congress in at least four investigations. For a fraction of those documents, the administration went to court to try to head off the request, but courts generally sided with Congress, and the documents were ultimately handed over.
