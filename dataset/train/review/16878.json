["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on June 2, 2016", "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell falsely claimed that\u00a0\u201cthe average person is about $3,000 or $4,000 a year worse off today than when President Obama came to office.\u201d \u00a0Real median personal income under Obama was down about $400 as of 2014, the most recent Census data available.\u00a0And wages have improved since 2014.", "Average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation of all private-sector workers increased 2.6 percent since the end of 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That indicates that \u201ctoday,\u201d as McConnell put it, workers are a good bit better off than they were in 2014.", "McConnell discussed the economy when asked on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d about the political success of businessman Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee (at the 3:17 minute mark).", "McConnell, May 31:\u00a0And you know, in today\u2019s politics, and people are legitimately unhappy, I mean, the average person is about $3,000 or $4,000 a year worse off today than when President Obama came to office, you can understand the anxiety and the desire for a kind of quick turnaround.", "To measure income for the \u201caverage person\u201d we went to the Census Bureau and reviewed the data for real (inflation adjusted) median personal income. The most recent data (table P-7) show that it was $28,757 in 2014, down $396 from $29,153 in 2008.", "When we asked McConnell\u2019s office where he got his figure of \u201cabout $3,000 or $4,000 a year,\u201d we were given data for median household\u00a0income\u00a0(table H-8) from the Census Bureau. McConnell didn\u2019t say \u201caverage household;\u201d he said \u201caverage person.\u201d But he\u2019s wrong about average household, too.", "In fact, by one report, average household income has fully recovered from the 2007 recession.", "By McConnell\u2019s measure, using Census data, there was a decline of\u00a0$1,656 in median household income (not\u00a0\u201c$3,000 or $4,000\u201d) as of 2014 (not \u201ctoday\u201d). According to the Census Bureau, the median household income in 2014 dollars (inflation adjusted) was $55,313 in 2008 and $53,657 in 2014.", "But that figure of $1,656 is outdated. As we mentioned earlier,\u00a0average hourly earnings for private-sector workers increased 2.6 percent since the end of 2014, so today the \u201caverage person\u201d is doing better now than even 2014.", "The average household is doing better, too.", "McConnell\u2019s office did not cite this, but there is a more up-to-date source of median household income and that\u2019s from Sentier Research, which provides monthly household income figures while the Census Bureau publishes annual figures.", "In 2012,\u00a0GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney cited Sentier Research to make the exaggerated claim\u00a0that the median income in America had fallen by $5,000 under Obama. It was a\u00a0staple of his stump speech. But, as we wrote at the time, Romney\u2019s $5,000 figure dated to the start of the recession in December 2007 \u2014 more than a year before Obama took office.", "Sentier Research now shows that median household income has\u00a0fully recovered from the Great Recession, which officially ended\u00a0June 2009.", "In its latest report,\u00a0Sentier says household median income was $57,243 \u2014 up $343, or 0.6 percent, from the start of the recession in December 2007.", "Sentier Research, \u201cHousehold Income Trends April 2016,\u201d May 26, 2016: The April 2016 median income of $57,243 is 2.5 percent higher than the median of $55,859 in June 2009, the end of the recent recession and beginning of the \u201ceconomic recovery.\u201d The April 2016 median is 0.6 percent higher than the median\u00a0of $56,900 in December 2007, the beginning\u00a0month of the recession that occurred more\u00a0than eight years ago.", "It\u2019s time for McConnell to retire this Republican talking point, which was misused in 2012 and flat out wrong in 2016.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/483f561d-0ec1-4cb4-802e-c631494830f1", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
