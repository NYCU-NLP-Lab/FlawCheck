Follow our post-election coverage here.", "Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy visited former U.S. President Donald Trump on Jan. 29, 2021, at Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, residence and resort Mar-a-Lago, reportedly to mend fences after laying blame on Trump for inciting an attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Although the meeting was described as \"good and cordial,\" as far as we know, no one said, \"You complete me.\"", "But somehow that famous scene from the 1996 Tom Cruise romance \"Jerry Maguire\" ended up spliced into MSNBC coverage of the meeting. It happened during the news and politics show \"The 11th Hour with Brian Williams\" on Jan. 28, 2021, when Williams informed his guests, writer and podcast host Baratunde Thurston and political analyst Bill Kristol, that he was going to show \"exclusive video\" from the meeting between McCarthy and Trump.", "Instead, he cut to video of the scene in \"Jerry Maguire\" when Tom Cruise's eponymously-named character tearfully tells Renee Zellweger's character, \"You complete me.\"", "https://youtu.be/wz73dkoEE2U", "The video is real \u2014 the \"Jerry Maguire\" clip really was played during Williams' show.

At a rally preceding the riot, he told the crowd to march to the Capitol. They did, and five people, including a police officer, died in the ensuing violence.", "But as time has gone by, despite what appeared to be at least somewhat bipartisan outrage in the hours and days immediately following the attack, Republicans like McCarthy have walked back their initial statements about holding Trump accountable.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who started her career as a daily newspaper reporter and has covered everything from crime to government to national politics.
