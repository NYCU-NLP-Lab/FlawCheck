(AP)", "Republicans have criticized the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine as an overextension of Democrats\u2019 power in Congress.

But as for the impeachment inquiry\u2019s price tag, there is no evidence that it has cost $40 million.", "That $40 million figure most likely comes from an incomplete and inaccurate reporting of the cost of the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The impeachment inquiry centers around actions by Trump that occurred after Mueller\u2019s investigation was completed.", "This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard the claim that a public investigation cost $40 million.", "After Mueller concluded his special counsel investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, claimed during a Fox News interview that it cost \"about $40 million.\"", "Expenditure filings from May 2017 to 2019 put the cost closer to $32 million. The investigation was paid for through a permanent, indefinite appropriation for independent counsels.", "RELATED: Here\u2019s what we know about the cost of the Mueller investigation", "Mueller\u2019s office said indirect expenses \u2014 such as personnel from the FBI or other agencies \u2014 aren\u2019t really a use of additional tax dollars, since the personnel and resources would have been devoted to other cases if there had been no special counsel investigation.", "Two notes: First, the cost of the investigation doesn\u2019t account for forfeitures made by people ensnared in the probe. The financial penalties leveled against Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman, stand out among nearly three-dozen indictments stemming from the probe.", "As part of a plea agreement, Manafort forfeited to the government his real estate property in New York, funds in three bank accounts, and his life insurance policy. Court documents do not specify the estimated value of each asset. (Some news outlets reported that the combined value of the real estate properties could be an estimated $22 million.)", "Second, none of Mueller\u2019s findings have been \u2014 to date \u2014 part of the impeachment inquiry.

In 2018, salaries surpassed $5 million.", "If you factor in staff salaries for the Judiciary Committee, which will weigh in on the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation in the House, the total comes to around $5.7 million as of June.

Robert Ray, who succeeded Starr as head of the Office of the Independent Counsel, told the Associated Press in 2002 that about $12.5 million was spent on the perjury and obstruction probe of Clinton and his relationship with Lewinsky.", "But the Starr investigation lasted several years and looked into multiple aspects of the Clinton presidency, such as the Whitewater scandal. And it was independent of Congress, making it more similar to Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in 2016 (which was slightly less expensive, when adjusting for inflation) than the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine.", "A Facebook post claimed, \"Democrats spent $40,000,000 of YOUR tax dollars trying to impeach Trump.\"", "That number echoes an exaggerated estimate of the cost of the Mueller investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 election. That did not go through the impeachment process. We haven\u2019t seen any estimates of the cost of the impeachment inquiry so far. Salaries for staffers on the committees involved, as well as expenses associated specifically with Clinton\u2019s impeachment charges, suggest that the cost of the Trump inquiry is far less than $40 million.
