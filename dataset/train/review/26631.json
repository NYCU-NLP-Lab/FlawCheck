When in the field, gear such as bulletproof vests, arms and ammunition and parachutes can be regarded as a part of the uniform. Readers should note that in 2019, several media outlets \u2014 The Economic Times, The Indian Express and The Eurasian Times \u2014 reported that protective gear/ bulletproof jackets for the Indian Army were imported from China.", "Col Rajendra Bhaduri (Retd.) told Alt News, \u201cThe section which claims that \u201cfabrics were imported from China, Korea and Taiwan\u201d can be interpreted as daily wear uniforms of Army, Navy and Air Force officers. As per the article, DRDO approved [fabric] sample order by Surat-based textile manufacturers. Therefore, the said fabric can\u2019t be the same as the fabric which is used by military personnel as their daily wear. The said fabric is likely a technical one used in specialised applications like bulletproof vests, rucksacks, parachutes, special forces clothing etc.\u201d", "Alt News spoke with serving military officials, veterans and fabric experts to understand the process.", "\u201cThe officers in all the three armed forces have to get their own daily wear uniforms stitched with the help of a \u2018uniform allowance\u2019 alloted to them, while the uniforms to Personnel Below Officers Ranks (PBOR) are provided by the concerned government authority. Historically PBOR uniforms are manufactured by the Ordinance Clothing Factories, a unit of government body Ordinance Factory Board (OFB) at Shahjahanpur and Avadi. As of today, all armed forces personnel are given a uniform allowance. I\u2019m a third-generation military officer in my family and I have never heard any officer purchasing imported fabric to make their official uniform,\u201d said Bhaduri.", "Gagan Chaturvedi, deputy director-general, corporate communications at Ordinance Factory Board further told us, \u201cSince 2018, Junior commissioned officer and PBORs cadre of the armed forces is entitled to a dress allowance. A list of dress allowance items has also been declared. The production of these dress allowance items has been discontinued in the OEF group. As a result, we manufacture combat uniforms and other products which can be viewed in our catalogue. Yet, the OFB remains the largest suppliers of uniform in the organised sector. As per latest available data, in 2017-18 the OFB manufactured uniforms, troop comfort items and combat gear comprising Coat Combat Army Logo, Combat Uniforms, Overall Combination Army Logo and Infantry Combat Kits.

He said, \u201cIn my professional experience, the most used fabric brands have been Alok and Nahar to make Army uniforms. Fabrics of brands like Raymonds and S. Kumars are also used by officers these days. However, some officers also bring cloth of other brands which suit them better. As long as the fabric matches the designated colour, their uniforms can be made.\u201d", "Delhi-based tailor who has been making uniforms for Indian Air Force officers for over 15 years said, \u201cThese days most officers buy the fabric from the defence canteen. In my experience, all fabrics used by the officers are manufactured by Indian companies.

He further said that the fabric will be used by defence forces for various purposes like shoes, rug-sacks, trousers and tents. It is pertinent to note that Saravgi did not talk about uniforms but specific items.", "\u201cThis fabric is used for specialised purposes. It has a tenacity of 7.25 grams per denier (gpd). The fabric we make is plain white in colour and made using a high tenacity yarn. This type of yarn was mostly imported because there was no demand for it in India. Once the fabric is made, we give it to garmenters who make the final products. This fabric can be used to make equipment like tents, rug-sacks and highly specific military gears. It can also be used to make trousers which need higher endurance. This cloth isn\u2019t used by common folks going to the office.,\u201d Saravgi informed Alt News. Ahmedabad Mirror included inputs from Saravgi, however, failed to clarify that the fabric is unlikely to be used to make daily uniform.", "We asked Saravgi about Ahmedabad Mirror\u2019s input that the fabric is so strong it cannot be torn by hand and attempting to tear it may even cut fingers. He clarified, \u201cI was talking about the yarn, not fabric.\u201d", "Therefore, the fabric mentioned by Ahmedabad Mirror and ANI is a specialised fabric which is used to make various military equipment. Due to the lack of technical details, the reports created an impression that daily wear uniforms for the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force were made using imported fabric until now. The headlines of the reports also gave the same impression. However, the truth is that the officers of the armed forces purchase their own fabric from Indian brands like Raymond and get their uniforms stitched.", "Ahmedabad Mirror\u2019s article was shared by Union Cabinet Minister for Textiles and Women & Child Development Smriti Z Irani, BJP MP Darshana Jardosh, BJP MP Shobha Karandlaje, BJP MLA Purnesh Modi, co-founder of PuneTech and ReliScore Amit Paranjape and Group President at Reliance Industries Limited Dhanraj Nathwani.", "This slideshow requires JavaScript.", "Many of the above outlets had republished an ANI story.
