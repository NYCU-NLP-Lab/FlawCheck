But viral stories wrongly conflate removals with President Trump\u2019s zero tolerance policy.", "Viral stories that defend the Trump administration\u2019s policy of separating children from adults caught illegally crossing the country\u2019s southwest border are claiming that the Obama administration did worse \u2014 by separating \u201c72,410 Children From Their Families in 2013.\u201d", "But the websites parroting that line overstate the number of children separated \u201cfrom their families\u201d under President Obama and conflate two separate immigration actions. We explain both issues here.", "As we\u2019ve reported before, the wide-scale practice of separating families apprehended at the border was not one employed by previous administrations.", "Experts told us that, under previous presidents, such family separations occurred in\u00a0\u201creally limited circumstances,\u201d such as suspicion of trafficking or other fraud.", "None had a blanket rule like the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance policy,\u201d which referred all illegal border crossings for criminal prosecution.\u00a0When that happened, adults were sent to jails that cannot legally house children.", "Relying on civil immigration proceedings to remove those who crossed illegally, \u201cprevious administrations used family detention facilities, allowing the whole family to stay together while awaiting their deportation case in immigration court\u201d \u2014 or released and tracked families as they awaited their court dates, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.", "Before suspending its practice of separating families amid widespread criticism, the Trump administration separated more than 2,000 children from adults \u2014 and has been working to meet a federal court\u2019s\u00a0order\u00a0to reunify those eligible.", "The website\u00a0davidharrisjr.com\u00a0claimed\u00a0in an Aug. 10 story that \u201cBARACK OBAMA SEPARATED 72,410 CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES IN 2013 ALONE.\u201d", "\u201cThe truth of the matter is that it was not Donald Trump\u2019s policies that begin separating children from their parents,\u201d the story says, later adding:\u00a0\u201cWith all the liberal tears, wailings and gnashings of teeth over 2,000 illegal children being separated by the Trump administration you would think the 72,410 Obama separated in one year would spark a nation wide protest, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d", "That story was posted on other websites and accrued thousands of shares and engagements on Facebook,\u00a0according to CrowdTangle data, including on pro-Trump\u00a0pages.", "In reality, the number cited \u2014 72,410 \u2014 refers to the number of unauthorized immigrants who were removed in 2013 that claimed \u201cat least one U.S.-born child.\u201d A 2014 HuffPost story\u00a0reported as much, citing U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports given to Congress for the\u00a0first and second halves of 2013.", "The action of deporting unauthorized immigrants, including those with U.S.-born children, has existed across administrations, and continues to occur today. In other words, Trump\u2019s new zero tolerance policy is in addition to existing deportation actions.", "Most of the removals in 2013 were the result of \u201cimmigration enforcement priorities\u201d \u2014 meaning the immigrants were convicted of a crime, caught illegally entering the U.S., or were considered a fugitive because they failed to report to ICE or were already issued a final order of removal.", "When parents of U.S.-born children are removed, the children may\u00a0leave with them \u2014 or stay with another parent, family member, or in foster care.", "We don\u2019t know how many children were separated from their families in 2013, and the HuffPost story did not say, so the headline on\u00a0davidharrisjr.com is wrong. It says\u00a0Obama \u201cseparated 72,410 children from their families in 2013 alone.\u201d But an unknown number wound up staying with their families, either with their other parent or another family member.", "The website misleads when it conflates the issues by declaring that \u201cit was not Donald Trump\u2019s policies that begin separating children from their parents. Those policies were in place long before Donald Trump took office.\u201d", "In the years following 2013, the number of immigrants removed who claimed at least one U.S. child did decline. While we couldn\u2019t locate data for 2014,\u00a0DHS reported\u00a0that there were 31,411 such removals in 2015. In 2016, the number totaled 28,860.", "Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said in an interview that the drop was likely the result of enforcement changes by the Obama administration. DHS guidance issued in late 2014, building off the president\u2019s executive actions on immigration, more thoroughly\u00a0outlined\u00a0immigration enforcement priorities and the use of prosecutorial discretion.", "Under the changes,\u00a0the highest priority group for deportation included serious criminal offenders, especially those deemed national security threats, and immigrants apprehended at the border. DHS officials were also given ample discretion on such cases \u2014 even if they did fall under one of several levels of priority. And having a child who was a U.S. citizen, Pierce said, could have helped their case.", "We don\u2019t have enough data to know how exactly the number of immigrants removed who have a U.S.-born child will change over\u00a0the course of the Trump administration.\u00a0The first half of 2017 saw 12,464 such removals \u2014 a drop from 14,699 in\u00a0the first half of 2016.", "But within days of taking office, Trump overrode the 2014 guidance with an\u00a0executive order that significantly broadened the groups of immigrants in the country illegally that should be prioritized for removal, Pierce noted.", "The effects of that may result in Immigration\u00a0and Customs\u00a0Enforcement increasing the removals of parents of U.S. citizens, she said.\u00a0\u201cIt takes a lot of time to ramp up interior enforcement \u2014 we\u2019ve seen ICE trying to work with local jurisdictions \u2026 [and] criminal justice systems, trying to get referrals.\u201d", "We asked DHS for the number of immigrants removed who claimed U.S.-born children in the second half of 2017, and to date in 2018 \u2014 as well as for other years\u2019 data \u2014 but did not get a response.
