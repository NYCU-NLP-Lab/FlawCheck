The bill doesn\u2019t eliminate state voter ID laws so much as provide voters a way to work around them. In states with voter ID laws, the bill says voters without ID can present election officials with a sworn written statement under penalty of perjury attesting to their identity.", "Allows felons to vote: This leaves out context. It\u2019s more accurate to say the bill restores voting rights to felons once they\u2019ve served their criminal sentence. Many states already allow felons to vote once they meet the terms of their sentence, as PolitiFact has previously reported. The bill specifically says rights are restored \"unless such individual is serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or facility at the time of the election.\"", "Expands \"no excuse\" absentee voting: This is true. Some states require voters to have an excuse for requesting an absentee ballot. The bill says if someone is eligible to vote, \"the State may not impose any additional conditions or requirements on the eligibility of the individual to cast the vote in such election by absentee ballot by mail.\" It\u2019s worth noting, however, that North Carolina is already a no excuse absentee voting state.", "Now to the big miss.", "Budd said the bill \"allows minors to vote.\" That\u2019s not true.", "When we asked Budd\u2019s office about this, spokesman Curtis Kalin said: \"I believe he was referring to the provision that allowed those under 18 to register to vote.\"", "The bill allows people who are 16-years-old to pre-register to vote. As PolitiFact previously reported, some states already allow this practice.

Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass, has introduced a pair of amendments that would lower the voting age to 16. Polls show younger voters tend to lean Democratic.
