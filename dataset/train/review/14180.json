["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on March 22, 2018", "Q: Did \u201ctwo million people leave the food stamp rolls in Trump\u2019s first year\u201d?", "A: No. That\u2019s the decline in average monthly enrollment in fiscal year 2017, including almost four months when Trump wasn\u2019t president.", "Fact check story on 2 million less people on food stamps \u2018thanks\u2019 to 45. I saw this on Facebook this morning.", "The number of people collecting benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly called food stamps, has been declining since fiscal year 2014.", "Consistent with that trend, average monthly enrollment decreased by about 2 million from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017.", "That decrease happened only partly on President Donald Trump\u2019s watch.", "Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2017, while the 2017 fiscal year\u00a0ran from Oct. 1, 2016, to Sept. 30, 2017. So, about four months \u2014 a third of that fiscal year \u2014 were during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.", "But some pundits have attributed the entire drop in enrollment last fiscal year to Trump\u2019s policies after the Department of Agriculture released data for the last fiscal year on March 9.", "On \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on March 17, Rachel Campos-Duffy said: \u201cTwo million Americans are off of food stamps. This is, like, the opposite of what happened in the Obama administration, where we saw that number grow. In one year, it\u2019s coming down.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that the number of people enrolled in SNAP initially increased during the Obama administration \u2014 reaching a peak average monthly enrollment of 47.6 million in fiscal year 2013. That rise was a consequence of the deep recession that began in 2007, according to a 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.", "However, as the economy recovered and poverty and unemployment rates decreased, so did SNAP enrollment, according to the USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service. Enrollment was down to 42.7 million in January 2017, when Obama left office.", "That decline has continued under Trump.", "Enrollment went down by 1.35 million from January 2017, when Trump took office, to December 2017, according to the most recent monthly figures from the USDA, which administers SNAP. By comparison, enrollment declined by 1.88 million over the same time period in 2016 when Obama was president, from 44,852,347 in January 2016 to 42,969,079 in December 2016.", "But Campos-Duffy\u2019s statement was turned into a meme that has been circulating on Facebook, and other websites published stories making similar claims. For example, the Gateway Pundit posted a story with the headline: \u201cTWO MILLION Leave Food Stamp Rolls in Trump\u2019s First Year \u2014 Saving Country $3 Billion Annually.\u201d", "Some Facebook users flagged the story as potentially false, and others emailed to ask us if the meme is accurate. Both are misleading.", "There are two things wrong with the claim: It credits Trump with the entire decrease in fiscal year 2017, even though he wasn\u2019t in office for a third of the fiscal year, and it ignores a years-long trend in the reduction of food stamp recipients. If anything, the rate of the decrease in people receiving food stamps has slowed under Trump.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "U.S. Department of Agriculture. \u201cA Short History of SNAP.\u201d 28 Nov 2017.", "U.S. Department of Agriculture. \u201cSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Participation and Costs.\u201d 9 Mar 2018.", "U.S. Department of Agriculture. \u201cSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\u201d 9 Mar 2018.", "Fox News. Fox & Friends clip. 17 Mar 2018.", "Congressional Budget Office. \u201cThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\u201d Apr 2012.", "USDA Economic Research Service. \u201cSNAP participation and selected economic indicators, 1980-2016.\u201d 30 Mar 2017.", "Hoft, Jim. \u201cTWO MILLION Leave Food Stamp Rolls in Trump\u2019s First Year \u2014 Saving Country $3 Billion Annually.\u201d GatewayPundit.com. 19 Mar 2018.", "Jackson, Brooks. \u201cTrump\u2019s Numbers.\u201d FactCheck.org. 19 Jan 2018.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
