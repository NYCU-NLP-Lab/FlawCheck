But her contract was terminated just days later when the The Daily Mail tabloid published sections of a Facebook post reportedly written by Bergdorf.", "Bergdorf said she made the comments as a reaction to the August 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. L\u2019Or\u00e9al said Bergdorf's words were at odds with their support of \"diversity and tolerance towards all people.\"", "In early June 2020, L\u2019Or\u00e9al posted statements supporting Black people in the wake of the May 25, 2020, police-custody death of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis died while being forcibly restrained by a white police officer. Soon after, Bergdorf called the cosmetic company out as hypocrites on her Instagram account, recalling that she was fired three years prior for speaking out against white supremacy.", "On June 9, Bergdorf revealed that L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s new president, Delphine Viguier had since reached out to her.
