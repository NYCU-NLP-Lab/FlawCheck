Also, Staples\u2019 cited arrest and confiscation totals reflected Drawbridge\u2019s overall results.", "In an interview, Staples told us his statement was intended to reflect totals for the entire program and he\u2019s never said all the results were due to Agriculture Department aid. Staples also stressed that his email blast said the agency\u2019s savings \"helped\" achieve the results. \"I don\u2019t want to get popped for something I\u2019ve never taken credit for,\" he said.", "Operation Drawbridge", "The state\u2019s Department of Public Safety started Drawbridge in January 2012, according to its website. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us by email that Agriculture Department grants in October 2012 and August 2013 provided $345,000 to the program.", "The main source of Drawbridge funding, Vinger said, is the Criminal Justice Division of the Governor\u2019s Office, which has so far provided grants totaling $2.5 million.", "A description of the initiative from a June 9, 2012, San Antonio Express-News news story said, \"(T)he department is installing 500 cameras along the border, part of an electronic monitoring program called Operation Drawbridge. It's an update of the much-criticized Texas Border Watch Program, a multimillion-dollar effort by the state to set up video cameras along the border. It was recently canceled after only a few dozen cameras were put in place over more than three years and unimpressive results.\"", "A 2013 DPS conference presentation placed online illustrates how Drawbridge uses modified off-the-shelf, motion-sensing, low-light cameras of the type hunters use to spot and track game at all hours. Farmers and ranchers volunteer to have the $300 cameras placed on their land near the Texas/Mexico border. Once an image is captured, software transmits it to law enforcement, and response times can be as quick as 10 minutes, according to the presentation.", "Images from 2013 conference presentation on DPS website preparingtexas.org", "Staples has long warned that because of a lack of border security, farmers and ranchers are under siege.
