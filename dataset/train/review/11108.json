["The claim was shared by an Australian-based Facebook user here. The post has been shared more than 460 times.", "The post purports to compare the progress of developing a Covid-19 vaccine with other areas of medical research.", "It states: \u201c40 years worth of research\u2026 no vaccine for HIV\n\t\u201cAt least 100 years of research\u2026 no vaccine for cancer\n\t\u201cOngoing research\u2026 no vaccine for the common cold\u00a0\n\t\u201cLess than a year for a Covid vaccine?\u00a0\n\t\u201cI think I\u2019ll pass on that shot!!\u201d", "Sars-CoV-2, the virus that leads to the disease Covid-19, was first reported to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019. The virus has since spread to almost every continent on earth, infecting more than 72 million people and killing more than 1.6 million people, according to Johns Hopkins University.", "A similar claim was shared by Facebook users hundreds of times here, here\u00a0and here.", "The claim, however, is misleading.", "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) attacks the cells in the body that help fight infections and diseases and can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The virus is primarly contracted during unprotected sex and can be fatal.", "However, medications now available for HIV prevent the degradation of the immune system and reduce the risk of disease associated with the virus. People who are HIV positive are now often able to live a healthy and long life. Some medications have been shown to even prevent the transmission of the virus. This page on the website for the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations gives more details.", "University of Western Australia virologist Associate Professor Alison Imrie\u00a0told AFP in an email that HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are \u201cvery different viruses\u201d.", "\u201cHIV inserts itself into our DNA and remains there until those cells die, whereas SARS-CoV-2 does not. Also, HIV mutates at a much greater rate than SARS-CoV-2 so the immune response cannot control it,\u201d she said in the December 14 email.", "\u201cThe relatively good news about SARS-CoV-2 is that although this virus also mutates, it does not change as quickly as many other viruses (such as HIV, influenza, and rhinovirus, one of the viruses that causes the common cold) so the Covid-19 vaccines are more likely to be successful as the virus does not change fast enough to be able to escape the immune response the vaccines will produce.\u201d", "The American National Cancer Institute explains here that cancer is a collection of related diseases that are primarily caused by cells which begin to divide and spread to surrounding tissue. \u201cAs cells become more and more abnormal, old or damaged cells survive when they should die, and new cells form when they are not needed. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form growths called tumors,\u201d the website reads.", "According to Professor Imrie, cancer is not a single microbe or change in the body, unlike Covid-19 which is caused by a single virus (Sars-CoV-2). Cancer can be caused by a plethora of different reasons including viruses, she said. \u201cThe fight against Covid-19 is easier as this is a disease caused by infection with one virus,\u201d she said.", "Only between 12 and 20% of all cancers are caused by viruses, but vaccines have been shown to help prevent some cancers caused by viruses, according to this article by the American Society for Microbiology.", "The HPV vaccine, which can help prevent the human papillomavirus which leads to a variety of cancers,\u00a0and Hepatitis B vaccine, which can help prevent liver cancer caused by the virus, are just two examples.", "The common cold is caused by a number of groups of different viruses, including coronaviruses, RSV and parainfluenza, but rhinoviruses are the most common. Most of these viruses will lead to people becoming sick, but our immune systems will generally fight them off, according to the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).", "After we have developed an immune response to a particular virus, we will often become immune to any future exposure to the same virus, but not to the other hundreds of other similar viruses, Imrie said.", "\u201cPharmaceutical companies won't invest in developing hundreds of vaccines for viruses which are relatively benign, and we likely won't want to pay a lot of money for hundreds of vaccinations against viruses which don't cause serious disease,\u201d she added.", "Flinders University Associate Professor of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases\u00a0Jill Carr\u00a0told AFP in an email the common cold also is not perceived as \u201chaving a devastating impact\u201d on the economy or public health. \u201cThus, in the environment of limited funding for research, the big impact diseases are given much more focus,\u201d she said.", "According to Professor Imrie, the mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 have been developed relatively quickly because the technology used in them has been in development since 2003 for other coronaviruses like MERS and SARS. \u201cWhen those diseases seemed to disappear, vaccine funding dried up but some of the technology had been developed and was ready to apply to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19,\u201d she explained.", "\u201cAlso, basic research that has been going on in universities around the world, supported by government and by philanthropic organisations including Gates Foundation, resulted in discoveries that have been applied to the new COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d she said.", "Professor Carr said the amount of resources devoted to finding a vaccine, advances in technology and collaboration among scientists are all factors that have spurred progress towards finding a Covid-19 vaccine so quickly.", "\u201cThese basic platforms... and scientific networks have expedited developing a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and the streamlining of the process that couples basic science to clinical trials, regulatory approval and manufacture have helped all these different arms of the process work together.", "\u201cThe financial risk has been mitigated by political support for guarantees of outcomes for manufacturers' investment, so pharmaceutical companies have lower risk for taking on the vaccine candidate for manufacture,\u201d she said.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
