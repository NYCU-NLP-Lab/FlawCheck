["About this rating", "During a speech to U.S. troops announcing a military pay increase, President Trump joked that he knew they didn't really want a pay raise because they're very patriotic and would rather the money be spent to pay down the national debt.", "President Trump did not literally say that if the soldiers were real patriots they wouldn't take a pay raise.", "On 13 August 2018, President Trump visited Wheeler-Sack Army Air Field at Fort Drum, New York, for a ceremonial signing of the John McCain National Defense Authorization Act, a $717 billion military spending bill for fiscal year 2019.", "In addition to funding increases in troop strength, equipment upgrades, and modernization, the bill included a 2.6 percent pay raise for service members (the highest increase in nine years), as well as a 3.4 percent increase in basic subsistence allowance and a 2.9 percent increase in basic housing allowance.", "Before the official signing took place, Trump spoke to the assembled troops of the 10th Mountain Division, whom he complimented on their valor and dedication. \"You're not just tough, you're mountain tough, you're mountain proud, and you're mountain strong, ever climbing to glory,\" he told them.", "But something else Trump allegedly said drew way more attention on social media. After announcing the increase, he supposedly told the troops that if they were \"real patriots,\" they would turn down the pay raise:", "Direct from your mouth, \u201cIf soldiers were real patriots, they will not take a pay raise\u201d Wow? How unthoughtful coming from a 5 Time draft dodger who was scared to wear the uniform ???", "\u2014 John Hobbs Jr (@HobbsAnimations) August 15, 2018", "'If soldiers were 'real patriots,' they wouldn't take a pay raise: \u201cDoes anybody not want it? Please raise your hand,\u201d Trump he said. After scanning the crowd, he added, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? Are these real patriots? I don\u2019t know, General.

One thing they make clear is that the president did not utter the words, \"If soldiers were real patriots, they wouldn't take a pay raise.\" It isn't a direct quote.", "Here is the relevant passage from the official White House transcript of the speech:", "And we are proudly giving our troops the biggest pay increase in a decade. And I know you don\u2019t want it because you\u2019re very patriotic. You\u2019ll say, just save the money. We\u2019re going to pay down debt. Does anybody not want it? Please raise your hand. What\u2019s going on here? (Laughter.) Are these real patriots? I don\u2019t know, General. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the biggest increase in a decade.", "In context, it's obvious that the president was teasing the soldiers, not literally questioning their patriotism. His improvised remarks were clearly intended as a joke, even if some listeners might have considered it to be a rather lame one.", "Many of the commenters who acknowledged that it was a joke felt it was a disrespectful one, though. And at least one tweet accused Trump of \"mocking\" the troops:", "Trump, addressing troops at Fort Drum, mocks them for wanting pay raise Congress just enacted; \"Are these real patriots?\"", "\u2014 John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) August 13, 2018", "But again, the criticism seemed to presume that at some level President Trump seriously doubted his audience's patriotism. It bears pointing out that this wasn't the first time he had ribbed U.S. soldiers about wanting a pay raise. During a speech he delivered a few months earlier in which he took credit for a 2.4 percent military pay hike in fiscal 2018 (which he erroneously claimed was the first increase in 10 years), Trump feigned uncertainty as to how soon the troops would like to see another such raise:", "Today, I\u2019m here to tell you that my administration is totally committed to every family that serves in the United States armed forces. That is why, earlier this year, I was proud to sign that big pay raise that I\u2019ve already spoken about. And I am proud of it.", "And I guess there will be others, too. Would you like one sooner, or do you want to wait another 10 years? I don\u2019t know.", "Although Trump didn't mention patriotism that time, the form of the joke was reminiscent of the one he would later make at Fort Dodd, right down to answering his own tongue-in-cheek question with \"I don't know.\" This is typical of Trump's deadpan, sometimes awkward improvisational style.", "Arguably, then, what some have interpreted as a slight against U.S. service members' patriotism can be interpreted with equal validity as a clumsy attempt at irony -- although the only point on which most observers are likely to agree is that it wasn't particularly funny.", "Kenmore, Abraham. \u00a0 \"Trump Visits Fort Drum to Sign Military Spending Bill.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Watertown Daily Times. \u00a0 13 August 2018.", "Shane III, Leo. \u00a0 \"Trump Seems Confused About Military Pay, Claims Troops Received No Raises for a Decade.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Military Times. \u00a0 9 May 2018.", "Vergun, David. \u00a0 \"President Signs National Defense Authorization Act, With 2.6 Percent Pay Raise for Troops.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Army News Service. \u00a0 13 August 2018.", "WhiteHouse.gov. \u00a0 \"Remarks by President Trump at a Signing Ceremony for H.R. 5515, 'John S.
