["By Brooks Jackson", "Posted on February 28, 2019", "President Donald Trump is fond of saying that China is paying billions of dollars to the U.S. as a result of the increased tariffs he has imposed on imports of Chinese goods. Not true. The tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. importers in the form of customs duties, and to some extent by U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices.", "Trump said it again most recently on Feb. 25, in remarks to state governors who were meeting in Washington, D.C.", "Trump, Feb. 25:\u00a0Now, China is paying us, right now, billions and billions of dollars of tariffs a month.\u00a0 Every month, billions of dollars.\u00a0 I love it.\u00a0 Personally, I love it.\u00a0 But they\u2019re paying billions of dollars.\u00a0 And it\u2019s hurting them; it\u2019s not good for them.", "The \u201cbillions\u201d part is true \u2014 just barely. Most recent figures show monthly collections of duties on imports from\u00a0China nearly tripled after the first round of Trump\u2019s tariffs went into effect July 6, rising from an estimated $1.24 billion in June to $3.65 billion in October. Estimated collections were $3.30 billion in November, the most recent month for which the U.S. Census Bureau has released estimates, which may vary somewhat from actual collections. (Figures for December are delayed, due to the partial government shutdown.)", "But those increased tariff duties aren\u2019t paid by China, or even by Chinese companies.\u00a0Import duties are paid by U.S. importers, either directly or more commonly through customs brokers. The government\u2019s \u201cGuide for Commercial Importers\u201d advises those who use brokers to make out a separate check \u201cpayable to \u2018U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019 for those customs charges, which the broker will then deliver to CBP.\u201d", "And importers \u2014 including big retailers like Walmart and Target \u2014 face pressure to pass on those increased costs to consumers in the form of higher prices. The National Retail Federation calls Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201ca tax on American families.\u201d", "That was echoed by the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue, in his annual \u201cState of American Business\u201d address on Jan. 10. He said, \u201cLet me be very clear. Tariffs are taxes paid by American families and American businesses \u2014 not by foreigners.\u201d", "Indeed, the pro-business Tax Foundation estimates that the tariff increases put into effect thus far \u2014 on goods from China as well as other countries \u2014 will increase federal revenue by nearly $42 billion annually, but also will cost the economy over $30 billion in reduced growth\u00a0over an unspecified number of years, diminish job growth by more than 94,000 jobs, and hold down wage growth to 0.08 percent below where it would otherwise be.", "Some argue that overall, the tariffs cost Chinese companies more than they cost U.S. consumers. Back in November, a study by EconPol Europe\u00a0concluded that Trump\u2019s threatened increase in the tariffs to 25 percent would raise \u201cUS consumer prices on all affected Chinese products by only 4.5% on average, while the producer price of Chinese firms declines by 20.5%.\u201d As it happened, Trump delayed that increase pending trade talks with China, which are continuing.", "So Trump is correct when he says the tariffs on China\u2019s goods are \u201cbad for them.\u201d\u00a0 The levies may even be worse for the Chinese than for Americans \u2014 and possibly could induce China to agree to a trade deal that reduces tariffs and curbs some practices that the U.S. has long seen as unfair, such as China\u2019s appropriation of U.S. intellectual property.", "But to say that \u201cChina is paying us\u201d is not just an oversimplification \u2014 it\u2019s wrong.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
