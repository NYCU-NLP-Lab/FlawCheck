One of them \u2014 about what can and can\u2019t be asked of witnesses \u2014 is false, and another (that no \u201cinvolvement\u201d by Trump\u2019s counsel is permitted) is misleading.", "We\u2019ll explain below.", "Some background: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in late September that the House would launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. The investigation is being carried out by multiple committees and focusing on Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. In particular, the inquiry is exploring his decision to withhold appropriated security aid to Ukraine \u2014 and whether he did so to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to investigate Democrats and former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 political opponent. (For more, see \u201cWhat We\u2019ve Learned From Impeachment Inquiry.\u201d)", "While the investigative work done to date has occurred behind closed doors, the Oct. 31 resolution, which codifies aspects of the probe and formalizes how it will proceed, paved the way for a more public airing of the evidence.", "One of the purported rules of the inquiry listed in the viral posts distorts the facts about what authority Trump\u2019s attorney will have during the House\u2019s investigation.", "\u201cThe rules do not allow involvement of the President\u2019s legal counsel,\u201d the social media posts read.", "While some Republicans have criticized the fact that Trump\u2019s counsel is not permitted to take part in the House intelligence committee\u2019s probe \u2014 which is to include public hearings \u2014 there is involvement by the president\u2019s team incorporated into the phase handled by the House Judiciary Committee.", "The intelligence committee, according to the resolution, is expected to issue a report on its findings (in coordination with other committees) to the Judiciary Committee, which will ultimately decide whether to draft articles of impeachment. If the articles are approved by a simple majority in the House, then a trial would be held in the Senate.", "The resolution says:", "The House authorizes the Committee on the Judiciary to conduct proceedings relating to the impeachment inquiry referenced in the first section of this resolution pursuant to the procedures submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the chair of the Committee on Rules, including such procedures as to allow for the participation of the President and his counsel.", "The procedures for the judiciary committee\u2019s part of the impeachment inquiry were printed in the Congressional Record on Oct. 29, and they outline a number of ways the president\u2019s counsel may be involved in the inquiry.", "For example, the procedures say that the president\u2019s counsel shall be given copies of certain records and depositions related to the inquiry and that his counsel can submit written requests for additional testimony or evidence.", "Also, when witnesses are called to testify, the procedures say, \u201cthe President and his counsel shall be invited to attend all hearings, including any held in executive session\u201d \u2014 and that Trump\u2019s counsel will have the right to raise objections to \u201cthe examination of witnesses or to the admissibility of testimony and evidence.\u201d", "The procedures also say \u201cthe President\u2019s counsel may question any witness called before the Committee, subject to instructions from the chair or presiding member respecting the time, scope and duration of the examination.\u201d", "It\u2019s worth noting that one provision among the procedures indicates that, \u201cshould the President unlawfully refuse to make witnesses available for testimony, or to produce documents requested by\u201d any of the investigative committees, \u201cthe chair shall have the discretion to impose appropriate remedies, including by denying specific requests by the President or his counsel under these procedures to call or question witnesses.\u201d", "The committee chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, told CQ Roll Call that the provision is \u201cjust a precaution.\u201d", "So, while some Republicans have objected to the absence of Trump\u2019s counsel in the intelligence committee proceedings, it is not correct to simply say that the \u201crules do not allow involvement of the President\u2019s legal counsel.\u201d", "The posts also claim that the \u201crules do not allow any witnesses to be questioned unless the question is approved by Adam Schiff.\u201d Schiff, a Democrat, is chairman of the intelligence committee.", "There is no language in the resolution that requires such approval.", "The resolution indicates that Schiff and Rep. Devin Nunes, the highest-ranking Republican on the committee, shall be given equal time to question a witness \u2014 which may be conducted by staff \u2014 and then the committee \u201cshall proceed with questioning under the five-minute rule\u201d established in the Rules of the House of Representatives. The corresponding section of the House rules states that \u201ceach committee shall apply the five-minute rule during the questioning of witnesses in a hearing until such time as each member of the committee who so desires has had an opportunity to question each witness.\u201d", "In other words, both Republicans and Democrats on the committee will be afforded time to ask witnesses questions. And, as we said, there is no requirement that members have questions approved by Schiff first.", "Finally, the posts say that the \u201crules do not allow any witness to be called unless the witness is approved by Adam Schiff.\u201d That is mostly correct.", "Regarding the intelligence committee\u2019s work, the resolution allows the \u201cranking minority member\u201d \u2014 Nunes \u2014 to make \u201crequests for witness testimony.\u201d", "And while it authorizes Nunes to issue subpoenas for witnesses or documents, that power is to be exercised \u201cwith the concurrence of the chair.\u201d", "If Schiff \u201cdeclines to concur in a proposed action of the ranking minority member,\u201d then Nunes can ask that the committee vote to determine whether the action should be taken.
