The former Prez and First Lady have been renting the house this summer and loved it so much, we've learned they made an offer. The property is listed at $14,850,000. Our sources say they're paying less, but we don't know how much.", "The details of the potential sale were not made public at the time and, as TMZ reported, \u201cit's not a done deal just yet. We're told there are contingencies so it's possible it could fall apart.\u201d The property in question in the affluent Massachusetts community was listed at just shy of $15 million and does have waterfront access.", "As of Sept. 6, 2019, no sales report of the purchase had been logged with the Dukes County Registry of Deeds.

Reynolds, as trustee of The 79 Turkeyland Cove Road Nominee Trust.\" Multiple news reports have identified Reynolds as a longtime friend of the former first family, but none of the documents available through the Dukes Country Registry of Deeds mentioned the Obamas by name at the time.", "In August 2021, however, news coverage of plans for Obama's 60th birthday party made clear he is the owner of the property.
