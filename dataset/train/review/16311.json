The unemployment rate continued to drop, from 4.7% when Trump took office to a 50-year low of 3.5% under Trump, before the COVID-19 pandemic sent it shooting up to the worst levels since the 1930s.

It argued that Biden\u2019s earlier comments about Trump\u2019s \u201crecord of hysteria and xenophobia\u201d weren\u2019t a reference to the restrictions, though they were made the same day those travel prohibitions were announced, as we\u2019ve explained.", "Stefanik also talked about Trump\u2019s support of the U.S. military, saying he signed \u201cthe largest pay raise for our troops in a decade.\u201d It\u2019s true that basic military pay in January increased by 3.1% \u2014 the largest increase since 2010, according to the Defense Department.", "But, as we have written several times, Trump was following federal law, which sets pay raises by a statutory formula. \u201cUnder current law, the pay raise for service members is, by default, set to equal the percentage change in\u201d the employment cost index for private-sector workers\u2019 wages and salaries, as the Congressional Budget Office explained in a\u00a02018 report.", "Pence falsely\u00a0claimed\u00a0that Biden would \u201cabolish fossil fuels\u201d and \u201cend fracking.\u201d But Biden\u2019s climate platform doesn\u2019t go that far.", "As we\u00a0explained\u00a0on the first night of the convention when similar claims were made, Biden\u00a0wants\u00a0to prohibit new oil and gas leases on public lands and waters. That would allow existing permits to continue and wouldn\u2019t affect activity on private land.", "Longer-term, Biden is aiming to reach\u00a0net-zero emissions\u00a0no later than 2050, which would almost certainly require a large reduction in the use of fossil fuels. But that\u2019s decades into the future and it\u2019s not a ban, since carbon capture and other technologies could be paired with those energy sources to meet the net-zero goal.", "Throughout the night, multiple speakers exaggerated Biden\u2019s position on abortion. Pence\u00a0said, \u201cJoe Biden, he supports taxpayer funding of abortion right up to the moment of birth.\u201d Sister Deirdre \u201cDede\u201d Byrne, of the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, similarly\u00a0said that Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, \u201care the most anti-life presidential ticket ever, even supporting the horrors of late-term abortion and infanticide.\u201d", "As we\u00a0wrote\u00a0on the first convention night, Biden has said that he backs codifying\u00a0Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision, into federal law. That ruling guaranteed a woman\u2019s right to an abortion before the end of the first trimester, but permits additional regulations or prohibitions\u00a0on terminating a pregnancy once a fetus becomes viable outside the womb.", "Furthermore, killing an infant after it is born is illegal, and Biden does not condone that.", "Pence\u2019s statement is a reference to Biden\u2019s recent\u00a0reversal\u00a0on the\u00a0Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding from being used to pay for an abortion unless the mother\u2019s life is in danger or the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. In practice, it has meant that many abortions, including abortions in the first trimester, are not available to low-income people on Medicaid and other governmental health insurance programs. Biden previously supported Hyde, but\u00a0said in June 2019 he had changed his mind.", "It\u2019s worth iterating how uncommon abortions are further into pregnancy. According to a 2018 CDC report, 65.4% of abortions in 2015 were performed within the first eight weeks of pregnancy and 91.1% occurred by the end of the first trimester. Only 1.3% of abortions were done after 21 weeks, or about halfway through gestation.", "Continuing a talking point that has\u00a0pervaded\u00a0the Republican convention, Pence\u00a0falsely claimed\u00a0\u201cJoe Biden is for open borders.\u201d", "As we have written, Biden supports a more open and\u00a0welcoming\u00a0immigration policy than the one championed by Trump. In 2013, Biden supported the so-called\u00a0Gang of Eight immigration bill\u00a0that would have provided\u00a0a path to earned citizenship for those then in the country illegally, but which also would have included significant investments in border security (including\u00a0350 miles of new fencing). During the campaign, Biden has vowed that he will halt construction of any more border wall, though he has\u00a0stopped short\u00a0of saying he would dismantle any fencing constructed during the Trump administration.", "\u201cI\u2019m going to make sure that we have border protection, but it\u2019s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. And at the ports of entry \u2014 that\u2019s where all the bad stuff is happening,\u201d\u00a0Biden said\u00a0in an interview on Aug. 5.", "Pence was misleading when he said Trump has \u201csecured our border and built nearly 300 miles of that border wall.\u201d", "According to an Aug. 7\u00a0story\u00a0in the\u00a0San Antonio Express-News, only five miles of new fencing have been constructed. The paper said 260 miles of replacement and secondary walls have been built. The border is about 2,000 miles. The paper said its story was based on data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.", "A wall on the Mexican border to keep out immigrants trying to illegally cross the border was a major campaign issue in 2016 for Trump and a frequent rallying cry since. Trump promised that Mexico would pay for the wall.", "In our June 5\u00a0story, we reported that 194 miles of new fencing had been built under Trump as of May 22 and included only about \u201c3 miles of new border wall system constructed in locations where no barriers previously existed,\u201d according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.", "The Trump administration has allocated funding for 400 miles of replacement walls, 57 miles of new secondary fencing and 281 miles of new primary walls, the Express-News\u00a0said.", "Pence\u00a0wrongly claimed\u00a0that \u201cBiden wants to end school choice.\u201d", "As\u00a0we have written, Biden opposes federal funding going to \u201cfor-profit charter schools,\u201d but schools managed by for-profit companies make up only a fraction of charter schools. The current percentage of charter schools that contract with Education Management Organizations, or\u00a0EMOs\u00a0\u2014 which are for-profit entities hired to manage charter schools \u2014 is about 10%, a researcher for the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools told us in July.", "And while Biden opposes vouchers for private school tuition \u2014 the ultimate in school choice for some \u2014 he does not oppose students choosing between public schools, magnet schools and high-performing charter schools.", "According to a statement provided by a Biden campaign official to FactCheck.org in July, \u201cVP Biden will do everything he can to help traditional public schools, which is what most students attend. As president, he will ban for-profit charter schools from receiving federal funds. He will also make sure that we stop funding charter schools that don\u2019t provide results.\u201d The campaign added that Biden \u201cdoes not oppose districts letting parents choose to send their children to \u2026 high-performing public charters.\u201d", "Promoting Trump\u2019s actions on behalf of veterans, Pence gave a misleading summary of the evolution of the Veterans Choice Program.", "\u201cAnd after years of scandal that robbed our veterans of the care that you earned in the uniform of the United States, President Trump kept his word again,\u201d he said, referring to\u00a0excessively long wait times for patients treated at VA hospitals. \u201cWe reformed the VA and veterans choice is now available for every veteran in America.\u201d", "While Pence makes it seem as though the president was the one to implement changes to improve wait times and health care for veterans, the Veterans Choice Program got its start well before\u00a0Trump entered office.", "The program allowed veterans to seek health care outside the VA system if individuals lived far from VA facilities or had difficulty getting an appointment. Obama signed bipartisan legislation creating the program in August 2014.", "Trump\u00a0continued\u00a0the program, and in July 2018 signed the VA MISSION Act \u2014 another piece of bipartisan legislation \u2014 that extended Veterans Choice for another year and then replaced the program with the\u00a0Veterans Community Care Program, which\u00a0began\u00a0in June 2019.", "The new program is similar, but more expansive. According to a 2018 Congressional Budget Office\u00a0report, the Veterans Community Care Program is expected to refer an additional 640,000 veterans outside the VA health system in its early years. Still, there are eligibility requirements\u00a0that veterans must meet to be able to receive care through the program.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
