["About this rating", "Sen. Ted Cruz is under fire for taking a flight to the resort town of Canc\u00fan, Mexico, on Feb. 17, 2021, as his home state of Texas underwent severe winter storms. Cruz returned the next day, saying the trip was \u201cobviously a mistake.\u201d Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people lost access to heat and electricity, and millions were forced to boil their own tap water before drinking it because of damaged infrastructure.", "As a result, a screenshot of a tweet claiming to be from his Twitter account began circulating on the internet, in which Cruz allegedly said, \u201cI\u2019ll believe in climate change when Texas freezes over.\u201d The tweet appeared to be from Sept. 8, 2016.", "We looked through Cruz\u2019 Twitter history, and there is no record of him having tweeted this, even in archived versions of his page from Sept. 2016. A look at ProPublica's deleted tweets archive also showed no results from that date. He was also never quoted saying this publicly based on online searches.", "Other memes emerged quoting Cruz, without attributing the tweets as well. This particular meme said \u201cSatire\u201d on the bottom right.", "The exact origin of the quote is unclear, but we found the same quote on a website called Tjshome.com on a page stating, \u201cFunny Status Messages and Tweets.\u201d This particular quote was added to the list on Feb. 18, 2021, in the midst of the power crisis in Texas. Others on the page appeared to be one-line jokes.", "Given that the quote was not tweeted from Ted Cruz\u2019 account, and there is no record of him saying this, we rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "Feb. 20, 2021: Corrected claim rating in last paragraph.", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
