["By Eugene Kiely, Jessica McDonald, D'Angelo Gore, Lori Robertson and Rem Rieder", "Posted on July 20, 2020", "President Donald Trump\u2019s extraordinary interview with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace, who frequently fact-checked the president in real time, contained a long list of false, misleading and unsubstantiated claims:", "In the\u00a0interview, which took place on the patio outside the Oval Office, the president also repeated numerous bogus talking points, including about presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s immigration proposals, Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s alleged \u201cmistakes\u201d and the U.S. economy.", "The president falsely claimed once again that the U.S. has \u201cone of the lowest mortality rates\u201d for COVID-19 of any country, and distorted the facts about the harm caused by the coronavirus.", "Trump claimed that other countries \u2014 later pointing to Europe \u2014 are only testing for COVID-19 if someone is \u201creally sick,\u201d saying the \u201cmassive\u201d testing in the U.S. \u201creally skews the numbers.\u201d", "But that\u2019s not what testing data indicate. Many countries, including in Europe, have conducted more tests per confirmed case of COVID-19 than the U.S.", "If other countries have tested more people than have actually had the disease, compared with the U.S., that suggests those countries couldn\u2019t have been only testing the \u201creally sick.\u201d", "Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, told us in an email that\u00a0\u201ctests per confirmed case provides an indication of how aggressively a country is testing. And many countries are at much higher rates than the US.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s claim is a new twist on his repeated false assertion that increased testing is the only reason some states in the U.S. have seen an uptick in new COVID-19 cases in recent weeks.", "The president first told Wallace this about other countries\u2019 testing programs:", "Trump, July 17: You look at other countries; they don\u2019t even do tests. They do tests if somebody walks into the hospital, they\u2019re sick, they\u2019re really sick, they test them then, or they\u2019ll test them in a doctor\u2019s office. But they don\u2019t go around, have massive areas of testing and we do. And I\u2019m glad we do, but it really skews the numbers.", "Later in the interview, he singled out Europe and dismissed the possibility that the European Union doesn\u2019t have as bad of an outbreak as the U.S. does now.", "Trump: Take a look at Europe, take a look at the numbers in Europe. And by the way, they\u2019re having surges.", "Wallace: I can tell you cases are 6,000 in the whole European Union.", "Trump: They don\u2019t test. They don\u2019t test like we do.", "Wallace:\u00a0Is it possible that they don\u2019t have the virus as badly as we do?", "Trump: It\u2019s possible that they don\u2019t test, that\u2019s what\u2019s possible.", "According to the University of Oxford-based project Our World in Data, several European countries\u2019 testing policies are open testing for anyone, including those without any symptoms; those countries include Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Portugal, Greece and Iceland. That\u2019s the current policy in the United States.", "Many other countries in Europe, including Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom, test \u201canyone with symptoms.\u201d Only a handful of countries have more restrictive testing policies for those with symptoms and other criteria, such as having been admitted to the hospital or in contact with someone who has COVID-19. Those countries include Bulgaria, Hungary, Kosovo, Serbia and Albania.", "Experts have told us before that looking at the test positivity rate \u2014 the percentage of conducted tests that are positive \u2014 shows whether a country is doing enough testing. By that measure, nearly all European countries, as well as many other countries around the globe, are doing better than the United States.", "\u201cThe way we can tell whether a country is only testing people who are sick enough to show up at a hospital is to look at their test positivity,\u201d Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us in an email. \u201cWhen positivity is high, it means a country is likely only testing the sickest of the sick. But if positivity is lower, then the country is likely casting a wide net to look for infections and count them as cases.\u201d", "Nuzzo cited New York state as an example. In the spring, when the state was only able to test those sick enough to be hospitalized, the positivity rate was as high as 50.7%. \u201cNow that it has expanded testing, [its] positivity has fallen quite dramatically and is now less than 2%,\u201d she said.", "Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the U.S. has an average daily positivity rate of 6.45%. Several countries, including Germany, Spain, Italy, Iceland, Greece and Norway, have lower rates. Among European countries, only France and Sweden have higher rates.", "Nuzzo said it\u2019s possible some countries have restricted testing only to the hospitalized, but \u201cthe data from many countries in Europe and elsewhere suggest they are doing a better job of finding infections than the US.\u201d", "Another way of looking at positivity is the number of tests per confirmed case. The U.S. has conducted 12.4 or 13.2 tests per confirmed case, depending on the data source used, but European countries, and others across the globe, have conducted more tests per case, according to Our World in Data.", "For example, the United Kingdom and Italy \u2014 two countries that have faced sizable outbreaks of COVID-19 \u2014 have conducted 27.4 and 25.6 tests per case, respectively. (Only France and Sweden, among European countries, rank lower than the U.S., but the available information for those two countries dates back to early July and May. We don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s still the case.)", "We can also look at tests per confirmed case over time through the seven-day rolling average. By that measure, the U.S. is currently conducting fewer tests per confirmed case than the 30-some European countries for which Our World in Data has figures.", "The difference in the trajectory of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. compared with European countries is striking.", "In a July 20 Wall Street Journal article, Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute said the \u201cfundamental difference\u201d was that \u201cEurope has taken the virus seriously, and America largely has not.\u201d Jha told the newspaper: \u201cWe didn\u2019t build testing and tracing programs, and in parts of the country we didn\u2019t even bring cases down. We have done things half way.\u201d", "In discussing the economy and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump claimed that states were backpedaling on reopening \u201con purpose,\u201d and singled out California as having \u201cno reason\u201d to do so other than politics.", "Wallace: With states now rolling back some of the reopening and\u2026", "Trump: On purpose.", "Wallace: Well, there are a lot of Republican \u2026", "Trump: On purpose.", "Wallace: Well, there are a lot of Republican states, like Texas \u2026", "Trump: There is no reason \u2026", "Wallace: And here\u2019s \u2026", "Trump: They\u2019ll be open very soon.", "Wallace: Let me just ask my question.", "Trump: There\u2019s no reason for California to be doing what they\u2019re doing.", "Wallace: Alright.", "Trump: Except for Nov. 3rd.", "There is no evidence that California or other states are halting or reversing their reopenings for political reasons.", "On the contrary, multiple states have concerning trends, such as increases in COVID-19 cases and test positivity, that public health experts \u2014 including those on the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force \u2014 say warrant business closures and other precautions.", "On July 13, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he was shutting down indoor operations of bars, restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, card rooms, and zoos and museums across the state. Counties failing to meet certain metrics would additionally have to close fitness centers, places of worship, offices for non-critical sectors, hair salons, barbershops and indoor malls.", "In a press conference, Newsom said the seven-day rolling average for new coronavirus cases was on the rise, and that over the past two weeks, hospitalizations had increased 28%, ICU admissions had increased 20%, and the two-week average test positivity rate had also gone up 21%, to 7.4%.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a consequence of [an] increase in positivity rate, increase in hospitalizations, in ICUs,\u201d Newsom said of the decision to pullback on reopening, adding that it was not an \u201con and off switch,\u201d but rather a dimmer switch intended to be responsive to changing conditions.", "Newsom is not the only person to be worried about the coronavirus trends in his state. In a July 8 task force briefing, Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx specifically noted the \u201cincrease in the number of test positives and rapid increase in cases\u201d in California and referenced state-level governmental action.", "\u201cI think the work that these governors have done to \u2014 and ask the American people is it\u2019s stop going to bars, to close the bars, to move to outdoor dining, to decrease indoor \u2014 any kind of indoor gatherings again,\u201d she said.", "Birx identified Texas, Arizona, Florida and California as four of the most concerning states, and alluded to a task force report labeling \u201cred zone\u201d localities.", "\u201cTo all of the Americans out there that are in these four states and the states that have \u2014 in the report, were in the red zone \u2014 because there\u2019s a series of other states that we have in that zone,\u201d she said, \u201cis really asking the American people in those counties and in those states \u2014 in those states to not only use the face coverings \u2014 not going to bars, not going to indoor dining \u2014 but really not gathering in homes either and decreasing those gatherings back down to our phase one recommendation, which was 10 or less.\u201d", "The Center for Public Integrity obtained a July 14 edition of the report, which lists 18 states as being in the \u201cred zone\u201d for new COVID-19 cases, or more than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the last week. Eleven states were in the \u201cred zone\u201d for test positivity, with figures above 10%.", "According to the report, California was in the red for new cases and the yellow for test positivity, with 9.3% of tests coming back positive.", "Under the policy recommendations for California\u2019s 14 red counties, the task force report suggested that public officials \u201c[c]lose bars and gyms, and create outdoor dining opportunities with pedestrian areas\u201d and \u201c[l]imit social gatherings to 10 people or fewer.\u201d", "For California\u2019s 17 yellow counties, the report recommended that officials \u201c[l]imit gyms to 25% occupancy and close bars until percent positive rates are under 3%; create outdoor dining opportunities with pedestrian areas\u201d and \u201c\u201c[l]imit social gatherings to 25 people or fewer.\u201d", "Dr. Anthony Fauci, a coronavirus task force member and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a June 24 interview with the Sacramento Press Club that it might be necessary to pause or back down from some reopening if trends started to move in the wrong direction.", "Praising Newsom for having a \u201creally good sense of [what] to do,\u201d Fauci explained that the options were not limited to all or none.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t really need to go back to lockdown,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to pause and say, wait a minute, we [started] opening, and things aren\u2019t going right. What do we need to do to correct that? Now, you may need to stay where you are and impose a few more restrictions. Or, maybe back up a little. But again, just like you don\u2019t want to open in an all or none, you don\u2019t want to start locking down completely.\u201d", "Newsom\u2019s plan is not a complete lockdown, and allows many businesses to continue to operate outside.", "There may be differing opinions on the degree and type of restrictions to put in place, but California\u2019s limitations are predicated on specific metrics and are an effort to avoid further transmission of the coronavirus.", "Trump said Seattle officials finally acted to clear a protest zone near a police precinct in the city because he was sending in federal forces to do so.", "Trump: We have forced them in Seattle to end the CHOP [Capitol Hill Organized Protest] because, you know, we were going in that following day. You probably have heard it. We were getting ready to go in. We were all set, and when they heard that we were going they set their police force.", "But Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan had already told the Washington Post that neither Trump, nor the White House, ever notified her, or her office, that federal troops were being sent in. In fact, Durkan said Trump had nothing to do with her decision to order Seattle police to end the protests that started in early June, not long after George Floyd died while in Minneapolis police custody.", "Durkan denied having ever heard from Trump after he made a similar claim during a July 9 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. In that interview, Trump told Hannity: \u201cWe were going in, we were going in very soon. We let them know that. And they, all of a sudden, they didn\u2019t want that, so they went in before we got there.\u201d", "Durkan and her office said no notice was given, according to a Washington Post story published a day after the Hannity interview.", "\u201cHe never contacted me or my office to warn us,\u201d Durkan told the Post. \u201cWe had no conversations whatsoever with the White House about anything related to the protests, Capitol Hill, or anything along these lines.\u201d", "On June 30, Durkan signed an executive order declaring the weekslong protests near the Seattle Police Department East Precinct and Cal Anderson Park area an \u201cunlawful assembly.\u201d The order noted that the protests, which reportedly started out largely peaceful, had seen an increase in violence, including at least two fatal shootings.", "On July 1, Seattle Police, who had previously ceded the area to protesters, began to enforce the mayor\u2019s order to clear the area.", "But, as the Washington Post reported on July 10: \u201cDurkan categorically rejected any suggestion that this was related to anything Trump or anyone around him communicated \u2014 privately or publicly. Her office told us that serious conversations between the mayor\u2019s office and the police chief and community groups about ending the protests began around June 22.\u201d", "Trump did post tweets in mid-June threatening, or suggesting, federal action. But there is no indication that there was a plan to back up those threats.", "\u201cCongress should investigate whether there was actually a plan to send federal forces into an American city,\u201d the Washington Post quoted Durkan as saying.", "Trump falsely claimed that he \u201cgot soldiers the biggest pay raises in the history of our military.\u201d", "In the current fiscal year, basic military pay increased by 3.1% \u2014 the largest during the Trump administration, according to a Department of Defense chart of annual pay raises since 2007. But that chart also shows there were larger pay hikes in 2008 (3.5%), 2009 (3.9%) and 2010 (3.4%).", "The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service provides a table back to 2002 that shows there were larger increases in basic military pay in seven of the last 19 years, including 5% in 2002 and 4.1% in 2003.", "The president\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 would raise basic military pay by 3%.", "Also, as we have written on other occasions, military pay increases are determined by a statutory formula \u2014 unless overridden by the president and/or Congress.", "\u201cUnder current law, the pay raise for service members is, by default, set to equal the percentage change in\u201d the employment cost index for private-sector workers\u2019 wages and salaries, as the Congressional Budget Office explained in a 2018 report.", "The president can \u201cspecify an alternative pay adjustment that supersedes the automatic adjustment,\u201d and Congress can pass legislation that would \u201csupersede the automatic adjustment and/or any presidential adjustment,\u201d the CRS said in a May 6, 2019, report.", "In his first budget, Trump proposed\u00a0an increase of 2.1% \u2014 less than the 2.4% level set by the statutory formula for fiscal year 2018. Congress overrode the president\u2019s proposal and provided the full military pay hike, according to the CRS report. Trump\u2019s next three proposed budgets all followed the statutory formula, according to CRS and the White House fiscal 2021 budget proposal.", "Fauci\u2019s COVID-19 comments. Trump claimed Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, initially said of COVID-19: \u201cThis will pass. Don\u2019t worry about it. This will pass.\u201d Trump added: \u201cHe was wrong.\u201d", "But that\u2019s not exactly what Fauci said.", "In a\u00a0Jan. 21 interview on Newsmax TV \u2014 which was highlighted in a\u00a0memo the White House sent to some news outlets \u2014 Fauci said: \u201cWell, you know, obviously we need to take it seriously and do the kinds of things that the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and the Department of Homeland Security are doing. But this is not a major threat for the people in the U.S., and this is not something that the citizens of the U.S. right now should be worried about.\u201d", "Jan. 21 was the day the CDC announced the first U.S. case of the disease; relatively little was known about the virus at the time. Still, Fauci qualified his statement about the virus by saying there was no need to worry \u201cright now\u201d and \u201cwe need to take it seriously.\u201d", "Also, in a\u00a0Feb. 29 interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, which was also cited in the White House memo, Fauci said that \u201cright now at this moment\u201d the risk was \u201clow\u201d and there was \u201cno need\u201d for people \u201cto change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis.\u201d But, he warned, \u201cWhen you start to see community spread\u201d \u2014 which is when the source of infection is unknown \u2014 \u201cthis could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.\u201d Fauci added that it could develop into a \u201cmajor outbreak,\u201d which is exactly what happened.", "We wrote about Fauci\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show interview in late April.", "Not the lowest COVID-19 mortality rate. As he has before, Trump falsely said the U.S has the \u201cnumber one low mortality rate,\u201d alternately saying when pressed, \u201cI heard we have one of the lowest, maybe the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world.\u201d", "As Wallace explained in the televised interview, the Our World in Data figures the president contends demonstrate the nation\u2019s low COVID-19 case fatality rate do not show that, as many countries are left off of the graph Trump produced. And even on the president\u2019s graph, which was dated July 17, three countries bested America: Brazil, South Korea and Iceland.", "Data collected by Johns Hopkins University also\u00a0do not show\u00a0the U.S. with a particularly low mortality rate. Of the 20 most affected countries, the U.S. had the seventh highest observed case fatality ratio and the third highest number of deaths per capita at the time of the interview.", "Misleads on COVID-19 severity. In response to Wallace noting that COVID-19 cases are up 194%, while testing is only up 37%, Trump downplayed the concern, instead focusing on COVID-19 not being deadly to most people.", "\u201cMany of those cases are young people that would heal in a day. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of them \u2014 don\u2019t forget, I guess it\u2019s like 99.7%, people are going to get better and in many cases they\u2019re going to get better very quickly.\u201d", "It is true that younger people are less likely to die from COVID-19, although it still happens. But Trump overstates the percentage of people who survive the disease, and also misleadingly suggests, as he has\u00a0before\u00a0when he claimed 99% of coronavirus cases are \u201ctotally harmless,\u201d that anyone who doesn\u2019t die is left unscathed.", "Scientists\u00a0estimate\u00a0that between 0.6% and 1% of all people who contract the coronavirus will die, with higher rates of death among the elderly and those with chronic conditions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, around 14% of cases are\u00a0severe\u00a0or\u00a0require hospitalization, which means a sizable fraction of people are not simply those with \u201csniffles.\u201d", "Furthermore, some reports suggest that a proportion of COVID-19 patients do not recover quickly. Anecdotally, numerous patients have\u00a0reported\u00a0months of lingering symptoms, even after \u201cmild\u201d COVID-19 infections.", "A July 9\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association\u00a0also found that among 143 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Italy, only 18 (12.6%) were completely free of symptoms after an average of two months, while nearly a third had one or two symptoms and more than half had three or more. The most common symptoms were fatigue, difficulty breathing, and joint and chest pain; 44% of patients reported having a worse quality of life relative to before their infections.", "Not the \u201cgreatest economy.\u201d Trump repeated one of his favorite false talking points: \u201cI built the greatest economy ever built anywhere in the world; not only of this country, anywhere in the world.\u201d", "Under Trump, the economy \u2014 as measured by the real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product \u2014 grew 2.3% last year, 2.9% in 2018 and 2.4% in 2017, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\u00a0Over\u00a0the last 39 years \u2014 dating to Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency \u2014 the nation\u2019s real economic growth has reached or exceeded Trump\u2019s peak year of 2.9% 19 times, most recently in 2015.", "The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5% or more in seven straight years in the 1980s, including a high of 7.2% in 1984 under Reagan.", "False claims on immigration. Trump also falsely said that the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations would \u201cabolish immigration detention\u201d and \u201cend prosecution of illegal border crossers.\u201d Trump made similar misstatements in his remarks in the White House Rose Garden on July 14.", "As we have written, the recommendations call for using detention as a \u201clast resort, not the default.\u201d They also call for ending the use of for-profit detention centers. But they do not call for abolishing detention.", "Similarly, the task force calls for reducing the number of prosecutions, not eliminating them. It calls for scrapping the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy and focusing on prosecuting \u201chuman traffickers, smugglers\u201d and other serious criminals.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
