["The narrative around coronavirus pandemic has taken a turn for the worse in India with a majority of social media users and mainstream media outlets not only pinning the blame on the Muslim community but also accusing it of intentionally spreading the infection. Since Nizamuddin Markaz was identified as a COVID-19 hotspot, Alt News has been inundated with random \u2018spitting\u2019 and \u2018sneezing\u2019 videos shared with a false Muslim angle.", "In an April 11 broadcast, India TV praised the government for working \u201c24\u00d77\u201d to fight the virus outbreak. However, the channel claimed that the efforts are being derailed because of the weakest link i.e., Tablighi Jamaat. \u201cThere is another big accusation against the Jamaat \u2013 of spitting. Where did they catch the disease of spitting? Which Mulana gave them the symptoms of the virus, India TV has investigated,\u201d said the anchor during the show.", "The channel subsequently played a video of an Islamic preacher saying \u2013 \u201cTo save yourself from the clutches of demons, read the Surah Al-Ikhlas and spit thrice on the left-hand side\u201d \u2013 and paused before he was finished. The music playing in the background would put even directors of Hindi soap operas to shame. \u201cIf you do not believe what you saw and heard, watch again and hear with your ears wide open so that no confusion is left.\u201d The video is played for a second time and the anchor goes on the ask questions that would sound ridiculous to the sane mind \u2013 \u201cWhy do Jamaatis spit?\u201d He further says that there have been reports of Jamaatis spitting on doctors and nurses in isolation wards. The anchor introduces the preacher as Faiz Syed and asks, \u201cDoes religion teaches to spit on doctors and nurses?\u201d", "Throughout the show, the channel attempt to blame a certain \u2018maulana\u2019 for the spread of coronavirus. Below is one example of the many obnoxious questions flashed by India TV \u2013 \u201cWhich maulana\u2019s brainchild is Jamaat\u2019s coronavirus symptoms?\u201d", "The video played by India TV is three years old. It was shared by the YouTube channel IRC TV on October 25, 2017. Faiz Syed is an Islamic preacher and the founder of Islamic Research Centre (IRC).", "The video is titled, \u201cAgar Kisi Ko Allah Ki Zaat Par Waswasa \u2013 Whispers Aaye To Kya Kare By Adv. Faiz Syed\u201d. This translates to \u2013 \u201cWhat should one do when they get whispers (evil or negative thoughts) about the existence of Allah.\u201d", "In his speech, Faiz Syed first quotes a hadith (sayings of Prophet Mohammad) and advises on what to do if their minds are riddled with evil thoughts on the existence of Allah. He asks people to recite from the Surah Al-Ikhlas (112th chapter of the Quran) \u2013 \u201cHe is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent\u201d \u2013 and spit three times on the left-hand side.", "Syed then refers to another hadith which talks about warding off evil thoughts (Shaitan) during prayers. The book \u2018Waswasah: The Whispering of the Shaitan\u2019 says that the Prophet was once asked by his companion: \u201cO Messenger of Allah, Satan intervenes between me and my prayer and he confounds me,\u201d to which the Prophet replied, \u201cThat is the doing of the Satan who is known as khinzab; when you perceive its effect, seek refuge with Allah from it, and spit three times to your left.\u201d", "Alt News spoke with an Islamic scholar who explained that the \u2018spitting\u2019 is not literal ejection of saliva but a gesture. \u201cWhen evil thoughts come to one\u2019s mind during prayers or meditation, they recite the Surah Al-Ikhlas and make a gesture of spitting on the left side \u2013 either say thoo thrice or spit out air. This is a psychological way of believing that after taking Allah\u2019s name, the act of \u2018spitting\u2019 ejects the Shaitan out of the body.\u201d", "Therefore, Syed quoted hadith and portions from the Quran in his speech to give advice on how to rid one\u2019s mind of negative thoughts that may either cause one to question Allah\u2019s origin or obstruct one from remembering God. At no point in his speech did he ask people to spit on others.", "India TV dug up a three-year-old video of the Islamic preacher and falsely claimed that he was advocating the spread of coronavirus by spitting. The channel did not inform its users that a day before its broadcast was aired, Syed had uploaded another video where he is saying that intentional spitting to spread the virus is a sin. He also advises people to follow government guidelines and maintain social distancing.", "Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi was identified as a coronavirus hotspot on March 31. Soon after, reports came pouring in that members of Tablighi Jamaat are spitting and misbehaving with medical workers in quarantine wards. Several reports also claimed that they defecated in the open after being refused non-vegetarian food. Despite no visual evidence and the claims debunked by local authorities, channels have continually been promoting the anti-Muslim narrative. Belgavi Commission of Police clarified that no person quarantined in the district facility has either spat or misbehaved with health workers. AIIMS Raipur also tweeted that rumours about a patient form Tablighi Jamaat spitting on doctors are untrue. Saharanpur police took to Twitter to call-out false reports by Amar Ujala and Patrika that Markaz attendees defecated in the open.", "Alt News has also been debunking several old and unrelated videos widely shared on social media to claim that members of the Muslim community have been intentionally spitting to spread the virus. However, mainstream media has now emerged as the main promoter of this dangerous piece of misinformation. The visibly hateful broadcasts and reports have manifested into common people hounding and assaulting Muslim vendors on the road. There have also been calls to boycott the community and not purchase any items from their shops.", "[Update: India TV deleted its broadcast after this fact-check was published. A link of the downloaded broadcast has been added.]", "Donate Now", "Pooja Chaudhuri is a senior editor at Alt News.", "A purported video of a Muslim man beating a temple priest with a bat is\u2026", "A picture depicting the Pakistani flag apparently bigger in size and apparently placed higher than\u2026", "Amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, a video of a fleet of cars\u2026", "On September 29, two youths named Iqbal and Rahul were involved in a bike collision\u2026", "A claim that Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has passed away went viral on social media\u2026"]
