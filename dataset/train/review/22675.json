["Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley, shown here hearing a case when she was a state appeals court judge, has been criticized for deciding as an attorney to represent a former boyfriend in a family law case. (Rick Wood photo)", "Critics of Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley say her decision to represent a former boyfriend in a contested family law case raises questions about her judgment.", "Bradley counters by noting that the judge in the case determined Bradley\u2019s representation didn\u2019t violate any ethical rules.", "And she contends that what she did is done by lawyers on a regular basis -- which is something we want to check.", "Wisconsin Public Radio host Joy Cardin asked Bradley, who is being challenged by state Appeals Court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg in the April 5, 2016 Supreme Court election, about the case.", "\"I was helping out a friend,\" Bradley responded in the March 21, 2016 interview. \"This is something that lawyers do on a regular basis, to help out friends or family members who need assistance in these types of cases.\"", "We know it\u2019s common for a lawyer to represent a friend or family member in more mundane cases, such as a speeding ticket or a real estate transaction.", "But in this instance we\u2019re talking about a business lawyer, as Bradley was, representing a former boyfriend in a family law case in which a couple was fighting over child placement.", "The case", "About a week and half before the interview, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on the family law case involving J. Andrew Bednall. Case records show Bednall\u2019s ex-wife had objected to Bradley representing Bednall. The court-appointed attorney for their son also expressed\u00a0concerns.", "Ethics rules prevent lawyers from having sexual relationships with clients. However, they do not prevent lawyers from representing clients if a romantic relationship existed prior to the attorney-client relationship.", "Bradley responded in court papers filed in 2005. She said she and Bednall previously had a romantic relationship that \"we both believed might result in marriage.\" She wrote that that part of the relationship ended in November 2002, but that they continued to date \"on a nonexclusive basis\" at the time of the custody case.", "The judge on the case declined to remove Bradley from the case on ethical grounds, according to the public filings.", "Bradley\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to our requests to back the statement we\u2019re checking.", "Family law experts", "We talked with five lawyers, four from the Milwaukee area and one from Madison, who have more than 100 years of combined experience in family law cases.", "Retired Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Lee Wells, who headed the family law division for eight years and still handles family cases as a reserve judge and mediator, said he has seen non-family law attorneys handle family cases and has seen lawyers in family cases represent someone they had or were having a relationship with.", "But he said he couldn\u2019t characterize how common it is, partly because there likely were instances where lawyers didn\u2019t disclose their lack of family law experience, or didn\u2019t disclose that they were representing someone they had been involved with romantically.", "The other four lawyers, however, said that in their decades of experience, they could not recall even one case like Bradley\u2019s, in which a lawyer represents a former boyfriend in a contested family law case.", "Our rating", "Bradley says her representation of an ex-boyfriend \"who was then my friend\" in a family law case is \"something that lawyers do on a regular basis.\"", "But we found no evidence of that.", "Four of five longtime family law lawyers told us such representation is not done regularly -- they had never seen a lawyer represent a former boyfriend in a contested family law case. The other expert said he could recall cases similar to Bradley\u2019s, but couldn\u2019t say whether they occurred on a regular basis.", "We rate Bradley\u2019s statement False.", "Wisconsin Public Radio, Rebecca Bradley interview (6:50), March 21, 2016", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Bradley extramarital affair, role in child placement surface,\" March 10, 2016", "Interview, retired family law lawyer and 18-year family court commissioner Lucy Cooper, March 22, 2016", "Interview, 31-year Milwaukee family law lawyer Gregg Herman, March 22, 2016", "Interview, family law lawyer and former eight-year Milwaukee County Circuit Court family law division chief Judge Lee Wells, March 23, 2016", "Interview, 31-year Milwaukee family law lawyer Martin Gagne, March 23, 2016", "Interview, 23-year Madison family law lawyer Marta Meyers, March 23, 2016", "Email, JoAnne Kloppenburg campaign manager Melissa Mulliken, March 23, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
