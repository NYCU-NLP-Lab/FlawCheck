(That turned out to be Pants on Fire-level inaccurate.)", "Now, a social media post roaming around the internet claims that a photo of the National Mall during Trump\u2019s Fourth of July \"Salute to America\" ceremony shows how few people attended, and asserts the webcam filming the celebration was purposely turned off because of it.", "The post, shared by the Other 98% Facebook page on July 4, features a picture of what appears to be a rainy, empty National Mall, with text below that reads:", "\"The webcam of the National Mall was abruptly shut down without notice and has been removed from the whitehouse.gov site. Presumably to stop viewers from seeing the lack of attendees at the #TrumpParade. We are about to relive Trump\u2019s inauguration all over again.\"", "The page also added this caption alongside the photo: \"Trump's parade was an unmitigated, absolute, outrageously expensive disaster. First of all, barely anyone showed up. The webcams on the National Mall have all been turned off without notice so no one will talk about Trump's 'crowd size'. DO NOT spread this photo around, we don't want to make our Great Leader angry.\"", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
