["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Understandably, Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan is more focused on running for vice-president than he is on seeking re-election to his southern Wisconsin House seat.\n\nBut his House opponent, Democrat Rob Zerban, continues to run hard against him.\n\nThe former Kenosha County supervisor used his first TV ad, released Oct. 4, 2012, to attack Ryan. He repeats one of the most common -- and debunked -- claims of the past year.\n\n\"Paul Ryan -- his controversial budget for America has been called dangerous, cruel and deeply wrong,\" a narrator says of the House Budget Committee chairman as the ad begins.\n\n\"The Ryan plan ends Medicare.\"\n\nNo maybes. No qualifiers. Just a straight declaration.\n\nZerban\u2019s evidence\n\nAs the claim is uttered by the narrator, the words \"End Medicare\" (in quotation marks) appear on the screen, along with a citation to a June 2011 opinion article in The New York Times.\n\nPaul Krugman, who writes The Conscience of a Liberal column, had written that \"Republicans are trying to end Medicare. The program we now call Medicare is one in which the government acts as your insurer, paying your major medical bills; coverage is guaranteed to all seniors. The program Republicans want gives you vouchers and tells you to go buy your own insurance, if you can. That\u2019s not at all the same thing.\"\n\nIt\u2019s important to underline the fact that Zerban\u2019s ad cites an opinion column. We asked Zerban if he had other evidence.\n\nCampaign spokesman Karthik Ganapathy sent us a statement citing news articles that say Ryan\u2019s plan would effectively end Medicare; end Medicare as we know it; or reform Medicare into a voucher system relying on private insurers.\n\nThe statement also quoted the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning Washington, D.C. think tank, as saying Ryan\u2019s plan would raise Medicare recipients\u2019 premiums and \"lead more of Medicare\u2019s healthier enrollees to abandon it for private plans, very possibly setting off a spiral of rising premium costs and falling enrollment for traditional Medicare. Over time, traditional Medicare would become less financially viable and could unravel.\"\n\nSo, Zerban cites news accounts and a think tank report on how Ryan would change Medicare -- substantially, to be sure -- but not end it.\n\nAnd then Zerban wavered on his claim.", "The statement his campaign sent us quotes Zerban as saying: \"We don\u2019t say anything we don\u2019t mean -- Paul Ryan\u2019s budget ends Medicare.\"", "But then Ganapathy e-mailed us to say he wanted to emphasize the ad\u2019s reference to the Times opinion article: \"We are citing other folks who claim the Ryan plan will end Medicare, not coming up with a new accusation ourselves.\"", "Zerban is hardly the first to claim Ryan\u2019s plan ends Medicare. But, no bones about it, he clearly made that allegation.", "So what would Ryan\u2019s plan do?\n\nOther evidence\n\nIn December 2011, more than nine months before Zerban\u2019s TV ad, PolitiFact National rated as its Lie of the Year for 2011 the oft-repeated Democratic line that Republicans voted \"to end Medicare\" by voting for Ryan\u2019s plan.", "(FactCheck.org has also knocked down the ends-Medicare claims.)", "PolitiFact National noted that the allegation ignores the fact that people 55 and older would remain on traditional Medicare and that, even with the privatized system under Ryan's bill, younger people would still receive a guarantee of care. Moreover, around the time the top lie was chosen, Ryan announced he was altering his plan and would retain an option for people to stay in traditional Medicare if they want.\n\nIn other words, Medicare doesn\u2019t end.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say there wouldn\u2019t be major changes.\n\nPolitiFact National rated as Mostly True a charge by President Barack Obama that Mitt Romney and Ryan want to turn Medicare into a voucher program.\n\nIn that item, our colleagues noted that under Ryan\u2019s original plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. This would have affected people who today are under 55 only. But Ryan later proposed allowing beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they could use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.\n\nSo, Medicare would remain the same for people 55 and over and it would remain an option for those who are younger.\n\nOur rating\n\nLong after the claim had been debunked, Zerban flatly stated that Ryan\u2019s budget plan \"ends Medicare.\"\n\nPeople 55 and older would remain on traditional Medicare, while those who today are under 55 could use a voucher they would receive to buy either a private insurance plan or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.\n\nWe rate Zerban\u2019s statement Pants on Fire.", "Rob Zerban campaign, \"The difference\" TV ad, Oct. 4, 2012\n\nPolitiFact National, \"How we chose the 2011 Lie of the Year,\" Dec. 20, 2011\n\nPolitiFact National, \"Do Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to turn Medicare into a voucher program?,\" Aug. 16, 2011\n\nNew York Times, \"What\u2019s in a name?,\" June 3, 2011\n\nEmail interview, Rob Zerban campaign spokesman Karthik Ganapathy, Oct. 8, 2012\n\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, \"Medicare in the Ryan budget,\" March 28, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
