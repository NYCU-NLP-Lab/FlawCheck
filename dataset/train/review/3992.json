Experts also urged caution when defining terms like hunger, undernutrition and malnutrition.", "\u201cNearly half of all child deaths in Africa stem from hunger,\u201d read the headline of a June 2019 online article by the UK\u2019s Guardian newspaper.", "Several other publications, including the UK\u2019s Independent newspaper, Microsoft portal MSN and South Africa\u2019s Citizen newspaper also reported this.", "All attributed this startling statistic to a 2019 report on child hunger by non-profit research institute, African Child Policy Forum (ACPF), which is based in Ethiopia.", "In a key finding, the report said that \u201chunger contributes to about 45% of childhood mortality in Africa\u201d. But does the evidence support this claim? We checked.", "Retta Getachew is the manager of the child development and protection programme at the ACPF. He told Africa Check that it is difficult to find a \u201cuniversally acceptable definition\u201d of child hunger.", "Few reports directly address hunger and those that do focus on some aspects such as stunting or wasting. Therefore, the organisation had adopted a \u201cmore comprehensive understanding of child hunger\u201d, Getachew said.", "This, he said, encompasses a spectrum of food deprivation ranging from a complete absence of food, in other words starvation, to malnutrition and undernutrition.", "Narrowing the scope of the statistic, Getachew told Africa Check that \u201cvarious sources indicate child malnutrition, which the ACPF understands as one aspect of child hunger, contributes to nearly half of child mortality.\u201d", "For sources, he referred us to a UN Children's Fund (Unicef) webpage on malnutrition. Dated April 2019, this says that \u201cnearly half of all deaths in children under five are attributable to undernutrition\u201d.", "Getachew also provided two factsheets from the World Health Organization. Both are dated 2018. The first covered malnutrition and said that \u201caround 45% of deaths among children under five years of age are linked to undernutrition\u201d. The second noted that \u201cnutrition-related factors contribute to about 45% of deaths in children under five years of age\u201d.", "Both WHO and Unicef told Africa Check the estimate came from a paper published in the Lancet, a weekly peer-reviewed general medical journal, in 2013.", "Juliana Krasevec, who focuses on statistics and monitoring for Unicef, said that the information on their page had referred to \u201cundernutrition and not hunger\u201d. The two terms are \u201cnot the same thing\u201d, she told Africa Check.", "Using WHO estimates of child malnutrition, the authors of the Lancet study estimated that in 2011, some 3.1 million children, or 45% of all child deaths under five, were due to foetal growth restriction and suboptimal breastfeeding. Other causes of death were stunting, wasting and deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc.", "But this finding is different from the claim by the ACPF, which attributed this share of deaths as being only in Africa.", "Joanne Katz is a professor in the department of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She is one of the authors of the 2013 Lancet paper.", "Katz told Africa Check their estimates came from low and middle-income countries worldwide.", "\u201cThese calculations were not made specifically for African countries, hence the 45% listed may not be applicable to Africa. But we don\u2019t know because that calculation has not been done,\u201d she said.", "Katz also drew attention to other concerns with the ACPF estimate. For example, the organisation\u2019s report did not specify an age group for \u201cchild deaths\u201d.", "The Lancet paper referred only to those deaths that occurred in children under five years of age, Katz told Africa Check. \u201cThe causes of death are different for older children than younger ones,\u201d she said.", "Kerstin Hanson, a paediatrician with Doctors Without Borders, agreed. She told Africa Check that children under five had the highest burden of disease due to undernutrition.", "\u201cI think that ACFP should therefore indeed be more specific, as the burden is not the same across different \u2018childhood\u2019 age groups,\u201d Hanson said.", "While the ACPF\u2019s definition of \u201cchild hunger\u201d included undernutrition, experts also urged caution with this.", "Undernutrition is taking in fewer nutrients than required for normal healthy functioning of the body, Katz said. These nutrients are both macronutrients \u2013 needed in larger amounts \u2013 and micronutrients, which though required in small amounts are still essential.", "But \u201can undernourished person could look normal and not be thin but be missing some important vitamins or minerals from their diet\u201d, Katz said.", "Similarly, a person can feel satiated \u2013 or not hungry \u2013 but still be undernourished due to the food\u2019s quality, said Hanson. \u201cAlthough often used interchangeably\u201d, it is preferable not to equate hunger with undernutrition, she said.", "The ACPF responds to our findings", "In response to our findings, the African Child Policy Forum noted that there was a dearth of cause of death data in many African countries. This had led to a reliance on research \u201cundertaken in \u2018similar\u2019 contexts, with a special focus on those undertaken in low income countries and developing regions\u201d.", "As their primary audience was busy policy makers, key government officials and decision makers, the organisation \u201cis always compelled, to the extent possible, to use simple and plain language in its reports to convey key messages and recommendations...\u201d.", "The organisation directed us to the Lancet list of low and middle income countries relied on for the claim. Of these, just under half, or 38 of 78 countries were in Africa. \u201cThis is again another statistically substantial number that would influence the percentage of child deaths attributed to hunger (about 45%).\u201d", "The ACPF added that \u201cby definition\u201d child mortality is calculated for children under age five. \u201cIf one wants to refer to older children, it needs to be specified as such.\u201d", "The organisation said that its estimate should be seen in light of these considerations, and that it believed its figure is \u201creasonably reflective of the reality in Africa\u201d.", "In a widely publicised report, Ethiopia-based non-profit research institute African Child Policy Forum in June 2019 claimed that \u201cabout 45% of child deaths in Africa are attributable to hunger\u201d.", "We traced the claim back to a 2013 study published in the Lancet medical journal. This found that 45% of all deaths in children under five in 2011 were attributable to undernutrition.", "But one of the study's authors said this share may not be applicable to Africa as that calculation has not been done.
