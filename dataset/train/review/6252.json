Kirsten Gillibrand has been under fire for reversing her position on a bill to penalize those who boycott Israel. (John Hickey/Buffalo News)", "Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand no longer supports a bill she originally co-sponsored that would punish people for boycotting Israel.", "\"I am going to urge the authors of the bill to change the bill, and I will not support it in its current form,\" Gillibrand said at a town hall meeting in Queens.", "The bill targets individuals and companies who participate in the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement, a Palestinian-led effort to remove international support for Israel by asking global leaders and businesses to cut ties with the country. Offenders could face heavy fines and even jail time under the bill.", "The American Israel Public Affairs Committee sent an email to its supporters about Gillibrand\u2019s flip a few days after the event.", "\"New York\u2019s junior Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, has withdrawn her co-sponsorship of the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.720), sending a powerful message to her constituents that she no longer supports the fight to combat the international delegitimization of Israel,\" the email said.", "AIPAC is one of the most influential lobbying groups for pro-Israel interests in the U.S. Each major party candidate for president spoke at its conference last year.", "Gillibrand has taken a lot of flack since the email blast, including from Jewish leaders and online publications.

Violators could also face up to 20 years in prison.", "Gillibrand changed her position because, in her view, individuals should not face that kind of punishment for expressing their opinion.", "\"I\u2019m against BDS but I think anybody who\u2019s in favor should feel very comfortable speaking on any stage, anywhere in America, saying exactly why,\" Gillibrand said. \"That is what free speech is about, and I fully support it.\"", "Gillibrand said she does support penalizing companies that participate in BDS.", "Gillibrand responded to her critics more than a week later in an opinion piece on Forward, a Jewish news website.", "\"Some have suggested that I suddenly began supporting the BDS movement when I took my name off the bill. This accusation has popped up on the Internet in recent days \u2013 both from Israel\u2019s supporters and from Israel\u2019s detractors. This is just plain false,\" Gillibrand wrote. \"I cannot state this more clearly: I vehemently oppose the BDS movement.\"", "Our ruling", "AIPAC told its supporters Gillibrand \"no longer supports the fight to combat the international delegitimization of Israel.\"", "AIPAC did not respond to a request to clarify its statement.", "Gillibrand has made it clear, both during the town hall and after, that she still opposes the BDS movement.
