["It\u2019s not true that a tornado lifted a mobile home and carried it over 130 miles until it landed in a rural Kansas area. And since that never happened, it\u2019s also fake news that there were five family members inside that house who came out of the ordeal without major injuries.", "A website called Daily Native American, dailynative.us, posted the fabricated story on Aug. 6, 2017, but the claims have circulated for years. Satirical website worldnewsdailyreport.com posted the same story back in 2015.", "\"A family from Tulsa, Oklahoma, underwent the scariest experience of their life yesterday, when their mobile home was carried over 130 miles by a tornado, landing in a rural Kansas area.

But heavy objects cannot cover the same ground.", "Brooks said even in the \"most violent events,\" wind could not usher a Tulsa mobile home northwest over Colorado before landing near Wichita in southern Kansas. \"That\u2019s a rare direction for even paper to get thrown over significant distances,\" he said.", "Dailynative.us does not feature an \"About Us\" page detailing who\u2019s behind it or what is it\u2019s purpose.", "Allusions to The Wizard of Oz did not go unnoticed to some readers.", "\"Sorry is it just me or has someone else heard all this before? \u2026Dorothy?
