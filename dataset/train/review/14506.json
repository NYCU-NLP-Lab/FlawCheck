["\u201cGreeting staff at @TeamTrump HQ this morning, a reminder that the media doesn\u2019t select the President,\u201d Tim Murtaugh tweeted on November 8, 2020.", "Two photos were attached to the tweet. One showed an image of a front page of The Washington Times that read: \u201cPRESIDENT GORE,\u201d followed by: \u201cFlorida pushes Gore over the top with bare majority.\u201d The second showed dozens of copies of the image on the walls of the Trump campaign headquarters.", "The tweet was later deleted, but screenshots of the photo of the front page remained and were shared on other social media platforms, including on Facebook.", "However, the image is a doctored version of a real front page by The Washington Times, a newspaper based in the US capital.", "\u201cThese photos have been doctored,\u201d the conservative-leaning newspaper replied to Murtaugh on Twitter. \u201cThe Washington Times never ran a \u2018President Gore\u2019 headline.\u201d", "The doctored photo was based on a November 8, 2000 copy of The Washington Times. The original copy that was falsified read: \u201cPRESIDENT BUSH,\u201d followed by: \u201cFlorida pushes Texan over the top with bare majority,\u201d according to a photo by a Twitter user who said they had a physical copy.", "However, other printed versions of the November 8, 2000 Washington Times edition featured the headlines \u201cNo President Yet,\u201d and \u201cDown to the Wire.\u201d", "The falsified headline tweeted by Murtaugh was based on the \u201cPRESIDENT BUSH\u201d version, as it is the only one that reports 207 seats for House Republicans, and 189 for House Democrats.", "While the headline was doctored in the image tweeted by Murtaugh, other text on the front page was not, CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski pointed out on Twitter. One article read:", "\u201cGeorge W. Bush, the son of the president who was vanquished by the Clinton-Gore team eight years ago, avenged his father early this morning by defeating Al Gore, creating only the second father-son presidential dynasty in history.\u201d", "On the night of November 7, 2000, news organizations including ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox and the Associated Press predicted Democrat Al Gore had won the race. But Bush\u2019s victory was eventually called by most media on November 8.", "An agonizingly long recount in the key battleground state of Florida was eventually halted by the US Supreme Court weeks later, definitively giving the presidency to Republican Bush.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
