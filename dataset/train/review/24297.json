["By Rem Rieder and Angelo Fichera", "Posted on October 31, 2020", "A false claim circulating on social media alleges that mail-in ballots already filled out with votes for Democrats, including Joe Biden, were sent to voters in a New York City borough. A spokesperson for the New York City Board of Elections told us the ballot that triggered the allegation was the result of a voter\u2019s error.", "The contretemps began on Oct. 29 with a tweet by Jake Novak, who describes himself on Twitter as a freelance editorial columnist for CNBC.com. Novak said residents of Queens Village, a section of Queens Borough in New York City, \u201care receiving pre-filled out ballots for Joe Biden and being told to just send them back to the Board of Elections. This is blatantly ILLEGAL.\u201d Twitter tagged the claim as \u201cdisputed.\u201d", "BREAKING NEWS: Several Queens Village (NY) residents are receiving pre-filled out ballots for Joe Biden and being told to just send them back to the Board of Elections.

The latter tweet is no longer available.", "Among other things, Novak said the circles in the ballot are filled in so perfectly that no human being could have done them and they could only have been done by a machine.", "Novak\u2019s original tweet was retweeted on Oct. 30 by Eric Trump, one of President Donald Trump\u2019s sons.

In one tweet, the board challenged the notion that the ballot brandished by Novak had not been filled out by hand. In the other, the board said it had tracked down the voter who had received the mail-in ballot and the voter had in fact received a blank ballot.", "This is the height of irresponsibility to continue to make these false claims. We have communicated directly with the voter in question, who received a BLANK absentee ballot.  This is simply untrue!", "\u2014 NYCBoardOfElections (@BOENYC) October 30, 2020", "In one of his videos, Novak said he had been in touch with a Queens Village resident who had received the filled-in ballot. He said the ballot had been addressed to someone who hadn\u2019t lived at the address for eight months. Novak said his tipster didn\u2019t want to be identified because he had voted for past Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton but this time planned to vote for Trump, rather than Democratic nominee Joe Biden.", "In his original tweet, Novak said \u201cresidents\u201d had been receiving filled-in ballots but he backed away from the plural in the video. While saying the way the ballot he had seen was filled in suggested it was \u201cmass produced,\u201d he said he did not know for sure that others had received filled-in ballots.", "Novak said he suspected Democrats were behind the pre-marked ballot but didn\u2019t know for sure and was continuing to investigate.", "Novak, who also lists himself on Twitter as the \u201ccreator of @Varneyco on @FOXBusiness\u201d and a former \u201cExecutive Producer of the #KudlowReport,\u201d said he wouldn\u2019t provide the identity of his tipster to other news outlets because he didn\u2019t want to give away his story.

He did not do so.", "But according to the New York City Board of Elections, there is a simple explanation for what happened, and it doesn\u2019t involve anything nefarious. We reached Valerie Vazquez-Diaz, the board\u2019s director of communications and public affairs, and she described what had happened in a telephone interview.", "In Novak\u2019s video of the ballot, the voter ID number is clear. According to Vazquez-Diaz, election officials tracked down the voter who had requested the absentee ballot in California. The voter reported receiving a blank ballot, filling it out and depositing it at a mail box in the Golden State.", "The problem arose because the voter put the ballot into the oath envelope, which is supposed to go inside an outer envelope to be mailed to election officials. But the voter instead placed the oath envelope into the mail box. The only address on the oath envelope is the voter\u2019s, so that\u2019s where it was returned.", "Vazquez-Diaz said officials had no idea how the envelope made its way into the hands of Novak\u2019s tipster.", "But as for Novak\u2019s tweets, she said they were \u201cinaccurate.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
