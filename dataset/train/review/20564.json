So, we thought we\u2019d check out his claim.", "Two recent polls", "Sanders finished as runner-up to Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination. So the Vermont senator, an Independent, never faced Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump, of course, defeated Clinton, the former secretary of state, in the general election.", "The latest national survey on this question was the Harvard-Harris Poll, which is done by Harvard University\u2019s Center for American Political Studies and Harris Insights and Analytics.", "Conducted online April 14 to 17, 2017 with registered voters, the poll listed the names of 16 political figures, without the titles of their governmental positions. Respondents were asked whether they had a favorable or unfavorable view of each, or had never heard of them. The 16 included prominent figures, such Sanders, Trump and Clinton, and the Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, but also lesser-known Trump appointees.", "Pollster.com co-founder Charles Franklin, director of polling at the Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, said it is common in non-election years for the president, vice president, congressional leaders and perhaps a prominent senator or two to be included in such polls.
