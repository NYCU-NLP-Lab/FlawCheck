["About this rating", "On 20 May 2016, the video shown above, purportedly capturing \"rain falling in one place\" in Togo was posted to YouTube.  However, what was depicted in the video did not occur \"this morning\" (i.e., 20 May 2016), nor did it take place in Togo. The video has been circulating online since at least June 2015, when it was shared under the title \"Sources of water, water sources of well digging.\" While that version of the video did not include mention of a location, other postings of it have placed the incident in Indonesia, China, and Vietnam.", "This video also doesn't show \"rain falling in one place.\" In fact, it doesn't show rain at all.

When the peak is in view, the color of the water and the sky are too similar to easily distinguish one from the other. However, a careful examination of this footage shows that the water clearly originates from the ground and not the sky.", "The first clue is that a central water column can be periodically glimpsed throughout the video. The water is erupting from a hole in the ground and then falling back to the ground:", "The peak of this geyser can also be glimpsed at several points in the video, and at the 1:17 mark viewers can actually see the height of the geyser briefly change:", "A simliar shot of a burst high-pressure water main on Akosombo Road in Ghana has also been circulated with the same claim of its depicting \"rain falling on only one spot\":", "The true nature of the phenomenon is more obvious in this clip taken from a different angle:", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
