The featured photo was not taken in\u00a0California, it is not from an Earth Day event (which isn\u2019t until April 22), and it is not proof of hypocrisy on the part of environmentalists, as the text suggests.", "The photo actually shows the aftermath of a football tailgate from nearly a decade ago at the University of Georgia.", "Using reverse image searches, we found the same image used in posts about the September 2009\u00a0game.
