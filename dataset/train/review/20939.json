["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on August 23, 2016", "Donald Trump\u2019s new TV ad on immigration creates a misleading comparison, saying that under Hillary Clinton, \u201cillegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay\u201d but under Trump, \u201cterrorists and dangerous criminals\u201d are \u201ckept out.\u201d In fact, Clinton has said she would deport \u201cviolent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety.\u201d", "The Trump campaign did not respond to our questions about the ad. However, Clinton has supported measures, including the 2013 bipartisan Senate immigration bill, that would have allowed those living in the U.S. illegally who committed fewer\u00a0than three misdemeanors, not including\u00a0minor traffic violations, to stay \u2014 provided they met other requirements. This could be what the ad means by criminals \u201cget to stay.\u201d", "If so, the ad, titled \u201cTwo Americas: Immigration,\u201d misleads the viewer by contrasting Clinton\u2019s plan with Trump\u2019s proposal to keep\u00a0\u201cterrorists and dangerous criminals\u201d out. That\u2019s no different from what Clinton has proposed on illegal immigration. There are certainly different definitions of the word \u201cdangerous,\u201d but Clinton has used the same\u00a0language in talking about whom she would deport. And the bill she supported barred convicted felons from becoming legal residents or citizens.", "The Republican presidential nominee\u2019s ad began airing Aug. 19 on a $4.8 million ad buy over 10 days in Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida, the campaign has said.", "The ad begins with the narrator describing immigration \u201cin Hillary Clinton\u2019s America:\u00a0The system stays rigged against Americans.\u00a0Syrian refugees flood in.\u00a0Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay.\u00a0Collecting Social Security benefits, skipping the line.\u00a0Our border open.\u201d", "In contrast, the narrator gives this description of \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s America\u201d: \u201cTerrorists and dangerous criminals: kept out.\u00a0The border: secured.\u00a0Our families: safe.\u201d", "We\u2019ve written about a few of these claims before. Clinton hasn\u2019t supported \u201copen\u201d borders, as the ad falsely implies. The\u00a02013 Senate immigration bill \u2014 the most recent comprehensive immigration legislation, which Clinton has said she backed \u2014 would have made large investments in border security, including additional border fencing,\u00a0and Clinton said during a\u00a0Democratic debate in November, \u201cBorder security has always been a part of that\u00a0[immigration]\u00a0debate.\u201d As we\u2019ll explain later, the immigration plan on her website talks about deporting some individuals. That\u2019s not an \u201copen\u201d border.", "The ad also uses a deceptive image of people crowded on top of train cars when it says \u201cour border open,\u201d as if anyone and everyone could stream in legally. That\u2019s not what Clinton has proposed or supported. The 2013 Senate bill would have set up a path to citizenship for those who had entered the country\u00a0prior to Dec. 31, 2011.", "The ad also\u00a0leaves the impression that \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d would be \u201ccollecting Social Security benefits\u201d under Clinton\u2019s presidency, but that would only happen if those immigrants became citizens or had legal status. And that\u2019s the case under current law. As we\u2019ve explained before\u00a0back in 2009 and 2006, those in the country illegally are barred from collecting Social Security. Once an immigrant gains legal status, then that person can get credit for the Social Security taxes he or she paid when working illegally.", "As for whether Clinton would allow a \u201cflood\u201d of Syrian refugees, that\u2019s a matter of opinion.\u00a0Obama has authorized the acceptance of 10,000 Syrian refugees for fiscal year 2016, while Clinton\u00a0has said the number should be as many as 65,000. For context, there are nearly 5\u00a0million Syrian refugees displaced by the country\u2019s civil war, which began in 2011. And the U.S. is set to accept a total of 85,000 refugees from around the world in fiscal 2016.", "Trump has said that no Syrian refugees should be admitted to the U.S., because terrorists may be among them, and Clinton has said the refugees should be admitted \u201conly if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine.\u201d", "The claim that piqued our fact-checking interest, though, was the assertion that under Clinton \u201cillegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay.\u201d", "The ad includes a graphic that says \u201ccriminals stay\u201d and a citation of \u201cNBC News 7/9/16.\u201d We tried internet and Lexis Nexis searches to find a relevant NBC News article on that day, but we came up empty.\u00a0We asked the Trump campaign to point us to the article in question, and spokeswoman Hope Hicks told us over the phone that she would take a look at our emailed request. We have not received a response, but we will update this article if we do.", "However, Clinton has talked about deporting criminals as part of her illegal immigration plan.", "Clinton\u2019s proposal says that she will send a plan to Congress that will include \u201ca path to full and equal citizenship\u201d within her first 100 days in office. That plan \u201cwill treat every person with dignity, fix the family visa backlog, uphold the rule of law, protect our borders and national security, and bring millions of hardworking people into the formal economy.\u201d", "The plan\u00a0goes on to say that she would defend Obama\u2019s executive orders to delay deportation for so-called DREAMers and the parents of citizens and lawful residents. But she specifically talks about deporting other immigrants, saying, she would \u201cfocus resources on detaining and deporting those individuals who pose a violent threat to public safety.\u201d", "During a March Democratic debate, Clinton was asked about allowing immigrants to stay if they lacked a\u00a0criminal record. She\u00a0said:\u00a0\u201cBut if you are asking about everyone who is already here, undocumented immigrants, the 11-12 million who are living here, my priorities are to deport violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety.\u201d", "In a speech to the National Immigrant Integration Conference in December 2015, Clinton also talked about \u201cprioritiz[ing] whom to deport.\u201d She said: \u201cDangerous criminals? Yes. DREAMers and their families? No.\u201d", "As for Trump, he initially talked about deporting all immigrants living in the country illegally, but his stance has recently softened. At a February debate, he said that\u00a0all immigrants with illegal status\u00a0\u201cwill go out,\u201d adding that some will \u201ccome back legally.\u201d Last November, he talked about using\u00a0a \u201cdeportation force\u201d\u00a0to deport all of the estimated 11 million immigrants living here illegally.", "But in an interview with\u00a0Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly on Aug. 22, Trump\u00a0said\u00a0that \u201cwe\u2019re going to get rid of all of the bad ones,\u201d mentioning \u201cgang members\u201d and \u201ckillers,\u201d and talked about using the existing deportation process for others. \u201cAs far as the rest, we\u2019re going to go through the process, like they are now, perhaps with a lot more energy, and we\u2019re going to do it only through the system of laws,\u201d Trump said.", "Trump described his deportation approach as similar to past administrations, including the current one. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country. Bush the same thing. Lots of people were brought out of the country with the existing laws. Well, I\u2019m going to do the same thing and I just said that,\u201d he told O\u2019Reilly.", "The candidates obviously differ on what to do about noncriminals who are illegally living in the United States: Clinton would create a path to citizenship, while Trump says he would keep existing laws and deportation processes. But as far as prioritizing whom to deport, both have said they\u2019d\u00a0focus\u00a0on criminals and dangerous individuals.", "What about the measures Clinton has supported in the past? The 2013 Senate immigration bill\u00a0included a years-long path to citizenship, but that path would not have been available to those convicted of a felony, three misdemeanor crimes (not counting \u201cminor traffic offenses\u201d), a foreign crime or unlawful voting. Also, an individual would have been ineligible\u00a0if there were \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the person \u201cis engaged in or is likely to engage after entry in any terrorist activity.\u201d", "That would mean that an immigrant in the country illegally who\u00a0was convicted of two misdemeanors could have stayed under the bill \u2014 provided that person met other requirements including paying a $500 fine and back taxes. Becoming a citizen then required other measures, such as having a steady work history, knowing English, passing background checks and more.", "The bipartisan legislation, also known as the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill, said that it would be possible for the secretary of homeland security to waive the barring of those convicted of three misdemeanors for \u201chumanitarian\u201d or \u201cpublic interest\u201d reasons.\u00a0Under federal immigration laws, a misdemeanor is an offense punishable by up to a year in prison.", "There are similar\u00a0exclusions\u00a0for felons and other criminals in Obama\u2019s executive order on deferring deportation for so-called DREAMers, those who came to the United States at a young age and are attending or have graduated from high school or have served in the U.S. military. Among the requirements to apply\u00a0for a two-year deferral of deportation proceedings: \u201cHave not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety,\u201d according to\u00a0the\u00a0U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.", "Such language leaves open the possibility that some convicted criminals \u2014 if their offenses were misdemeanors and fewer than three \u2014 would be allowed to stay under the types of proposals Clinton has supported. But contrasting that with a Trump plan to keep out \u201cterrorists and dangerous criminals\u201d is a misleading comparison. Clinton, too, has said she would deport \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cviolent\u201d criminals, \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201canyone who threatens our safety.\u201d", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/321a94e0-89fd-438a-806b-77e12a0700a9", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
