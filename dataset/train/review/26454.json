["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Jessica King was a part of the first graduating class of Emerge Wisconsin, which touts itself as the premier program for training Democratic women to run for office. She was elected to the Oshkosh Common Council in 2007, even before completing the training.\n\nIn 2008, King ran for an open seat in the state Senate, but lost to Republican Randy Hopper of Fond du Lac. After a recount, the margin was 163 votes out of more than 83,000 cast.\n\nWhen Hopper became one of the Republican senators targeted for recall for his support of GOP Gov. Scott Walker, King entered the race, creating a rematch.", "Hopper dismissed King as having a \"liberal tax-and-spend agenda\" and has since sharpened his attack ahead of the Aug. 9, 2011 election.\n\nA Hopper TV ad released July 15, 2011 begins by praising his own work as a lawmaker. Then, as background music turns ominous, the narrator says:\n\n\"When you see Jessica King\u2019s negative attacks, remember 63. King opposed balancing the state budget and voted to increase her pay with taxpayer dollars by 63 percent. Raising your pay by 63? Does Jessica King really care about you and me?\"\n\nA politician voting herself a 63 percent pay raise during tough economic times?\n\nThat\u2019s worth a look.\n\nAsked for evidence to back the attack, Hopper campaign spokesman Sean Stephenson cited the 2009 and 2010 and Oshkosh city budgets.\n\nThey show the pay appropriated for the seven council members -- the mayor and six aldermen -- totaled $17,400 in 2008 and had risen to $28,500 in 2010. That\u2019s an increase of 63.8 percent.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t break down how much of a raise King might have received, nor whether she voted for it. So we went back to Stephenson, who stood by the 63 percent claim. He said the proof King voted for the raise was that she voted for the 2009 and 2010 city budgets.\n\nKing campaign spokeswoman Gillian Morris pointed instead to a vote on a pay raise ordinance the Oshkosh council took April 8, 2008.\n\nThe ordinance and official minutes from that meeting show the council voted, 4-3, to double the mayor\u2019s salary to $6,000 and boost the salary of each of the six council members from $2,400 to $3,750, or 56 percent.\n\nKing voted no on the raises, saying salaries should be reviewed by a citizen committee.\n\nOshkosh City Manager Mark Rohloff said the council members\u2019 pay can be raised only through an ordinance such as the pay ordinance King voted against. City budgets cannot authorize pay raises for elected officials; they only carry out what has been legally authorized by an earlier pay ordinance, he said.\n\nOne more point before we close: By law, elected officials cannot directly vote themselves pay raises. Any raises that they adopt can\u2019t take effect for a particular office until after that office comes up for election again.\n\nThe Oshkosh raises took effect in April 2009, a year after the council adopted the pay ordinance. So, although King voted against the raises, she did receive the 56 percent raise herself after being re-elected in 2009.\n\nLet\u2019s get back to the claim.\n\nIn a TV ad, Hopper said King voted to increase her pay on the Oshkosh Common Council by 63 percent. It\u2019s ridiculous to claim King voted for the raise, given that she voted against the ordinance that raised the pay -- which is the only legal way council pay can be raised. And Hopper\u2019s claim of 63 percent itself is false, given that the correct raise figure is a somewhat lower 56 percent.\n\nRidiculous and false. Around here, that\u2019s a combustible mixture. We give Hopper\u2019s claim a Pants on Fire.", "Interview and email interview, Randy Hopper campaign spokesman Sean Stephenson, July 16 and 19, 2011\n\nEmail interview, Jessica King campaign spokeswoman Gillian Morris, July 19, 2011\n\nRandy Hopper campaign, \"63\" TV ad, July 15, 2011\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Female candidates to graduate,\" Sept. 28, 2007\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Oshkosh official to challenge Hopper,\" April 13, 2011\n\nOshkosh Northwestern, \"Candidate roundup,\" Jan. 5, 2011\n\nCity of Oshkosh, 2009 budget (page 25 of pf)\n\nCity of Oshkosh, 2010 budget (page 29 of pdf)\n\nCity of Oshkosh, minutes and pay ordinance of April 8, 2008 Common Council meeting (page 7)", "City of Oshkosh, minutes of council vote on 2009 budget, Nov. 25, 2008\n\nCity of Oshkosh, minutes of council vote on 2010 budget, Nov. 24, 2009", "Interview and email interview, Oshkosh City Manager Mark Rohloff, July 19, 2011\n\nWisconsin Government Accountability Board, results of 2008 Hopper-King state Senate election", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
