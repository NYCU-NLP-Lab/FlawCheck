["\u201cKamala Harris doesn\u2019t think you have the right to own a gun,\u201d said the headline of an August 11, 2020 article on pro-gun website \u201cBearing Arms,\u201d which has been shared more than 800,000 times on Facebook.", "As a result of this fact check, \"Bearing Arms\" changed the headline of its article on August 19.", "An August 11\u00a0post\u00a0on the Facebook page of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, the lobbying arm of the powerful National Rifle Association, calls Harris \u201c2nd Amendment-hating\u201d and adds: \u201cBiden & Harris will dismantle the 2nd Amendment.\u201d", "The article and the post came just hours after Biden announced that Harris, a California senator, would be his running mate. She is to formally accept the nomination on August 19 at the Democrats\u2019 virtual convention.", "Rather than outright opposition to gun ownership, Harris has supported legislation aimed at increasing safety. Nor has she called for the destruction of the Second Amendment, which says: \u201cA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d", "At a Judiciary Committee hearing in March 2018, Harris called for \u201ccommon sense gun safety laws\u201d and said \u201cit\u2019s a false choice to suggest that you are either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone\u2019s guns away.\u201d", "She made similar comments at a CNN Town Hall on January 28, 2019, after she announced a bid to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, which Biden later won.", "\u201cYou can be in favor of the Second Amendment and also understand that there is no reason in a civil society that we have assault weapons around communities that can kill babies and police officers,\" Harris said at the 1:06 mark of this video clip.", "While the Biden-Harris campaign plan to counter gun violence includes a ban on the sale and manufacture of assault weapons as well as high-capacity magazines, it makes no mention of a prohibition on gun ownership.", "\u201cIt\u2019s within our grasp to end our gun violence epidemic and respect the Second Amendment, which is limited. As president, Biden will pursue constitutional, common-sense gun safety policies,\u201d the plan says.", "President Donald Trump, trailing Biden in polls before the November 3 election, had made inaccurate comments about the Biden-Harris stance on guns before the claims spread on social media.", "\u201cIf Biden becomes President your GREAT SECOND AMENDMENT doesn\u2019t have a chance. Your guns will be taken away, immediately and without notice,\u201d he said in an August 6 tweet, claims he reiterated as the Democrats\u2019 nominating convention began.", "But Jake Charles, executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law, said in an email to AFP that: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to characterize what they propose as even remotely dismantling the Second Amendment.\u201d", "The \u201cBearing Arms\u201d article based its argument on Harris\u2019s joining 17 other district attorneys -- including at least one Republican -- in an amicus brief more than a decade ago that backed the District of Columbia\u2019s ban on handgun possession and rules for gun storage. These were challenged at the nation\u2019s highest court by a man named Dick Heller.", "Harris was San Francisco District Attorney at the time.", "\u201cThe three statutes at issue in the DC Code do not violate the Second Amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with any state-regulated militia,\u201d she and the other attorneys argued.", "They expressed concern that the case could unleash further court challenges to existing criminal firearms laws. This would leave prosecutors hindered in their ability to enforce those laws that \u201cthey have long understood to be valid and compromised in their continuing efforts to combat gun violence in their communities,\u201d they said.", "But the Supreme Court in 2008 ruled in favor of Heller, saying there is \u201can individual right\u201d to firearm possession, although that right is \u201cnot unlimited.\u201d", "The article in \u201cBearing Arms\u201d -- a publication that believes \u00a0in \u201ca pre-existing inalienable right to self-defense\u201d -- said Biden chose a running mate who \u201cargued in 2008 that Washington, DC\u2019s ban on handguns didn\u2019t violate the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\u201d", "It cited the district attorneys\u2019 argument against creating \u201ca broad private right to possess any firearm that is a \u2018lineal descendant\u2019 of a founding era weapon and that is in \u2018common use\u2019 with a \u2018military application\u2019 today.\u201d", "Legal scholars, however, say that although Harris supported the amicus brief, it is false to conclude from it that she believes -- as the article claims -- \u201cyou don\u2019t have the right to own a gun.\u201d", "\u201cThe brief in question is not about whether there is an individual right under the Second Amendment. It is about the crime-related consequences of invalidating the DC handgun law at issue in Heller,\u201d Aziz Huq, of the University of Chicago Law School, told AFP by email. Huq studies how constitutional design interacts with individual rights and liberties.", "Adam Winkler, a specialist in gun policy at the UCLA School of Law, made a similar argument.", "\u201cThis statement is false,\u201d he said of the article\u2019s claim.", "\u201cThe brief she supported argued that DC\u2019s gun laws should be upheld but not because there was no right to own a gun,\u201d Winkler said in an email to AFP.", "\u201cRather, the brief argued that the laws should be upheld because there is a tradition of gun restrictions, and DC\u2019s were reasonable regulations,\u201d said Winkler, the author of \u201cGunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\u201d", "The amicus brief which Harris joined argued \u201cthat at least as far as the Second Amendment is concerned, it doesn\u2019t relate to private rights,\u201d said Charles, of the Duke Center for Firearms Law.", "But he added: \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s fair to claim that as her current position given that the Supreme Court decided in Heller that people do have that right, and I haven\u2019t seen her questioning the Heller decision.\u201d", "Fact-checking organizations have already debunked the false claim that Harris will send police to people\u2019s doors if \u201cyou don\u2019t surrender your guns.\u201d", "Since Biden named her as his running mate, AFP Fact Check has disproven other false claims about Harris, including that she would be disqualified from serving as president because her parents were foreign-born.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
