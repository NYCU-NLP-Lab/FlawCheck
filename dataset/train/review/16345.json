["About this rating", "A viral story on Shareably first published in May 2018 claims that a mixture of orange juice and cream of tartar \u201cwill flush nicotine from your body and [help you] quit smoking faster.\u201d Though Shareably's article is currently driving the bulk of viral traffic on this subject, the claim has a history on the internet going back at least a decade.", "Before diving into the science, several reasons exist to be suspicious of the article from a media literacy standpoint. Far from citing any peer-reviewed scientific paper, the article states that its primary source of information is an article from the company Providr, a clickbait mill Snopes exposed for fraudulent Facebook practices in multiple 2018 investigations. The article itself, which in reality devotes only a few sentences to the headline claim, cites questionable websites like Natural Health and Healing 4 You and Organic Facts to support its argument. Finally, that claim relies on one of the most overused tropes in pseudoscientific literature: the notion of \u201cdetoxifying your body\u201d through nutrition:", "Low potassium is associated with just about every single health issue caused by smoking \u2026 This is why it is effective to use while quitting smoking. It puts potassium back into your system and gets your adrenal glands working in conjunction with the rest of your body. Then your body naturally decides which toxins to eliminate through bowel movements, urine, and sweat.", "Everyone knows the importance of keeping vitamin C. What many people don\u2019t know is that nicotine blocks your ability to adequately absorb it into the blood. On the upside, one glass of OJ delivers well above the recommended daily value. So when you drink a glass mixed with Cream of Tartar, you twice [sic] the medical benefits.", "Potassium tartrate (and other potassium chemicals) exists as potassium ions in the body, which are undeniably crucial for several important cellular processes, and a factor in multiple health conditions. Despite its chemical importance, no scientific basis exists for any claim that it can affect the removal of nicotine from the body or ease the cessation of smoking. Instead, Shareably relies on vague, scientific sounding non sequiturs that do not actually provide support for the headline claim.", "Patrick Mulholland, a professor at The Medical University of South Carolina and an expert in the biological processes underlying addiction, described the claim as \u201cridiculous,\u201d telling us via email that \u201cthere is currently no known mechanism by which increasing [potassium] in the diet will reduce smoking or relapse in individuals with nicotine dependence.\u201d", "The most obvious implication made with these vague internet claims is that smoking somehow lowers levels of potassium in the body \u2014 a medical condition known as hypokalemia. \u201cThere is no evidence that smoking itself causes hypokalemia\u201d Mulholland told us. In fact, he added, \u201cacute nicotine exposure can increase [potassium] levels\u201d in the bloodstream. In other words, smoking cigarettes, while undeniably bad for your health, does not create a potassium deficiency in the body that could be rectified by the addition of more potassium. (As another problem, \u201clittle is known\u201d about how potassium levels in the body are affected by diet in the first place.)", "What about the claim that potassium helps \u201cflush\u201d nicotine out of the body by \u201cget[ing] your adrenal glands working in conjunction with the rest of your body\u201d such that \u201cyour body naturally decides which toxins to eliminate through bowel movements, urine, and sweat?\u201d This is essentially gibberish. Cream of tartar has \u201ca long history\u201d as a purging agent for one simple reason: it has a diuretic effect, which means it increases the amount of water expelled from the body in urine.", "It is unclear, however, how that action would serve to increase the metabolism \u2014 i.e. breakdown \u2014 of nicotine. These chemicals are broken down into metabolites by the liver before being excreted as urine. Further, from an addiction standpoint, the rapid removal of nicotine from the body \u2014 even if potassium tartrate could cause that effect \u2014 would counterproductively serve to increase the frequency of cravings, not reduce them.", "The alleged role Shareably suggests vitamin C plays in this process is even less precise. A closer look at these arguments reveals them to be especially flimsy. The first proffered argument does not actually provide support for the assertion that potassium helps you remove nicotine and/or quit smoking, it merely suggests adding the orange juice to replace all the lost vitamins from the purging. To be clear, this would be a solution to a problem that didn\u2019t exist before the treatment, not a path toward quitting smoking.", "Another explanation they provide is simpler, but decidedly less-impressive sounding: \u201cdrinking [orange juice and cream of tartar] will drastically alter the way things taste, including cigarettes,\u201d implying that the unpleasant taste would make people less likely to smoke. This explanation may hold the closest relevance to their claims of smoking cessation, but it is one that is unsupported by any actual scientific research. The National Institute on Drug Abuse does not endorse that notion, and a review of the literature suggests that very few people, if any, have tested it.", "As a final note, consuming too much cream of tartar can lead to adverse health effects on its own \u2014 there have been rare cases of \u201clife-threatening\u201d hyperkalemia (too much potassium) resulting from people using cream of tartar as a cleanse.", "One of the driving features of pseudoscientific clickbait is that it floods a reader with bits and pieces of actual science that are then misrepresented or distorted. This article is no different.", "For example, the piece asserts that \u201clow potassium is associated with just about every single health issue caused by smoking.\u201d Correlation is not causation. The association presented here is used to falsely suggest that because people with low potassium and people who smoke share similar medical maladies, supplementation with potassium would be the solution. The problem with this argument is that one of the most common symptoms that chronic smokers experience is also the defining feature of hypokalemia: hypertension. Hypertension, in turn, is a major factor in most of the other complications \u2014 cardiac problems, etc. \u2014 at issue in smoking. That link does not mean smoking-connected hypertension is related to potassium levels in the bloodstream, nor has any research been published supporting that notion.", "Similarly, the article asserts that nicotine \u201cblocks your ability to adequately absorb [vitamin C] into the blood.\u201d While it is true that smokers generally have lower levels of vitamin C in their body, this association is used to support the notion that vitamin C has an important role to play in smoking-related maladies without ever explaining what role vitamin C deficiency is alleged to play in either preventing the removal of nicotine from the body or prolonging someone's efforts to quit smoking.", "Because no published support exists for the claim that cream of tartar can play any role in either the removal of nicotine from the body or as an aid to quit smoking, and because the scientific facts used to make that argument are incorrect, distorted, or irrelevant, we rank this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "Adler, Jessica. \u00a0 \u201cMix Cream Of Tartar With Orange Juice To Flush Nicotine From Your Body And Quit Smoking Faster.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Shareably. \u00a0 14 May 2018.", "Hull, Janet. \u00a0 \u201cNo-Smokin' the Cream Of Tartar.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Dr. Janet Starr Hull Newsletter. \u00a0 August 2007.", "Bogdanski, Natalie. \u00a0 \u201cMix This With Orange Juice to Flush Nicotine Out Of Your Body.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Providr. \u00a0 11 March 2017.", "Harvard Health Publishing. \u00a0 \u201cThe Dubious Practice of Detox.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 May 2008.", "Stone, Micheal S., et al. \u00a0 \u201cPotassium Intake, Bioavailability, Hypertension, and Glucose Control\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Nutrients. \u00a0 22 June 2016.", "Keither, Norman M. and Binger, Melvin W. \u00a0 \u201cDiuretic Action of Potassium Salts.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Nutrients. \u00a0 16 November 1935.", "Benowitz, Neal L., et al. \u00a0 \u201cNicotine Chemistry, Metabolism, Kinetics and Biomarkers.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Handbook Experimental Pharmacology. \u00a0 13 October 2010.", "National Institute on Drug Abuse. \u00a0 \u201cCigarettes and Other Tobacco Products.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 23 October 2019.", "Rusyniak, Daniel E., et al. \u00a0 \u201cLife-Threatening Hyperkalemia from Cream of Tartar Ingestion.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Journal of Medical Toxicology. \u00a0 28 August 2012.", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u00a0 \u201cHealth Effects of Cigarette Smoking.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 23 October 2019.", "Mayo Clinic. \u00a0 \u201cPrimary Aldosteronism.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 23 October 2019.", "Kallner, A.B., et al. \u00a0 \u201cOn the Requirements of Ascorbic Acid in Man: Steady-state Turnover and Body Pool in Smokers.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. \u00a0 1 July 1981.", "German Nutrition Society, et al. \u00a0 \u201cNew Reference Values for Vitamin C Intake.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism. \u00a0 August 2015.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
