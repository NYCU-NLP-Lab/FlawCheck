Jeremy has been assessed and all four paws treated for second-degree partial thickness burns, he is doing very well and is in great spirits. Thank you to all involved in his treatment thus far.", "The International Fund for Animal Welfare said that koalas are among the first animals to perish in wildfires because the slow-moving creatures can't outrun the flames:", "The IFAW said that injured koalas - such as Jeremy - typically come in with severe burns, especially on their paws, caused by contact with burning trees or from fleeing across fire grounds.", "\"On a normal day, they spend around 18 hours asleep in the fork of a tree and even when fully awake, they are slow-moving creatures with a top speed of around 10 kilometers an hour.\"", "In a fast moving fire, they are often the first to perish.", "\"Injuries to paws, claws, face and ears are common and tiny joeys [baby koala] can often only wait in burning trees, crying for their mothers.\"", "While the above-displayed picture was taken after a fire in Australia in 2015, similar scenes have taken place in 2020. Here's a video report from CNN about how the koala population is faring during the latter's devastating fires:", "The Guardian. \u00a0 \"A Weekend of Bushfire Devastation in Australia \u2013 in Pictures.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 5 January 2020.", "Anadolu Agency. \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Burnt Koalas in Need of Mittens.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 10 January 2015.", "Chow, Denise. \u00a0 \"Scientist Estimates That More Than a Billion Animals Killed by Australian Wildfires.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 NBC News. \u00a0 8 January 2020.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
