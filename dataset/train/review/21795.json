Paul Ryan\u2019s recent proposal to overhaul Medicare opened a round of partisan debate over how to control the costs of popular entitlement programs that are driving the U.S. deep into debt.\n\nThe plan, part of the House GOP\u2019s 2012 budget, passed the chamber with no Democratic support. Although it is certain to die in the Senate or on Obama\u2019s desk, Ryan\u2019s effort to reduce the government\u2019s role in providing health insurance to seniors is likely to remain an issue in the 2012 elections. Ryan, R-Wis., is chairman of the House Budget Committee.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Fairfax County, recently assailed Ryan\u2019s plan to privatize much of Medicare. Under the proposal, seniors would buy private insurance policies and Uncle Sam would make a fixed payment to insurers to help cover the plans. The system would start in 2022 for everyone who is 65 or younger that year.\n\n\"Not one dollar of the increased costs to seniors would be used to reduce the deficit,\" Connolly said in a press release. \"Instead, the Republican plan lines the pockets of the private insurance companies.\"\n\nAre Connolly\u2019s comments true?\n\nGeorge Burke, Connolly\u2019s communications director, said the claim was based on projections from the Congressional Budget Office that Ryan\u2019s plan would require seniors to pay more for health coverage but not really reduce government expenses. He said the plan \"lines the pockets\" of insurers because seniors would have to buy private insurance, something they don\u2019t have to do now.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s discuss how Ryan\u2019s plan would work.\n\nUnder the legislation, people who turn 65 after 2022 would get a \"premium support payment\" from Medicare, paid directly to an insurer they select towards the cost of buying private health insurance. The payment is projected to be about $8,000 in 2022 for someone turning 65 that year. As people grow older, the subsidy would increase. That\u2019s because health care costs increase with age.\n\nRyan\u2019s plan would raise the baseline payment each year by the increase in the Consumer Price Index. That would allow the payment to keep up with overall inflation, although medical costs have been climbing much faster than total inflation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOne result, the CBO said, would be that future Medicare recipients \"would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system.\"\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Connolly now. We\u2019ll start by addressing the second part of his claim, that requiring seniors to buy private health insurance would \"line the pockets\" of private insurers.\n\nAlthough Connolly\u2019s language might be dramatic, he\u2019s right about the basic detail. If Americans over 65 start buying private insurance, with their own money or with government funds, total premium levels will climb for private health insurers. And because the largest health insurance companies are publicly traded and seek profits, it is a good bet that they won\u2019t offer money-losing Medicare plans.\n\nThe insurers would have to meet standards set by the federal government, however. They would have to charge the same premium to everyone who is the same age, and could not deny coverage to seniors based on pre-existing health conditions.\n\nThe Ryan plan would provide higher insurance subsidies to low-income people; those in the top 8 percent of earnings would receive smaller government payments.\n\nSo Connolly\u2019s right on part of his claim. The Ryan plan would increase revenues from premiums revenues at private insurers. We won\u2019t pass judgment on whether this is \"lining the pockets\" of these companies, since there is little chance of predicting what profit margins would be like under these plans in 10 years.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine Connolly\u2019s claim that \"not one dollar of the increased costs to seniors would be used to reduce the deficit.\"\n\nAs we mentioned, the CBO believes that seniors would pay more from their own pockets for health care under Ryan\u2019s plan. So the increased costs to seniors makes sense. But as Joe Antos, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute points out, if seniors have to pay more, government should end up paying less.\n\nThe CBO estimates that health costs would be higher under the Ryan plan than under traditional Medicare for a 65-year-old in 2022. The reason for the increase, it says, is that \"both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare.\"\n\nAntos and Marc Goldwein, an economist at the non-partisan New America Foundation, said the government\u2019s premium payments under the Ryan plan would grow more slowly than Medicare\u2019s expenses under the current set-up. So while there may be little savings initially, over time the government\u2019s share of Medicare spending would fall. Those savings would be available for other programs, including deficit reduction.\n\nAntos also said the payments would encourage health insurers and providers to economize because seniors would not have blank checks to pay for tests and treatments. Health-care insurers and providers would have incentive to \"increase profits through more efficient care, delivered in a more efficient manner.\"\n\nPaul Van de Water at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities used the CBO information and his own calculations to estimate the cost difference between Ryan\u2019s plan and the current system.\n\nUnder the current system, Van de Water says a typical 65-year-old pays $6,150 for premiums and out-of-pocket costs on Medicare and supplemental coverage. The government pays about $8,600.\n\nIn 2022, he said, a 65-year-old would see out-of-pocket costs double to $12,500, while the government\u2019s share of costs would fall by $600, to $8,000. So while the government would see some savings, Ryan\u2019s plan \"increases the total health costs for beneficiaries by vastly more than it reduces the federal government\u2019s spending,\" Van de Water said.\n\nDean Baker, another left-leaning economist, said the plan could save the government money over time, but only at the cost of much higher payments from seniors. He, like Van de Water and the CBO, said using private insurers will mean higher costs and more inefficiencies. Those inefficiencies cost money.\n\nLet\u2019s review:\n\nThe liberal economists don\u2019t like Ryan\u2019s plan and say it would harm seniors, but they concede it would lead to lower government spending on health care costs, at least over time. That contradicts Connolly\u2019s assertion that no money from these increased costs would help pay down the deficit. It\u2019s true that the new payments by seniors would go towards private insurers, but savings from lower government spending could go towards deficit reductions.\n\nWe rate Connolly\u2019s claim Half True.", "Rep.
