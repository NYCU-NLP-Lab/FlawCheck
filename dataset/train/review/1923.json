["We found some factual distortions in the first debate round of the two-night affair.", "By Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson, Brooks Jackson, Robert Farley, Angelo Fichera, Jessica McDonald and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on June 27, 2019", "The debate season for the 2020 presidential election kicked off with 10 Democratic candidates taking the stage in Miami and exaggerating or garbling the facts on Iran, wages, Medicare, the opioid crisis and guns.", "The first debate was hosted by NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo on June 26, with another 10 candidates set to debate the following night.", "Moderator Lester Holt asked all 10 candidates if they would, as president, \u201csign on to the 2015 nuclear deal as it was originally negotiated.\u201d Only Sen. Cory Booker said no.", "Booker said he would renegotiate the agreement, but he criticized President Donald Trump for\u00a0announcing\u00a0on May 8, 2018, that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement.", "In criticizing Trump, Booker garbled the facts about the impact of the agreement on the \u201cbreakout time,\u201d which is how long it would take Iran to produce enough highly enriched uranium for one nuclear weapon.", "Booker:\u00a0Literally, he\u00a0took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years.", "The Iran agreement pushed the breakout time from roughly two or three months to one year for at least 10 years,\u00a0according to the Obama White House.", "In years 11 to 15 of the agreement, the breakout time would be reduced to less than one year because Iran would be \u201cpermitted to replace its first-generation centrifuges with limited numbers of advanced models, although the restrictions on enriched ura\u00adnium stocks and enrichment level continue through year 15,\u201d\u00a0as explained in an\u00a0August 2015 report\u00a0issued by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University a month after the U.S. and other nations\u00a0announced\u00a0the\u00a0agreement.", "The point of extending the breakout period is to give the international community enough time to react \u2014 if Iran moves ahead with production of a nuclear weapon.", "\u201cSome contributors to this report believe that breakout time by year 15 could be comparable to what it is today \u2014 a few months \u2014 while others believe it could be reduced to a few weeks,\u201d the Harvard report said. \u201cIn any event, Iran is unlikely to attempt breakout at Natanz during this period because detection would be swift and the risk of provoking a military attack would be high. Since all enrichment will be limited to Natanz for 15 years under the JCPOA, Iran\u2019s nuclear program would be vulnerable to military attack.\u201d", "\u201cAfter 15 years, all physical constraints on enrichment imposed by the agreement will be lifted,\u201d the Harvard report said.", "Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio falsely said: \u201cThe bottom 60 percent haven\u2019t seen a raise since 1980.\u201d Analyses of Census data by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service and the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank that advocates for low- and middle-income workers, show there has been a rise in inflation-adjusted wages over that time period, even if the percentage increase was relatively small, especially compared with the 90th percentile of workers.", "Ryan, however, didn\u2019t comment on the magnitude of the wage increase. He said there hasn\u2019t been an increase at all.", "In a\u00a02019 report, EPI showed that every percentile had seen a cumulative percentage increase in real (inflation-adjusted) hourly wages from 1979 to 2018, with considerably higher increases for high-income earners. The 50th percentile experienced a 14% increase, and the 70th percentile saw a 17.1% increase. The 10th percentile saw just a 4.1% increase, while the 95th percentile saw its wages grow by 56.1%. (See Appendix Figure B.) \u201cRising wage inequality and sluggish hourly wage growth for the vast majority of workers have been defining features of the American labor market for nearly four\u00a0decades, despite steady productivity growth,\u201d the report began. It continued: \u201cWhat also stands out in this last year of data is that, while wages are growing for most workers, wage growth continues to be slower than would be expected in an economy with relatively low unemployment.\u201d", "Another EPI report (see Figure A)\u00a0shows\u00a0the real wage change for the 60th percentile from 2000 to 2018 (4.9 percent) and from 2007 to 2018 (2.1 percent). The upper-percentiles did considerably better. \u201cBecause of the recent uptick in wages for the 20th through 40th percentiles over the last year on top of steady increases over the last few years at the 10th percentile, wage growth is in the rough shape of a checkmark with stronger growth at the bottom attributed to several consecutive years of state-level minimum wage increases and a growing economy, while the fastest growth at and near the top is a continuation of the trends in growing inequality since the 1970s,\u201d EPI wrote in a report that noted \u201ca steadily improving economy should eventually translate into stronger wage growth.\u201d", "The Congressional Research Service used the same Census dataset to analyze the wage trends from 1979 to 2017. The\u00a0report\u00a0found that the 50th percentile experienced a cumulative 6.1% growth over that time period, with men in that percentile actually seeing a decrease of 6% while women saw a 25.5% increase. \u201cIn summary, analysis of the data shows that overall wages rose in real terms over the 1979 to 2017 period at the top of the wage distribution, increased slightly at the middle of the wage distribution, and rose to an even lesser degree at the bottom of the distribution.\u201d", "We reached out to Ryan\u2019s campaign to ask for the source of his claim, but we did not receive a response.", "Booker used a common but disputed comparison to justify his support for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d", "Booker:\u00a0There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America, from pharmaceutical companies to insurers. Literally, the overhead for insurance that they charge is 15 percent, while Medicare\u2019s overhead is only at 2 percent.", "It\u2019s true that the most recent\u00a0Trustees Report\u00a0of the Medicare system puts total \u201cadministrative expenses\u201d at $9.9 billion last year. That\u2019s actually 1.3 percent of total Medicare expenditures for the year \u2014 even less than the 2 percent figure Booker cited. So far, so good.", "But is Medicare really as economically efficient as that small number suggests? Hardly. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (a nonpartisan arm of Congress) estimates that in fiscal year 2017\u00a0Medicare made $52 billion in \u201cimproper payments,\u201d\u00a0including those that were fraudulent or erroneous. Spending more on administration might cut losses from waste and fraud.", "It\u2019s also true that the\u00a0health insurance industry says\u00a0that in 2014 through 2016 an average of 18.2 cents of every private premium dollar went for things other than doctors, hospitals and other health-care services. But by no means can all of that be called \u201coverhead.\u201d An average of 4.7 cents went for federal, state and local taxes, for example.", "Most of the remaining 13.5 cents clearly falls under the heading of \u201coverhead,\u201d including 3.3 cents for \u201cfees and business expenses\u201d; 2.3 cents for \u201cprofit\u201d; 1.8 cents for \u201ccustomer engagement\u201d; 1.6 cents for \u201cfinance, claims and special investigations; 0.7 cent for \u201cadministrative.\u201d", "But the 13.5 cents also includes 1.6 cents for \u201ccare management,\u201d a category that includes health coaching and wellness programs aimed at improving customer health and thus reducing claims. If those expenses are considered to be benefits, then the \u201coverhead\u201d total shrinks to 11.9 cents.", "And there\u2019s another problem with Booker\u2019s comparison: Medicare beneficiaries are all age 65 or over, or disabled, and on average have much larger medical bills than the mostly under-65 population served by private health insurance. A\u00a02006 study estimated\u00a0that in 2003, the average medical cost for Medicare\u00a0was $6,600 per person per\u00a0year while the\u00a0average medical cost for private health insurance (excluding out-of-pocket costs) was less than half that \u2014\u00a0$2,700 per\u00a0person per year.", "So $1 spent on overhead for Medicare automatically becomes a smaller percentage of total spending than does $1 spent on overhead for private insurance. And that also means that if Medicare were extended to \u201call\u201d the percentage spent on overhead would rise.", "Our conclusion: Booker and others using this and similar claims have a point \u2014 Medicare does spend less on administration than private insurers. But it\u2019s not so simple as they would have you believe.", "In discussing the nation\u2019s opioid crisis, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke offered a misleading take on a pharmaceutical company\u00a0linked\u00a0to the epidemic.", "\u201cDespite what Purdue Pharma has done \u2014 their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we\u2019re seeing throughout this country \u2014 they\u2019ve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a single night in jail.\u201d", "It\u2019s accurate that no one from the company, the manufacturer of the\u00a0addictive painkiller\u00a0Oxycontin, spent time in jail. But it\u2019s inaccurate to say \u201cthey\u2019ve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences.\u201d", "In 2007, the company and three executives\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in federal court to charges relating to \u201cmisbranding\u201d OxyContin. Collectively, they agreed to pay more than $634 million in fines and other payments \u2014 what was\u00a0described\u00a0by the New York Times\u00a0as \u201cone of the largest amounts ever paid by a drug company in such a case.\u201d", "States also have recently\u00a0taken\u00a0action\u00a0against the company: In March, the Oklahoma Attorney General\u2019s Office\u00a0reached\u00a0a $270 million settlement with Purdue after\u00a0alleging\u00a0the company and others were to blame for the state\u2019s opioid epidemic.", "Booker cited studies that showed that when Connecticut enacted a permit-to-purchase gun law, \u201cthey saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides.\u201d Two studies did find an association with such drops in gun violence and suicides, but they stopped short of claiming the decline was\u00a0caused\u00a0by that law in Connecticut. And there\u2019s also some evidence states with similar laws have seen less dramatic results.", "Booker: If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and own a firearm. And not everybody in this field agrees with that. But in states like Connecticut that did that, they saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides. We need to start having bold agendas on guns.", "Currently, 10 states have enacted permit-to-purchase laws that require gun purchasers to obtain a permit or license, and three states require a license to own firearms,\u00a0according to the Giffords Law Center.", "Booker\u2019s claims about the effect of the permit-to-purchase law passed in Connecticut in 1995 come from two studies. The first, published in the\u00a0American Journal of Public Health\u00a0in 2015 concluded that \u201cthe law was associated with a 40% reduction in Connecticut\u2019s firearm homicide rates during the first 10 years that the law was in place.\u201d The second, published in\u00a0Preventive Medicine\u00a0in 2015, found a 15.4% reduction in suicide rates associated with Connecticut\u2019s law (and a rise in suicide rates in Missouri after it repealed its permit-to-purchase law).", "So Booker\u2019s statement is accurate. But both studies cited an\u00a0association, and stopped short of concluding that the decline was\u00a0caused\u00a0by those laws.", "In addition,\u00a0researchers caution\u00a0not to put too much stock in the results in any one state or city, as it is notoriously difficult to tease out the effects of various gun policies in states that often have a combination of policies. Results are further complicated because some states with strong gun policies are bordered by states that may or may not have similar policies. In other words, results in Connecticut may not be representative of how the law might affect gun crimes in other areas.", "Another\u00a0study, one that looked at licensing laws in large, urban counties around the U.S., found that permit-to-purchase laws \u201cwere associated with a 14% reduction in firearm homicide.\u201d And a\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0Journal of General Internal Medicine\u00a0in March found that universal background checks \u2014 either at the point of purchase or through a license/permit application \u2014 were associated with about a 15 percent reduction in homicide.", "In the course of demonstrating his support for the LGBT community, Booker said, \u201cWe don\u2019t talk enough about how many children, about 30 percent of LGBTQ kids, who do not go to school because of fear.\u201d", "There\u2019s a valid source for the statistic, but it could use some context. We asked Booker\u2019s campaign for a source for the number and were directed to an\u00a0NBC News story\u00a0about the 2017\u00a0GLSEN\u00a0National School Climate Survey, which found that 35% of\u00a0LGBTQ students missed one day of school or more in the prior month because of feeling unsafe at school.", "GLSEN\u00a0is a national advocacy group for LGBTQ rights in schools, and every other year releases a survey given to students identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer or questioning in American schools.\u00a0The\u00a02017 survey\u00a0included 23,001 students from across the country between the ages of 13 and 21.", "The 35% of students who missed school at least one day in the past month\u00a0\u201cbecause of feeling unsafe\u201d included 10.3% of students who said they missed one day, 14.1% who missed two or three days, 4% who missed four or five days and 6.5% who missed six or more days.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has similar data that suggest the number could be lower, although the survey populations differ. In the agency\u2019s first nationally representative study of the health risks of LGB high school students, which was released in 2016 based on a 2015 survey, the CDC found that\u00a0more than 1 in 10\u00a0LGB students missed at least one day of school in the past 30 days \u201cdue to safety concerns.\u201d\u00a0The survey did not ask about transgender identity, so it lacks that information.", "More specifically, the CDC survey found that\u00a012.5% of LGB students\u00a0missed one day of school or more\u00a0because they felt they would be unsafe at school or on their way to or from school, compared with\u00a05.6% of all students, 4.6% of heterosexual students and 10.8% of students who weren\u2019t sure.", "Fact Sheet. \u201cPresident Donald J.
