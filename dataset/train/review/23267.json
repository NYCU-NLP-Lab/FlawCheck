["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on September 24, 2018", "Competing campaign ads in the Nevada Senate race would have voters believe both candidates have done a disservice to veterans. But a closer inspection reveals cracks in several of the claims.", "Ads attacking lawmakers often point to their voting records. But we would caution readers that a single vote doesn\u2019t always tell the whole story and can be misrepresented by political campaigns.", "For instance, Heller\u2019s ad says Rosen \u201cvoted against holding the VA accountable for mistreating veterans,\u201d while Rosen\u2019s ad says she \u201cbroke with [House Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi to bring some accountability to the VA.\u201d Which is it?", "Rosen voted against a House bill that was supported overwhelmingly by Republicans, but she voted for a bipartisan Senate version, which was then signed into law by President Donald Trump.", "The incumbent senator\u2019s ad, launched on Sept. 11, features veterans who say they\u2019ll \u201cnever forget how Jacky Rosen treated us.\u201d The first complaint: \u201cRosen skipped a vote to help Vietnam veterans like me suffering from Agent Orange,\u201d one veteran says.", "Rosen did miss the vote on June 25, but her absence \u2014 and that of the other 44 House members who also missed the vote \u2014 made no difference in the outcome of the legislation. It passed on a 382-0 vote under an expedited process called \u201csuspension of the rules.\u201d", "\u201cThe purpose of considering bills under suspension is to dispose of non-controversial measures expeditiously,\u201d explains the Congressional Institute, a nonprofit educational organization.", "The legislation, the\u00a0Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, would enable Navy personnel who served offshore during the Vietnam War to submit disability claims for injuries related to exposure to Agent Orange under a presumption that they were exposed to the herbicide used by the U.S. military. The policy now of the Department of Veterans Affairs is to presume exposure if service members were onshore or on ships on inland waterways.", "Bills passed under the suspension procedure must garner a two-thirds majority, and the bill had an even larger majority in co-sponsors, with 330 lawmakers \u2014 or nearly 76 percent of the House \u2014 signing on to the legislation. The co-sponsors split close to evenly between Democrats (175) and Republicans (155).", "Rosen signed on as a co-sponsor on Feb. 28, 2017, nearly two months after the bill was introduced on Jan. 5, 2017. It continued gathering sponsors through May of this year.", "The congresswoman stated on the House floor on June 27, two days after the vote, that she had been absent due to \u201cwork-related travel\u201d but she would have voted yes on the measure.", "Voters can decide for themselves whether to fault Rosen for missing the vote, but the ad may well leave the misleading impression with some that her absence had an impact on the outcome of the legislation. It didn\u2019t.", "The bill is now being considered by the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs.", "The NRSC similarly attacks Rosen for this missed vote in two TV ads. In one, a veteran\u00a0tells viewers, \u201cWhen Congress debated helping veterans on Agent Orange, Jacky Rosen skipped town.\u201d In fact, the debate under the suspension of the rules was limited to 40 minutes and consisted solely of several lawmakers speaking in support of the bill, according to the Congressional Record.", "Rosen also was an original co-sponsor\u00a0of a bipartisan bill to expand benefits to veterans who served in Thailand during the Vietnam War. That bill was referred to committee in January and no action has been taken since.", "Heller\u2019s ad goes on to say that Rosen \u201cskipped [the Agent Orange vote] to film a campaign commercial.\u201d Rosen was on \u201cwork-related travel,\u201d as she said, but her campaign used some images from that trip in a campaign ad.", "Does that mean she went to \u201cfilm a campaign commercial\u201d? The two campaigns disagree about the intent of Rosen\u2019s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border that came during the\u00a0controversy over the Trump administration\u2019s separation of families apprehended at the border.", "\u201cThe Monday of the vote, she decided it was more important to shoot a commercial than showing up and voting to expand coverage for veterans suffering from the effects of\u00a0Agent\u00a0Orange,\u201d Heller campaign spokesman Keith Schipper told us. \u201cHer campaign was more important \u2014 more of a priority \u2014 than these heroes.\u201d", "On June 25, Rosen toured a detention facility in Texas for unaccompanied immigrant children, some of whom had been separated from their parents. She also toured the border with Rep. Salud Carbajal of California. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada toured another detention facility in Texas the same day.", "Rosen\u2019s congressional office noted in a press release that the congresswoman was an original co-sponsor\u00a0of the\u00a0Keep Families Together Act, aimed at prohibiting the separation of children from their parents when apprehended at the border. Nearly all of the 194 Democratic House members who signed on to the bill were original co-sponsors. She, along with 15 other Democrats, was also an original co-sponsor of\u00a0the\u00a0Reunite Children with their Parents Act,\u00a0which would require the Department of Homeland Security to reunite separated families.", "Nevada media outlets covered the trip and interviewed Rosen, who said the tent city detention facility wasn\u2019t \u201ca viable solution.\u201d She said:\u00a0\u201cWe need people to come to the table, talk about comprehensive immigration reform, talk about the oversight we need in the Justice Department, be sure that people have access to legal means if they\u2019re seeking asylum, and be sure that we are not going to be violators of human rights,\u201d according to the Nevada Independent.", "But Heller\u2019s campaign\u00a0charges that the visit was a political photo op, since Rosen\u2019s campaign used images from the border visit in a Spanish-language campaign ad. The Nevada Republican Party\u00a0filed an ethics complaint about it, saying the campaign had used \u201ctax dollars to pay for Rosen\u2019s most recent television commercial.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that the Nevada Democratic Party also has filed ethics complaints with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics\u00a0against Heller\u2019s campaign, with one of those complaints for a similar reason \u2014 using a Senate photo on his campaign site and in campaign materials.", "Heller\u2019s ad also says Rosen \u201ccampaigned in Hollywood with Jane Fonda.\u201d An NRSC ad also raises this issue, saying: \u201cHanoi Jane raised Jacky Rosen money for her campaign,\u201d using a nickname Fonda earned for her antiwar activities, in particular a visit to Hanoi in 1972 in which she was photographed with North Vietnamese soldiers on an antiaircraft gun.", "Rosen attended an April 20 fundraiser in California along with several female Democratic senators. According to the Los Angeles Times, the invitation said the event was hosted by actresses Jane Fonda and Connie Britton, along with others. Contributions went to a joint fundraising committee of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the campaigns of several of the lawmakers, including Rosen.", "But Rosen\u2019s campaign says that Fonda didn\u2019t actually attend the event. A DSCC aide confirmed that, saying in an email to FactCheck.org that Fonda \u201cdid not contribute or attend the event and was not expected to.\u201d", "A search of donor records through the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 website shows no donations from Fonda to Rosen\u2019s campaign.", "The joint fundraising committee that held the event \u2014 Women on the Road California 2018 \u2014 gave $11,400 to Rosen\u2019s campaign.", "So, according to the DSCC and Rosen\u2019s campaign, she has not actually \u201ccampaigned with\u201d Fonda in person. We can\u2019t say whether any of the attendees of the event donated money because of Fonda\u2019s association with it.", "Rosen\u2019s campaign responded to these claims with an ad of its own featuring veterans. In the TV spot, released Sept. 14, the veterans say that Heller was \u201cplaying politics with veterans\u201d and that his ads were \u201clies.\u201d They go on to charge that\u00a0\u201cHeller, he got the worst grade in Nevada on veterans.\u201d He did back in 2010, the last year that the nonprofit Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America released a report card on lawmakers.", "Heller, who was then in the House, and a Nevada senator tied for the worst grade in the Nevada delegation \u2013 a \u201cD.\u201d However, it\u2019s worth noting that two years earlier, the same group gave Heller a \u201cB\u201d for his actions on bills the IAVA supported. That was not the lowest grade awarded to the delegation that year. The IAVA launched the report card project in 2006, the group told us, issuing reports every two years through 2010. It was not able to provide the 2006 and 2008 reports.", "As we\u2019ve said with several of these claims, readers can come to their own conclusions about the significance of the IAVA rating. But it\u2019s worth noting that in the 2010 report card, there were some inherent disadvantages for Republicans like Heller in terms of the legislation IAVA highlighted. Sen. John McCain, for instance, also received a \u201cD,\u201d and had received a \u201cD\u201d in the 2008 report.", "Heller received 11 out of a possible 18 points. He and most other House Republicans failed to garner four of the possible points because they didn\u2019t co-sponsor legislation that was overwhelmingly sponsored by Democrats. (However, many Democrats didn\u2019t sign on as co-sponsors either. The most combined co-sponsors any one measure received was 125.)", "The IAVA told us the group chose those pieces of legislation because they \u201cfavored veterans,\u201d not a particular party. But, a spokesperson added, \u201cIn that Congress, Democrats held a fairly sizable majority in both chambers so it\u2019s not strange that many of the\u00a0bills passed began with Democrat sponsors. However, many of those bills had substantial bipartisan cosponsors.\u201d", "Heller also lost a point for missing a vote on a bill that received overwhelming support \u2014 which was the case in Rosen\u2019s missed vote this year.", "The House approved an appropriations bill funding the Department of Veterans Affairs by a 415-3 vote. That means nearly all House lawmakers earned a point in the IAVA report card for their yes votes \u2014 but not Heller. He had left Washington to attend his daughter\u2019s wedding, held the day after the vote in Lake Tahoe.", "Heller\u2019s campaign spokesman, Schipper, told us: \u201cDean Heller has a record supporting the IAVA\u2019s issues and it punished Heller\u00a0for attending his daughter\u2019s wedding.\u201d", "The Nevada Independent did a deep dive on Heller\u2019s score on the 2010 report card and his stances and action on the issues in question. Among the findings: \u201c[T]here is also evidence Heller supported some of the policies that he was docked for voting against because the policies were a small part of a much bigger and more complicated bill.\u201d", "One bill, for instance, provided additional compensation for service members who were \u201cstop-lossed\u201d \u2014 required to serve beyond their enlistment terms in Iraq and Afghanistan. But Heller voted for another version of the bill. Heller also voted against a bill that included provisions on sexual assault prevention programs in the military. It provided for a repeal of the Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell policy, and it passed\u00a0the House largely along party lines. He voted for another version \u2014 without the Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell repeal \u2014 and that version became law.", "IAVA said in its report that the grades weren\u2019t based on party but rather the legislation the group prioritized. \u201cThese grades are based on their votes and cosponsorship of IAVA Action\u2019s legislative priorities published and delivered to every Congressional office at the start of 2009 and 2010 and regularly reinforced by Congressional testimony and appearances in the media. The grades are based entirely on these priorities and are blind to party and ideology,\u201d it said.", "We\u2019d note that the exercise of grading Congress on any topic shows how emphasizing certain legislation over others makes a difference.", "And that\u2019s amply illustrated by these competing ads. As we said at the beginning of this article,\u00a0Rosen voted against a House bill\u00a0on VA accountability that was supported overwhelmingly by Republicans, but she voted for a bipartisan version, which passed the House by a 368-55 vote. Rosen\u2019s ad says she \u201cbroke with Pelosi\u201d on the vote, which is true \u2014 Pelosi, along with 53 other Democrats, voted against it. It also says she\u00a0\u201ctook on her own party,\u201d but she wasn\u2019t alone on that in this vote.", "\u201cThe first version of the bill was highly partisan and created due process concerns for\u00a0workers,\u201d a spokesperson for Rosen\u2019s campaign told us of why she supported one bill but not the other. \u201cRosen supported the more bipartisan Senate version of the bill to improve VA\u00a0accountability that addressed these concerns, and President Trump signed the bill into\u00a0law.\u201d", "The Senate didn\u2019t vote on the House bill, but instead passed its version of the legislation by voice vote.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
