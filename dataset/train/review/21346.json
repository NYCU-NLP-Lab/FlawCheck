The meme went on to claim that Harrington's patent was denied because Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had filed a similar patent six months earlier:", "There's nothing factual about this meme. This graphic was created as a joke to mock the type of conspiracy theories that have plagued the internet during the pandemic, which began in 2019.", "For starters, the man in this photograph is not a government employee named Christopher Harrington who worked under the administration of President Barack Obama. This is a generic stock photo of a businessman.", "Second, we were unable to find any patents for a mask with the serial number CV19-N95. Lastly, we've looked into Gates' patent history for previous articles, and found no record of him filing a CV19-N95 patent in 2015.", "The biggest red flag, however, comes from an uncropped version of this meme.

Also Christopher Harrington is the real name of the guy who played Jon Snow in Game of Thrones. Get it together, people. Memes aren't news sources.", "At some point, someone cropped this image to remove Brett Lofgreen's disclaimer and started to circulate this meme as if it relayed factual information.
