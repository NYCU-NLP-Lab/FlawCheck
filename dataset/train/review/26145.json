The post fooled many, including reporters. Most notably in terms of virality, however, it also fooled the anonymous entity behind the sprawling \u201cQAnon\u201d or \"Q\" conspiracy theory. On June 1, 2020, Q \u201cdropped\u201d a side-by-side shot of the gag segment on top of the the trailer, accusing the press of pushing an \u201cAmerica on Fire\u201d narrative:", "Q would later admit the mistake, confusingly blaming the mix up on \u201chelicopter rides\u201d which create verification \u201cchallenges.\u201d", "The viral attention apparently shocked Bad Scooter, who tweeted \u201cI dramatically underestimated Twitter.\u201d The user deleted the original video and posted an all caps clarification that the video was fake.
