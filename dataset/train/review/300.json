["Farmers across the country have been protesting against the centre\u2019s new agricultural laws for nearly two months now. Thousands of Punjab farmers are now marching to the national capital as part of their \u2018Dilli Chalo\u2019 protest. Strong barricading, police and security forces have been deployed at the Delhi border to prevent the protestors from reaching the capital. Since the early hours of November 26, farmers tried to continue their march, tearing down the barricades at the Patiala-Ambala highway and braving rounds of water cannons and tear gas. The Indian Youth Congress shared a few pictures claiming they represent the ongoing police action on farmers.
