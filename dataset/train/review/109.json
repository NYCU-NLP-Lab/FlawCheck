["About this rating", "A photograph purportedly showing a hearse being towed as a group of pallbearers carry a casket out of a church has been passed around as real on the Internet for several years:", "This image does not depict a genuine, real-world moment when a group of mourners realized that they would be walking to the grave site, but instead an onlooker's view of actors filming a scene for a television show.", "One giveaway is that a boom mic can be spotted just above the casket on the left side of the image. This piece of audio equipment is regularly used on television sets, but would be an oddity at a real funeral procession:", "In early 2010, Big Talk Productions was filming a scene for the show Rev. outside a church on Shoreditch High Street in London which involved a hearse being towed away during a funeral. As the actors began their faux funeral procession, a group of onlookers gathered to take videos and photographs of what they believed to be a truly grim situation.", "Peter Cattaneo, the show's director, told the Telegraph:", "Filming took place in and around the church of St Leonard\u2019s in Shoreditch, east London. One afternoon, the crew shot a scene in which a hearse was towed away by wheel clampers. \u2018Before long, a crowd had gathered and was getting really furious about it,\u2019 recalls the show\u2019s director, Peter Cattaneo (who also directed The Full Monty). \u2018I said to one of them, \u201cIt\u2019s a joke.\u201d And they said, \u201cIt\u2019s still disgusting!\u201d", "\u2018I think it was [made worse] because the word \u201cNan\u201d was in the hearse\u2019s window,\u2019 he adds.", "The scene comes from the third episode of the first season of Rev., and it can be briefly glimpsed in a featurette about the making of the show. Actor Tom Hollander can be seen approaching the hearse at the 55-second mark of the following video:", "An unofficial copy of the scene can be found on YouTube. Another image of Hollander with the hearse can be seen below:", "Wojdyla, Bem. \u00a0 \"This Has To Be Fake: Hearse Towed During Funeral.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Jalopnik. \u00a0 3 February 2010.", "Grant, Olly. \u00a0 \"Rev: a realistic and very funny new comedy from BBC Two.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Telegraph. \u00a0 25 June 2010.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
