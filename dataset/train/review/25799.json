["Tea party Republican Rand Paul raised some eyebrows in February 2011 when he said in two national TV interviews that the average public school teacher in Wisconsin \"is making $89,000 per year.\"\n\nBut the claim by the U.S. senator from Kentucky, which we ruled to be False, was not as surprising as one made nearly a year earlier by the conservative MacIver Institute.\n\nSpeaking about Milwaukee public school teachers, the Madison think tank declared in a March 3, 2010, news release:\n\n\"For the first time in history, the average annual compensation for a teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools system will exceed $100,000\" in 2011.\n\nIn light of Paul\u2019s comments, which were made during the heat of the nationally watched Wisconsin budget debate, we decided to take a closer look at MacIver\u2019s claim. It has resurfaced in the budget debate in comments on websites such as the Huffington Post and TheNation.com.\n\nIn announcing the $100,000 figure, the institute produced a video that included brief clips of an MPS administrator reciting salary and fringe benefit numbers during a school board meeting the previous day. The average total compensation figure for teachers exceeded $100,000.\n\nWe asked MacIver spokesman Brian Farley if he had any additional evidence. He cited a February 2011 posting from the School Zone blog on JSOnline.com, which reported slightly different numbers than those in MacIver\u2019s video.\n\nThe posting quoted MPS\u2019 budget manager as saying that in 2011-2012 (the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2011), the average MPS teacher would receive total compensation of $101,091 -- $59,500 in salary and $41,591 in benefits.\n\nWe double-checked with MPS spokeswoman Roseann St. Aubin and she confirmed the figures.\n\nWe wanted to compare the $101,091 for MPS teachers to other teachers, but the latest figures compiled by the state Department of Public Instruction are for 2009-2010, two years earlier.\n\nThose figures show for 2009-2010, MPS teachers earned, on average, $56,095 in salary plus $30,202 in benefits, for a total of $86,297.\n\nThat was lower than eight other school districts in Milwaukee County, including Greendale, Greenfield, Shorewood, Cudahy, Fox Point, South Milwaukee, Franklin and Nicolet, which was highest at just over $103,000.\n\nLet\u2019s return to the MacIver Institute claim.\n\nThe conservative think tank said the average annual compensation for a Milwaukee Public Schools teacher would exceed $100,000 in 2011. As of July 1, 2011, according to the school district, that figure will be $101,091.\n\nMacIver\u2019s claim is True.", "JSOnline.com, \"MPS could face $13.6 million shortfall; benefit rate still high,\" Feb. 10, 2011\n\nMacIver Institute,\"Average MPS teacher compensation tops $100k/year,\" March 3, 2010\n\nE-mail interview, Milwaukee Public Schools spokeswoman Roseann St. Aubin, March 2, 2011\n\nInterview,Milwaukee Teachers\u2019 Education Association president Mike Langyel, \u00a0March 3, 2011\n\nWisconsin Department of Public Instruction, 2009-2010 teacher compensation database", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
