Sarah Palin\u2019s speech at the Republican National Convention last week. Having stirred the crowd to its feet more than once, Palin delivered a knockout line when she deadpanned:", "\u201cI love those hockey moms. You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick.\u201d", "The line drew cheerful applause and has echoed ever since, which seems to explain how Sen. Barack Obama found himself in the middle of an uproar when he uttered a time-worn phrase to denigrate Sen. John McCain\u2019s proclaimed agenda for \u201cchange\u201d in Washington.", "\"John McCain says he's about change, too,\" Obama said. \"And so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out, George Bush! Except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy, and Karl Rove-style politics, we're really going to shake things up in Washington.'\"", "\"That's not change,\" Obama said. \"That's just calling something the same thing something different. But you know, you can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it\u2019s still going to stink after eight years. We\u2019ve had enough of the same old thing.\"", "Gasp! He just said lipstick! Did he just call Sarah Palin a pig??!!!", "That\u2019s the charge.", "Later that day, the McCain campaign arranged a conference call for reporters with Jane Swift, the former governor of Massachusetts. She said that when you add up Obama\u2019s comments and Palin\u2019s comments, you get Obama calling Palin a pig. Swift said Obama should apologize.", "\u201cCalling a very prominent female governor of one of our states a \u2018pig\u2019 is not exactly what we want to see,\u201d Swift said.", "The issue has dominated the presidential campaign for two days, with the McCain campaign stirring a controversy by having local lawmakers call for Obama to apologize, and the Obama campaign responding with examples of how often he and others have used the phrase. The next day, Obama called the McCain\u2019s campaign tactics \u201clies and phony outrage and Swift-boat politics.\u201d", "On Wednesday, the McCain campaign released a Web ad called \u201cLipstick.\u201d It begins with a clip of Palin delivering her lipstick line, then text flashes on the screen saying \u201cBarack Obama on: Sarah Palin.\u201d A moment later, the ad plays a small portion of Obama\u2019s \u201clipstick on a pig\u201d remark, but not enough of his quotation to make clear what he was talking about. The ad concludes with a clip of CBS anchor Katie Couric soberly remarking on sexism on the campaign trail.", "The ad has two big problems, as does the complaint of former Gov. Swift. First, in the full text of the remarks it\u2019s clear that Obama isn\u2019t talking about Sarah Palin. He\u2019s talking about McCain\u2019s argument that he represents change.", "Second, \u201cputting lipstick on a pig\u201d is a popular put-down, especially among politicians. It generally means taking a bad or unattractive idea and trying to dress it up.", "We weren\u2019t able to pin down the origins of this folksy expression, but we found tons of instances of people using it. The political newspaper\n\nThe Hill\n\nlabeled the phrase \u201cCongress Speak\u201d back in June, and gave it an official definition: \u201can expression used to illustrate that something unattractive cannot be beautified or otherwise positively changed by any amount of makeup or other exterior alterations.\u201d", "In 1986, Texas Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower used the phrase to criticize Ronald Reagan\u2019s farm policy. During the 2004 presidential campaign, both Dick Cheney and John Edwards used it to attack the other guy\u2019s running mate. Earlier this year, Democratic Congresswoman Linda Sanchez of California gave a speech on trade policy. \u201cYou know the old saying about putting lipstick on a pig? Well, I smell bacon,\u201d she groused.", "Obama and McCain both have used the expression.", "In September 2007,\n\nWashington Post\n\ncolumnist Eugene Robinson quoted Obama using the phrase to discuss Iraq policy:", "\u201cI think that both Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment,\u201d Obama said. \u201cGeorge Bush has given a mission to Gen. Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig.\u201d", "In Iowa on Oct. 11, 2007, McCain panned Sen. Hillary Clinton\u2019s health care plan, calling it \u201ceerily reminiscent\u201d of the plan that failed during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune.", "\u201cI think they put some lipstick on a pig,\u201d McCain said, \u201cbut it\u2019s still a pig.\u201d", "On Feb. 1, 2007, McCain blasted a Senate resolution that would have criticized President Bush\u2019s strategy in Iraq. Some had praised the resolution as a compromise measure, but McCain disagreed. \u201cIt gets down to whether you support what is being done in this new strategy or you don\u2019t,\u201d McCain said. \u201cYou can put lipstick on a pig, [but] it\u2019s still a pig, in my view.\u201d", "It is simply impossible to view the complete remarks by Obama and conclude that he\u2019s making a veiled and unsavory reference to Palin. Her name never is used in the preceding sentence. In fact, it\u2019s hard to see how one could interpret Obama\u2019s lipstick-on-a-pig remark as referring directly to McCain, either. We think it\u2019s very clear that Obama was saying McCain\u2019s effort to call himself the \u201ccandidate of change\u201d is like putting lipstick on a pig, trying to dress up a bad idea to look better. Agree or disagree with Obama\u2019s point, but his remark wasn\u2019t the smear that McCain\u2019s people have tried to make it.", "If anyone\u2019s doing any smearing, it\u2019s the McCain campaign and its outrageous attempt to distort the facts.
