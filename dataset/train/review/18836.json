["A 19-year old Dalit woman who was allegedly gang-raped in Hathras succumbed to injuries on September 29. She was subsequently cremated by Uttar Pradesh police without the consent of her family. The incident sparked protests led by the civil society and politicians who attempted to visit the victim\u2019s family. On October 5, Congress leader Udit Raj, along with a team 15 people heading to Hathras, was stopped by the police. In response, Raj and his associates \u2014 activists Yogita Bhayana, Alka Mahajan, and Shilpi Arora \u2014 staged a sit-in protest on the road. Around 1 pm, a live video of the protest was uploaded on Raj\u2019s Twitter handle.", "An eight-second clip from the protest has gone viral. It shows Raj tapping on the shoulder of a woman, whispering in her ear and sharing a laugh.
