["\u201cIn Texas, we arrested one man who filled out 1,700 ballots. That\u2019s what happens with mail-in ballots,\u201d reads a quote attributed to Barr on social media that gained traction in late September 2020.", "Barr\u2019s reference to the Texas case comes after President Donald Trump repeatedly attacked mail-in voting\u2019s reliability ahead of the November presidential election, despite experts\u2019 assurances that it is safe.", "While talking with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer about mail-in voting on September 2, Barr did claim that a Texas man was indicted for filling out 1,700 ballots for the candidate he wanted. \u201cElections that have been held with mail, have found substantial fraud and coercion,\u201d Barr said before citing the Texas case.", "However, Barr misrepresented a real example of suspected voter fraud in Texas.", "\u201cPrior to his interview, the Attorney General was provided a memo prepared within the Department that contained an inaccurate summary about the case which he relied upon when using the case as an example,\u201d Kerri Kupec, Justice Department spokeswoman, told The Washington Post in a statement.", "The Department of Justice did not respond to AFP\u2019s request for comment.", "A 2017 investigation led to the identification of nearly 700 possibly fraudulent ballots cast in Dallas\u2019 District 6 City Council election in May of that year.", "\u201cWhat was so unnerving about Barr\u2019s comments to me is that he would say that there were 1,700, and that number was wrong, but also, that\u2019s not what the case was about,\u201d Andy Chatham, the chief investigator on the case for the Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office at the time, told AFP by phone.", "After several people complained about receiving mail-in ballots without applying for them, Chatham and his team found around 700 ballots requested under the name Jose Rodriguez, \u201cso at that point we really thought this was a case of voter fraud,\u201d Chatham said.", "However, upon opening the ballots and verifying their accuracy with the voters, they turned out to be mostly consistent with voters\u2019 choices, and votes were cast for both candidates.", "Chatham then contacted the two candidates, Monica Alonzo and Omar Narvaez.", "\u201cThey indicated that they had been contacted numerous times,\u201d Chatham said, by people offering them to buy votes.", "Both candidates said that they refused, which Chatham and his team believe is the reason why\u00a0the ballots were split between the candidates.", "In the end, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any actual voter fraud. We have a guy who was trying to defraud the candidates. He\u00a0was trying to sell them this information,\u201d Chatham told AFP.", "Miguel Hernandez was eventually convicted for improperly returning a marked ballot that was signed \u2018Jose Rodriguez\u2019 and was sentenced to six months in jail.", "Chatham said that Hernandez was \u201cat the bottom level,\u201d of this scheme, and claimed not to know who organized it.", "Hernandez\u2019 lawyer at the time, Bruce Anton, told AFP by phone that the 27-year-old was approached by \u201ca neighbor,\u201d who gave him a list of people from whom to pick up ballots. Hernandez was paid $8 per ballot and \u201cdid it for about 20 ballots.\u201d", "Anton said Hernandez pled guilty because the \u201cstate had evidence that he knew that the people he was giving the ballots to might be tampering with them, and that would make him party to that offense.\u201d", "Early voting has already begun in some states, and mail-in ballots are expected to be used in unprecedented numbers because they are considered safer than in-person voting during the Covid-19 pandemic.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
