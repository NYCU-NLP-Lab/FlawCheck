["Ready for some \"billionaire talk,\" as a recent Facebook post was so labeled?", "\"I have known Trump for decades,\" reads a quote the post attributes to former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. \"We have traveled in the same business circles. He is known among millionaires as a con-artist and among business owners as a cheat out to stiff everyone.\"", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "We felt cheated when we searched for this quote online. There were only three results, none of them credible.

It doesn\u2019t include the statement, but Bloomberg did use the word \"con\" and \"cheat.\"", "\"Throughout his career,\" Bloomberg then said, \"Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry shareholders, and contractors who feel cheated, and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off. Trump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s run his business. God help us. I\u2019m a New Yorker and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!\"", "Bill de Blasio, the current mayor of New York City, has more recently called Trump a con. As a candidate in the crowded Democratic presidential race, he\u2019s positioning himself as the person to defeat \u00a0\"Con Don,\" as he called him on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America.", "On June 7, it was widely reported that Bloomberg was donating $500 million to help close all remaining U.S. coal plants.", "But we couldn\u2019t find the comment that was credited to Bloomberg in this Facebook post, which was published the same day.", "We rate this post False.", "Facebook post, June 7, 2019", "Politico, \"Bloomberg rips Trump: \u2018Totally incompetent,\u2019\" Jan. 25, 2019", "The Associated Press, \"Michael Bloomberg to plunge $500M into clean energy effort,\" June 6, 2019", "HuffPost, \"Michael Bloomberg will donate $500 million to help close all remaining U.S. coal plants,\" June 7, 2019", "ABC News, \"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announces 2020 presidential bid,\" May 16, 2019", "June 12, 2019 email from Anna Miroff, media strategist, Stu Loeser & Co", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
