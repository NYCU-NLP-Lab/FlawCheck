["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on February 11, 2021", "President Joe Biden overstated the impact of raising the federal minimum wage to $15, claiming that \u201cif you\u2019re making less than $15 an hour,\u201d and working 40 hours a week, \u201cyou\u2019re living below the poverty wage.\u201d Not everyone earning less than that would be below the federal poverty guidelines or lifted above the guidelines with $15-an-hour pay.", "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 17 million workers would be \u201cdirectly affected\u201d by increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025 \u2014 those workers would otherwise earn less than that. But the number in poverty would decline by 900,000.", "Those working full-time and earning the current federal minimum wage \u2014 $7.25 an hour \u2014 would be below the federal poverty guideline of $17,420\u00a0for a family of two. Such a worker would earn only $14,500 if working 40 hours a week for 50 weeks a year. A White House spokesperson referred us to those poverty guidelines, while another spokesperson told PolitiFact.com that Biden was referring to families of four.", "Workers earning between $11 and $13 an hour and in a family of four with no other income would still be below those poverty guidelines. But those earning $14 an hour \u2014 $28,000 a year \u2014 would be above the federal poverty level of $26,500 for a family of four.", "Federal guidelines include higher thresholds for Alaska and Hawaii. In those states, workers earning $14 or $15 an hour in a family of four would be below the poverty guidelines.", "Biden made the claim in an interview with CBS News that aired on Feb. 5. He said he expected a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour \u2014 which was part of his COVID-19 relief package \u2014 would not be included in the final legislation, the American Rescue Plan.", "\u201cMy guess is it will not be in it,\u201d Biden said. But he went on to say that he supported the policy.", "\u201cI am prepared, as president of the United States on a separate negotiation on minimum wage, to work my way up from what it is now, which is \u2014 look, no one should work 40 hours a week and live below the poverty wage. And if you\u2019re making less than $15 an hour, you\u2019re living below the poverty wage,\u201d Biden said,\u00a0without specifying the size of the worker\u2019s family.", "Our calculations above show gross income, before taxes. Federal, state and local government programs offering assistance to low-income individuals may use before- or after-tax thresholds for eligibility. The Census Bureau uses before-tax money income and slightly different poverty thresholds to determine its poverty measure.", "While the federal minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009, 29 states plus Washington, D.C., Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands have set higher minimums, and some cities have enacted their own minimum wage hikes. Washington state currently has the highest statewide minimum wage at $13.69, while the wage is $15 in Washington, D.C.", "As we said, raising the minimum wage as Biden proposes would lift some workers out of poverty, and raise the wages of millions more. But it also would cause job losses, according to a Feb. 8 report by the CBO.", "That also contradicts Biden\u2019s claim in the CBS News interview that working up to a $15 minimum wage \u201call the economics show, if you do that, the whole economy rises.\u201d The Washington Post Fact Checker wrote about that claim, explaining that economists disagree on the impact of a minimum wage hike, with liberal economists finding little to no job loss but competing research concluding employment would decline.", "The CBO estimated the effects of a Senate bill to increase the federal minimum wage annually, reaching $15 an hour by June 2025. In that year, the number of people in poverty would decline by 900,000, but employment would also drop by 1.4 million people, according to CBO\u2019s average estimate.", "The report said there is a 33% chance that between zero and 1 million jobs would be lost, and a 33% chance that between 1 million and 2.7 million jobs would be lost.", "The \u201c17 million workers whose wages would otherwise be below $15 per hour would be directly affected, and many of the 10 million workers whose wages would otherwise be slightly above that wage rate would also be affected,\u201d the CBO said. Among the 10 million workers, \u201cwages for many of those workers would increase as employers sought to retain some of the differences in pay that had previously existed among those workers.\u201d", "The Economic Policy Institute, which receives some of its funding from labor unions, analyzed the same congressional proposal as the CBO but found more workers would see higher wages. It estimated the legislation would raise the pay of nearly 32 million workers and \u201cmeaningfully reduce the number of families in poverty.\u201d", "EPI also argues that a single, full-time worker without kids needs $15 an hour \u201cto achieve a modest but adequate standard of living.\u201d", "Biden worded his claim differently in remarks on Jan. 22. He said: \u201cNo one in America should work 40 hours a week making below the poverty line. Fifteen dollars gets people above the poverty line. We have so many millions of people working 40 hours a week \u2014 working \u2014 and some with two jobs, and they\u2019re still below the poverty line.\u201d", "A $15 minimum wage would get some people \u201cabove the poverty line,\u201d as the CBO report shows. But not everyone earning under $15 is below the poverty guidelines.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
