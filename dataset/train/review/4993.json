We did this on our own accord in response to the voter registration issue we're still dealing with here in Georgia in 2018 (53 thousand registered voters voices won't be heard this election).", "The New Black Panthers also hinted at more tepid support for Abrams than these sources suggested, differing with her over her positions on issues such as gun legislation (the New Black Panthers are Second Amendment enthusiasts, while Abrams supports policies such as universal background checks):", "Look, I'll admit the 2nd Amendment issue is obviously a major issue for us too and as large as we are and based on our beliefs obviously we are not a monolithic voting block either locally or nationally. But let's be honest, the most a Democrat Governor in Georgia could do if elected here is veto new Pro Gun Bills that come to her desk which Republicans have been avoiding as well because of all the negative press it would bring them due to the new March for Our Lives Movement.", "She can't Confiscate our Weapons we already own or take away our Current 2nd Amendment Rights we have in a state that's obviously gonna maintain it's Republican Controlled Legislature which she would realistically need to be majority Democrat in order to actually attack the 2nd Amendment Rights we're proud to have here in Georgia. A lot of times politicians have to say certain things to win their party's nomination, you all know that.", "In other accounts, the group's chairman voiced more open support for Abrams:", "Hashim Nzinga, national chairman of the New Black Panther Party, knows that people are talking about those pictures of members campaigning for Stacey Abrams while carrying long guns.", "And Nzinga understands it may look weird for an organization like his, which encourages members to arm themselves and carry weapons openly, to support a candidate who has advocated for gun control.", "But that is exactly what happened, he said. Those pictures were taken in Southwest Atlanta and reflect the New Black Panthers exercising their right to participate in the political process, he said.", "\u201cWe were doing what everybody is doing in November,\u201d Nzinga said. \u201cWe were campaigning for the candidate that we feel is best to represent our community. And the pictures were taken where we work the best: in our community.\u201d", "Members decided to support Abrams after reading her platform, he said. Plus they believe Kemp\u2019s alliance with President Donald Trump makes him an unacceptable candidate.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean they agree with Abrams on everything, especially the firearm issue.", "\u201cEven when she is going against gun laws, which is a foundation of the Panther Party, we still think she is a better candidate than this Trump sympathizer who is openly attacking our community,\u201d Nzinga said.", "We found no accounts from Atlanta reporting that this New Black Panthers group had shown up at polling places (or anywhere else) or had overtly attempted to coerce or intimidate voters into casting ballots for Stacey Abrams. Similarly, Wired noted of such claims that:", "The [Breitbart] article compares that rally, which appeared to have no more than five Black Panthers in attendance based on a review of 22 photos the group put on Facebook, to the thousand-person-plus rally Trump held for Kemp that same night.", "Kemp\u2019s supporters are using the same images to claim that Black Panthers are intimidating voters at the polls ... it is clear that these images have been taken by Kemp\u2019s supporters out of context -- they do not show armed individuals at the polls in Georgia, but rather a small gathering that happened on Saturday on a street corner in Atlanta.", "The Breitbart article included no indication that the Abrams campaign condoned, or was even aware of, this activity of the part of the New Black Panther Party, nor any indication that Breitbart had made any attempt to ascertain that information. Instead, the article offered only a critical statement from the campaign of Abrams' Republican opponent.", "We reached out to Breitbart with a set of questions about the story, but political editor Matt Boyle declined to comment. We also reached out to the New Black Panther Party and did not receive a response. A spokesperson for the Abrams campaign responded to our query but didn't address the issue directly, saying via email that:", "Brian Kemp is the only candidate in this race who has posed for pictures with supporters wearing racist, hate-filled t-shirts and refused to denounce them, while Abrams continues to condemn any racist, anti-Semitic, or otherwise discriminatory words and actions.", "The New Black Panther Party, which takes their name from an older and defunct political organization which originated during the Civil Rights Era, is categorized as an extremist hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) because of anti-Semitic and violent rhetoric.", "The Georgia gubernatorial election has been a heated close call and beset with racial strife. Abrams' opponent, Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp, has been accused of disenfranchising tens of thousands of black voters, leading to accusations of conflict of interest.", "Although Kemp denounced a white supremacist group's racist robocall attacking Abrams, Abrams' camp has blasted Kemp for posing in a photograph with a supporter wearing a t-shirt bearing an anti-Islam message:", "[I]t was reported that racist robocalls bankrolled by white supremacists were targeting Abrams and Oprah Winfrey, who has campaigned in the state. Kemp said the calls were \u201cvile\u201d but Abrams criticized his response.", "\u201cI think it\u2019s a little late for him to repudiate racist remarks, given that he stood with someone wearing an anti-Islam T-shirt, he refused to denounce the same man earlier,\u201d Abrams said, referring to a photo that showed Kemp standing with a man wearing a T-shirt claiming \u201cAllah is not God\u201d.", "Donald Trump, who has used incendiary language in his campaign appearances over the past few weeks, appeared with Kemp in Georgia, at a rally which Kemp pulled out of a scheduled debate with Abrams to attend.", "As the election cycle wound down to the wire, Kemp opened a hacking investigation into his Democratic foes without citing evidence of their culpability.", "WGCL. \u00a0 \"Members of New Black Panther Party Seen Holding Guns, Stacey Abrams Campaign Sign.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 5 November 2018.", "Martin, Jonathan and Alexander Burns. \u00a0 \"Stacey Abrams Wins Georgia Democratic Primary for Governor, Making History.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 22 May 2018.", "Stracqualursi, Veronica. \u00a0 \"Racist Robocall Targets Stacey Abrams, Oprah in Georgia Governor's Race.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN. \u00a0 3 November 2018.", "Fausset, Richard and Alan Blinder. \u00a0 \"Brian Kemp\u2019s Office, Without Citing Evidence, Investigates Georgia Democrats Over Alleged \u2018Hack.\u2019\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 4 November 2018.", "Bernstein, Joseph. \u00a0 \"Here's How Breitbart and Milo Smuggled White Nationalism Into the Mainstream.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 BuzzFeed News. \u00a0 5 October 2017.", "Starr, Penny. \u00a0 \"Armed Black Panthers Lobby for Democrat Gubernatorial Candidate Stacey Abrams.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Breitbart. \u00a0 4 November 2018.", "Mitchell, Tia. \u00a0 \"Those Pictures of New Black Panthers Campaigning for Abrams Are Real, And They Aren\u2019t Apologizing.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Atlanta-Journal Constitution. \u00a0 6 November 2018.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
