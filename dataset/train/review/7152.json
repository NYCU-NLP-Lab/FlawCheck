In so doing, he managed to get the entire crowd doing a variation of the the Nazi salute. He didn\u2019t mention the words \u201cNazi\u201d or \u201cHitler\u201d but he didn\u2019t have to.

However, footage of the event\u00a0looked much more\u00a0benign than the photo: Trump first asked the crowd whether they \"liked\" him, before appearing to spontaneously elicit a pledge. He asked attendees to raise their right hands, then rattled off a promise for them to recite to vote for him:", "Separate stills from the rally revealed a scene that looked more like a Pledge of Allegiance than a Third Reich gathering:", "Subsequent tweets by the same reporter (Jenna Johnson, who is on the Trump beat) indicated that the pledge was an element Trump incorporated into later campaign stops:", "In NC, Trump again has his crowd pledge to vote for him, although this one was shorter. \"Should we do the pledge?

A disgrace.\u201d", "Most presidential campaigns are equipped with \"rapid response\" teams that are tasked with spotting these sorts of trends on social media before they go viral and are widely picked up by the media. But Trump runs a small shop and usually acts as his own one-man rapid response team, immediately responding to controversy on Twitter. Trump usually seems to have his finger right on the pulse of social media, but in this case it appears that no one briefed the boss before he called into the \"Today Show\" on Tuesday morning.", "\"Today's\" Savannah Guthrie brought up Foxman's comparison to a \"Nazi salute\" and asked Trump: \"I wonder how you feel about that comparison and whether it would make you want to perhaps not do it anymore, if people do feel that way?\"", "\"Well, I think it's ridiculous.
