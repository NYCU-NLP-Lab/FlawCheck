["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on January 15, 2020", "Since announcing on Jan. 2 that a U.S. operation had killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the Trump administration has offered various accounts of the intelligence assessments that President Donald Trump relied on to make his decision.", "Initially, Trump administration officials said Soleimani was planning an \u201cimminent attack\u201d against U.S. service members and diplomats without providing any evidence or offering any details. \u201cWe don\u2019t know precisely when and we don\u2019t know precisely where \u2014 but it was real,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a Jan. 9 interview.", "Over the course of two days, Jan. 9 and Jan. 10, the president escalated the imminent threats posed by Soleimani with new details \u2014 but no evidence \u2014 that even members of Congress were not given in their classified briefings.", "On Jan. 9, Trump told reporters Soleimani was threatening to \u201cblow up\u201d the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, and later told his supporters at a political rally that Soleimani \u201cwas looking very seriously at our embassies and not just the embassy in Baghdad.\u201d A day later, Trump told Fox News, \u201cI can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies.\u201d", "But, in the Fox News interview, Trump hedged his revelations with the words \u201cI believe\u201d and \u201cI think.\u201d He went on in that interview to say, \u201cI think it would have been four embassy, could have been military bases, could have been a lot of other things too.\u201d", "Two days later, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he \u201cdidn\u2019t see\u201d any intelligence that indicated the Iranians would attack four embassies. He also said the president was merely expressing his belief that there \u201ccould have been attacks against additional embassies.\u201d", "Trump responded on Twitter by saying it \u201cdoesn\u2019t really matter\u201d if a \u201cfuture attack by terrorist Soleimani was \u2018imminent\u2019 or not\u201d because of Soleimani\u2019s \u201chorrible past,\u201d which the U.S. has said includes \u201cthe deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members\u201d during the Iraq war.", "Here we provide a timeline of what Trump administration officials said about the reasons for killing Soleimani.", "Jan. 2 \u2014 A U.S. drone strike at Baghdad\u2019s airport kills Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. The attack also kills five others.", "In a statement, the Defense Department says Soleimani \u201cwas actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.\u201d There was no mention of an \u201cimminent attack.\u201d", "Jan. 3 \u2014 In an address to the nation, Trump says, \u201cSoleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him.\u201d", "In a background briefing for the media, an unnamed senior State Department official says the airstrike that killed Soleimani \u201cwas a defensive strike that was taken and supported by very solid intelligence, and I\u2019ve seen all the intelligence. This was strongly supported by everything that we were seeing that Soleimani was planning imminent attacks against American diplomats and our armed forces members in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and in the region.\u201d", "In an on-the-record media call, National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien tells reporters that the airstrikes against Soleimani were authorized under the 2002 Authority for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, or AUMF.", "\u201cThe President exercised America\u2019s clear and inherent right of self-defense to counter this threat,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cIt was a fully authorized action under the 2002 AUMF and was consistent with his constitutional authority as Commander-in-Chief to defend our nation and our forces against attacks like those that Soleimani has directed in the past and was plotting now.\u201d", "CNN host John Berman asks Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the nature of the \u201cimminent threats.\u201d He declines to discuss details \u2014 except to say it was based on U.S. intelligence.", "\u201cJohn, I can\u2019t talk too much about the nature of the threats, but the American people should know that President Trump\u2019s decision to remove Qasem Soleimani from the battlefield saved American lives. There\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Pompeo says. \u201cHe was actively plotting in the region to take actions, a big action, as he described it, that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk. We know it was imminent. This was an intelligence-based assessment that drove our decision-making process.\u201d", "Jan. 5 \u2014 On ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d Pompeo denies a report in the New York Times that some administration officials \u201cvoiced private skepticism about the rationale for a strike\u201d on Soleimani.", "\u201cGeorge, the senior leaders who had access to all of the intelligence, there was no skepticism,\u201d Pompeo tells host George Stephanopoulos. \u201cI think General Milley used the term, we would have been culpably negligent had we not taken this strike. The intelligence assessment made clear that no action, allowing Soleimani to continue his plotting, his planning, his terror campaign created more risks than taking the action that we took last week. We reduced risks.\u201d", "Jan. 6 \u2014 In a joint press conference with Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says of Soleimani: \u201cWe know his history. Importantly we knew his future. I\u2019m not going to go into the details of that, and I know that a lot of people are out there \u2013 I\u2019ve seen words like, oh, the intel was razor thin. Very, very few people saw that intelligence. He and I saw that intelligence. And I will be happy, when the appropriate time comes in front of the proper committees and anybody else, through history and every \u2013 I\u2019ll stand by the intelligence I saw, that \u2013 that was compelling, it was imminent, and it was very, very clear in scale, scope.\u201d", "Jan. 7 \u2014 Esper tells reporters in a press briefing that he will share classified information today with the Gang of Eight about the decision to kill Soleimani. The Gang of Eight are the congressional leaders (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer) and chairmen and ranking minority party members of the House and Senate intelligence committees (Reps. Adam Schiff and Devin Nunes, and Sens. Richard Burr and Mark Warner).", "\u201c[T]he exquisite intelligence that we\u2019re talking about that led to the decision to \u2014 that was, I should say, one of the factors that led to the decision to strike at Soleimani is \u2014 is \u2014 is only shared with a handful of members, the so-called Gang of Eight.\u00a0 And so they are getting that briefing this afternoon, and \u2014 and \u2014 and they will have access to that, but most [congressional] members will not have access to that,\u201d Esper says.", "Jan. 8 \u2014 The Trump administration holds additional less detailed briefings for other members of Congress.", "After the briefings, Esper tells reporters, \u201cI got back from the Hill where the national security team and I have briefed members of Congress in both the House and Senate.\u00a0 Both briefings went long, longer than expected, but that was a very good discussion.\u00a0 We covered a number of issues in both the House and Senate, everything ranging from authorities and imminence, all the way through force posture, next steps, et cetera.\u201d He acknowledges that some members of Congress \u2014 which includes GOP Sen. Mike Lee \u2014 may have been dissatisfied with the briefing, but \u201cmost members of Congress do not have access to the intelligence that I think was the most compelling.\u00a0 That\u2019s just simply the nature of the intelligence, and it\u2019s restricted to the Gang of Eight, if you will.\u201d", "In a letter to the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft says the U.S. decision to kill Soleimani was an act of self-defense \u201cin accordance with Article 51 of Charter of the United Nations.\u201d She writes that in recent months \u201cthe United States has been the target of a series of escalating threats and armed attacks by the Islamic Republic of Iran,\u201d including the Dec. 27, 2019, death of a U.S. government contractor.", "Jan. 9 \u2014 In an interview on Fox News, Pompeo says (at 3:06 into the interview): \u201cThere is no doubt that there were a series of imminent attacks that were being plotted by Qassem Soleimani. We don\u2019t know precisely when \u2014 and we don\u2019t know precisely where \u2014 but it was real.\u201d", "At an unrelated White House event, Trump says, \u201cWe did it because they were looking to blow up our embassy [in Baghdad]. We also did it for other reasons that were very obvious. Somebody died \u2014 one of our military people died. People were badly wounded just a week before. And we did it. And we had a shot at him, and I took it, and that shot was pinpoint accurate.\u201d Asked to provide details on the plot to blow up the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, Trump says, \u201cNo, I think it was obvious.\u201d", "At a political rally in Ohio, Trump says, \u201cSoleimani was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies and not just the embassy in Baghdad.\u201d", "Jan. 10 \u2014 At a White House press briefing, a reporter asks Pompeo about Trump\u2019s remarks that Iran was planning an attack against the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and other embassies. \u201cWe had specific information on an imminent threat, and those threats included attacks on U.S. embassies. Period. Full stop,\u201d Pompeo says.", "Asked how an Iranian attack could be \u201cimminent\u201d if, as he had said, the U.S. did not know \u201cprecisely when\u201d or \u201cprecisely where\u201d the attack would take place, Pompeo says: \u201cThose are completely consistent thoughts. I don\u2019t know exactly which minute. We don\u2019t know exactly which day it would\u2019ve been executed. But it was very clear: Qasem Soleimani himself was plotting a broad, large-scale attack against American interests.\u00a0 And those attacks were imminent.\u201d", "In an interview on Fox News, Trump says he believes four U.S. embassies were at risk of attack. This is the first time that any administration official has mentioned four possible targets, although he did not name which ones or when the attacks would happen.", "\u201cI can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies. And I think that probably Baghdad already started. \u2026 Baghdad certainly would have been the lead. But I think it would have been four embassy, could have been military bases, could have been a lot of other things too. But it was imminent and then all of a sudden, he was gone,\u201d Trump says.", "Jan. 12 \u2013 In an appearance on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Schiff, a member of the Gang of Eight, says: \u201cThere was no discussion in the Gang of Eight briefings that these are the four embassies that are being targeted.\u201d He also says he could not recall if the briefing included \u201ca specific discussion about bombing the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.\u201d", "Host Margaret Brennan also asks Esper about Trump\u2019s statement that the Iranians planned to attack four U.S. embassies, and why the Gang of Eight wasn\u2019t given that information in a classified briefing.", "Esper says he \u201cdidn\u2019t see\u201d any intelligence that indicated the Iranians would attack four embassies. He also suggests that the president may have been merely expressing his belief that there \u201ccould have been attacks against additional embassies.\u201d Here is the Esper\u2019s exchange with Brennan:", "Esper: Well, what the President said was he believed that it probably and could have been attacks against additional embassies. I shared that view. I know other members of National Security Team shared that view. That\u2019s why I deployed thousands of American paratroopers to the Middle East to reinforce our embassy in Baghdad and other sites throughout the region.", "Brennan: Probably, and could have been.", "Esper: Mm-Hm.", "Brennan: That is\u2013 that sounds more like an assessment than a specific, tangible threat with a\u2013 a decisive piece of intelligence.", "Esper: Well, the President didn\u2019t say there was a tangible\u2013 he didn\u2019t cite a specific piece of evidence. What he says probably\u2013 he believed, could have been\u2013", "Brennan: Are you saying there wasn\u2019t one?", "Esper: I didn\u2019t see one with regard to four embassies. What I\u2019m saying is I share the President\u2019s view that probably\u2013 my expectation was they were going to go after our embassies. The embassies are the most prominent display of American presence in a country.", "Jan. 13 \u2014 Trump tweets, \u201cThe Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Soleimani was \u201cimminent\u201d or not, & was my team in agreement. The answer to both is a strong YES., but it doesn\u2019t really matter because of his horrible past!\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
