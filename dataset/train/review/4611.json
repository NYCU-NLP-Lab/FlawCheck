["Youth unemployment is down 44% since 2010.", "Correct.", "\u201cYouth unemployment down 44.2%\u201d", "Young Conservatives, 17 July 2018", "It\u2019s correct that youth unemployment in the UK\u2014in this case people aged 16-24, is down by 44% since 2010, when the Coalition government entered office. That\u2019s about the same fall as seen across employment of all age groups.", "Just before the 2010 general election there were an estimated 940,000 young people unemployed. That reached over a million in 2011 and 2012, before falling back to today\u2019s estimate of about 520,000. That\u2019s roughly a return to the levels last seen in the early 2000s.", "The unemployment rate measures the proportion of people in the jobs market who don\u2019t have one, so it doesn\u2019t count people who aren\u2019t actively seeking work. For people aged 16-24, the unemployment rate has also fallen from 20% at the 2010 election to 12% now.", "Honesty in public debate matters", "You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email", "I\u2019m in", "Plenty of young people aren\u2019t even in the jobs market, usually because they\u2019re in full time education, and they aren\u2019t counted against the unemployment rate.", "You can still be employed if you\u2019re in full time education and you do part time work, although most students don\u2019t.", "Out of all young people, 55% are employed, 7% are unemployed and 38% are economically inactive (neither in work nor actively seeking it).", "Young people are more likely than most to be working part time or in temporary employment, or on a zero-hours contract. That said, the majority\u00a0of young people aged 16-24 in work have a full time job.", "Some comments in response to the claim on Twitter say it hides the fact that more young people are staying on in education, so not counting towards the unemployment figures.", "This isn\u2019t a fair criticism of the situation since 2010,\u00a0where there hasn't\u00a0been much movement in the education trends, so the fall in unemployment is genuine.", "But there is a point here about the longer term. The recession in the late 2000s corresponded with an increase in the proportion of young people in full time education, and the proportion who are economically inactive. Those increases accelerated long-term trends in both measures.", "Even though the jobs market has recovered since then, those\u00a0figures haven\u2019t returned to pre-recession levels.", "The proportion of young people aged 16-24 who are economically inactive is at near record levels, as is the proportion in full-time education.", "So the employment figures have been heading in a positive direction, but we haven\u2019t returned to quite the same jobs market we used to have.", "A NEET is someone not in education, employment or training. Education and training include apprenticeships, government work programmes, people who\u2019ve recently finished job-related training and people enrolled on an education course and are waiting to start or for term to restart.", "So these figures, broadly, give us a sense of how many young people aren\u2019t involved in the jobs market and aren\u2019t studying or training towards one.", "They also show a positive direction since 2010 from the government\u2019s perspective. The number of young people aged 16-24 classed as NEET fell from over a million to 800,000 now, or from about 15% of all 16-24 year olds in 2010 to 11% now.", "But NEETS also look a little different than they used to.", "In 2010, young people who were NEET were more likely to be actively seeking work (\u201cunemployed\u201d) than economically inactive. That picture has now reversed.", "Figures from the ONS suggest young people who are economically inactive and NEET\u00a0are usually looking after a family home, or are long-term sick or disabled.", "Full Fact fights for good, reliable information in the media, online, and in politics.", "Bad information ruins lives.
