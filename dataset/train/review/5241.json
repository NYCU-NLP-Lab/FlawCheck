["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "As Democrats and Republicans squared off Monday on Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s proposal to reduce state income taxes, state Sen. Joe Pennacchio reminded his fellow legislators of how taxpayers in Pennsylvania and Delaware are already getting better deals.\n\nPennsylvania charges a top income tax rate of 3 percent, while Delaware doesn\u2019t collect any state income taxes, according to Pennacchio.\n\n\"We\u2019re competing worldwide, but especially we\u2019re competing with our regional states. This has to make us more competitive, because when you take a look at us versus Pennsylvania, it's still three percent in Pennsylvania,\" Pennacchio (R-Morris) said during a Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee hearing. \"When you take a look at us versus Delaware, it's still zero in Delaware.\"\n\nIn a news release issued following the meeting, Pennacchio repeated the claim: \"A small decrease is a good first step to making New Jersey more competitive with states like Pennsylvania which charges a top rate of 3%, or Delaware which has no state income tax at all.\"\n\nEach time, Pennacchio was right about Pennsylvania, but wrong about Delaware. As PolitiFact New Jersey found, both states charge state income taxes.\n\nPennacchio acknowledged in a phone interview that he was wrong about Delaware, but argued that New Jersey still needs to be competitive with its neighboring states.\n\n\"I think the premise is still the same,\" Pennacchio told us.\n\nHere\u2019s the story with state income taxes in Pennsylvania and Delaware:\n\nPennsylvania charges a flat income tax rate of 3.07 percent on all taxpayers, regardless of income level. Certain individuals or families may qualify for a state program that eliminates or reduces their state income taxes.\n\nSo, Pennacchio is correct about the 3 percent rate in the Keystone State.\n\nBut Delaware also charges a state income tax. In 2011, that state\u2019s rates ranged from 2.2 percent on taxable income greater than $2,000 to a top rate of 6.95 percent on taxable income greater than $60,000. This year, Delaware\u2019s top rate is decreasing to 6.75 percent.\n\n(For shoppers looking to save some money, Delaware doesn\u2019t have a sales tax.)\n\nThese seven states don\u2019t collect any state income taxes: Alaska, Florida, South Dakota, Washington, Nevada, Texas and Wyoming. New Hampshire and Tennessee impose taxes on interest and dividends income, but not one\u2019s wages.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the top income tax rates in Pennsylvania and Delaware still remain below the maximum rate in New Jersey, where individuals with taxable income exceeding $500,000 face a rate of 8.97 percent.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAt a Senate committee hearing and then in a news release afterwards, Pennacchio claimed that Pennsylvania imposes an income tax rate of 3 percent and Delaware doesn\u2019t collect any state income taxes.\n\nThe senator\u2019s on target when it comes to Pennsylvania, where taxpayers face a flat rate of 3.07 percent. But he\u2019s wrong about Delaware, since that state imposes income tax rates ranging from 2.2 percent to more than 6 percent.\n\nWe rate the statement Half True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "Sen.
