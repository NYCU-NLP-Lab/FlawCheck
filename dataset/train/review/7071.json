One user said: \"And that's on someone being scheduled to open and then the entire rest of the staff calls out... so they dip.\" Another commented: \"That's what happens when a business doesn't appreciate their employees. They leave.\" Others thought the employees all must have quit. A few commenters had other ideas: \"I would've made me some Chipotle. A few bowls and burritos, chips, guacamole, and queso, extra steak to go.\"", "However, it was much ado about nothing. Chipotle employees didn't mysteriously vanish, nor did any customers.
