["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on September 6, 2019", "Ads posted on Facebook from a committee working to reelect President Donald Trump claim that Democrats are calling for the Second Amendment to be repealed. To support the claim, the Trump campaign pointed to statements by a few state lawmakers and one candidate for U.S. Senate.", "The ads, however, could lead some viewers to believe this is a position of Democrats in Congress or those running for president. It\u2019s not.", "We\u2019ve written about literally accurate but misleading claims before: Statements that are true but omit information to leave a misleading impression. This type of deceptive advertising is similar. It takes the position of a few outlier politicians and presents it in a way that can lead viewers to believe this is the general position of the party.", "\u201cDemocrats have finally admitted what they truly want: a repeal of the Second Amendment,\u201d says one version of the ads, which were visible to specific Facebook users in many states, including swing states such as Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the American people to stand strong and defend our freedoms.\u201d", "Another ad says, \u201cDemocrats have been telling us that they only want \u2018gun control.\u2019 But the truth is finally out. Some are now proudly calling for a REPEAL OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. We cannot let a few loud talking heads on the Left drown out the voices of the American people.\u201d", "Facebook\u2019s \u201cAd Library\u201d shows the ads were posted\u00a0from Trump\u2019s official account on Sept. 2 and Sept. 4, just days after the latest deadly mass shooting in Midland and Odessa, Texas. They were paid for by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint fundraising committee run by Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee. (That joint committee has paid to run ads making a similar claim before, including in 2018.)", "Some of the recent ads include images of Trump, while others include short videos set to music. They all encourage supporters to add their names to a petition to defend the Second Amendment, which the Supreme Court decided in 2008 \u201cprotects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\u201d", "But we\u2019re not aware of Democrats in Congress or running for president who are calling to scrap the Second Amendment, and the Trump campaign didn\u2019t identify any.", "Instead, the campaign provided a few examples of Democratic state lawmakers, and one Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, who have called for a repeal to be undertaken or discussed, or have at least suggested that that\u2019s their position.", "Democratic members of Hawaii\u2019s state Legislature, for example, introduced resolutions in 2018 and 2019 that urge members of Congress \u201cto propose and pass a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution \u2026 to clarify the constitutional right to bear arms,\u201d and \u201cconsider and discuss whether the Second Amendment \u2026 should be repealed or amended to clarify that the right to bear arms is a collective, rather than individual, constitutional right.\u201d", "Also, in March 2018, New Hampshire state Rep. Katherine Rogers reportedly said that \u201cit\u2019s always time to revisit and to look at our Constitution,\u201d after former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a New York Times op-ed that called for repealing the Second Amendment. Rogers, however, didn\u2019t go that far herself.", "\u201cSo I think having this discussion is good, and maybe the op-ed by Justice Stevens leads to a lot of interesting discussion,\u201d she said, according to the New Hampshire Journal. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to say let\u2019s get rid of the Second Amendment, but I think it\u2019s an interesting discussion for everybody to have.\u201d", "That same month, Louisiana state Sen. Karen Carter Peterson, who is also the chair of the Louisiana Democratic Party and the vice chair of civic engagement and voter participation for the Democratic National Committee, wrote \u201cRepeal the Second Amendment\u201d in a since-deleted tweet in which she shared a link to Stevens\u2019 opinion piece. But Louisiana Democratic Party Executive Director Stephen Handwerk later told the USA Today Network that Peterson told him that wasn\u2019t her position.", "More recently, in August, Sen. Ed Markey\u2019s Democratic primary challenger in Massachusetts, Shannon Liss-Riordan, said she does believe repeal is necessary.", "\u201cI agree with the late Justice John Paul Stevens: the Second Amendment is \u2018a relic of the 18th century.\u2019 We need leaders in Washington who understand that, and have the courage and the will to fight to repeal the Second Amendment,\u201d she reportedly said in a statement.", "In addition, about 39 percent of Democrats support repealing the Second Amendment, according to a February 2018 Economist/YouGov poll, and about 33 percent of Democrats support it, according to an April 2018 Quinnipiac University survey.", "But an official proposal to amend the Constitution can only be made in a convention called for by two-thirds of U.S. states, or it has to be proposed by two-thirds of the House and Senate. And last year, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told the New York Times, \u201cIt is unequivocally not the Democratic caucus\u2019 position to repeal the Second Amendment.\u201d", "Democrats running to challenge Trump for the presidency in 2020 haven\u2019t proposed doing that, either. Several candidates have unveiled plans to address gun violence that include a ban on so-called \u201cassault weapons,\u201d but not all guns.", "On Sept. 1, the day before some of the Facebook ads reappeared, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas reiterated in a CNN interview his support for an \u201cassault weapons ban\u201d and a mandatory national buyback program for certain semi-automatic weapons, which he called \u201cweapons of war.\u201d", "\u201cThis is not right, and we should not accept it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we should be honest with ourselves. Universal background checks will help. Ending the sales of weapons of war will help. But if millions of them remain on the streets, they will still be instruments of terror that terrify and terrorize us and take our lives. And I\u2019m not going to accept that.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t need an AR-15, an AK-47 \u2026 a weapon of war designed to kill people as efficiently, as effectively, in as great a number as possible,\u201d he later added. \u201cLet\u2019s not sell those anymore, and let\u2019s bring them back off of our streets.\u201d", "Former Vice President Joe Biden also said in a CNN interview last month that he would implement a federal gun buyback program for assault weapons. That was days after fatal mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 3 and Aug. 4.", "\u201cThe fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period. Look, the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t say you can\u2019t restrict the kinds of weapons people can own,\u201d Biden argued. \u201cWhat I would do is I would try to \u2014 I would institute a national buyback program and I would move in the direction of making sure that that, in fact, was what we tried to do, get them off the street.\u201d", "Biden said guns that had been legally purchased would not be confiscated.", "So, some individual Democrats may support an effort to repeal the Second Amendment, but that\u2019s not currently being pursued by Democrats in Congress or those running for president. That distinction may not be clear to Facebook users who encountered the ads imploring them to sign up to protect that part of the Constitution.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
