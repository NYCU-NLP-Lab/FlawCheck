["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Out of work? Angry? Want to blame somebody?", "Assigning blame to politicians appeared to work for Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections, just as it did for Bill Clinton, a Democrat, when he ran for president in 1992. And if the current economic recovery isn\u2019t robust enough, it could be a political liability in 2012, too.\n\nThat\u2019s when U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, is up for re-election. So it came as no surprise that on Feb. 17, the second anniversary of the $787 billion economic stimulus bill, Republicans highlighted Brown\u2019s vote for the bill.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee, or NRSC, picked out a number to attach to Brown\u2019s name: 9.6. That\u2019s Ohio\u2019s latest unemployment rate -- 9.6 percent -- and it is higher than the 9.1 percent unemployment rate that Ohio had when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 passed.\n\n\"The Obama White House projected that their massive stimulus spending would cap national unemployment at 8 percent, and Brown promised Ohioans that it would \u2018go a long way toward putting Americans back to work and our economy back on track,\u2019 even claiming last September that the stimulus has worked,\" the NRSC said in a news release. \"But since Brown and the Democrats rammed the bill into law on a party-line vote, Ohio's unemployment rate has risen to 9.6 percent, above the national average.\"\n\nBrown\u2019s office doesn\u2019t dispute those numbers, nor did we when we looked on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website.\n\nBut Brown\u2019s office cites an array of other numbers -- if the NRSC can pick some, then so can Brown -- that tell a different story. We checked out some additional numbers ourselves. The bottom line:", "The problem is, the national rate then had a healthy decline for two straight months while Ohio had only a small decline. That difference explains why Ohio\u2019s unemployment rate, which was even with the nation not long ago, is above the national rate again.\n\nSo we go back to the NRSC claim: that since Brown and Democrats \"rammed the bill into law on a party-line vote, Ohio\u2019s unemployment rate has risen to 9.6 percent, above the national average.\"\n\nThe vote was not entirely along party lines, since two Republicans in the Senate (Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine) voted for it on final passage, as did independents Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. And it\u2019s unclear how Brown did any ramming.\n\nOn the House side, the vote was along party lines. Not a single Republican voted for passage.\n\nThe Truth-O-Meter says a statement is Half True if it leaves out important details or takes things out of context. The NRSC claim gives too much credit to Brown for \"ramming.\" \u00a0And it suggests that Ohio\u2019s unemployment rate has risen above the national average since the stimulus bill passed. With the brief exception of last November, you\u2019d have to go back to 2002 to find a time when Ohio didn\u2019t lag the nation in employment. And it ignores that Ohio\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen for nine straight months.\n\nContext is important here because numbers can be cherry-picked too easily. And these facts are important for a listener to put the statement in proper context. That\u2019s why we say the NRSC\u2019s claim is Half True.", "National Republican Senatorial Committee, news release: \"Two Years Later, Sherrod Brown's $787 Billion Stimulus Has Failed To Create Promised Jobs,\" Feb. 17, 2011\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, monthly unemployment rates, accessed Feb. 18, 2011\n\nGovTrack, Senate vote on American Recovery and Reinvestment Act\n\nPolitiFact Ohio, \"Gov.
