Almost all the individuals we apprehend who are coming from the Northern Triangle area [Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador], if not all, are requesting asylum.\"", "Romero said a major change in the type of foot traffic that Border Patrol encounters in El Paso in the last year or so has been an increased number of large groups of families and children crossing the border.
