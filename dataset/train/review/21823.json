["Former Gov. Charlie Crist continued his attacks on Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s education funding record in a TV ad set at St. Petersburg High School, Crist\u2019s alma mater.", "\"This isn\u2019t just a doorway to a school. It was my doorway as a public school kid to opportunity. And I want to make sure every child has that same chance for a better life,\" Crist says in the ad. \"But Rick Scott's education cuts are closing that door on Florida's kids, spending almost $200 less per student than when I was governor and cutting Bright Futures scholarships in half.\"", "Here we will fact-check whether Scott cut Bright Futures scholarships in half.", "Bright Futures funding and scholarships", "Launched in 1997, Bright Futures is the higher education scholarship program funded by the Lottery and designed to keep high-achieving students at Florida schools.", "The program\u2019s costs spiraled up from an initial price tag of $70 million in 1997 to $437 million in 2011. Those rising costs led the Legislature to rein in the program.", "In 2010, Crist\u2019s last year as governor, the Legislature reduced Bright Futures scholarships by $1 dollar for every credit hour. The law also raised SAT/ACT requirements incrementally over a few years, which was expected to lead to a drop in the number of students who would qualify. For example, the Legislature raised the minimum SAT requirement for Florida Medallion Scholars -- one subset of Bright Futures -- from 970 in 2010-11 to 1050 in 2013-14.", "So that means that the Legislature and Crist reduced the number of eligible students in the future, after Scott took over as governor. When Scott took over, he and the Legislature continued on that same path -- but made it even harder for students to qualify.", "In 2011, Scott\u2019s first year as governor, the Legislature decided to further raise test scores for 2013-14 graduates. For example, those Medallion Scholars would now have to score 1170 on their SAT by 2013-14.", "When Crist says that under Scott the scholarships were cut in \"half,\" it\u2019s possible for viewers to mistakenly believe that refers to total dollars spent, or the amount of individual scholarships. Instead, what the ad is referring to is the number of scholarships distributed.", "The text on the screen shows that it refers to a May 2014 Sun-Sentinel editorial criticizing Bright Futures cuts, and this is what the Crist campaign pointed us to regarding the ad. As the requirements rose, not surprisingly the number of students who obtained the scholarship has dropped.", "Due to the tougher standards, \"the number of new Bright Futures scholarship students will be cut almost in half \u2013 from 41,107 last fall to 21,340 this fall,\" the editorial board wrote.", "That number for this fall is based on an estimate from the state regarding how many students will qualify. After schools verify that scholarship recipients enrolled in eligible courses, the schools submit for reimbursement to the state -- and that\u2019s when we learn the actual number of scholarships that were used.", "Here are recent years\u2019 numbers on Bright Futures.

Instead, Crist\u2019s campaign zeroed in on the number of scholarships that were distributed last year compared to an estimate for the upcoming school year.", "While the ad blames Scott, under Crist the Legislature also raised the standards to reduce the number of scholarships awarded.
