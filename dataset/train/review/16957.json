He\u00a0tweeted, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" At a press conference in Pittsburgh with local reporters Thursday, Peduto repeated this claim: \"The people of Pittsburgh voted for Hillary Rodham Clinton, 80 percent.\"", "Peduto\u2019s spokesperson Timothy McNulty said Friday the mayor got the number \"off the top of his head\" and noted the numbers weren\u2019t that different.", "During an appearance on CNN late Thursday, Peduto qualified his earlier statement: \"The city of Pittsburgh voted for Hillary Clinton with nearly 80 percent of the vote. [Trump] may be talking about all of western Pennsylvania, but it\u2019s a far cry from being Pittsburgh.\" And while on \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\" on MSNBC, Peduto again stuck with the same claim: \"Actually in Pittsburgh, Hillary Clinton won with nearly 80 percent of the vote.\"", "Did Clinton win the city by that majority?", "Almost.
