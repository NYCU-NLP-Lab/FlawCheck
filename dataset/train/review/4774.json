Campbell, the Chief of the Australian Defence Force, who was appointed in July 2018.", "Below is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:", "The post\u2019s caption states: \u201cAngus Campbell, the general who stripped our Diggers of their iconic inherited unit badges and has done his best to vilify and delegitimise our Anzac fighting spirit, is at it again. This time with the help of Dept of Defence secretary, Greg Moriarty, he has decreed that every ADF base and facility be renamed with aboriginal place names and has ordered that the primary position of the Australian flag be downgraded to a shared position on all ADF publications.\u201d", "Greg Moriarty became\u00a0Secretary of the Department of Defence in September 2017.", "A similar misleading claim was published in this Facebook post.", "The same photo of General Campbell was shared here on Twitter alongside\u00a0a similar claim.", "But the posts are misleading; the Australian Defence Force has said Australia\u2019s military bases will retain their existing English names, but their Aboriginal names will also be added.", "In an email on September 17, a Department of Defence spokesperson told AFP that \u201cthe names of Defence bases and establishments are not being changed.\u201d", "\u201cAs part of Defence\u2019s commitment to fostering genuine and meaningful relationships with Indigenous Australians, and the unique skill set that they bring to strengthen and enhance Defence, we will be commissioning dual-names.
