It\u2019s so huge that\u00a0some claim its gravitational pull could cause earthquakes and make volcanoes erupt. Ironically, it\u2019s expected to just barely skim past Earth on Christmas eve.", "The 1.5 mile wide slab of\u00a0rock \u2013 known as 2003 SD220 \u2013 is so large it could potentially wipe out a continent in the case of a direct hit.", "While it is true that Asteroid 2003 SD220 will pass by Earth on Christmas Eve, the above-quoted article gets several facts wrong.", "First, the asteroid will not be getting disconcertingly close to\u00a0Earth.

The 2018 flyby will be the closest the asteroid will get to Earth until 2070, when it is expected to safely fly past our planet at a distance of about 1.7 million miles (2.7 million kilometers).", "JPL's Near Earth Object Office, which detects and tracks potentially hazardous\u00a0asteroids and other space\u00a0objects,\u00a0is refuting and clarifying rumors on its verified Twitter account.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
