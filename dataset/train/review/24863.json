["About this rating", "On March 6, 2020, Amee Vanderpool published a story on her \"Shero\" newsletter raising the possibility U.S. President Donald Trump benefited financially from the test the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed for COVID-19, which is caused by the new coronavirus. She purported he owns stock in Thermo-Fisher Scientific, which produces a machine necessary for the test:", "According to the Associated Press, Donald Trump, the current President of the United States who is supposed to be managing the Coronavirus epidemic and how the testing is conducted, has listed investments in V.F. Corp (VFC) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation (TMO) \u2026 There is reason to believe that Donald Trump stands to profit from medical testing of coronavirus that will now take place in the United States.", "Though Vanderpool later updated her post to reflect that Trump currently owns no stocks in Thermo-Fisher, the claim of a potential conflict of interest continues to be repeated online.", "The CDC's COVID-19 test does indeed require a machine made by a company owned by Thermo-Fisher, Applied Systems. Official CDC testing guidelines specifically require an Applied Biosystems \"7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR System with SDS 1.4 software.\" In other words, both the PCR system and software are produced by Thermo-Fisher.", "Vanderpool cited a 2016 Associated Press story as evidence that Trump owned shares of Thermo-Fisher. While his ownership of Thermo-Fisher shares was accurate at the time, the president's financial-disclosure forms indicate he sold those shares sometime in 2017.", "Financial disclosures from 2016 and 2017 (each of which reflect the preceding financial year) indicated the president owned \"$50,001-$100,000\" worth of Thermo-Fisher stock in 2015 and 2016. Financial disclosures filed in 2018 and 2019, however, indicate that the president has not owned stock in Thermo-Fisher since the 2017 financial year.", "Although Trump has refused to release his tax returns and has not necessarily been transparent about all of his finances, the evidence used to support the claim that he could benefit financially from the new COVID-19 test is categorically flawed. As such, we rank the claim as \"False.\"", "Vanderpool, Amee. \u00a0 \"Trump Could Profit From Coronavirus Testing.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Shero. \u00a0 6 March 2020.", "Vanderpool, Amee. \u00a0 \"UPDATE: Trump Could Profit From Coronavirus Testing.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Shero. \u00a0 8 March 2020.", "Simpson, Andrew. \u00a0 \"Report Claims Trump Owns Stock In Company That May Play A Major Role In Providing COVID-19 Kits, Helping POTUS To Profit From Testing.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Political Tribune. \u00a0 7 March 2020.", "Simpson, Andrew. \u00a0 \"Report Claims Trump Owns Stock In Company That May Play A Major Role In Providing COVID-19 Kits, Helping POTUS To Profit From Testing.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Political Tribune. \u00a0 7 March 2020.", "emptywheel.net. \u00a0 \"Three Things: Endemic COVID-19 Edition.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 7 March 2020.", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u00a0 \"CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 11 March 2020.", "ThermoFisher.com. \u00a0 \"Applied Biosystems\u2122 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument, With Tower Computer.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 11 March 2020.", "Horwitz, Jeff and Chad Day. \u00a0 \"Trump\u2019s Investments Include Companies He Bashed.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Associated Press. \u00a0 19 May 2016.", "U.S. Office of Government Ethics. \u00a0 \"Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report (OGE Form 278e) - 2016.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 11 March 2020.", "U.S. Office of Government Ethics. \u00a0 \"Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report (OGE Form 278e) - 2017.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 11 March 2020.", "U.S. Office of Government Ethics. \u00a0 \"Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report (OGE Form 278e) - 2018.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 11 March 2020.", "U.S. Office of Government Ethics. \u00a0 \"Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report (OGE Form 278e) - 2019.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 11 March 2020.", "Rappeport, Alan. \u00a0 \"Steven Mnuchin Refused to Release Trump's Tax Documents to Congress.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. 6 May 2019.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
