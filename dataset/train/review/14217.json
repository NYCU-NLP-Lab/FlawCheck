["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on January 3, 2019", "Q: Is it accurate that \u201c18 children died while in custody of Border Patrol\u201d during the Obama administration?", "A: No. Prior to two children\u2019s deaths in December, it had been more than a decade since a child died while in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.", "18 children died in Border Patrol custody during the Obama presidency! Where was the media outrage then?", "True?", "The news last month that two children from Guatemala died while in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection fueled scrutiny of the government\u2019s ability to care for young immigrants.", "CBP officials\u00a0reported that 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin died Dec. 8, two days after being apprehended for illegally crossing the Southwest border with her father. Weeks later, the Department of Homeland Security announced that an 8-year-old boy, later identified as Felipe Gomez Alonzo, died Dec. 24 while in CBP custody. He and his father had also crossed the border without authorization.", "But in some social media circles, criticism of the deaths was met by claims of a double standard. Viral posts argued that\u00a0\u201cduring the Obama administration 18 children died while in custody of Border Patrol.\u201d", "That\u2019s false.", "In fact, Department of Homeland Security Secretary\u00a0Kirstjen Nielsen said in a Dec. 26 statement following the two children\u2019s deaths that \u201cit has been more than a decade since CBP has had a child pass away in their custody.\u201d U.S. Border Patrol is a part of CBP, which is an agency within DHS.", "DHS has also said that \u201cdeaths in CBP custody are extraordinarily rare.\u201d The most recent data publicly available, from a 2016 report to Congress, show that CBP reported 13 deaths in fiscal year 2015 between Oct. 1, 2014 and Sept. 30, 2015 \u2014 10 of which were the result of \u201cuse of force.\u201d\u00a0We asked CBP for more information on the deaths of immigrants in its custody but did not get a response.", "What\u2019s more \u2014 according to data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which also falls under DHS and oversees\u00a0the civil immigration detention system \u2014 none of the 67 immigrants who died while in ICE custody during the Obama years were children. The youngest individual to die while in ICE custody during Obama\u2019s presidency was a 23-year-old man from El Salvador.", "The \u201c18 children\u201d claim may stem from a misrepresentation of a story published Dec. 18 by a conservative website, the Daily Caller. The headline of that story reads, \u201c18 DEATHS OF ICE DETAINEES ACKNOWLEDGED UNDER OBAMA \u2014 BUT NOT INVESTIGATED.\u201d", "While the story juxtaposes news of Maquin\u2019s death with information on immigrant deaths during the Obama administration, it never makes the claim that immigrant children died while in custody under Obama. In fact, the story says, \u201cThe detainees who died then were between 24 and 49 years old.\u201d", "Instead, the Daily Caller revisited a 2016 analysis by Human Rights Watch, which enlisted medical experts to review government information on 18 immigrant-detainee deaths from mid-2012 to mid-2015. The international human rights organization, citing the experts, faulted \u201csubstandard medical care and violations of applicable detention standards\u201d as \u201cfailures\u201d that \u201cprobably contributed to the deaths of 7 of the 18 detainees.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cCBP Shares Additional Information about Recent Passing of Guatemalan Child.\u201d Press release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection. 25 Dec 2018.", "\u201cList of Deaths in ICE Custody.\u201d U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
