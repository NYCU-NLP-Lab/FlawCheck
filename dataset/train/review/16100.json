["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on March 24, 2021", "Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey exaggerated the rise in people trying to cross the southern border illegally under President Joe Biden, when he said there has been a \u201c460% spike in illegal apprehensions.\u201d", "As we recently wrote, border apprehensions started to rise prior to the election under then-President Donald Trump and have continued to go up under the Biden administration. The increase under Biden, however, has not been nearly as great as Ducey claimed.", "Ducey made his remarks in an interview with Martha Raddatz, host of ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d who toured the southern border with the governor. Ducey, a Republican, said there has been a \u201c460% spike in illegal apprehensions, over 100,000 people in custody,\u201d and blamed \u201cthe reverse of the Biden administration of the Trump policies, and it needs attention.\u201d", "The 460% figure caught our attention, so we asked the governor\u2019s office for Ducey\u2019s source. A spokesperson for the governor referred us to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data for \u201cborder encounters.\u201d", "\u201cThe Governor based his comments on total apprehensions from April 2020 (17,106) to February 2021 (100,441),\u201d Bobby Charette told us in an email.", "That\u2019s actually a 487% increase, but it\u2019s misleading. The governor\u2019s office is using the wrong data and cherry-picking dates.", "CBP data for \u201cborder encounters\u201d includes \u201cinadmissibles,\u201d who are \u201cindividuals encountered at ports of entry who are seeking lawful admission into the United States but are determined to be inadmissible.\u201d", "Ducey referred to \u201cillegal apprehensions\u201d \u2014 and his office referred to \u201ctotal apprehensions\u201d \u2014 so we looked at data for \u201cborder apprehensions.\u201d There were 96,974 apprehensions in February, not quite the 100,000 that the governor said.", "But, more importantly, Ducey compares the February data with April 2020, when both the U.S. and Mexico responded to the coronavirus pandemic with economic shutdowns.", "Apprehensions dropped to 16,182 in April 2020. But then, they started to rise again, increasing noticeably in late summer and fall. By October, 69,022 people were apprehended on the southwest border \u2014 a 327% rise from April.", "So, apprehensions were rising while Trump\u2019s policies were in place and before the Nov. 3 election that would ultimately result in Biden\u2019s victory. That trend continued after Biden took office, as the chart below shows.", "Ducey blamed Biden\u2019s policies for the rise, but the Democratic president didn\u2019t take office until Jan. 20.", "Comparing Trump\u2019s last full month in office in December (71,047) to Biden\u2019s first full month in office in February (96,974), apprehensions have risen 36% \u2014 not 460%.", "For more about the increase in apprehensions and its causes, see our March 23 article \u201cThe Facts on the Increase in Illegal Immigration.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
