(AP)", "In April 2020, 23,196 absentee ballots were rejected, 1.8% of total ballots. That's down from 2.5% in April 2016.", "As Democrats celebrate the unofficial victory of President-elect Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 presidential election, claims of subterfuge, trickery and outright fraud involving absentee ballots continue to rain down.", "Thus far, there has been no evidence of widespread fraud presented, but Wisconsin lawmakers plan to issue their first subpoenas in years as part of an investigation into the election here.", "Ben Wikler, Chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, rejected the fraud allegations in a Nov. 8 appearance on WISN-TV\u2019s UpFront program. But he added another detail that caught our eye.", "\"Across the state the rejection rate for ballots went way down because so much work and so much care was taken both by voters themselves and clerks around the state,\" Wikler said.", "Is his claim that the rejection rate for ballots is down correct? Let\u2019s take a look.", "When asked to back up the claim, Courtney Beyer, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Democratic Party of Wisconsin, cited a Oct. 28, 2020, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article that reported 23,196 absentee ballots were rejected in the April 2020 election, about 1.8% of total ballots. Democrats believe there are signs it would be much lower for the November election.", "\"At least 23,000 ballots were rejected in April,\" Beyer said in an email.\u00a0 \"We don\u2019t know exactly how many absentee ballots were rejected from this election (and won\u2019t for a while), but preliminary counts had it around 1,000. Significantly less.\"", "Beyer also cited a Nov. 3\u00a0 tweet from WisPolitics.com journalist Pat Poblete, who said \"Administrator Meagan Wolfe says as of this afternoon, 970 absentee ballots have been returned with a deficiency that would lead to them being rejected.\"", "But Wikler\u2019s claim was made while discussing the Nov. 3 election. Viewers would have had no reason to believe he was referencing data from the April primary.

The Oct. 28 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article points out that in April 2016, 5,860 absentee ballots were rejected \u2014 2.5% of the total absentee ballots.", "And in April 2020, 23,196\u00a0 absentee ballots were rejected. It\u2019s a much higher raw number, but because so many more people used absentee ballots it was actually a smaller portion of total ballots \u2014 1.8%.", "Wikler said, \"Across the state the rejection rate for ballots went way down.\"", "According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, it\u2019s too early to know how many ballots were rejected.", "It may very well be true that the absentee ballot rejection rate was lower than past elections, but for now, the commission says there is no data to confirm that. By looking at the 2016 rejected ballot rate compared with the improved April 2020 rate, there is a possibility the rejection will also be down for November 2020, but there is no data yet to confirm that.", "Even Democrats subsequently acknowledged, \"We don\u2019t know exactly how many absentee ballots were rejected from this election (and won\u2019t for a while).\"", "For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Ballot clerks asked for help.
