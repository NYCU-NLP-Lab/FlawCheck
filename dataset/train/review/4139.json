The image was first shared after the government\u2019s move. In 2016, the Gujarat government had accorded minority status to Jains as well. However, accordance of minority status to a religion is not equivalent to declaring a religion as a catholic sect.

This confirms the pattern of disinformation around the Lingayat issue that Alt News has debunked earlier. Fake news website Postcard News had circulated a fake letter addressed to Sonia Gandhi by Karnataka Minister MB Patil in which it was alleged that the Lingayat issue was engineered with the help of the Global Christian Organisation and World Islamic Organisation.
