He said, \"I have a solution for you and I'd like you to make a comment on my proposal: Just tell the black people of South Bend to stop committing crime and doing drugs.\"", "Buttigieg took the man to task, saying, \"Sir, I don't think racism is going to get us out of this.\"", "When the man countered that his comment had \"nothing to do with race,\" Buttigieg responded, \"The fact that a black person is four times as likely as a white person to be incarcerated for the exact same crime is evidence of systemic racism,\" Buttigieg said.", "Man booed at Pete Buttigieg event after racist comment.\"Racism is not going to help us get out of this,\" Buttigieg tells him, to applause. \"Racism has no place in American politics or in American law enforcement.

Such racial disparities in marijuana possession arrests exist in all regions of the country, in counties large and small, urban and rural, wealthy and poor, and with large and small Black populations.\"", "The marijuana arrest finding is \"a widely cited figure, and accurate as far as I can tell,\" Sonja B. Starr, a University of Michigan law professor, told PolitiFact.", "However, this study does not support what Buttigieg specifically said in Iowa.", "The ACLU finding refers to arrests, not incarceration, which is a much more serious event. In addition, this finding is specific to marijuana, not to all crimes. And the data is at least a decade old, meaning it measured a time before the wide-scale decriminalization fo marijuana; arrest patterns may have changed.", "Comparisons of this sort involving marijuana have some advantages, Starr said, because the data is more comprehensive than it is for other crimes.", "Still, she added, \"marijuana studies don't prove in and of themselves that similar disparities translate into other areas. And marijuana possession only accounts for quite a small percentage of those incarcerated in this country, so this figure doesn't give us a full picture at all.\"", "We wondered whether other studies support what Buttigieg said in Iowa.", "While we found voluminous evidence of racial disparities in the criminal justice system, we couldn\u2019t locate any finding that specifically addressed what Buttigieg said.", "African Americans fare more poorly than whites in the United States\u2019 criminal justice system -- a pattern that emerges at every stage of the process, including higher arrest rates, a higher likelihood of imprisonment as opposed to probation, and longer sentences for those who are incarcerated.", "Here are some findings that support this conclusion but don\u2019t address Buttigieg\u2019s specific assertion:", "\u2022 \"Black men are six times as likely to be incarcerated as white men.\"", "Source: The Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for criminal justice reform.", "Why it\u2019s not on point: This finding addresses incarceration for all crimes together, not \"for the same crime.\"", "\u2022 \"Blacks receive sentences that are almost 10 percent longer than those of comparable whites arrested for the same crimes.\"", "Source: Paper by Sonja B.

Buttigieg\u2019s formulation also glosses over disparate arrest patterns for different crimes and even the disparities among victims in the reporting of different types of crimes.", "One often-underestimated factor concerns differences between different jurisdictions, said Candace McCoy, a professor with John Jay College\u2019s doctoral program in criminal justice. Some areas put a great deal of effort into community relations or reducing disparities in arrests. Others don\u2019t.", "The racial disparity \"varies wildly among the 50 states and the federal system, too,\" McCoy said. \"So it is really hard to make one big overall statement such as the one Buttigieg did and be accurate.\"", "Experts agreed that Buttigieg, in an attempt to make a reasonable argument, muffed his talking point.", "\"It's encouraging that Buttigieg is calling attention to this important issue, but he should be framing the research findings more accurately,\" said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project.", "Buttigieg said \"a black person is four times as likely as a white person to be incarcerated for the exact same crime.\"", "There\u2019s ample data documenting disparities between African Americans and whites in the criminal justice system, but neither we nor criminal justice experts could find evidence to support Buttigieg\u2019s specific assertion.
