However, the BJP government won the trust vote with only 32 votes cast in support of the no confidence motion. The same day, several social media users began sharing a picture of Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar with former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. The Deputy Speaker of the Haryana Legislative Assembly is seen in the company of the two leaders.
