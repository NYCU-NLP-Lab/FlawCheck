["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 2, 2021", "A meme purports to list actions taken by President Joe Biden in his \u201cfirst 48 hours\u201d in office \u2014 but most of the points are misleading or wrong. For example, the purported tax changes are proposals \u2014 some of which need additional context \u2014 and would require legislation before they can be implemented.", "It\u2019s true that President Joe Biden has had a busy first two weeks in office \u2014 signing a flurry of executive orders, a move that has prompted some criticism.", "But a meme shared on Instagram and Facebook distorts the facts about Biden\u2019s early actions, claiming to show a list of his work during his \u201cfirst 48 hours.\u201d It further instructs social media users to \u201cbrace yourselves for what\u2019s coming!!\u201d", "A few of the bullet points are accurate, but other items are proposals that have not become law or distortions of what has actually occurred.", "Among the accurate claims: Biden did recommit the U.S. to the Paris Agreement and he did halt U.S. departure from the World Health Organization. And there was a\u00a0terrorist attack\u00a0in Baghdad, Iraq, on Jan. 21 \u2014 the day after Biden was sworn in (though it\u2019s unclear if the meme is suggesting that\u00a0the\u00a0attack\u00a0is somehow connected to Biden taking office).", "Here are the facts on some of the other claims in the meme.", "Claim: \u201cReady to deploy soldiers to Middle East (wars).\u201d", "Facts: There is no evidence Biden in his first days proposed deploying more soldiers to the Middle East.", "Claim: \u201cRejoins the TPP (massive job loss to China).\u201d", "Facts: There has been no formal effort yet to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement from which Trump withdrew the U.S. in 2017.", "Biden has signaled he would possibly try to renegotiate the partnership, but that has not happened yet and certainly did not happen in his first 48 hours.", "Claims: \u201cMen with wigs can enter girls restrooms,\u201d and \u201cMen with wigs can compete in women sports.\u201d", "Facts: The meme may be referring to an executive order that Biden signed on his first day, which seeks to ensure that existing federal laws protecting against sex discrimination are enforced to protect against discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.\u00a0But federal agencies have yet to lay out how exactly the order will be put into motion.", "The order says \u201c[c]hildren should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports\u201d and cites a 2020 Supreme Court decision that held that Title VII\u2019s prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of sex also covers gender identity and sexual orientation.", "\u201cIn Title VII, Congress adopted broad language making it illegal for an employer to rely on an employee\u2019s sex when deciding to fire that employee,\u201d the court ruled. \u201cWe do not hesitate to recognize today a necessary consequence of that legislative choice: An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.\u201d", "Biden\u2019s executive order posits that the same rationale should apply to other laws prohibiting sex discrimination \u2014 such as Title IX, which protects against sex discrimination in schools and educational programs receiving federal money \u2014 \u201cso long as the laws do not contain sufficient indications to the contrary.\u201d", "It further directs federal agencies to \u201creview all existing orders, regulations, guidance documents, policies, programs, or other agency actions\u201d relating to \u201cTitle VII or any other statute or regulation that prohibits sex discrimination, including any that relate to the agency\u2019s own compliance with such statutes or regulations\u201d and determine whether they \u201care or may be inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.\u201d", "\u201cThe head of each agency shall \u2026 consider whether to revise, suspend, or rescind such agency actions, or promulgate new agency actions, as necessary to fully implement statutes that prohibit sex discrimination and the policy set forth in section 1 of this order,\u201d it adds.", "The order gives the agencies 100 days to develop plans to carry out any actions relating to the order.", "Meanwhile, some state legislators have introduced measures aimed at preventing transgender girls from participating in women\u2019s sports.", "Claim: \u201cWe\u2019ll be charged a hefty fine for not having health insurance (Obama care).\u201d", "Facts: Biden and Democrats in Congress may well indeed, at some point, reintroduce the penalty associated with the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act. But that hasn\u2019t happened yet.", "As we\u2019ve explained before, the individual mandate requires Americans to have insurance or pay a penalty, but in 2017 that penalty was reduced to $0 by Republicans in Congress. In a lawsuit now before the Supreme Court, Republican state officials have asked that the mandate be declared unconstitutional since there\u2019s no longer a tax associated with it \u2014 and that the entire health care law be dismantled. (The Supreme Court had previously, in 2012, ruled the mandate was constitutionally valid as a tax.)", "Some have observed that if the penalty is increased from $0, it may undermine Republicans\u2019 current legal argument against the mandate.", "Claim: \u201cRevokes Keystone Pipeline, 57,000 go jobless.\u201d", "Facts: Biden did sign an executive order rescinding a March 2019 permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline \u2014 a pipeline slated to run from Alberta, Canada, through the U.S., to Nebraska.

In addition, he has supported adding a payroll tax of 12.4% on earned income above $400,000.", "\u201cThe 52% number for income and payroll tax is adding together the 39.6% rate above $400K and the proposed 12.4% Social Security payroll tax on income above $400K,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThis would be the case for both employees and self-employed individuals, but it would be a top rate\u201d \u2014 meaning income above the $400,000 \u2014 \u201cnot an effective rate on all income.\u201d", "Claim: \u201cSmall business taxes from 29.6% to 39.6%.\u201d", "Watson said the \u201csmall business taxes\u201d refers to those business owners taxed at the aforementioned 37% top rate \u2014 \u201coffset by the Section 199A passthrough deduction (20%),\u201d which is available to some business owners, \u201cyielding a rate of 29.6%.\u201d", "But Watson said the deduction \u201cis already curtailed for higher earners in service industry professions, and it would be curtailed further by Biden for income above $400,000.\u201d", "In other words, the deduction is already in many cases not available to higher-income earners, so for many the change would be from 37% to 39.6%, Watson added.", "Claim: \u201cCapital gains & divident taxes from 23.8% to 43.4%.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that capital gains are currently taxed at a 23.8% top rate, \u201cas it is 20 percent plus the 3.8 percent net investment income tax (NIIT),\u201d Watson said.", "\u201cBiden has proposed taxing capital gains and dividends above $1,000,000 at an ordinary rate of 39.6 percent,\u201d he said.", "Watson pointed out that the Biden campaign said that the 39.6%\u00a0would be inclusive of NIIT \u2014 \u201cso a 43.4 percent rate is probably too high,\u201d he added.
