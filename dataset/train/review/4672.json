["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on June 21, 2018", "Q: Did President Donald Trump call for the creation of a \u201cspace force\u201d to fight off an \u201calien attack\u201d?", "A: No. The president did request exploration of a \u201cspace force,\u201d but it is unrelated to extraterrestrial activity.", "On June 18, President Donald Trump called for the creation of a \u201cspace force\u201d \u2014 a new branch of the military in addition to the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard.", "By that afternoon, a conspiracy theory website had combined Trump\u2019s request with a made-up claim that the president had spoken with aliens and feared an \u201calien attack.\u201d", "Outlandish? Yes. But the site \u2014 called Truth Unsealed \u2014 is run by a man who has a YouTube channel with more than 60,000 subscribers and a website dedicated to peddling the thoroughly debunked \u201cpizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory. That infamous conspiracy theory drove Edgar Maddison Welch to take an AR-15 rifle into the Comet Ping Pong pizza shop in Washington D.C., where he fired shots on Dec. 4, 2016.", "The alien story says in part:", "Truth Unsealed, June 18: Since assuming office on January 20, 2017, Trump has periodically exchanged messages with intelligent extraterrestrial life forms who, according to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, have provided him with advice and guidance on a multitude of issues including an impending attack from another world.", "\u201cThey know he\u2019s an excellent negotiator \u2013 probably the best our planet has to offer \u2013 and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve elected to speak with him,\u201d Secretary Sanders told a handful of reporters during an off-camera briefing on Wednesday. While Sanders could not comment on the extent or frequency of the encounters, she said President Trump is \u2018extremely humbled\u2019 to be the first head of state to make contact with alien life.", "Those two paragraphs are lifted, almost word-for-word, from a September 2017 story on a satirical website, Real News Right Now.", "We spoke with Robert Shooltz, the 35-year-old who runs the website and wrote the satirical story under the pen name, R. Hobbus J.D. He explained that the idea behind it was to joke that the president would get policy ideas from aliens.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a silly thing,\u201d he said.", "Shooltz described himself as a moderate who leans left. He said he cast a write-in vote for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 general election.", "Shooltz said he finds \u201cit upsetting\u201d when his stories that are meant to poke fun at public figures, such as Trump, get picked up and misused by other websites.", "But, ultimately, he puts the responsibility of recognizing made-up claims on readers and he does not include a satire disclaimer on his website. Instead, he drops subtle hints that the site is a spoof, like listing the \u201cStephen Glass Distinction in Journalistic Integrity\u201d among his awards \u2014 Stephen Glass was a writer for the New Republic who left the magazine in disgrace after it was revealed that he had fabricated many of his stories.", "While most of the story on the conspiracy theory site was taken from Shooltz\u2019s spoof, the part about Trump\u2019s call for a \u201cspace force\u201d is true.", "Recognition of the importance of space for national security goes at least as far back as 2001, when a commission headed by Donald Rumsfeld \u2014 who became the secretary of defense that year \u2014 issued a report recommending extensive enhancement of the military\u2019s operation in space.", "\u201cWe know from history that every medium \u2014 air, land and sea \u2014 has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different,\u201d the commission wrote in its report. \u201cGiven this virtual certainty, the U.S. must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space.\u201d", "More recently, since Trump took office, Defense Secretary James Mattis noted in his prepared remarks for his confirmation hearing that, \u201cWhile our military maintains capable land, air, and sea forces, the cyber and space domains now demand an increasing share of our attention and investment.\u201d", "Also, in January, the Department of Defense issued its National Defense Strategy for 2018 in which it anticipated that space and cyberspace would become \u201cwarfighting domains.\u201d", "And, on March 13, the president floated the idea of creating a new branch of the military to focus on space during a speech in California, saying, \u201cI was saying it the other day, because we\u2019re doing a tremendous amount of work in space; I said: \u2018Maybe we need a new force. We\u2019ll call it the space force.\u2019 And I was not really serious, and then I said: \u2018What a great idea. Maybe we\u2019ll have to do that.'\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.", "Trump, Donald.
