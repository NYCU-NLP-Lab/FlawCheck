["On April 30, reports emerged that fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi will appeal for a third bail application in London on May 8, 2019. This report directly contradicted the news stories that had earlier emanated from a section of the media. On April 26, multiple media outlets had reported that Westminster magistrates\u2019 court had rejected Nirav Modi\u2019s bail plea for the third time.
