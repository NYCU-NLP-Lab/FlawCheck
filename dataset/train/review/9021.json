["About this rating", "On 7 February 2017, President Trump held a roundtable discussion with county sheriffs from around the United States in which he cited a chilling crime statistic as a reason for inviting the sheriffs to the White House:", "... the murder rate in our country is the highest it\u2019s been in 47 years, right? \u00a0Did you know that? \u00a0Forty-seven years. \u00a0I used to use that -- I\u2019d say that in a speech and everybody was surprised, because the press doesn\u2019t tell it like it is. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t to their advantage to say that. But the murder rate is the highest it\u2019s been in, I guess, from 45 to 47 years.", "Trump made similar claims during the 2016 presidential campaign. On 26 October 2016, for example, he stated the following to a crowd in Charlotte, North Carolina:", "The problem is not the presence of police, but the absence of police. We need really a great group of people to keep you safe, to keep us all safe, to keep us all safe. You know the murder rate in the United States, I don\u2019t know if you know this because the press never talks about it, is the highest it\u2019s been, think of this, in 45 years. Nobody knows that. The murder rate, highest it\u2019s been in 45 years.", "Both versions were incorrect, however. According to the most recent FBI data available, an estimated 15,696 murders occurred in the United States in 2015, or 4.9 murders per 100,000 people. And while this was the highest murder rate in six years (compared to a range of 4.4 to 4.8 murders per 100,000 each year since 2009, when the figure was 5 per 100,000), it's less than half the historical high of 10.2 in 1980.", "FBI statistics show, in fact, that the 2015 murder rate was among the lowest of the past 47 years, and indeed the lowest of any year between 1965 and 2009.", "It's likely that President Trump erred by conflating the murder rate itself with the size of the year-over-year increase in the murder rate. That is, the 2015 rate (4.9 per 100,000) marked an increase of approximately 11 percent over the previous year's murder rate (4.4 per 100,000), which, it would be accurate to say, is the highest year-over-year rate of increase in 45 years. On at least one other occasion, during his so-called \"victory tour\" after the 2016 election, Trump stated the statistic correctly: \"On crime, the murder rate has experienced its largest increase in 45 years.\"", "Trump aide Kellyanne Conway appeared to confirm that he had conflated the statistics during a subsequent interview on CNN: \u201cWhen he talks about the 47 years and the rate, I\u2019m handed the information, I think you referred to it as well, that we have had an increase from 2014 to 2015,\" she told host Jake Tapper.", "Berman, Mark. \u00a0 \"Violent Crime and Murders Both Went Up in 2015, FBI Says.\"\r\nThe Washington Post. \u00a0 28 September 2106.", "Borchers, Callum. \u00a0 \"Kellyanne Conway vs. Jake Tapper, Annotated.\"\r\nThe Washington Post. \u00a0 8 February 2017.", "CBS/Associated Press. \u00a0 \"FBI: Rise in Murder, Violent Crime in 2015, After Historic Lows.\"\r\n26 September 2016.", "FBI. \u00a0 \"2015 Crime in the United States.\"\r\nSeptember 2016.", "InfoPlease.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Homicide Rate, 1950 - 2014.\"\r\nUndated.", "NPR.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Trump's Victory Tour Stump Speech, Annotated.\"\r\n7 December 2016.", "White House. \u00a0 \"Remarks by President Trump in Roundtable with County Sheriffs.\"\r\n7 February 2017.", "C-SPAN.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Donald Trump Campaign Rally in Charlotte, North Carolina.\"\r\n18 August 2016.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
