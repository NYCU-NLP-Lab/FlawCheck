["A viral photo showing thousands of people gathered on a ship is circulating social media, and while the photo is real, the caption that goes with it is inaccurate.", "The caption above the photo reads: \"These aren\u2019t Syrians.

You can pretend that a picture of people fleeing the political uncertainty and economic misery of Albania a quarter of a century ago shows Tripoli or Tartus this summer, and some people will believe you (and retweet). Or you can put the same picture in black and white and claim it shows European refugees in the 1940s, and other people will believe you (and repost). One of those claims is intended to provoke hostility toward refugees, and the other is intended to elicit sympathy\u2014but it\u2019s striking that both of them reduce the refugees themselves to silence in precisely the same way.\"", "Social media posts sharing an image of thousands of migrants on a ship claim that it depicts \"Europeans trying to get to North Africa during World War II.\"", "The image is real, but it was taken in 1991 at an Italian port and shows thousands of Albanian migrants trying to enter the country.", "We rate this False.", "Correction, July 29, 2019:\u00a0\"La Nave Dolce\" literally translates to \"The Sweet Ship\" in Italian.
