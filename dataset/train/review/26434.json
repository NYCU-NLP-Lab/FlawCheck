Then those users are presented with a \u201csurvey\u201d that extracts personal information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and even sometimes credit card numbers. Finally, those who want to claim their \u201cfree\u201d gift cards or coupons eventually learn they must first sign up to purchase a number of costly goods, services, or subscriptions.", "The Better Business Bureau offers consumers several general tips to avoid getting scammed:", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
