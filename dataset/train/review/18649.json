["A bizarre piece of news made headlines on July 27 \u2014 a goat was \u201carrested\u201d by Kanpur police for not wearing a mask. An IANS feed republished by National Herald, Orissa Post and News18 English claimed, \u201cThe incident took place over the weekend and the Beconganj police picked up the goat and took it to the police station in a jeep.\u201d", "However, IANS also carried a contradictory statement by Circle Officer, Anwarganj police station, Saifuddin Beg, who said that cops had found a youth without a mask taking the goat along. \u201cWhen he saw the police, he ran away leaving the goat behind so the policemen brought the goat to the police station. Later, we handed over the goat to its owner,\u201d the officer was quoted. IANS accused the police of \u201cchanging\u201d its version of the story.", "News18 deemed the story important enough to be published in Telugu and Bangla languages as well. The channel broadcast a video of policemen loading a goat into their jeep.", "Times Now, Republic and India Times carried similar reports. Times Now too blamed the police of \u201cchanging\u201d the narrative. \u201cNow they say they wanted to arrest the man who was seen not wearing a mask instead of the goat,\u201d read the report.", "Other outlets that published articles on the peculiar story were Asianet News (Kannada and Hindi), Kashmir Today, Zee News Tamil, Dainik Bhaskar and Loksatta.", "The story contradicts common sense just by the first reading. It sounds like something one would find on satirical websites, yet was published by legitimate media organisations as \u201cnews\u201d. The video of a goat being pushed inside a police van was floating on mainstream media and social media alike. A Twitter user claimed that a person accused Beconganj police of forcefully taking away his goat. Kanpur police replied to the user that an unclaimed goat roaming around Dada Miyan intersection during lockdown was brought to Beconganj police station and handed over to its owner Khanikujjma, son of Mohammed Ali.", "\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0930\u0923 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u09300\u0928\u093f0 \u092c\u0947\u0915\u0928\u0917\u0902\u091c \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092c\u093e\u0924\u092f\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e \u0915\u093f \u0932\u0949\u0915\u0921\u093e\u0909\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092c\u0915\u0930\u093e \u0932\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0938 \u0918\u0942\u092e \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0925\u093e \u091c\u093f\u0938\u0915\u094b \u0925\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0932\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e, \u092c\u0915\u0930\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915 \u092e\u094b0 \u0905\u0932\u0940 \u092a\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0916\u0928\u0940\u0915\u0941\u091c\u094d\u091c\u092e\u093e \u0928\u093f0 \u0926\u093e\u0926\u093e\u092e\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u091a\u094c\u0930\u093e\u0939\u093e, \u0925\u093e\u0928\u093e \u092c\u0947\u0915\u0928\u0917\u0902\u091c \u0915\u093e\u0928\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0928\u0917\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u0906\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0930 \u0909\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947 \u0928\u093f\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0938\u093e\u0930 \u092c\u0915\u0930\u0947 \u0915\u094b \u0938\u0941\u092a\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0926 \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e, \u0936\u0947\u0937 \u0906\u0930\u094b\u092a \u0905\u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f \u0935 \u0928\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0927\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u0948\u0964", "\u2014 Kanpur Nagar Police (@kanpurnagarpol) July 27, 2020", "Alt News reached out to Beconganj police and was told that a police van was passing by when locals informed that a goat was roaming unclaimed on the streets. \u201cWe brought the goat to the police station in case it gets lost and called the owner.

It is ridiculous to suggest that the police \u201carrested\u201d a goat for not wearing a mask when Indian streets are littered with (obviously unmasked) stray animals all the time. While in the past we have noticed outlets falling for satire, this time comical news was crafted out of a real incident. IANS referred to the police as the \u201cbutt of jokes\u201d all the while believing that a goat was actually arrested in Kanpur for not wearing a mask during COVID-19.
