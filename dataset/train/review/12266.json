Trump tweeted the first statement on March 9:", "The latter was a statement Trump made during a Coronavirus Task Force press briefing from the White House on March 17. As can be seen in the following video (at the 1:05:00 mark), as Trump fielded a question from a reporter about whether his \"tone\" on the pandemic had suddenly changed the previous day, he declared, \"This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. All you had to do is look at other countries; I think now it's in almost 120 countries all over the world. No, I've always viewed it as very serious. There was no difference yesterday from days before\":", "The New York Times chronicled this statement from Trump and contrasted it with others he had made in the weeks leading up to it:", "For weeks, President Trump has minimized the coronavirus, mocked concern about it and treated the risk from it cavalierly. On [March 17] he took to the White House lectern and made a remarkable assertion: He knew it was a pandemic all along.", "\u201cThis is a pandemic,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cI felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.\u201d", "This is what Mr. Trump has actually said over the past two months:", "On Jan. 22, asked by a CNBC reporter whether there were \u201cworries about a pandemic,\u201d the president replied: \u201cNo, not at all. We have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d", "On Feb. 26, at a White House news conference, commenting on the country\u2019s first reported cases: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we\u2019ve had very good luck.\u201d", "On Feb. 27, at a White House meeting: \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear. One day \u2014 it\u2019s like a miracle \u2014 it will disappear.\u201d", "On March 7, standing next to President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil at Mar-a-Lago, his club in Palm Beach, Fla., when asked if he was concerned that the virus was spreading closer to Washington: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not concerned at all. No, I\u2019m not. No, we\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d (At least three members of the Brazilian delegation and one Trump donor at Mar-a-Lago that weekend later tested positive for the virus.)", "On March 16, in the White House briefing room, warning that the outbreak would \u201cwash\u201d away this summer: \u201cSo it could be right in that period of time where it, I say, wash \u2014 it washes through. Other people don\u2019t like that term. But where it washes through.\u201d", "But his assertion ... that he had long seen the pandemic coming was the most abrupt pivot yet from the voluminous number of claims and caustic remarks he has made about the disease.", "Rogers, Katie. \u00a0 \"Trump Now Claims He Always Knew the Coronavirus Would Be a Pandemic.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 17 March 20.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
