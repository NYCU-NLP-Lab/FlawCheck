["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on June 27, 2019", "President Donald Trump \u2014 without evidence \u2014 accused special counsel Robert Mueller of illegally deleting the text messages of two people who had been assigned to the Russia investigation.", "Trump made his remarks about Mueller during a June 26 interview with Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria.\u201d", "The host, Maria Bartiromo, asked Trump about the announcement that Mueller will testify on July 17 before the House intelligence and House judiciary committees.\u00a0That led to a discussion, at around the 33:17-minute mark, about text messages exchanged between then-FBI agent Peter Strzok and then-FBI lawyer Lisa Page, that were critical of Trump\u00a0at a time when they were assigned to the FBI investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information while secretary of state.", "Page, for example, referred to Trump as \u201ca loathsome human,\u201d and Strzok called Trump \u201can idiot\u201d in a March 3, 2016, text exchange, according to a June 2018 report of the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General.", "Bartiromo, \u201cMornings with Maria,\u201d June 26: Well Peter Strzok and Lisa Page wrote everything down, so we\u2019ve got all the \u2013 we\u2019ve got all the texts.", "Trump: Well wait until you see the rest \u2013 wait until you see \u2013 no, wait until you see the rest of their \u2013", "Bartiromo: There\u2019s more.", "Trump: Now here\u2019s the problem, Robert Mueller, they worked for him, and the two lovers were together and they had texts back and forth and e-mail back and forth.", "Bartiromo: How come we haven\u2019t seen it all? I mean you did \u2013 you gave William Barr the authority to \u2014", "Trump:\u00a0He \u2013 you know why? Because Mueller terminated them illegally. He terminated the emails, he terminated all of the stuff between Strzok and Page, you know they sung like you\u2019ve never seen.", "Robert Mueller terminated their text messages together. He would \u2013 he terminated them. They\u2019re gone. And that\u2019s illegal, he \u2014 that\u2019s a crime.", "There is a lot to unpack here, but let\u2019s start with this: There is no evidence that Mueller \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 illegally deleted text messages sent or received by Strzok and Page.", "Here\u2019s what happened: In December 2018, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General issued a report that detailed its efforts to retrieve data from phones that Page and Strzok were given by the FBI (Samsung Galaxy phones) and the special counsel\u2019s office (iPhones).", "As we have written before, the IG\u2019s office said that it had\u00a0recovered about 20,000 text messages sent and received by Page and Strzok on FBI-issued Samsung phones. That is why Bartiromo said \u201cwe\u2019ve got all the texts\u201d between the two former FBI employees.", "However, the IG report\u00a0also said that Strzok and Page received iPhones from the Department of Justice after they were assigned to the\u00a0special counsel\u2019s office in the spring of 2017.", "No data could be recovered from the iPhones, because the special counsel\u2019s office reset the phones to factory settings after Page and Strzok turned them in, according to the report. Both FBI employees had the iPhones for less than two months, and they continued to use their FBI-issued phones while working in the special counsel\u2019s office, the IG report said.", "Breitbart, a conservative website, said the special counsel\u2019s office \u201cscrubbed\u201d Strzok\u2019s iPhone before giving it to the IG\u2019s office, but there is no evidence in the IG report of any wrongdoing.\u00a0The report notes that the DOJ \u201croutinely resets mobile devices to factory settings when the device is returned\u201d by an employee.", "Mueller is not mentioned in the IG report. According to public accounts, Mueller\u2019s only role in the matter was to remove Strzok\u00a0from the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation after he learned of the politically charged text messages. Page resigned from her position with the office.", "The IG report said \u201cPage left the SCO on July 15, 2017,\u201d and\u00a0\u201cStrzok\u00a0was removed from the SCO investigation in late July 2017.\u201d", "We asked the White House what evidence the president has that Mueller committed a crime, but we have not received a response.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
