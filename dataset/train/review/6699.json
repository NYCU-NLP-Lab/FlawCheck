We didn\u2019t remember \"vicious\" attack ads from Obama during the 2008 campaign, either.", "So what\u2019s going on? There are commercials out there showing Michelle Obama, but it\u2019s not at all clear if she\u2019s talking about Hillary Clinton. And the ads were made by a pro-Trump super PAC.", "What Michelle Obama said", "The Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry for this article, but he appears to be referring to comments made by Michelle Obama on Aug. 12, 2007, at a Women for Obama South Side Community Kickoff gathering at the Grand Ballroom, a historic venue in the Obamas\u2019 hometown of Chicago.", "At the event, which took place during the 2008 primary contest, Michelle Obama said:", "\"One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. Can't do it.\"", "Initially, these comments didn\u2019t attract much attention, though a clip of the event was aired on a local Chicago television newscast.", "However, Michelle Obama made a similar comment on the stump during a visit to Atlantic, Iowa. Here\u2019s what she said:", "\"One of the most important things that we need to know about the next president of the United States is, is he somebody that shares our values? Is he somebody that respects family? Is (he) a good and decent person? So our view was that, if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. So, so we've adjusted our schedules to make sure that our girls are first, so while he's traveling around, I do day trips. That means I get up in the morning, I get the girls ready, I get them off, I go and do trips, I'm home before bedtime. So the girls know that I was gone somewhere, but they don't care. They just know that I was at home to tuck them in at night, and it keeps them grounded, and, and children, the children in our country have to know that they come first. And our girls do and that's why we're doing this. We're in this race for not just our children, but all of our children.\"", "Michelle Obama\u2019s comments in Iowa first attracted attention in an Aug. 23, 2007, dispatch by Chicago Sun-Times reporter Jennifer Hunter, who wrote that the comment \"could be interpreted as a swipe at the Clintons.\"", "Hunter\u2019s article was then picked up by the conservative Drudge Report, and from there various television networks and other news outlets followed up. Most reports mentioned the possibility that Michelle Obama was taking a veiled shot at the Clintons\u2019 well-documented marital tribulations.", "Barack Obama rejected that interpretation, saying in a conference call with reporters that \"there was no reference beyond her point that we have had an administration that talks a lot about family values but doesn\u2019t follow through.\" He added that his wife often spoke about children and families in her remarks on the trail.", "It\u2019s possible to see her words as a veiled shot at the Clinton\u2019s marriage. It\u2019s also possible that she was simply expressing pride in how her own family had arranged its affairs to make sure their young children weren\u2019t left out.", "We will leave it to readers to decide which interpretation is closest to the mark.

That would be a nice bit of opposition research for the Trump campaign.", "However, the Obamas never aired such commercials. Rather, an ad along those lines has been made by a pro-Donald Trump super PAC.", "The 30-second spot, titled, \"Can\u2019t Run Your House,\" airs footage taken by a local television station from Obama\u2019s 2007 appearance in Chicago.

Rebekah Mercer took over the top position at Make America Number 1 after veteran Republican strategist David Bossie left to join Trump\u2019s campaign.", "By phrasing it the way he did, Trump implies that the Obamas ran ads against Clinton attacking their family life.

And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.\"", "Trump is wrong to imply that Michelle Obama\u2019s criticism came in an ad her husband ran against Hillary Clinton. Instead, it came from an ad made\u00a0by a pro-Trump super PAC. And, the comments from Michelle Obama are somewhat oblique.
