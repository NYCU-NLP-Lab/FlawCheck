According to this report, a young woman\u2019s body had been recovered in the Burdwan district of West Bengal on August 31, 2018. The girl\u2019s face had been crushed with a stone. During the post-mortem, two phone numbers written in henna were found on the victim\u2019s body. Tracing these numbers led the police to a person named Karan Singh, a resident of Mumbai. When he was shown a picture of the corpse, Singh told the police that the girl\u2019s name was Jahana Khatoon and she was from Muzaffarpur, Bihar. He and Jahana were in love with each other. However, her family was unhappy with their relationship. Singh said that Jahana\u2019s father made her end her relationship with him and tried to force her to come back home with them to Muzaffarpur. After getting this information, the police reached Jahana\u2019s house in Muzaffarpur. There they came to know that she had been taken to Kolkata by her father and brother a few days earlier. Singh had also told the police that Jahana\u2019s father Md Mushtaque and brother Md Jahid lived in Kolkata\u2019s Park Circus area where they both worked as drivers.", "The police then arrested the father-son duo from Park Circus on September 9, 2018. During the interrogation, Md Mushtaque broke down and confessed that he was the one who had killed Jahana. Md Jahid was quoted as saying in the report, \u201cWe brought her to Kolkata and we had also made up our mind to get Karan and Jahana married. While we were on the way back with Jahana, my father said that we should kill her. While I was driving, my father took a rope that was inside the car and strangulated her. Later he asked me to stop the car and he dumped the body off the road and mutilated her head with a stone.\u201d", "A few other media outlets, including News18, NDTV, Business Standard, and Zee News, had published reports on the incident.", "Image 2: Wedding card", "The image of the wedding card clearly shows the date of Sameer Khan and Prerna Vyas\u2019s wedding as October 22, 2019. Therefore, it cannot be linked in any way to the West Bengal incident from 2018. The picture of this wedding card has, in fact, been circulating on social media since October 2019.", "Image 3: Photo of a woman", "The woman is Telugu actress Summiyya Mohammed. Her picture, publicly available on the internet (1 and 2), was misused to weave the fictional story.", "To sum it up, a case of \u2018honour\u2019 killing in 2018 is being shared on social media with false claims that a Hindu woman was murdered as a result of \u2018love jihad\u2019. The woman who was killed hailed from the Muslim community. This 2018 incident has nothing to do with an interfaith marriage that was held in October 2019. The wedding card is unrelated to the incident. Furthermore, Telugu actress Summiyya Mohammed\u2019s picture was misused to claim she was the Hindu woman who succumbed to \u2018love jihad\u2019.", "Donate Now", "Kinjal Parmar holds a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology.
