["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on November 26, 2019", "A meme on Facebook misrepresents a year-old comment from former Sen. Orrin Hatch. He did not say, \u201cI don\u2019t care if Trump broke the law.\u201d Hatch said, \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d about allegations that Trump paid hush money to two women, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think he was involved in crimes.\u201d", "Even though Orrin Hatch retired from the Senate in January, a meme with his picture and a distorted quote is circulating on social media.", "The meme, recently shared on Facebook by the progressive group Occupy Democrats, claims that Hatch said: \u201cI don\u2019t care if Trump broke the law.\u201d", "He didn\u2019t actually say that \u2014 it\u2019s a twisted version of something he said nearly a year ago.", "In December 2018, a CNN reporter asked Hatch for his reaction to the implication that President Donald Trump was involved in the payment of hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. The day after the interview, Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in facilitating the payments.", "This is the exchange between CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Hatch:", "Raju, Dec. 11, 2018: I\u2019m wondering if you have any concerns about the fact that it was the president who was implicated in two crimes from 2016 involving these payments to women to hide these affairs. Are you concerned about what the federal government is alleging here?", "Hatch: Well, I think the Democrats will do anything to hurt this president. Anything. And what happened before he was elected president, you know, is one thing, but since he\u2019s been elected, the economy\u2019s done well, our country\u2019s moving ahead, we\u2019re in better shape than we were before he became president, and I think we ought to judge him on that basis.", "Raju: But this is not the Democrats, this is the Southern District of New York, the U.S. Attorney, I mean that\u2019s what\u2019s making this allegation.", "Hatch: You think he\u2019s a Republican, do you?", "Raju: Well, he\u2019s appointed by the president. He\u2019s an appointee by this president.", "Hatch: OK, but\u2026 I don\u2019t care. All I can say is he\u2019s doing a good job as president.", "Raju: It doesn\u2019t bother you, these crimes that he allegedly was involved in, the president, that doesn\u2019t bother you?", "Hatch: No, because I don\u2019t think he was involved in crimes, but, even then, you know, you can make anything a crime under the current laws. If you want to, you blow it way out of proportion \u2014 you can do a lot of things. All I can say is this, President Trump before he became president, that\u2019s another world. Since he\u2019s become president, this economy has charged ahead, we\u2019re all better off, the country\u2019s better off, and he\u2019s done a whale of a job. And I think we ought to judge him on that basis, rather than trying to drum up things from the past that may or may not be true.", "Raju: So you don\u2019t that\u2026 I mean\u2026 he\u2019s the president. Shouldn\u2019t he be following the laws, though?", "Hatch: Well, you\u2019re talking about things that happened before he became president, too, so, yeah, he should be following the law. We all ought to. On the other hand, when you run for president, no matter what you do, they\u2019ll claim you\u2019re not following the law, so, you know, I\u2019ve seen that when Democrats are president. I\u2019ve seen it when Republicans are president. I think we ought to get to where we support our presidents when they\u2019re right and quit trying to destroy them just for political reasons.", "At the time, several left-leaning online publications paraphrased Hatch\u2019s comments this way: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t care\u2019 if Trump broke the law.\u201d The meme now circulating online has taken that interpretation of Hatch\u2019s remarks and presented it as fact. It\u2019s not.", "Hatch actually said the president should follow the law, but he didn\u2019t think that Trump committed a crime.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
