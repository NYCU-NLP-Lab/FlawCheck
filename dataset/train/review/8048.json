["Several claims on social media -- including by the musician Ted Nugent here and by others here, here, here, here, here and here -- say that Dr. Seuss and Mr. Potato Head have been canceled, while some posts add they were \u201ctaken down\u201d by Biden.", "Critics of\u00a0 \u201ccancel culture\u201d -- a movement that seeks to call out offensive behavior -- denounce it as excessive and say it is contributing to increased political polarization.", "However, the claims in the posts are false on several accounts.", "Six books, out of a collection of 50 Dr. Seuss titles that were independently reviewed, are being pulled because of imagery now considered racist. The publisher of the bestselling children's books made the announcement on March 2, 2021 which would have been the author's birthday.", "Dr. Seuss Enterprises said it made the decision last year -- before Biden became president -- to take six titles out of print: \u201cAnd to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,\u201d \u201cIf I Ran the Zoo,\u201d \u201cMcElligot\u2019s Pool,\u201d \u201cOn Beyond Zebra!,\u201d \u201cScrambled Eggs Super!,\u201d and \u201cThe Cat\u2019s Quizzer.\u201d", "The six are currently unavailable for sale on the official Dr. Seuss\u2019 website.", "\u201cThese books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong,\u201d the company said in its statement, making no mention of governmental involvement in the decision.", "Seuss'\u00a0books have sold more than 650 million copies and have been translated into dozens of languages.", "Contrary to what some Facebook posts claim -- linking the decision to the current administration -- the reevaluation over the portrayal of Black, Arabic and Asian people in the Dr. Seuss catalog, that led to the decision, has been long in the making.", "A February 2019 study published in the \"Research on Diversity in Youth Literature\" journal examined 50 of Seuss\u2019 books. The report concluded that 43 of the 45 characters of color had \"characteristics aligning with the definition of Orientalism.\"", "Posts stating that \u201cThe Cat in The Hat\u201d has been \u201ccanceled\u201d are misleading. The 1957 children's book is not part of the six discontinued Dr. Seuss Enterprises titles. However, \u201cThe Cat\u2019s Quizzer\u201d displays the main character from that book.", "In February 2021, toy manufacturer Hasbro said it was dropping the honorific from the \u201cMr. Potato Head\u201d logo and packaging \"to promote gender equality and inclusion.\"", "But the product\u2019s rebranding does not mean \u201cMr. Potato Head\u201d will cease to exist. The iconic action figure, known for starring in the Pixar franchise \u201cToy Story,\u201d will continue to be sold in stores but\u00a0known simply as \"Potato Head.\"", "A non-gender-specific version of the toy, in which children add facial characteristics and clothes to the body of plastic spuds, will hit shelves in the fall. Their new product is a kit \u201cthat includes enough potatoes and accessories for kids to create all types of families,\" Hasbro told AFP in an email.", "The company tweeted that Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head characters \u201caren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d and would still be available for purchase. Hasbro also included a visual of what could be the new packaging and branding.", "Hasbro did not associate the rebranding of the toy with a governmental decision or to Biden himself.", "Moves by classic brands for more inclusive toys and books are not new this year. Barbie creator Mattel released a line of \"gender-inclusive\u201d dolls in 2019, after a series\u00a0with more inclusive body types released in 2016.", "For years , retailers have also embraced a more gender-neutral approach to marketing and selling their children\u2019s toys.

However, it was not the US but local forces in Iraq and Syria that played the decisive role in victories over the jihadists, with America focusing on providing them with air support, equipment and training.", "And while Trump was president at the time the jihadists' last major strongholds were retaken, the strategy of having local forces lead the fight was put in place by his predecessor Barack Obama.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
