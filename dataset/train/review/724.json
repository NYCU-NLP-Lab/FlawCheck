Jeanne Shaheen, voted with Obama 99 percent of the time.

One of those ways is an examination of presidential support, or the number of votes by each lawmaker on bills on which the sitting president has staked a position.", "The 2011 CQ analysis found that, out of the pool of votes on which Obama took a clear position that year, Brown\u2019s vote matched the president\u2019s stance 69.6 percent of the time. That score is in line with the claim Rubens made.", "Out of all Republicans in the Senate, only Maine Sen. Susan Collins recorded a higher presidential support score that year, based on CQ\u2019s analysis.", "Brown\u2019s presidential support score was somewhat lower during his first year in office.

The number rose to about 78 percent during Brown\u2019s final year in office in 2012.", "It\u2019s important to note that there are limitations to gauging any politician\u2019s support for the president based solely on the small number of votes represented in the CQ analysis.", "In 2011, for example, the Senate took 235 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on only 89 of those votes, most of which were taken on presidential nominations.", "After he was criticized by Rubens, Brown pointed out that he was proud to join Obama in supporting pieces of legislation such as the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which provides tax incentives for businesses that hire unemployed veterans.", "Brown\u2019s campaign also pointed out that Brown\u2019s presidential support score in the 2011 CQ analysis placed him midway between the average Republican and average Democrat in the Senate.", "According to CQ\u2019s figures, the average Senate Republican voted with the president 53 percent of the time, while the average Democrat supported the president 92 percent of the time.", "Our ruling", "Rubens said that when Brown was serving in the U.S. Senate in 2011, Brown voted with President Obama 70 percent of the time.", "In 2011, Brown took the same position as the president 69.6 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, based on analysis by Congressional Quarterly. Rounding off, Rubens was right on the money. But it\u2019s important to note the president doesn\u2019t take a clear position on all legislation and outlined his position on only 38 percent of the roll call votes taken in 2011.", "Overall, the number is accurate, but needs additional clarification.
