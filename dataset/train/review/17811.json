["By Sydney Schaedel", "Posted on June 21, 2017", "Q: Did Kellyanne Conway say liberal women hate her because of her \u201cstriking beauty and intellect\u201d?", "A: There\u2019s no evidence she did. That claim comes from a website that warns readers to rely on its information \u201cat your own risk.\u201d", "Skeptical Facebook users flagged a story posted on the London Web News website as potentially fake. The headline reads: \u201cLiberal Women Hate Me Because Of My \u2018Striking Beauty And Intellect\u2019, Says Kellyanne Conway.\u201d", "The story claims Conway, the White House counselor to President Donald Trump, made the statement \u201cto a reporter at a luncheon in Washington D.C.,\u201d and that \u201cpundits were quick to capitalise on her comments and tell her that if she and her boss were doing a good job and being open and honest with the American people then she wouldn\u2019t have to face much criticism.\u201d", "There\u2019s no evidence Conway said that. We did a search in Nexis, a news database, for the terms \u201cConway\u201d and \u201cstriking beauty and intellect\u201d and did not find any news articles or commentary from pundits that contained those terms.", "There are other reasons to believe that Conway never made the statement attributed to her, as the story raises several red flags that we often see with fake news.", "For example, there is no byline identifying the author. In fact, the London Web News website doesn\u2019t include the names of any reporters, editors or other staffers. The \u201ccontact us\u201d page contains only a Gmail address. It also provides no identifying information about its website in the WHOIS database\u00a0\u2014 which lists the owners of each domain name \u2014 unlike legitimate news organizations, such as the New York Times\u00a0and the Washington Post. Instead, London Web News shields its identity in WHOIS\u00a0using WHOISGuard.", "The story also makes it impossible to verify any of the reported information. It doesn\u2019t name the reporter who allegedly spoke to Conway at the luncheon, nor does it say when and at what venue the event took place.", "More important, the London Web News, which may sound like a legitimate news organization, says in a disclaimer that it can\u2019t vouch for the accuracy of its posts and advises readers to rely on its information \u201cat your own risk.\u201d", "London Web News: The information\u00a0contained in this website is for general informational purposes only and or educational purposes.
