["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on August 7, 2020", "A deceptively edited video clip of Joe Biden circulating on social media cuts an hour-long speech to less than one minute, retaining only parts of statements and his pauses between words.", "Joe Biden, former vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, spoke from a community center near his home in Delaware on July 28.", "The speech, which focused on addressing racial equality through his economic plan, and his answers to questions from reporters ran just over an hour. But a clip circulating on social media has spliced together parts of Biden\u2019s remarks into a video that runs for less than a minute and shows him mostly saying some version of \u201cum.\u201d", "The clip included this description in the title, \u201cBiden gets location wrong, sounds lost,\u201d and\u00a0garnered hundreds of comments on Facebook and Instagram, many of which expressed concern about Biden\u2019s mental capacity. One such commenter wrote: \u201cHe is not a good person, but I don\u2019t even have the heart to make fun of him. Cognitive decline is so sad, and I am stunned that his \u2018loved ones\u2019 would let him be paraded about like this.\u201d", "But the clip was deceptively edited.", "It starts off accurately, showing the beginning of Biden\u2019s remarks. He says: \u201cGood afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Kingswood Community Center. Actually, that\u2019s the one down, I used to work. That\u2019s a joke; didn\u2019t know where we were. Anyway,\u201d Biden then laughed. The video clip then shows Biden saying: \u201cIt\u2019s great to be here and back in a place where\u2026 .\u201d But the clip doesn\u2019t include the rest of the sentence, instead going on to splice together other parts of Biden\u2019s remarks where he says \u201cum\u201d or \u201cuh.\u201d", "The only other words from Biden that the clip uses come from about 35 minutes into his remarks, when he\u2019s answering a question about why he chose to speak from Delaware.", "In his full answer, Biden said he made that decision because \u201cthis is my home.\u201d He explained that he would get the same kind of media coverage regardless of his location, and doing it in Wilmington, Delaware, made it easy to coordinate with campaign staff in Philadelphia.", "While that event was held at a community center, Biden has made several virtual appearances from his house near Wilmington since the COVID-19 pandemic swept the country in March. Following those appearances, President Donald Trump characterized Biden as staying in his \u201cbasement.\u201d", "In his answer to the question, Biden made a reference to Trump\u2019s comments. That\u2019s where the social media clip picks up. It starts that section with Biden saying: \u201cOperating out of home. All this stuff about hiding in the basement? Well, over 340 million people have watched what we\u2019ve done like this on television. That\u2019s as big as the American population.\u201d", "Then, the clip ends.", "We asked Biden\u2019s campaign what that figure was based on, but we didn\u2019t get a response. Videos on the campaign\u2019s YouTube channel routinely get thousands or tens of thousands of views, and the campaign also posts videos on other social media platforms. But it\u2019s unclear how Biden got the tally of 340 million.", "We also reached out to Maggie VandenBerghe, who appears to have been the first person to post the clipped video. We didn\u2019t get a response.", "VandenBerghe describes herself on her Facebook page as a \u201cConservative Filmmaker & Producer\u201d and a \u201cPro Trump Patriot.\u201d She didn\u2019t explain in the caption accompanying the clip on either Facebook or Instagram that the video had been edited.", "The video of Biden\u2019s complete remarks is below:", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "\u201cJoe Biden Remarks in Wilmington, Delaware on the Economy.\u201d C-SPAN. 28 Jul 2020.", "Trump, Donald (@realDonaldTrump). \u201cWas in the Great State of Texas this week and explained that the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats, headed up by their great leader, Sleepy Joe Biden (who never leaves his basement), are strongly against \u201cOil, Gas, Guns, & God\u201d.
