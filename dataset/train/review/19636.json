["About this rating", "Some users have had music files deleted after signing up for Apple Music.", "Apple is not \"stealing\" music from people's personal computers; the deletion of files was likely the result of user error or a problem with software.", "On 4 May 2016, an article published on the Vellum Atlanta\u00a0blog reported\u00a0that Apple was \"stealing\" music from people's personal hard drives:", "\u201cThe software is functioning as intended,\u201d said Amber.", "\u201cWait,\u201d I asked, \u201cso it\u2019s supposed to delete my personal files from my internal hard drive without asking my permission?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d she replied.", "I had just explained to Amber that 122 GB of music files were missing from my laptop. I\u2019d already visited the online forum, I said, and they were no help. Although several people had described problems similar to mine, they were all dismissed by condescending \u201cgurus\u201d who simply said that we had mislocated our files (I had the free drive space to prove that wasn\u2019t the case) or that we must have accidentally deleted the files ourselves (we hadn\u2019t). Amber explained that I should blow off these dismissive \u201csolutions\u201d offered online because Apple employees don\u2019t officially use the forums\u2014evidently, that honor is reserved for lost, frustrated people like me, and (at least in this case) know-it-alls who would rather believe we were incompetent, or lying, than face the ugly truth that Apple has vastly overstepped its boundaries.", "While we can't confirm if this conversation truly occurred between blogger James Pinkstone and an Apple customer service agent, we can say that Apple is not \"stealing\" music, nor is it purposefully deleting music files without permission.", "However, many users have pointed out flaws in the Apple Music service that could result in\u00a0music collections being accidentally deleted.\u00a0In July 2015, Jim Dalrymple detailed his experience\u00a0with\u00a0Apple which also resulted in his files being\u00a0deleted. Dalrymple eventually had his music restored, and concluded that the issue arose from a mixture of user error, a confusing software ecosystem, and a poor matching service:", "I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m still trying to get my head around how this works.", "Some of the songs I own were incorrectly tagged as Apple Music, but that\u2019s been fixed too, which means they show up correctly in iTunes. That is great news.", "However, I\u2019m still missing a couple of hundred songs. Apple\u2019s theory is that I deleted them\u2014that when I was trying to fix Apple Music, I mistakenly deleted my own files. While I concede that it is within the realm of possibility that I deleted my own files, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me.", "Here\u2019s where my confusion comes from. I own all of Ozzy\u2019s albums and quite a few compilations. I can\u2019t think of a single reason why I would download an album I already own, and album that is in my iTunes Library, only to delete it. I can\u2019t think of a good reason for that.", "Here\u2019s one possibility. Perhaps I deleted an Ozzy compilation album (I believe I did do that) that contained tracks that were also on some of his studio albums. I\u2019m wondering if iTunes Match deleted my version of those same songs\u2014songs that I own from my own CDs, purely because the titles were the same as those on the compilation album.", "A support page for Apple Music clearly states that files\u00a0residing in iTunes on your Mac or PC are never altered or deleted:", "When Apple Music adds these matched songs to your iCloud Music Library, Apple Music doesn\u2019t change or alter your original music files that reside in iTunes for Mac or PC or on your iOS devices from which they were added. We make these matched songs available to your other computers or devices in high quality 256 Kbps AAC, and they can be played on them only while your Apple Music membership is active.", "While this description seems straightforward, the Apple blog\u00a0iMore\u00a0pointed out on 5 May 2016 that this policy only applied to primary devices. Files downloaded to mobile devices or secondary computers can still be deleted. Also, Jason Snell, the editor-in-chief of\u00a0Six Colors,\u00a0a web site dedicated to Apple news, reported that while Apple won't completely delete a file\u00a0from a main hard drive, it will send a file to the trash bin:", "When you press delete on a song in your iTunes Library with Apple Music or iTunes Match enabled, you'll see the following dialog:", "If you choose \"Remove Download,\" it will send the local file from your hard drive to your Trash, but leave the reference in your library \u2014\u00a0so that you can stream that track directly from iCloud Music Library. It won't delete the file until you empty your Trash.", "This is great if you're on a laptop and want streaming access to your music library, but you don't want the hassle of having 40GB of music on your hard drive. But it should only ever be done on a secondary computer or secondary iTunes Library\u2014\u00a0never for your master library.", "While it is true that some users have had files deleted when using Apple Music's match service, this was not deliberately done in order to \"steal\" your music. These file deletions likely occurred due to a mixture of user error, poor matching algorithms, and confusion over\u00a0how Apple syncs and manages files.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
