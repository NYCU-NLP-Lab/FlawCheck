["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on November 6, 2020 | Updated on April 29, 2021", "A video from a right-wing activist suggests that U.S. Postal Service employees backdated ballots in Michigan. The claim is unproven, but, even if true, no ballots in the state are accepted after Nov. 3, regardless of the postmark.", "Project Veritas, a right-wing activist organization, added to the onslaught of misinformation aimed at discrediting the election results this week.", "In a video posted to the group\u2019s YouTube channel, its founder, James O\u2019Keefe, claimed to present a Postal Service \u201cwhistleblower\u201d with information suggesting election fraud in Michigan.", "With his voice modified to disguise his identity, the so-called whistleblower says in the video: \u201cWe were issued a directive this morning to collect any ballots we find\u2026 so that they could hand stamp them with the previous day\u2019s date. Today is Nov. 4, for clarification.\u201d", "Election Day was Nov. 3, so the implication is that the U.S. Postal Service was participating in a scheme to allow illegitimate votes to be counted.", "We don\u2019t know if there was any such \u201cdirective.\u201d The U.S. Postal Service inspector general\u2019s office is investigating the complaint, spokesman Agapi Doulaveris told FactCheck.org by email, and, she said, \u201cno additional information [is] available at this time.\u201d", "But, even so, it would have no bearing on the election. Michigan law specifies that mail-in ballots \u201cmust reach the clerk or an authorized assistant of the clerk before the close of the polls on election day. An absent voter ballot received by the clerk or assistant of the clerk after the close of the polls on election day will not be counted.\u201d", "The Michigan Secretary of State\u2019s office has also explained on its website, \u201cMichigan\u2019s election clerks count valid ballots that they received at their offices or in their official ballot drop boxes by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Ballots received thereafter, regardless of the postmark, are not counted.\u201d", "And, just to be very clear, Bonnie Scheele, the county clerk for the area that includes the post office referenced in the video, told PolitiFact, \u201cEven if the ballots were postmarked as Nov. 3, they cannot be counted because the ballots had to be in the hands of the township or city clerks by 8 p.m. Nov. 3.\u201d", "Also worth noting is that President Donald Trump received more votes in that county, although his challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, did get more mail-in votes.", "Despite the fact that the claim is moot, Donald Trump Jr., one of the president\u2019s children, retweeted the video to his 6 million followers with this message referring to the Department of Justice: \u201cWhere is the DOJ???\u201d", "And some conservative outlets promoted it, too. Fox News host Sean Hannity called the Project Veritas video a \u201cbombshell\u201d on the Nov. 5 episode of his show, and a website called Chicks On The Right used the same term to describe it. The Russia-based, government-funded network RT, formerly Russia Today, promoted the claim, too.", "Update, April 29: John Sullivan, general counsel for Project Veritas, wrote to us to object to our description of\u00a0O\u2019Keefe\u00a0as a \u201cright-wing activist.\u201d We described O\u2019Keefe as a \u201cright-wing activist\u201d \u2014 as other media outlets have done, including the\u00a0Associated Press,\u00a0New York Times\u00a0and\u00a0New York Magazine \u2014 because O\u2019Keefe and Project Veritas are best known for posting secretly recorded videos that target liberal groups, mainstream news organizations and Democrats.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
