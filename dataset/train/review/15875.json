Ted Cruz.", "Gromer Jeffers of the Dallas Morning News said to O\u2019Rourke: \"You have addressed your 1998 DWI arrest numerous times during your public career. But not this question: As the Houston Chronicle pointed out recently, a witness said in that accident that you tried to leave the scene of the accident. Did you and should voters be concerned about this incident?\"", "O\u2019Rourke replied at the Southern Methodist University debate: \"I did not try to leave the scene of the accident--though driving drunk, which I did, is a terrible mistake for which there is no excuse or justification or defense and I will not try to provide one. I can only tell you that I was able to have a second chance in my life.\"", "O\u2019Rourke went on to tick-tock his subsequent opening of a business with friends in his hometown of El Paso where, he said, he met his wife with whom he\u2019s raising three children. Also, O\u2019Rourke said, he won election to the El Paso City Council and, in 2012, to the U.S. House, which he\u2019s leaving after this year.", "\"I made the most that I could with my second choice and my opportunity,\" O\u2019Rourke said.", "Readers asked us if O\u2019Rourke tried to leave the scene of his accident and arrest.", "Houston Chronicle news story cites police report", "The Chronicle, in an Aug. 30, 2018, news story, said a police report shows that the incident was a more serious threat to public safety than previously reported.", "The newspaper, citing the report, said that O\u2019Rourke was driving drunk at what a witness called \"a high rate of speed\" in a 75 mph zone on Interstate 10 about a mile east of the New Mexico border. He lost control and hit a truck, sending his car careening across the center median. The story said that the witness, described as stopping at the scene, later told police that O\u2019Rourke had tried to leave the scene.", "The report, the story says, refers to\u00a0an unnamed\u00a0\"motorist\u2019s description of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s dark-colored Volvo passing him quickly about 3 a.m. on I-10.\" The story says that O'Rourke reportedly struck a truck going in the same direction and crossed a grassy median into the opposite lanes.", "The story says that according to the police report, \"O\u2019Rourke then attempted to leave the scene but was stopped by the same motorist he had just passed. The unidentified motorist \u2018then turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to try to get the defendant (O\u2019Rourke) to stop,\u2019 the report says.\"", "The story says that O'Rourke recorded a 0.136 and 0.134 on police breathalyzers, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time.

The officer\u2019s report says that he met at the scene with a witness--called the \"reporter\" in Carrera\u2019s report--and his partner, the driver of \"the American Medical ambulance.\" By phone, Hartt-Goggin told us the ambulance company serves private clients out of Las Cruces, NM. Our attempts to reach a Las Cruces official with American Medical Response, a Colorado-based company, didn\u2019t draw an immediate response.", "Carrera\u2019s report says the witness said that he initially saw a green Volvo pass his vehicle at a high rate of speed westbound on I-10. \"The vehicle then lost control moments later and struck a truck traveling the same direction,\" the report says. \"After the driver/defendant struck the truck, it sent the defendant\u2019s vehicle across the center median and to a complete stop facing east bound,\" the report says.", "\"The defendant/driver then attempted to leave the scene,\" the report says.
