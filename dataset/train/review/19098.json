["Several studies have found that drinking alcohol damages both the immune system and the respiratory system's infection defense.", "With alcohol sales banned during South Africa\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown, the government has warned people to avoid alcohol because it weakens the immune system and makes it difficult for the body to fight disease.", "Several studies have found that drinking alcohol \u2013 particularly binge drinking \u2013 damages both the immune system and the respiratory system\u2019s defences against infection.", "Almost 70% of South Africans are non-drinkers. But nearly 60% of those who do drink, drink heavily. This puts them at risk of more severe Covid-19 symptoms.", "The South African government recently warned its nearly 400,000 Twitter followers to avoid alcohol.", "\u201cIt weakens the immune system!\u201d the tweet claimed. \u201cDrinking alcohol makes it difficult for the body to fight infections like COVID-19.\u201d", "South Africa is currently under lockdown in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus. Lockdown regulations ban the sale and transport of alcohol.", "Is the government\u2019s claim that alcohol weakens your immune system backed by evidence? We checked.", "The immune system is an organism\u2019s internal defence against infection. The human immune system is complex, using several mechanisms to prevent or fight disease.", "When the immune system detects a foreign body \u2013 such as the new strain of coronavirus \u2013 it releases chemicals and specialised cells to try destroy it. There are many of these defence mechanisms, and they all work in different ways to destroy the invaders.", "Alcohol\u2019s effects on the immune system have been known to experts for a long time, according to a 2015 issue of the journal Alcohol Research: Current Review. These include slower immune response and slower recovery rates.", "Dr Katherine Jung is the director of the Division of Metabolism and Health Effects at the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. She was also an editor of the 2015 Alcohol Research review.", "She told Africa Check that alcohol misuse has both immediate and long term effects, saying it \u201csuppresses the ability to defend against respiratory infection in the short term\u201d. It does this not only by weakening immune cells, but by damaging some of the cells that line our airways and act as barriers to infection.", "The long term effects of regular alcohol misuse include \u201cincreased risk for respiratory infections and for acute respiratory distress syndrome, with increased need for mechanical ventilation, prolonged ICU stay, and higher incidence of mortality\u201d.", "A Nigerian study in the African Journal of Biomedical Research found that these effects were especially pronounced if an alcohol user also smoked cigarettes.", "Most research on the topic focuses on chronic alcohol use \u2013 drinking too much or too often. In contrast, a review in the British Journal of Nutrition looked at low to moderate alcohol consumption.", "It found that regular consumption of small amounts of some alcoholic beverages, such as beer and wine, was not dangerous to the immune systems of otherwise healthy adults. This kind of drinking might even slightly improve resistance to some respiratory illnesses, the authors said. (Note: Two of the paper\u2019s six authors indirectly received funding from the Spanish arm of the Brewers of Europe.)", "But they added that the review\u2019s findings didn\u2019t apply to alcohol consumption in general. It advised children, pregnant people and the elderly against consuming alcoholic beverages. \u201cGiven the serious health risks associated with exceeding two drinks per day, increased alcohol consumption cannot be recommended,\u201d even for healthy adults.", "Africa Check asked the Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Research Unit, part of the South African Medical Research Council, about the claim.", "The unit\u2019s director, Prof Charles Parry, and consultant, Prof Neo Morojele, both stressed that most South African drinkers don\u2019t use alcohol in moderation.", "\u201cModerate drinking (however you define it) is relatively rare in South Africa,\u201d Morojele told Africa Check. She said advice for moderate drinkers would apply to a minority of the population.", "The World Health Organization has estimated that 69% of South Africans aged 15 or older were non-drinkers in 2018. This means they had not consumed alcohol in the year before the study was done.", "But most (59%) of the South Africans who did drink engaged in \u201cheavy episodic drinking\u201d, or binge drinking. The WHO defines this as consumption of \u201c60 or more grams of pure alcohol on at least one occasion at least once per month\u201d.", "By the WHO\u2019s definition, a person is considered a binge drinker if they drink four 340ml bottles of Carling Black Label or 1.5 litres of Castle Lager in one sitting. If they prefer wine, this is equivalent to drinking about 600 millilitres of Graham Beck Chardonnay or Tassenberg (locally known as \u201cTassies\u201d) in one sitting.", "Parry said that even a single episode of binge drinking impairs the immune system. He cited a study that found it caused a brief inflammatory immune response followed by an anti-inflammatory state in which many immune responses were suppressed.", "These effects were found to last even after alcohol was no longer detectable in the blood of test subjects. As most South African drinkers tend to binge on alcohol, Parry said, an impaired immune system was \u201cdefinitely an issue\u201d for them.", "Jung said there was \u201cno precise answer to how much alcohol is required to impair immune function\u201d, but stressed that even a single episode of heavy drinking had a negative effect.", "The South African government has warned people to avoid alcohol during the Covid-19 pandemic, claiming that it weakens the immune system.", "Several experts told Africa Check that the claim was correct, citing extensive research into the effects of alcohol on the immune system. In particular, heavy alcohol use has been shown to have negative long term effects on immune health. Data shows that most South Africans who use alcohol are binge drinkers.", "There is some evidence that moderate alcohol consumption is harmless, but only in specific circumstances. Experts say the available research is not clear on how much alcohol a person could consume without damaging their immune system.", "Please complete this form to receive the HTML sharing code.", "Africa Check values your trust and is committed to the responsible management, use and protection of personal information.
