["\u201cI\u2019m dead right on this. The coronavirus is the common cold, folks,\u201d Limbaugh said of the novel coronavirus on his show on February 24, 2020. Limbaugh was decrying the virus \u201cbeing weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump.\u201d", "A similar theory took hold on social media in the days following Limbaugh\u2019s remark, though without any explicit connection to the radio host. Some\u00a0Facebook users began to share a photo of an old medical textbook citing the common cold as a possible condition caused by coronaviruses.", "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which can cause the common cold.", "However, as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states on its website: \u201cThe virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.\u201d", "Like the SARS-Cov, a coronavirus discovered in 2003 that\u00a0killed 774 people, the novel coronavirus is a more serious strain that has infected more than 90,000 people worldwide, killing\u00a0more than 3,000.", "The novel coronavirus, also named COVID-19 or SARS-Cov-2, was discovered in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, and is more closely related to bat coronaviruses.", "\u201cThese viruses are all far more deadly than the established human coronaviruses, particularly in elderly individuals,\u201d Justin Lessler, professor of epidemiology at John Hopkins University\u2019s School of Public Health, told AFP by email, in reference to SARS-CoV and COVID-19.", "The Virginia Department of Health lists four types of common human coronaviruses that cause mild to moderate respiratory infections such as the common cold: 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. The CDC lists the same four viruses on its own web page.", "According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report on COVID-19, symptoms of the newly discovered virus \u201ccan range from no symptoms... to severe pneumonia or death,\u201d but in a majority of cases included fever and dry cough, to which the CDC adds shortness of breath.", "Symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, headaches, and body aches. Common colds, the CDC notes, are caused by many different respiratory viruses, \u201cbut rhinoviruses are the most common.\u201d", "Rhinoviruses are responsible for more than half of cold-like illnesses, according to a review of this virus family from the American Society for Microbiology.", "The photo used in Facebook posts to equate the novel coronavirus with the common cold\u00a0appears to be from the 1989 American Medical Association Encyclopedia.", "The textbook is correct, but refers to common human coronaviruses, and not the strain responsible for the current deadly worldwide outbreak.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
