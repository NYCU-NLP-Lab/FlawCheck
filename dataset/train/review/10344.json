["After a New York City surgeon was found dead at his Park Avenue apartment in late 2017, some media drew a connection between his apparent suicide and a lawsuit brought against him by a former New York Giants running back.", "Police investigated the death of Dean Lorich as a suicide, news reports from the ABC News and the New York Daily News stated at the time. The medical examiner determined that Lorich\u2019s death was a suicide, a fact that\u00a0the New York Police Department confirmed for us again on Friday.", "But another website, Intellihub, published a Dec. 12, 2017 story suggesting something more nefarious\u2014that Lorich was murdered after exposing corruption involving the Clinton Foundation in Haiti.", "This story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It appears to be making the social media rounds nearly a year after publication, with CrowdTangle data showing it has \u00a0been shared on Facebook nearly 80,000 times, generating almost 373,000 social media interactions.", "\"A well-known surgeon who exposed major inadequacies in medical trauma care promised to the Haitian people by the Clinton Foundation after the nonprofit raised over $30 million dollars in donations following the devastating 2010 earthquake was found dead in his upscale apartment Sunday with a stab wound to the chest,\" begins the Intellihub.com story written by Shepard Ambellas and labeled as an \"opinion\" piece.", "Intellihub\u2019s website describes Ambellas as \"an opinion journalist, analyst, and the founder and editor-in-chief of Intellihub News & Politics.\" Ambellas is also, according to the site, a regular contributor to Alex Jones\u2019 InfoWars.com, a website known to traffic in fake news and conspiracy theories.", "Ambellas goes on in the story to report that Lorich was working with a team of doctors in Haiti when he \"discovered an almost non-existent medical effort backed by the Clinton Foundation.\" When he was stateside again, the story says, Lorich aired his grievances in an email that was eventually forwarded to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.", "A note at the end of the article asks readers who they think murdered the doctor. \"Did the doctor\u2019s persistence wind up getting him added to the Clinton body count?\" the website says. \"Please comment and share.\"", "According to Intellihub\u2019s website, it is an \"independent news outlet which covers a variety of topics such as politics, the economy, surveillance, liberal corporate media bias, and much more.\"", "Ambellas did not immediately respond to an email seeking more information about the article. An email sent to an address at the bottom of the Intellihub website also went unanswered.", "The story links to three outside sources. The first is a New York Post article about the surgeon\u2019s death and the lawsuit he was facing. It doesn\u2019t mention the Clintons or Haiti.", "The second is a WikiLeaks page that appears to show an email Lorich wrote in 2010 that was eventually forwarded to Hillary Clinton. By the time it reached the the-secretary of state, the subject line was: \"DOCTORS REPORT FROM HAITI.\"", "\"Depressing,\" wrote the aide who forwarded it.", "In the email, Lorich describes a trip to Haiti with other doctors to provide trauma care in the wake of a devastating earthquake there. When they arrived, they were discouraged to discover that \"disaster management on the ground was nonexistent,\" according to the email. \"The difficulties in getting in despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and David Helfet\u2019s high political connections with Partner\u2019s in Health as well as the Clintons only portended the difficulties we would have once we arrived.\"", "The email does not mention the Clintons nor the Clinton Foundation again.", "The third link is the CNN piece authored by Lorich and surgeons Soumitra Eachempati and David Helfet. \"Doctors: Haiti medical situation shameful,\" the headline reads. They describe their plan to help safely amputate the limbs of injured earthquake victims with a 13-member team of surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses.", "\"We thought our plan was a good one, but we soon learned we were incredibly naive,\" the CNN opinion piece says. \"Disaster management in Haiti was nonexistent. The difficulties getting in\u2014despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and Dr. Helfet\u2019s connections with Partners in Health and Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2014only hinted at the difficulties we would have once we arrived.\"", "Lorich and the surgeons wrote of numerous points of failure in the operation before finally taking aim at the United States, writing, \"The lack of support for our operation by the United States is shocking and embarrassing and shows how woefully unprepared we are for the realities of disasters.\"", "There is no further elaboration of the involvement of the Clintons or the Clinton Foundation.", "As other fact-checkers have noted, the Clintons played a role in Haiti recovery efforts. Hillary Clinton led the U.S. government\u2019s response to the disaster, Bill Clinton was the United Nations special envoy to Haiti and their foundation raised millions for relief projects. The couple faced allegations that their efforts didn\u2019t accomplish enough and that some of the projects they backed benefited foreign investors and the wealthy more than poor Haitians.", "Lorich\u2019s criticism was aimed at the United States, not the Clinton Foundation, but conspiracy theories that the Clintons kill their political enemies aren\u2019t new. And Intellihub isn\u2019t alone in promoting the idea that the doctor\u2019s death was retribution. But while these stories lean on some factual information\u2014Lorich traveled to Haiti and he was discovered with a chest wound\u2014there is no evidence that suggests he was murdered by the Clinton family.", "We rate this headline Pants on Fire!", "Statement from the New York Police Department, Oct. 19, 2018", "Obituary, Dean Lorich, The New York Times, Dec. 12, 2017", "Article, \"Surgeon found dead in home was sued by ex-Giant for \u2018ending his career\u2019,\" New York Post, Dec. 11, 2017", "Article, \"His Giant burden - Doc faces ex-players suite before killing self,\" New York Daily News, Dec. 12, 2017", "Article, \"Doctor found dead with knife in chest in Manhattan apartment while home alone with 11-year-old daughter,\" New York Daily News, Dec. 10, 2017", "News clip, \"Acclaimed NY surgeon found dead in Park Avenue apartment in suspected suicide,\" ABC News, Dec. 11, 2017", "Article, \"Surgeon who exposed Clinton Foundation corruption in Haiti found dead in apartment with stab wound to the chest,\" Intellihub, Dec. 12, 2017", "Article, \"Surgeon found dead in home was sued by ex-Giant for \u2018ending his career,\u2019\" New York Post, Dec. 11, 2017", "Emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s Email Archive, Wikileaks", "Op-ed, \"Doctors: Haiti medical situation shameful,\" CNN, Jan. 25, 2010", "Blog post, \"Did the Clinton Foundation raise \u2018hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 for a hospital in Haiti that was never built?\" The Washington Post, June 13, 2016", "Article, \"How the Clintons\u2019 Haiti development plans succeed \u2014\u00a0and disappoint,\" The Washington Post, March 20, 2015", "Blog post, \"Clinton body bags,\" Snopes, Jan. 24, 1998", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
