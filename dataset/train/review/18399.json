A group of people had beaten a woman over the suspicion of her being a child-lifter. According to the report, people who were part of the mob claimed to have heard a rumour that a 35-year-old woman was trying to lift a seven-year-old child. The mob rounded up this woman suspecting her to be a child-kidnapper. The woman tried explaining to the mob that she merely approached a few children and spoke to them while walking on the street but the mob refused to lend ears. Police can be seen in the video because they rescued the woman from the enraged mob and escorted her to safety.", "Patna based local news portal Newscity reported that the woman was mentally unstable. Alt News reached out to Mehdiganj police station. We were informed that senior police officers confirmed that she was not a child-lifter. It was also reiterated to us that the woman was mentally ill.", "We also spoke to a senior official at Patna (city) police who corroborated the set of events.
