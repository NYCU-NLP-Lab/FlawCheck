["About this rating", "On 14 January 2016, the family of actor Alan Rickman confirmed he died of cancer in London.\u00a0In the wake of the sad news, many fans of the actor and the\u00a0Harry Potter series shared a meme on social media with a quote attributed to Rickman:", "When I'm 80 years old\u00a0and\u00a0sitting in my rocking chair, I'll be reading Harry Potter. And my family will say to me \"After all this time?\"", "And I will say, \"Always.\"", "The quote referenced one of the most famous\u00a0moments in both the books and the films, during which Hogwarts' headmaster Albus Dumbledore confronts Professor Severus Snape (portrayed by Rickman) about his motives in protecting Harry Potter. In the film, Snape responded by conjuring his patronus (an animal that reflects the magician's personality, in his case a doe) and revealing that it mirrored the patronus of Potter's mother, Lily.\u00a0In the books (and films), Snape's patronus was dramatically revealed as proof of his enduring love for Harry's mother:", "The above-reproduced meme didn't originate upon Rickman's death in 2016.

However, a search of existing\u00a0interviews and other material revealed no instance in which\u00a0Rickman made any such statement, and the comments did not sound like anything Alan Rickman would have said.
