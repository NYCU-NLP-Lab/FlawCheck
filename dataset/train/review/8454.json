That means somebody voted twice, that means somebody who\u2019s not entitled to vote voted, an illegal, a person from another city or state, a person who\u2019s not registered, but what it means is that those are illegitimate votes. You don\u2019t have an overvote of 200% or 300%.\u201d", "A similar claim was earlier widespread in November.
