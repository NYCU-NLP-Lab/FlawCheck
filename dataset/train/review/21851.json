The month before Trump took office, among economists surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics only 8% were predicting a recession\u00a0any time in 2017, and their consensus prediction was that growth would accelerate to 2.2% in 2017.", "Four days after Trump took office, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast that under then-current law, economic\u00a0growth would be 2.3% in 2017\u00a0(which turned out to be exactly correct) and 2.0% in 2018.", "That would support a claim that Trump\u2019s tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks boosted the growth by 1 percentage point above expectations in 2018 before weakening in 2019.

The change would be small for most of those middle- and lower-income households.\u201d", "According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model \u2014 which estimates the Biden tax plan would raise between $3.1 trillion and $3.7 trillion over 10 years\u00a0 \u2014 middle-income earners would see their after-tax income decline by 0.4%, or $180, on average.", "\u201cTo explain a bit more: because the corporate income tax is remitted by corporations and not people, economists have to make some assumptions about which people ultimately bear the burden of that tax,\u201d Ricco said. \u201cWe assume that, in the long run, a quarter of the corporate income tax falls on workers in the form of lower wages. This figure is based on an extensive body of economic research, and government agencies like the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis use a similar assumption. So while those workers wouldn\u2019t literally be remitting more in taxes, over time they would end up shouldering some of the burden of the tax increase.\u201d", "A\u00a0Tax Foundation analysis\u00a0of Biden\u2019s tax plan similarly found that while the majority of the new tax burden would fall on the wealthiest Americans, \u201ctaxpayers in other income quintiles would also see a reduction in their after-tax income \u2026 mainly due to the increased tax burden on labor from higher corporate income taxes.\u201d", "\u201cMost of the effect of Biden\u2019s tax plan on those earning under $400,000 comes from the proposed corporate income tax increase and minimum corporate income tax,\u201d\u00a0Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, told us via email. \u201cThis would impact taxpayers under $400K both by reducing wage income as some of the corporate income tax is borne by workers, and through lower returns and valuations of corporate equities and related assets, which are owned by many taxpayers under $400K in retirement and taxable investment accounts.\u201d", "\u201cThere is a distinction between a direct tax increase \u2013 the amount of tax paid by taxpayers to the government \u2014 and the share of tax hikes that are ultimately borne by taxpayers in the form of lower incomes,\u201d Watson said. \u201cOur estimates show that many Americans under $400K would have lower-after tax incomes as a result of the proposals, but they would not necessarily have larger tax bills. We agree\u00a0with Penn Wharton\u00a0that the bottom 90% is unlikely to face any net tax hike outside of the indirect effects of the corporate tax hikes. With that in mind, it\u2019s more precise to say that Biden\u2019s plan would lower the incomes of 82 percent of Americans as a result of the tax changes, but not that it would generate a larger direct tax bill for those Americans.\u201d", "Comparing Biden\u2019s plan to the tax cuts championed by President Trump, Eric Trump\u00a0added\u00a0one of the\u00a0most repeated, and\u00a0most\u00a0fact-checked,\u00a0false claims\u00a0of the Trump presidency: that his father \u201cdelivered the largest tax cuts in American history.\u201d Despite the persistence of this claim, there have been more expensive tax laws in terms of percentage of gross domestic product and inflation-adjusted dollars.", "First Lady Melania Trump claimed that the president \u201chas built an administration with an unprecedented number of women in leadership roles.\u201d That\u2019s not backed up by available data.

The CDC website shows that the percentage of counties with available data also decreased for both years, and reporting of prescriptions changed in 2017 to reflect the number sold to patients, rather than dispensed prescriptions. \u201cThis change in measurement frame resulted in a 1.9% downward shift in the measured opioid prescriptions dispensed,\u201d the CDC page\u00a0explains. \u201cThus, caution should be exercised when examining trends during this time period.\u201d", "And as we\u2019ve\u00a0written, opioid prescribing has been falling for years.
