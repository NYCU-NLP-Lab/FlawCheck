["By Robert Farley", "Posted on July 12, 2019", "A TV ad from Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand accuses President Donald Trump of breaking his promise to protect and create manufacturing jobs. Despite some plant closures, there has been a net increase of nearly 500,000 manufacturing jobs on Trump\u2019s watch.", "Billed by her campaign as the first anti-Trump TV ad of the 2020 cycle, the ad comes in support of what Sen. Gillibrand is calling the \u201cTrump Broken Promises Tour\u201d in six cities in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan on July 11 and 12 to highlight, in part, what she says are the president\u2019s broken promises to residents there about manufacturing jobs. The campaign said it is spending five figures to air the ad on cable channels in those cities.", "\u201cHe promised to end bad trade deals and bring back manufacturing jobs, and failed,\u201d Gillibrand said on CNN on July 9.", "The ad begins with a clip of Trump at a rally in Warren, Michigan, on Oct. 31, 2016, saying, \u201cIf I\u2019m elected, you won\u2019t lose one plant, you\u2019ll have plants coming into this country. You\u2019re gonna have jobs again \u2026 I promise you.\u201d", "On the screen, it then says, \u201cTrump promised manufacturing jobs would stay but they\u2019re not.\u201d That claim is credited to an MSNBC segment on March 9 that carried that headline. The story is about the closing of a GM plant that manufactured the Chevy Cruze in Lordstown, Ohio. But viewers of the ad can\u2019t tell that the claim refers specifically to Lordstown. The ad leaves the false impression that U.S. manufacturing jobs overall have declined.", "The Gillibrand campaign points to other plant closings, including a Harley-Davidson plant in Kansas City, as well as GM and PPG Industries plants in Michigan.", "Trump certainly has exaggerated claims about his success in reviving U.S. manufacturing. And as we have written, U.S. manufacturing is not \u201cback,\u201d at least it is nowhere near where it was two decades ago. The industry lost more than 6 million jobs between 1998 and 2010. But the number of manufacturing jobs has been slowly growing ever since, according to data kept by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\u00a0and on average, at a faster clip under Trump than under President Barack Obama after the recession.", "After six years of growth, manufacturing job gains flattened in 2016 (with a net loss of about 16,000 jobs that year). But in Trump\u2019s first two years in office, manufacturing jobs grew by an average of about 19,000 new jobs per month. That pace of growth has slowed in 2019, but there has still been a net gain of 28,000 manufacturing jobs since January, nationwide. All told, the U.S. has added 486,000 manufacturing jobs since Trump took office.", "\u201cManufacturing has been one of the bright spots in the economy over the last couple years,\u201d Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, told us in a phone interview.", "Trump doesn\u2019t get all the credit though, Moutray said. The president\u2019s success has been due, in part, to a \u201ccoincidence of timing\u201d in which the global economy and the energy sector improved about the time he took office. \u201cThere was a non-political element to it [the growth in manufacturing jobs since 2017],\u201d Moutray said. But he also credits part of the rise to the tax cuts championed by Trump and the easing of regulations. That resulted in some optimism among manufacturing executives, he said.", "Manufacturing job growth has slowed this year \u2014 more certainty about tariffs would help, Moutray said\u00a0 \u2014 but is still positive. NAM expects 1.2 percent growth for the year, he said.", "\u201cThe manufacturing sector continues to plug along,\u201d Moutray said.", "\u201cManufacturing job growth is clearly slowing,\u201d Alliance for American Manufacturing President Scott Paul said in a press release on June 7. \u201cEconomic expansions don\u2019t last forever, but there are policy interventions that can boost demand and support new factory job creation. Now would be a good time to get a $2 trillion infrastructure plan back on track, and to secure a meaningful trade deal with China to rebalance that relationship.\u201d", "The Gillibrand campaign emphasizes that there have been manufacturing job losses in some specific areas targeted by Trump during his 2016 campaign, including areas of Ohio and Michigan.", "Indeed, the distribution of new manufacturing jobs has not been equal around the country. Research from the New York Federal Reserve published in February found that since the rebound in 2010, \u201cmuch of the Northeast and many parts of the Midwest saw their shares of the nation\u2019s manufacturing jobs decline, while auto alley, parts of the South, and much of the West Coast saw their shares increase.\u201d According to the report, the \u201cgains were especially large in \u2018auto alley\u2019\u2014a narrow motor vehicle production corridor stretching from Michigan south to Alabama\u2014while much of the Northeast continued to shed manufacturing jobs.\u201d", "Gillibrand\u2019s tour includes areas that have not fared as well. One of those stops will be Youngstown, Ohio, where as president, Trump talked about viewing closed factories from his car window, and vowed to the audience, \u201cThey\u2019re all coming back. They\u2019re all coming back. Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t sell your house. \u2026 We\u2019re going to get those values up. We\u2019re going to get those jobs coming back, and we\u2019re going to fill up those factories or rip them down and build brand new ones. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d", "And yet, in nearby Lordstown, Ohio, GM earlier this year began shutting down a plant, eliminating about 1,600 hourly positions. According to the New York Times, about 700 of those workers had taken positions at other GM factories as of May. GM has said that it plans to sell its Lordstown plant to Workhorse Group, an electric-vehicle start-up company, though it is unclear how many jobs could be created if the deal goes through.", "\u201cWhen President Trump went to manufacturing communities he made some straightforward promises that he broke,\u201d a Gillibrand senior advisor, Glen Caplin, told us via email. \u201cWhen he said companies wouldn\u2019t leave and would be punished \u2013 that wasn\u2019t true. When he said \u2018you won\u2019t lose one plant\u2019 \u2013 that wasn\u2019t true. When he said your jobs will stay \u2013 that wasn\u2019t true. The truth is simply that plants have been closed, jobs continue to be outsourced and manufacturing towns in the Rust Belt have been devastated under his watch \u2013 just ask\u00a0the over 1000 laid off GM workers and their families in Lordstown, Ohio.\u201d", "As another example, the Gillibrand campaign pointed to GM earlier this year eliminating nearly 1,300 jobs at the Warren Tech Center. That\u2019s where Trump made the speech used in the Gillibrand ad, in which he promised, \u201cIf I\u2019m elected, you won\u2019t lose one plant, you\u2019ll have plants coming into this country. You\u2019re gonna have jobs again.\u201d However, the same Detroit News article about the elimination of jobs at the Warren Tech Center also noted that GM\u2019s Cadillac brand would be moving to Warren.", "Pockets of the Rust Belt have shed manufacturing jobs. But BLS data show that while the rate of manufacturing job growth in Rust Belt states \u2014 Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 has lagged behind the national average, all of those states have seen positive net growth in manufacturing jobs under Trump.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
