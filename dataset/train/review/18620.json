["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "When some Democrats look at the federal budget plan proposed by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., it\u2019s as if they\u2019ve caught sight of a tiki bar at the end of a hot summer day.\n\nThey aren\u2019t envisioning fruity drinks with tiny umbrellas, but rather electoral victories. The Democrats see Ryan\u2019s plan, particularly its changes to Medicare, as distasteful to voters and therefore an advantage for their party.\n\nAs evidence, they point to Democrat Kathy Hochul\u2019s upset win in a western New York congressional race that was dominated by Ryan\u2019s Medicare plan. That special election was held May 24, 2011, less than two months after Ryan released his plan, which would convert Medicare into a \"premium-support payment\" program starting in 2022. \u00a0\n\nOn June 6, 2011, Wisconsin state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, was asked in an online chat how Ryan would affect elections on another level.\n\nPasch is running in a recall election against state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, who aims to retain a seat she has held since 1992. It is one of an unprecedented nine state senator recall elections that will be held in Wisconsin in July 2011.\n\nIn the chat, which was sponsored by Blue America, a political action committee that says it works to elect progressives, a questioner asked:\n\n\"I just read that (Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman) Mike Tate says that Paul Ryan will be a central focus in the recall elections. I hadn't heard that before. Will it work? Is it that connected in people's minds? Or is it too abstract for the average voter to make the connection?\"\n\nPasch, a second-term lawmaker who formerly worked as a nurse and nursing professor for 30 years, gave this response:\n\n\"I think that Paul Ryan is the face of the radical plan to dismantle Medicare and Medicaid. People across Wisconsin depend on and like Medicare. If you stand with Paul Ryan, you stand with the promise to end health care for our seniors. It's not just a policy issue, it's a values issue.\"\n\nSo, according to Pasch, Ryan promised to end health care for senior citizens.\n\nNo health care? That would be one stiff drink to swallow.\n\nBefore we assess Pasch\u2019s defense of her claim, a little background.\n\nRyan\u2019s budget -- passed by the GOP-controlled House, 235-193, but defeated in the Democrat-controlled Senate, 57-40 -- would make dramatic changes to Medicare if it ever became law.\n\nAs it exists now, Medicare is government health insurance for people age 65 and over and for people under 65 with certain disabilities. It helps pay for doctor visits, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, other services and prescription drugs.\n\nUnder Ryan\u2019s plan, people who turn 65 before 2022 would remain in traditional Medicare, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Those who turn 65 in 2022 or after, the budget office said, would get a \"premium support payment\" from Medicare. Rather than getting health insurance from the government, Medicare recipients would use the payment toward the cost of buying private health insurance.\n\nThat\u2019s a major change. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that future Medicare recipients \"would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system.\"\n\nBut when MoveOn.org declared that Ryan\u2019s budget \"abolishes Medicare within 10 years,\" the left-leaning political advocacy group earned a False from us, given that Medicare would change but not go away.\n\nOther critics, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, haven\u2019t gone as far, arguing instead that Ryan\u2019s plan would end Medicare \"as we know it.\" But when Wasserman Schultz also claimed that under Ryan\u2019s Medicare, insurance companies could \"deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions,\" she got a False from our colleagues at PolitiFact National.\n\nYet Pasch goes even further, claiming Ryan has promised to \"end health care for our seniors.\" Not just Medicare, but \"health care.\"\n\nNow to Pasch\u2019s defense.\n\nPasch\u2019s campaign manager, Phil Walzak, argued in an email to us that, under Ryan\u2019s proposal, Medicare recipients would \"lose a guaranteed set of health benefits\" because they would instead receive money to be used toward buying private health insurance. He also predicted that Medicare recipients would get fewer benefits even though they would be paying more for their health care. He cited analyses by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the National Academy of Social Insurance.\n\nFor her part, Pasch herself was more measured in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin than she was in the online chat, saying Ryan\u2019s plan \"is clearly a move toward not promising health care to seniors.\" She went on to say that as senior citizens are forced to pay more for health insurance, they will \"start neglecting their health care.\"\n\nIt\u2019s time for the tab from our political tiki bar.\n\nPasch originally claimed that Ryan promised to end health care for seniors and now she says his Medicare plan is a \"move toward not promising health care to seniors.\" That\u2019s quite a step back from the original claim. Moreover, we\u2019ve established that, although it\u2019s expected that senior citizens would pay more for health care under Ryan\u2019s plan, they would still have health care.\n\nAt PolitiFact, we have a name for the drink that\u2019s made by mixing false and ridiculous. It\u2019s called Pants on Fire, and that\u2019s what we rate Pasch\u2019s claim.", "Blue America, online chat, June 6, 2011\n\nPolitico.com, \"July 12: The next Ryan referendum?,\" June 6, 2011\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Ryan plan at nub of House election upset,\" May 25, 2011\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Recall elections set for 3 Democratic senators,\" June 8, 2011\n\nPolitiFact Wisconsin, \"MoveOn.org says proposed House Republican budget abolishes Medicare in 10 years,\" April 11, 2011\n\nEmail interview, House Budget Committee communications director Conor Sweeney, June 6 and 7, 2011\n\nU.S. House Budget Committee, \"The Path to Prosperity\" fiscal 2012 budget resolution, April 5, 2011\n\nWisconsin Legislature, Rep.
