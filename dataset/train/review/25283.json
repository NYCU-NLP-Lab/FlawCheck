At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion dollars on K-12 education each year,\" Trump said on Sept. 8, 2016. \"That\u2019s an average of about $12,296 dollars for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools. The federal government pays for about 10 percent of the K-12 costs. The other roughly $560 billion dollars spent on K -12 education comes from the states themselves. We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. And we\u2019re doing very poorly in terms of A-list.\"", "Back in January, Trump made a similar statement about U.S. education spending, saying we were \"No. 1 per-pupil by a factor of four.\" PolitiFact rated the statement Mostly False because it is exaggerated.", "This new claim is a bit more tempered.", "Does the United States spend more per student than other major countries?", "\"The question is, how do you define \u2018major?\u2019\"\u00a0said Neal McCluskey, director of the libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Educational Freedom.
