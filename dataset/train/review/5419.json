["By Brooks Jackson", "Posted on July 31, 2012 | Updated on May 14, 2016", "Q: Are Obama\u2019s early records \u201csealed\u201d?", "A: No. Many records that presidential candidates don\u2019t ordinarily release do remain confidential, but they are not \u201csealed\u201d by a court. The 16 claims in a widely distributed graphic are mostly false or distorted.", "FULL QUESTION", "Is this true?", "Subj: What?", "\u2026and they want 12 years of Romney\u2019s tax returns? THIS should be on billboards all over our nation!", "Forward this to others who are interested in re-claiming America and saving our future", "FULL ANSWER", "This is an example of mostly old baloney in a new casing. It mainly recycles years-old falsehoods and insinuations, most of which we covered long ago, in connection with an earlier viral email.", "But with President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign heating up, this new graphic has appeared on countless anti-Obama websites and in viral emails like the one we\u2019ve reprinted here. Very little that it contains is new, and the old falsehoods have not improved with age.", "Nothing \u2018Sealed\u2019", "The idea that any Obama record is \u201csealed\u201d is a falsehood, to start. The word \u201csealed\u201d when applied to documents ordinarily refers to records that would normally be public, but that a judge has ruled cannot be released without the court\u2019s permission. Common examples of truly \u201csealed\u201d documents include records of crimes committed as a juvenile or records of adoptions. None of the claims in this message refers to records actually \u201csealed\u201d in that usual sense.", "In some cases, the records this screed claims are \u201csealed\u201d are actually public, and open for anyone to see. Other supposedly \u201csealed\u201d records are normally private documents that Obama hasn\u2019t released \u2014 and that other presidential candidates haven\u2019t released either.", "So as with earlier versions, this is little more than an attempt to raise suspicions by asking for records that aren\u2019t ordinarily made public, without any evidence that those records contain anything derogatory. We\u2019ll take the claims and questions in the order they appear.", "Other Claims", "Besides the numbered claims, the graphic also states that Obama has been endorsed by the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). It\u2019s true that the Communist Party USA supports Obama. It claims to have about 2,000 members. Obama didn\u2019t seek the CPUSA endorsement, nor has he endorsed that group.", "The graphic also attributes three quotes to Obama, all of which are commonly offered on conservative websites. All the quotes are accurate. Here\u2019s the background:", "In summary, there are bits here that are true. But most is wrong or misleading, and overall the graphic falls far short of getting our seal of approval for accuracy.
