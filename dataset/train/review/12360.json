["A sign marking the entrance to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention building in Atlanta is shown on Oct. 8, 2013. (AP/Goldman)", "The CDC report showed a correlation between testing positive for the coronavirus and going to bars and restaurants, where masks can\u2019t be effectively worn. That counters Carlson\u2019s claim that the July cases were \u201cwearing a mask\u201d and \u201cinfected anyway.\u201d", "The CDC report did not assess the impact of mask wearing on getting the coronavirus, and the study\u2019s authors said the participants might not be representative of the U.S. The study dealt with 154 people who tested positive in July, not all the positive cases in July.", "Masks are most effective as \"source control,\" preventing infected people from transmitting the virus. Experts say they offer the wearer some \u2014 but not total \u2014 protection.", "Fox News host Tucker Carlson misrepresented the findings of a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, amplifying misinformation from social media as he claimed on his TV show that the study showed masks don\u2019t work like experts say.", "Running through a series of data points listed in the CDC\u2019s report, Carlson said during his Oct. 13 show: \"Almost everyone \u2014 85% \u2014 who got the coronavirus in July was wearing a mask, and they were infected anyway. So clearly this doesn't work the way they tell us it works.\"", "The Fox News host\u2019s take ran counter to comments he\u00a0made in April touting the effectiveness of masks. It also contradicted the guidance of public health officials, who say mask wearing on a broad scale can slow the spread of the coronavirus.", "Carlson\u2019s misleading claim about the CDC study appeared to make its way to President Donald Trump, a frequent Fox News watcher and guest.", "\"Did you see, the CDC, that 85% of the people wearing the masks catch it, OK?\" Trump said during an Oct. 15 rally in Greenville, N.C.", "The data in the CDC report, however, cannot be generalized to say \"almost everyone\" who wore a mask in July got the coronavirus. It\u2019s from a very small sample the authors said\u00a0may not be representative of the United States, and mask use was self-reported. The report does not say masks don\u2019t work to slow the spread of COVID-19.", "The CDC paper summarizes findings from a survey of 314 people. The total included a group of 154 symptomatic people who tested positive for the coronavirus in July and a control group of 160 symptomatic people who tested negative for the coronavirus in July.", "Based on the results of the survey, the CDC report said two activities were linked to a positive coronavirus test: close contact with someone who also tested positive, and going to locations with on-site eating and drinking options, such as bars and restaurants.", "RELATED: No, masks don't collect the coronavirus", "Of the 160 survey participants who tested negative, 74.2% said they \"always\" wore a mask or face covering and 14.5% said they \"often\" did so.", "Of the 154 survey participants who tested positive, 70.6% said they \"always\" wore a mask or face covering and 14.4% said they \"often\" did so. Those numbers form the basis of Carlson\u2019s claim that 85% of people \"who got the coronavirus in July (were) wearing a mask.\"", "A Fox News spokesperson pointed to those figures and a segment from Carlson\u2019s show the following night. In the segment, Carlson addressed a statement he said the CDC made to Fox News. Carlson said the agency called his commentary on the September study \"misleading.\"", "\"CDC guidance on masks has clearly stated that wearing a mask is intended to protect other people in case the mask wearer is infected,\" the CDC said in the statement. \"At no time has CDC guidance suggested that masks were intended to protect the wearers.\"", "Carlson told viewers the CDC didn\u2019t address his original claim. \"The spokesman didn\u2019t dispute that we had showed accurate data from the CDC, including that 85% of people who tested positive for coronavirus in July reported wearing a mask always or often,\" Carlson said.", "But the CDC study wasn\u2019t measuring the impact of masks. \"Participants were asked about mask use as an individual behavior,\" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald told PolitiFact. \"However, the aim of the study was to assess possible situations for community exposure, not mask use.\"", "It\u2019s misleading to leap to conclusions about the effectiveness of masks from the CDC report, since most participants reported wearing them and the study was not controlling for mask use.", "\"You can\u2019t just look at a table and draw conclusions without understanding the details of the study,\" said Cindy Prins, an epidemiologist with the University of Florida.", "\"It is difficult to detect the effect of an exposure or intervention when it is widely deployed or used,\" McDonald added. He said both groups of participants had high levels of mask use, and that the rates of people who always wore a mask in each group were not \"statistically different.\"", "The study did find a significant difference between the groups: whether participants went out for food or drink. The study authors wrote that those with positive test results were \"approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant\" than those who tested negative.", "The link between restaurants and catching the coronavirus is important to Carlson\u2019s claim, since most people lower their masks to sip their drink or eat their food. \"Restaurants and coffee shops are places where people will tend to not wear a mask,\" Prins said.", "The study\u2019s authors noted that masks \"cannot be effectively worn while eating and drinking.\" But Carlson claimed that 85% of July cases were \"wearing a mask\" and \"infected anyway.\"", "\"Going to places where mask use and social distancing cannot be maintained might be an important risk factor for COVID-19,\" McDonald said.", "Carlson\u2019s comment also ignored limitations listed in the study. The people were surveyed at 11 health care facilities, where they\u2019d all sought testing because they were experiencing symptoms. So they \"might not be representative of the United States population,\" the study\u2019s authors wrote.", "Ben Neuman, a virologist with Texas A&M University, Texarkana, also took issue with the survey\u2019s reliance on the participants\u2019 self-reporting of their own mask use.", "\"There are certain things that are embarrassing or politically and socially sensitive, and you generally won\u2019t get honest answers if you just ask them on a questionnaire,\" Neuman said.", "Carlson\u2019s claim also mischaracterized the science behind masks. While masks do provide some protection for wearers, experts and public health officials say they are most effective as \"source control,\" preventing infected people from transmitting the virus.", "\"When a person who is infected with COVID-19 wears a mask, it helps to reduce the amount of virus that they release when they cough, talk, or even breathe,\" Prins said.", "The CDC recommends wearing masks in public and when social distancing isn\u2019t possible.", "Neuman previously shared three studies with PolitiFact that found wearing masks reduces the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. Other studies have said the same.", "\"Growing evidence increasingly shows that wearing masks in community settings reduces transmission among individuals in that community,\" McDonald said. \"There are laboratory studies, animal studies, community and epidemiological studies, as well as policy studies that show masking reduces transmission in communities by blocking exhaled respiratory droplets.\"", "The Fox News spokesperson cited CDC Director Robert Redfield\u2019s September testimony as an example of how mask wearing \"doesn\u2019t work the way they tell us it works,\" as Carlson claimed. Redfield touted the effectiveness of masks relative to a potential coronavirus vaccine.", "\"I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine,\" Redfield said in a clip Carlson played on his show.", "But Redfield never said that masks only protect the wearer \u2014 or that they offer complete and total protection in that regard. He was comparing masks to a potential early vaccine, which he said wouldn\u2019t necessarily guarantee an immune response.", "\"He was suggesting if everyone around him wore a mask, he would be protected until a vaccine became available,\" McDonald said.", "The CDC has been clear elsewhere that masks help keep infected people from passing the virus to others. The CDC\u2019s website, for example, says masks help \"prevent a person who is sick from spreading the virus to others.\" It adds: \"The protective effects \u2014 how well the mask protects healthy people from breathing in the virus \u2014 are unknown.\"", "Carlson said that according to a recent CDC report, \"Almost everyone \u2014 85% \u2014 who got the coronavirus in July was wearing a mask, and they were infected anyway. So clearly this doesn't work the way they tell us it works.\"", "Carlson didn\u2019t pull the 85% figure out of thin air, but the conclusion he drew\u00a0is wrong in multiple ways. For starters, the CDC report wasn\u2019t designed to measure mask effectiveness, and the study\u2019s authors said the participants might not be representative of the U.S.", "The findings don\u2019t prove masks are ineffective, either. Masks are most effective at preventing infected people from spreading the virus, and studies show they can help slow the spread.", "The correlation the CDC found between positive coronavirus tests and going to restaurants and bars suggests that taking masks off to eat or drink might increase risk.", "We rate Carlson\u2019s statement False.", "Tucker Carlson Tonight on Facebook, \"CDC Masks Study: Most Corona Patients Still Got The Virus,\" Oct. 13, 2020", "Fox News, \"Tucker Carlson responds to CDC after agency critiques commentary about mask-wearing,\" Oct. 14, 2020", "CDC on Twitter, Oct. 14, 2020", "Fox News, \"Tucker Carlson: The cult of mask-wearing grows, with no evidence they work,\" Oct. 13, 2020", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"Community and Close Contact Exposures Associated with COVID-19 Among Symptomatic Adults \u226518 Years in 11 Outpatient Health Care Facilities \u2014 United States, July 2020,\" Sept. 11, 2020", "Health Feedback, \"Mask use does not lead to a higher risk of COVID-19 as viral social media posts claim,\" Oct. 12, 2020", "PolitiFact, \"No, masks don't collect the coronavirus,\" Oct. 13, 2020", "PolitiFact, \"No, a CDC-WHO study does not prove that masks do not prevent spread of COVID-19,\" July 31, 2020", "PolitiFact, \"Fact-checking a video that claims masks \u2018ain\u2019t going to do anything for you,'\" July 10, 2020", "PolitiFact, \"NC Republican wrongfully says masks 'do not work,'\" July 9, 2020", "PolitiFact, \"Video shows outdated face mask guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci,\" July 8, 2020", "PolitiFact, \"No, OSHA does not say that 'masks don\u2019t work' against COVID-19,\" June 25, 2020", "PolitiFact, \"Masks for COVID-19 are effective, as a six-part Facebook takedown fails,\" June 12, 2020", "PolitiFact, \"Face masks, including homemade ones, are effective COVID-19 protection, experts say,\" May 18, 2020", "Email interviews with Jason McDonald, spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Oct. 14, 2020, and Oct. 15, 2020", "Email interview with Cindy Prins, assistant dean for educational affairs at the University of Florida College of Public Health and clinical associate professor of epidemiology, Oct. 15, 2020", "Statement from Fox News, Oct. 15, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
