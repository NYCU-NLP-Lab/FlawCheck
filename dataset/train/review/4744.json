["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on August 25, 2020", "Facebook posts falsely claim that under Joe Biden, the \u201ctax rate on a family making 75000 dollars would go from 12% to 25%.\u201d Biden\u2019s proposal does not call for a tax increase on those making less than $400,000, though analysts say an increased corporate tax rate could effectively result in a small tax increase for middle-income earners.", "Former Vice President Joe Biden has outlined a tax policy proposal that has been the subject of distortions before.", "A claim now circulating on Facebook is falsely telling users that, if the Democratic presidential nominee wins the election, the \u201ctax rate on a family making 75000 dollars would go from 12% to 25%.\u201d", "Currently, the 12% rate applies to individuals making between $9,875 and $40,125 \u2014 and married joint-filers earning between $19,750 and $80,250, according to the IRS. So the 12% rate does apply to a \u201cfamily making 75000,\u201d as the Facebook post suggests.", "But Biden\u2019s plan does not call for a tax hike on those earners.", "As we\u2019ve explained before, Biden\u2019s tax plan includes provisions such as imposing a payroll tax on earnings over $400,000; increasing the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%; and restoring a top income tax rate of 39.6% for income above $400,000. It says nothing about raising the 12% bracket for individual taxpayers.", "That said, independent analyses do indicate Biden\u2019s policies could effectively result in small tax raises on middle-income earners, assuming that employers pass a portion of the increased tax burden onto workers. But those estimates are nowhere near the magnitude alleged in the Facebook post.", "Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, confirmed to us in an email that the Facebook post is wrong.", "Smetters is the faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, whose\u00a0analysis of Biden\u2019s plan estimated that households reporting $75,000 income would see an after-tax income reduction of 0.4% in 2021 \u2014 again, not as the result of a direct tax increase, but because of the increased corporate tax rate.", "The Tax Policy Center also estimated that households making $75,000 would see an average after-tax income reduction of 0.4% due to the corporate tax increase; the estimate assumes that 20% of the corporate tax increase would fall on workers.", "\u201cIn 2021, the proposals would increase taxes on average on all income groups, but the highest-income households would see substantially larger increases, both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes,\u201d the center noted. \u201c[Biden\u2019s] plan would raise taxes on households in the top 1 percent of the income distribution (those with income more than $837,000) by an average of about $299,000, or 17.0 percent of after-tax income. By contrast, taxpayers in the middle-income quintile (those with income between about $52,000 and $93,000) would experience an average tax increase of just $260, or 0.4 percent of after-tax income. Taxpayers in the bottom quintile (those with income less than $26,000) would see an average tax increase of only $30, or 0.2 percent of after-tax income.\u201d", "The center added that, \u201c[i]n total, almost 93 percent of the tax increases would be borne by taxpayers in the top quintile of the income distribution.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
