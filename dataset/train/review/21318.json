["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on August 10, 2018", "Q: Did France pass \u201ca law saying having sex with a child is okay\u201d?", "A: No. The country already didn\u2019t have a legal consent age. The new law makes it easier to file rape charges against adults who have sex with those 15 or younger.", "Saw a post on fb (I know, so it must be true, right? Ha!) About France passing a law saying having sex with a child is okay. Research showed not true. Please post so I can blow this crazy woman out of the water for posting false information.", "French law doesn\u2019t include a legal age of consent for sex \u2014 an established norm in many Western countries. But that doesn\u2019t mean that \u201chaving sex with a child is okay.\u201d", "France has had a law on the books that made it illegal to have sex with someone who is 15 or younger \u2014 an offense that was punishable by five years of imprisonment and a fine of 75,000 euros.", "Last week, the French Parliament gave final approval to legislation that increased those penalties to seven years of imprisonment and a\u00a0fine of 100,000 euros. The new law also makes it easier to bring rape charges against an adult who has sex with a child 15 years old or younger \u2014 a crime that can lead to\u00a0imprisonment of 20 years.", "But the new law did not include a proposed formal age of consent \u2014 a failure that has sparked much criticism and confusion. Multiple readers have asked us whether the country actually passed a law that made it acceptable for children to have sex with adults.", "That may be in part because of misleading information shared online.", "A viral Your News Wire story\u00a0\u2014 headlined \u201cFrance Passes Law Saying Children Can Consent To Sex With Adults\u201d \u2014 began by saying that \u201cPresident Macron\u2019s government has voted against having an age of consent in France.\u201d", "\u201cFederal law in France now has\u00a0no legal age of consent,\u201d the Aug. 4 story adds.", "That\u2019s inaccurate. The country didn\u2019t have a consent age before the new law \u2014 and the measure passed didn\u2019t include language about a consent age. So the government didn\u2019t vote \u201cagainst\u201d one.", "Instead, the new law gives prosecutors more grounds to bring rape charges against an adult having sex with a child. It also penalizes street harassment.", "Under the existing law, there is no language that says outright that sex with a minor is rape. Cases of rape\u00a0must involve \u201cviolence, coercion, threat or surprise\u201d (though a 2010 law stipulated that moral coercion, or \u201cla contrainte morale,\u201d can result from the age difference between a minor and the perpetrator).", "The\u00a0new law, however, broadens what constitutes rape when an adult has sex with someone 15-years-old or younger. Specifically, it says that the coercion and surprise factors can be characterized by the \u201cabuse of the vulnerability,\u201d if the victim did not have \u201cthe necessary discernment for these acts.\u201d Judges will decide whether or not the victim was capable of giving consent, the Associated Press reported, and prosecution of such cases will be permitted for 30 years \u2014 instead of 20 \u2014 after the victim turns 18.", "Regardless of the issue of consent, French law does already penalize the\u00a0offense, or\u00a0infraction, of having sex with someone 15 or younger. And the new law upgraded penalties for such abuse to seven years imprisonment and a\u00a0fine of 100,000 euros.", "The rape of a minor, on the other hand, can lead to\u00a0imprisonment\u00a0of 20 years.", "The new law also\u00a0suggests that other sex offense charges can be raised if the\u00a0\u201cexistence of violence or coercion, threat or surprise\u201d \u2014 the basis of a rape charge \u2014 \u201cwas disputed during the proceedings.\u201d", "France had considered setting a legal age of consent at 15 \u2014\u00a0prompted by high-profile cases in which men who had sex with minors were not convicted of, or initially charged with, rape. While an early draft of the bill included such language, Reuters reported, officials retreated from that plan following concerns that the measure would be deemed unconstitutional.", "The failed attempt to set an age of consent disappointed\u00a0women\u2019s rights advocates.", "\u201cIf you do not make it extremely clear in a legal text that it is by default rape, it leaves it up to judges and up to courts to decide,\u201d\u00a0women\u2019s rights activist Nikita Blanes told Deutsche Welle, a German public broadcaster.", "The Your News Wire story, however, claimed France was \u201cthe latest nation to give in to pressure from an international network of liberal activists determined to normalize pedophilia and decriminalize sex with children across the world.\u201d", "The website, known for posting false information, mixed some accurate details with misleading and incorrect statements.", "The story, for example, claimed that \u201csupport for the European motion also exists in the United States,\u201d and quoted a supposed University of Michigan cultural anthropologist named Thomas Black. But we could find no record of that person at the university. The chair of the university\u2019s anthropology department, Andrew Shryock, told us that there is no one by that name currently active in the department.", "The piece garnered almost 150,000 interactions on Facebook, including nearly 20,000 shares, according to CrowdTangle data. It was also posted on other websites and cited in a 4chan thread titled, \u201cFrance Legalizes Child Rape.\u201d", "The Your News Wire story was given added attention when Judith Collins, a member of the New Zealand Parliament,\u00a0shared a link to the story on Twitter \u2014 prompting some to\u00a0criticize her\u00a0for sharing \u201cfake news.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.", "Corbet, Sylvie. \u201cFines for Sex Harassment on Streets Approved in France.\u201d Associated Press. 1 Aug 2018.", "\u201cFrance Passes Law Saying Children Can Consent To Sex With Adults.\u201d Your News Wire. 4 Aug 2018.", "Reinforcing the fight against sexual and sexist violence.\u00a0Law 2018-703. 3 Aug 2018.", "Shryock, Andrew.
