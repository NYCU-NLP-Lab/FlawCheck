The patties get their flavor from heme, an iron-rich molecule found in meat and plants that sparked some controversy but was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration.", "According to the Washington Post, the company\u2019s heme \"is made by taking the DNA from the roots of soy plants, inserting it into genetically engineered yeast and then fermenting that yeast.\"", "Other companies are even more lab-oriented.

He said he had invested in both and that their products will contribute to a \"dramatic reduction in methane emissions, animal cruelty, manure management and the pressure that meat consumption puts on land use.\"", "He\u2019s made similar points on his personal blog, GatesNotes, writing in one post that a rising population requires more food and that farming livestock can take a toll on the environment and require increased deforestation to make room for the animals.", "Livestock are responsible for 14.5% of greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.", "\"Raising meat takes a great deal of land and water and has a substantial environmental impact,\" Gates wrote in a 2013 blog post. \"Put simply, there\u2019s no way to produce enough meat for (a future population of) 9 billion people.
