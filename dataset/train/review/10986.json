["About this rating", "In April 2018, videos appeared purporting to show evidence of the toxicity of store-bought foods by peeling a layer of what appears to be plastic off leaves of lettuce. The claims have periodically resurfaced online for years:", "Although the video has been shared and seen by tens of thousands of people on social media, it doesn't, in fact, depict plastic peeling off lettuce leaves. Instead it shows evidence of a known agricultural phenomenon called epidermal peeling \u2014 a harmless side effect of cold weather.", "Much like a skin blister, epidermal peeling occurs when romaine lettuce, a majority of which is grown in Arizona, is exposed to freezing temperatures causing the leaves form a protective layer, which can then be peeled off. A farmer in Yuma, Arizona explains the process here:", "The phenomenon, although familiar to food growers, serves as a periodic subject of conspiratorial videos that purport to show how the food industry is nefariously poisoning the public, as evidenced by a 2012 blog post by organic food grocer Albert's Fresh Produce:", "There is a video circulating on the internet showing romaine lettuce with what appears to be a \u201cplastic coating\u201d peeling off the lettuce. We have received quite a few inquiries about this and wanted to address the concern. This \u201ccoating\u201d is actually the \u201cEpidermal or Skin Layer\u201d of the lettuce and \u201cnot plastic\u201d, which is why consumers of both organic and conventionally grown product have noticed the affect. It has nothing to do with anything that has been applied externally to the product.", "So why does this coating occur? During the winter season, romaine lettuce is grown in Yuma Arizona. During the months of December through February the Yuma growing region can easily see sub-freezing nights with temperatures reaching into the low twenties. This will cause the outer skin of romaine lettuce to experience a type of \u201cfreeze burn\u201d which results in a \u201cblistering\u201d of the skin, much like what would happen if human skin experienced a burn.", "The claims were likely re-ignited on social media by people searching out more information after major warnings appeared in mid-April 2018 about romaine lettuce that had been contaminated with E. coli.", "Weinstein, Sincha.\u00a0\"A Coating on Romaine Lettuce?\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0AlbertsOrganics.com.\u00a010 February 2012.", "Blake, Cary.\u00a0\"Freeze Damages Winter Lettuce Crop, Prices Soar.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Western Farm Press.\u00a024 April 2018.", "Karst, Tom.\u00a0\"California Vegetable Markets Spike With Cold Snap.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The Packer.\u00a01 March 2018.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
