["By Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on May 30, 2019", "In an impromptu press conference and on Twitter, President Donald Trump responded to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s remarks about the Russia investigation with several false and questionable claims:", "Mueller spoke publicly\u00a0on May 29 for the first time about the special counsel\u2019s investigation. The former FBI director\u00a0reiterated the key findings of his report, which was issued on April 18, and elaborated a bit on why he did not make a determination on whether Trump had obstructed the federal investigation.", "The\u00a0Mueller report\u00a0said investigators \u201cfound multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations.\u201d However, the report said it could not make a \u201ctraditional prosecutorial judgment,\u201d\u00a0because the department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel had issued\u00a0an opinion\u00a0that states an \u201cindictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President\u201d would be unconstitutional.", "\u201cBecause we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President\u2019s conduct,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe evidence we obtained about the President\u2019s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making a traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d", "In his May 29 remarks, Mueller reiterated that his report did not clear the president on the issue of obstruction.\u00a0\u201c[A]s set forth in the report\u00a0after that investigation, if we\u00a0had had confidence that the\u00a0president clearly did not commit\u00a0a crime, we would have said so,\u201d Mueller said.", "Trump responded to questions about Mueller\u2019s remarks\u00a0shortly before leaving the White House for Colorado to deliver a commencement address at the Air Force Academy.", "Trump was asked about the possibility of the Democratic-controlled House seeking to impeach him based on Mueller\u2019s report, which detailed 11 \u201ckey events\u201d of possible obstruction of justice.\u00a0Trump suggested that he could not be impeached because he hasn\u2019t been charged with a crime and the courts may not allow it.", "Reporter, May 30:\u00a0Do you think they\u2019re going to impeach you? Do you think they\u2019re \u2013.", "Trump: I don\u2019t see how. They can, because they\u2019re possibly allowed, although I can\u2019t imagine the courts allowing it. I\u2019ve never got into it. I never thought that would even be possible to be using that word. To me, it\u2019s a dirty word, the word impeach. It\u2019s a dirty, filthy, disgusting word and it had nothing to do with me.", "So, I don\u2019t think so, because there was no crime. You know it\u2019s high crimes and, not with or or, it\u2019s high crimes and misdemeanors. There was no high crime and there was no misdemeanor, so how do you impeach based on that?", "Trump was referring to Article 2, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, which states in full: \u201cThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d", "Constitutional scholars told us that Trump is wrong to suggest that a statutory crime is required for the House to bring impeachment charges and it is very unlikely that the courts would get involved in impeachment proceedings.", "\u201cThe President is wrong on both counts,\u201d\u00a0Neil Kinkopf, a professor of law at Georgia State University\u2019s College of Law.", "First it is worth nothing that Mueller said \u201ccharging the president with a\u00a0crime was \u2026 not an\u00a0option we could consider,\u201d because of the OLC opinion \u2014 which states that an \u201cindictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President\u201d would be unconstitutional.\u201d", "Regardless, Kinkopf and others we consulted with said that the framers of the Constitution meant impeachment to serve as a political remedy to remove federal officials from office for subverting the system of government \u2014 not necessarily for violating criminal statutes.", "\u201cThe phrase \u2018treason, bribery or other\u00a0high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019 does not refer to statutorily codified crimes,\u201d Kinkopf said. \u201cRather, the catchall \u2018other high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019 is meant to be open-ended and to refer to all misconduct that is harmful to the nation in a manner similar to \u2018treason and bribery\u2019 even if it does not meet the technical requirements of the current version of the federal criminal code.\u201d", "Philip Bobbitt, a law professor at the University of Texas, referred us to\u00a0Alexander Hamilton\u2019s Federalist No. 65, which states that the subjects of impeachments \u201care of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\u201d\u00a0(The Federalists Papers were published in New York to urge the state to ratify the proposed Constitution.)", "\u201cThe president seems to be confusing \u2018High Crimes\u2019 which are political offenses, see Federalist #65, with ordinary crimes and perhaps also confusing the term \u2018misdemeanor\u2019 with the common understanding of this as a minor offense,\u201d Bobbitt said.", "After President Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of Watergate, the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1974 published a report on the grounds for presidential impeachment that said\u00a0the phrase \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanors \u2026\u00a0has a special historical meaning different from the ordinary meaning of the terms \u2018crimes\u2019 and \u2018misdemeanors.'\u201d", "\u201c\u2018High Misdemeanors\u2019 referred to a category of offenses that subverted the system of government,\u201d the committee report said. \u201cSince the fourteenth century the phrase \u2018high Crimes and Misdemeanors\u2019 had been used in English impeachment cases to charge officials with a wide range of criminal and non-criminal offenses against the institutions and fundamental principles of English government.\u201d", "As for Trump\u2019s claim that the courts would bar Congress from impeaching him, Princeton University political professor\u00a0Keith E. Whittington called it \u201cvery unlikely.\u201d", "\u201cThe precise question of whether a court could review a congressional judgment that a particular offense is within the scope of the constitutional impeachment power has never been tested,\u201d Whittington told us. \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court has held that other aspects of the impeachment power are political questions entrusted to the sole discretion of Congress to resolve, and it seems very unlikely that the Court would intervene in the context of a presidential impeachment.\u201d", "Whittington referred us to an essay he wrote after Trump made a similar claim last month. In his essay, Whittington referred to a Supreme Court ruling involving the impeachment and conviction\u00a0of Federal District\u00a0Judge Walter Nixon. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected his appeal.", "\u201cThe parties do not offer evidence of a single word in the history of the Constitutional Convention or in contemporary commentary that even alludes to the possibility of judicial review in the context of the impeachment powers,\u201d the court said in its opinion.", "Trump also claimed that he could not be guilty of obstruction of justice because he was not guilty of an underlying crime \u2014 specifically the special counsel\u2019s office found that Trump did not conspire with Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.", "But Mueller, in his report, and again in his public statement on May 29, explained that it is possible to be guilty of obstruction even if one has been cleared of the underlying crime that gave rise to an investigation.", "According to Trump, Mueller \u201csaid, essentially, \u2018You\u2019re innocent.\u2019\u00a0 I\u2019m innocent of all charges.\u00a0And, you know, the thing that nobody brings up: There was no crime.\u00a0 They\u2019re saying \u2018he\u2019s obstructing something\u2019 and there was no crime.\u00a0 And nobody brings it up.\u201d", "Trump made similar arguments\u00a0shortly before his press conference, when he tweeted: \u201cIt was a crime that didn\u2019t exist. So now the Dems and their partner, the Fake News Media \u2026. say he fought back against this phony crime that didn\u2019t exist, this horrendous false accusation, and he shouldn\u2019t fight back, he should just sit back and take it. Could this be Obstruction? No, Mueller didn\u2019t find Obstruction either.\u201d", "In his comments, Mueller said his investigation concluded there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy\u201d between the Russians who sought to influence the election and the Trump campaign. But he did not clear Trump on obstruction of justice.", "\u201cIf we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,\u201d Mueller said in his remarks. \u201cWe did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.\u201d", "Mueller also explained the importance of an obstruction investigation.", "\u201cThe matters we investigated were of paramount importance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was critical for us to obtain full and accurate information from every person we questioned. When a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of their government\u2019s effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable.\u201d", "In the written special counsel report, Mueller explained that proof of an underlying crime is \u201cnot an element of an obstruction offense.\u201d", "Mueller cited the case United States vs. Greer, in which a federal circuit judge concluded, \u201cobstruction of a criminal investigation is punishable even if the prosecution is ultimately unsuccessful or even if the investigation ultimately reveals no underlying crime.\u201d", "So why would someone obstruct an investigation if they had done nothing illegal? And if they did, why would investigators care?", "\u201cObstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area, or to avoid personal embarrassment,\u201d the Mueller report states. \u201cThe injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.\u201d", "\u201cIn this investigation,\u201d the report states, \u201cthe evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the evidence does point to a range of other possible personal motives animating the President\u2019s conduct. These include concerns that continued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential uncertainty about whether certain events \u2014 such as advance notice of WikiLeaks\u2019s release of hacked information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians \u2014 could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family.\u201d", "Although Attorney General William Barr concluded after reading Mueller\u2019s report that \u201cthe evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,\u201d it is something that Congress could consider in impeachment hearings. In his remarks May 29, Mueller said that one reason for laying out the evidence for obstruction is that the Constitution provides \u201ca process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.\u201d", "At one point, Trump made an apples-to-oranges comparison of his situation to that of former President Bill Clinton.", "Trump, May 30:\u00a0There were no charges.\u00a0 None.\u00a0 If you look at \u2014 if you look at Bill Clinton, that very nice gentleman who\u2019s been so much on my side, as you know, his special prosecutor \u2014 it was guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.\u00a0 So many guiltys.\u00a0 With me, there was no guilty.", "Trump is referring to independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who led a four-year investigation of Clinton, including the president\u2019s sexual affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Starr did not issue a criminal indictment of Clinton; in the report on his investigation, Starr said there was \u201csubstantial and credible information supporting \u2026 eleven possible grounds for impeachment\u201d by Congress, including several examples of perjury and obstruction of justice.", "Clinton was\u00a0impeached by the House of Representatives, but he was acquitted by the Senate \u2014 meaning he was ultimately not found \u201cguilty.\u201d", "The impeachment recommendation to Congress, however, was an authority specifically granted to independent counsels, such as Starr, under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. The independent counsel statute of that law expired in June 1999.", "Mueller was appointed as \u201cspecial counsel\u201d in 2017. In that role, he did not have the same authority, Kimberly Wehle, a University of Baltimore law professor, told us in an email.", "\u201cStarr was under a separate statute, which expired,\u201d she said. \u201cMueller was under an internal DOJ regulation. Totally different legal regimes. Starr was required to report to Congress. Mueller was required to report to Barr.\u201d", "Kinkopf told us the \u201cregs setting up the position of Special Counsel and defining the report that the Special Counsel would produce were specifically in response to the perceived abuses of the Starr Report \u2014 particularly its partisan tone and gratuitous forays into salacious detail.\u201d", "The Justice Department regulation covering special counsels says they have \u201cthe authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses; and to conduct appeals arising out of the matter being investigated and/or prosecuted.\u201d", "But, on the matter of obstruction, Mueller said in his report that he decided not to make \u201ca traditional prosecutorial judgment\u201d about Trump, in part, because of a DOJ legal opinion that says \u201cthe indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions\u201d in violation of \u201cthe constitutional separation of powers.\u201d", "Still, in considering whether the president may have committed obstruction of justice, Mueller himself examined 11 \u201ckey events,\u201d which we have written about before.", "\u201cOur investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations,\u201d Mueller wrote. \u201cThe incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels. These actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney General\u2019s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony.\u201d", "In his public remarks on May 29, Mueller said that one reason for laying out the evidence for obstruction is that the Constitution provides \u201ca process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.\u201d", "That \u201ctiptoes pretty close to an impeachment referral and is at the very least an invitation to further Congressional investigation,\u201d Bobbitt told us. \u201cI think that is as far as the Special Counsel felt he could go; he certainly was not authorized by the governing regs to recommend an impeachment.\u201d", "Trump also repeated some false and misleading claims about Mueller and the investigation, including his insistence that the special counsel was \u201ctotally conflicted\u201d \u2014 a charge that even one of Trump\u2019s own advisers warned him was \u201cridiculous.\u201d", "Trump has long claimed that Mueller should not have been appointed special counsel due to alleged conflicts of interest \u2014 claims we most recently dealt with in our April 19 story, \u201cDebunking Mueller\u2019s \u2018Conflicts.\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s claim hinges on two main allegations: that Mueller wanted the job of FBI director but the president turned him down; and that Mueller had a \u201cbusiness dispute\u201d over membership fees when Mueller left a country club owned by Trump. The special counsel report, however, undermines both of those claims.", "Here\u2019s how the president put it on May 30:", "Trump, May 30:\u00a0I think he\u2019s totally conflicted.\u00a0 Because, as you know, he wanted to be the FBI Director, and I said no.\u00a0 As you know, I had a business dispute with him.\u00a0 After he left the FBI, we had a business dispute.\u00a0 Not a nice one.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t happy with what I did, and I don\u2019t blame him.\u00a0 But I had to do it because that was the right thing to do.\u00a0 But I had a business dispute.", "And he loves Comey.\u00a0 You look at the relationship with those two.\u00a0 So whether it\u2019s love or deep like, but he was conflicted.", "Look, Robert Mueller should\u2019ve never been chosen because he wanted the FBI job and he didn\u2019t get it.\u00a0 And the next day, he was picked as Special Counsel.\u00a0 So you tell somebody, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you can\u2019t have the job.\u201d\u00a0 And then, after you say that, he\u2019s going to make a ruling on you?\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u00a0 Plus, we had a business dispute.\u00a0 Plus, his relationship with Comey was extraordinary.", "Hours after his press conference, Trump also tweeted that Mueller \u201ccame to the Oval Office (along with other potential candidates) seeking to be named the Director of the FBI \u2026 I told him NO. The next day he was named Special Counsel \u2014 A total Conflict of Interest NICE!\u201d", "Robert Mueller came to the Oval Office (along with other potential candidates) seeking to be named the Director of the FBI.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2019", "That doesn\u2019t jibe with the testimony of former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon who told investigators that it was the White House that invited Mueller to the Oval Office to \u201coffer a perspective on the institution of the FBI.\u201d According to the special counsel report, \u201cBannon said that, although the White House thought about beseeching Mueller to become Director again, he did not come in looking for the job.\u201d", "As for the alleged dispute over\u00a0membership fees at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, the special counsel report also addresses that. According to the report, Mueller informed the club in a letter on Oct. 12, 2011, that he would no longer be a member. The letter \u201cnoted that \u2018we live in the District and find that we are unable to make full use of the Club\u2019 and that inquired \u2018whether we would be entitled to a refund of a portion of our initial membership fee,\u2019 which was paid in 1994,\u201d the report said.", "\u201cAbout two weeks later, the controller of the club responded that the Muellers\u2019 resignation would be effective October 31, 2011, and that they would be \u2018placed on a waitlist to be refunded on a first resigned/first refunded basis\u2019 in accordance with the club\u2019s legal documents,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe Muellers have not had further contact with the club.\u201d", "In July 2017, a spokesman for the special counsel said, \u201cMr. Mueller left the club in October 2011 without dispute.\u201d", "As for Trump\u2019s claim that Mueller was conflicted because he has an \u201cextraordinary\u201d relationship with fired FBI Director James Comey \u2014 \u201cHe loves Comey,\u201d Trump said \u2014 we note that Comey testified before a congressional committee in December that while he admires Mueller, \u201cWe\u2019re not friends in any social sense.\u201d Added Comey, \u201cI don\u2019t know his phone number, I\u2019ve never been to his house, I don\u2019t know his children\u2019s names.\u201d", "The special counsel report notes that when Trump initially laid out his claims about Mueller\u2019s alleged conflicts, several advisers recommended the president drop it.", "According to the report, the president\u2019s advisers \u2014 including then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, then-White House counsel Don McGahn and Bannon \u2014 \u201cpushed back on his assertion of conflicts, telling the President they did not count as true conflicts.\u201d Bannon told investigators that he \u201crecalled telling the President that the purported conflicts were \u2018ridiculous\u2019 and that none of them was real or could come close to justifying precluding Mueller from serving as Special Counsel.\u201d", "Shortly before his press conference, Trump tweeted, \u201cI had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected.\u201d It seemed to be the first time he acknowledged that Russian interference helped him in 2016. But when asked about his tweet, Trump took it back.", "Reporter, May 30:\u00a0Do you believe that Russia helped you get elected?", "Trump: No, Russia did not help me get elected. You know who got me elected? You know who got me elected? I got me elected. Russia didn\u2019t help me at all.\u00a0Russia, if anything, I think, helped the other side.", "In fact, Russia did help Trump\u2019s campaign. Russian President Vladimir\u00a0Putin denied that Russia interfered in the election, but\u00a0admitted that he wanted Trump to win.", "The Mueller report details how the Russians \u201ccarried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J.
