I am simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion,\" the document said.", "The suspected shooter also wrote that immigration can only be detrimental to the future of the United States and \"make one of the biggest issues of our time, automation, so much worse.\"", "\"It makes no sense to keep on letting millions of illegal or legal immigrants flood into the United States, and to keep the tens of millions that are already here,\" the manifesto said. \"Invaders who also have close to the highest birthrate of all ethnicities in America.\"", "By the following day, a rumor was afloat in social media that President Trump's \"team\" had begun deleting tweets in which Trump, like the shooting suspect, had referred to immigrants as \"invaders\":", "In light of El Paso and Dayton and the focus on white nationalist rhetoric, Trump's team has appeared to delete tweets where he used \"invaders\" to describe immigrants.

When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order.
