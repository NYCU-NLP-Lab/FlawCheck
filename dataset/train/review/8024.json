["After a dismal 2012 season, Marlins baseball owner Jeffrey Loria slashed payroll and got rid of a handful of expensive players, including star shortstop Jose Reyes and pitcher Josh Johnson. Miami baseball fans cried \"foul!\"\n\nLoria\u2019s moves revived debate about the lucrative public financing the Marlins won to build their stadium in 2009. \u00a0\n\nOn Feb. 24, Loria took out a full-page \"letter to our fans\" ad in the Miami Herald and other South Florida newspapers to defend his team\u2019s deal, saying he wanted to review the \"facts.\"\n\nLoria\u2019s letter was full of claims about the team\u2019s roster, finances and the stadium deal -- with some reminders about the 2003 World Series sprinkled in.\n\nLoria began with an admission that the Marlins\u2019 performance on the field \"stunk\" and said he takes his share of the blame. But then Loria turned up the defense:\n\n\"Those who have attacked us are entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts. The majority of public funding came from hotel taxes, the burden of which is incurred by tourists who are visiting our city, NOT the resident taxpayers.....\"\n\nSports writers and others have ripped apart Loria\u2019s rant. (Yahoo! Sports rebutted Loria\u2019s claims about everything from player trades to finances to the stadium\u2019s design awards.)\n\nHere at PolitiFact, we decided to put part of Loria\u2019s claims about the stadium\u2019s public financing to the Truth-O-Meter: \u00a0\n\n\"The majority of public funding came from hotel taxes, the burden of which is incurred by tourists who are visiting our city, NOT the resident taxpayers.\"\n\nLoria\u2019s claim suggests that it was largely tourists -- not Miami-Dade taxpayers -- who are footing the bill for a stadium project. Is it those high-rolling tourists who are mostly paying by plunking down credit cards at luxurious hotels in South Beach and beyond? Do resident taxpayers bear minimal financial burden here for the stadium?\n\nMarlins stadium deal\n\nWe turned to Miami Herald articles, stadium agreement documents and county officials to explain the deal.\n\nAfter about a decade of failed attempts, the Marlins finally reached a deal in 2009 with Miami-Dade County and the city of Miami to replace the Orange Bowl stadium with a 37,000-seat retractable roof stadium in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami.\n\nThe stadium cost about $515 million. Add in the parking complex, and the total rises to more than $600 million.", "The county, the city and the Marlins themselves all contributed to a fairly complicated deal. Here\u2019s a big-picture accounting of what each agreed to put in:\n\n Miami-Dade County: In March 2009, commissioners voted for a plan that was largely funded by three different hotel bed taxes that added up to almost $300 million. (The county also pitched in other sources of money, including $50 million from an earlier voter-approved bond referendum that is being paid off with property taxes.)", "We should note that while tourists pay bed taxes, so does anyone else who stays in a hotel or motel for any reason. That includes business people visiting the area, friends and family who visit local residents, and locals who live in hotels or need a room for the night.\n\nIn total, the county borrowed about $409 million for the Marlins project, which includes debt service and the cost of issuing the bonds, a county spokeswoman told PolitiFact Florida.\n\nThe county manager wrote in a memo before the vote that the bed taxes \"cannot be used for general government funding purposes such as social services, public safety and public education.\" But some bed tax dollars can be used for non-sports projects, such as museums and theaters.\n\nThe stadium was built on city-owned land later deeded over to the county, so the Marlins don\u2019t have to pay property taxes.\n\nCity of Miami: In March 2009, the city of Miami pledged $94 million for the city-owned, 5,800-spot parking structures (the final cost later dropped). The city also committed $13 million from bed taxes toward stadium construction, and $12 million for other improvements.\n\nMarlins: The team agreed to pay about $120 million toward stadium construction, and borrowed an additional $35 million from the county. The team pays rent, starting at about $2.3 million a year, plus 2 percent a year, to pay back that loan. The team is also paying $6 million of the county\u2019s construction costs. The Marlins pays the city about $10 per parking space.\n\nIf all this weren\u2019t complicated enough, in 2011, the Miami Herald reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission -- which was already reviewing the city of Miami\u2019s finances -- had launched a separate probe of the stadium deal, to see if the city misled investors about the parking complex bonds.\n\nExperts say that Loria is omitting some key points\n\nWe interviewed a few stadium financing experts who said that while Loria was correct that hotel bed taxes paid for a huge chunk of the cost, his claim obscured the fact that it was still public money, and it could have been spent on other projects to benefit local taxpayers.\n\n\"Simply put, Miami is going to get bed tax revenue regardless of whether Marlins park was built. So the implication that the city\u2019s budget wasn\u2019t affected by their decision to allocate their limited tax revenue to stadium construction is disingenuous,\" said Chris Lafakis, Moody\u2019s senior economist who analyzes Florida, in an email to PolitiFact.\n\nWe also interviewed Adie Tomer and Siddharth Kulkarni, researchers for the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program. They have argued that the stadium will cost the county $2 billion over 40 years, when all the interest on the borrowing is included.\n\n\"Focusing on tourist taxes obscures the real essence of debate, which is what can Miami do with this revenue?\" Tomer said. \"$2 billion is an enormous long-term cost. Those revenues are lost now.\"\n\nRoger Noll, a Stanford economics professor, said that higher taxes on tourists take away money they would have spent in local businesses. \"Politically, taxing tourist-related activities (hotels, rental cars) is attractive, because some voters do not understand that a targeted tax hurts the business that is being taxed as well as its customers,\" he said.\n\nJonah Keri, a baseball writer for ESPN\u2019s Grantland, said Loria\u2019s letter is right on one point: The county should get some of the blame on the stadium deal.\n\n\"Loria is saying the real idiots here are the government who didn\u2019t protect you from me,\" Keri said. \"That\u2019s true. The thing about Loria is, I don\u2019t think he is that much worse than any other owner. It really is the case that local officials are the ones who bungled this. Any capitalist is going to do this.\"\n\nIn an interview with PolitiFact, Marlins president David Samson defended Loria\u2019s claim, noting that bed taxes can\u2019t fund general government functions.\n\n\"It can\u2019t go to police officers, firefighters, nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers. ... It cannot be used to build park shelters for the homeless, as an example.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn response to renewed criticism about the 2009 Marlins stadium financing deal, Loria said \"The majority of public funding came from hotel taxes, the burden of which is incurred by tourists who are visiting our city, NOT the resident taxpayers.\"\n\nLoria is borrowing from politicians\u2019 playbooks here: He cherry-picked a fact that puts the situation in the best light while omitting a thorough explanation. On the surface, he is correct: Much of the public funding for the stadium came from hotel bed taxes largely (though not entirely) paid for by tourists.\n\nBut these are still tax revenues that belong to the taxpayer, and if it didn\u2019t go to the Marlins, it would have gone to some other public purpose to benefit those taxpayers. He also ignores that the county will be paying off that debt for decades. His implication that locals can shrug their shoulders at that public cost, and dismiss it as coming from the wallets of out of town tourists, is disingenuous.\n\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "Miami Herald\u2019s Fish Bytes blog, \"Jeffrey Loria\u2019s letter to our fans,\"Feb. 24, 2013\n\nMiami Herald,\"David Samson: Miami Marlins saw trouble with ticket sales before Day one,\"Feb. 26, 2013\n\nPolitiFact, \"Rays 3B Evan Longoria\u2019s spectacular bare-handed catch has become a must-see on YouTube,\"May 24, 2011\n\nMiami Herald\u2019s Economic Time Machine, \"How a $91 million loan on the Marlins ballpark will cost Miami-Dade $1.2 billion,\"Jan. 24, 2012\n\nMiami Herald,\"Josh Johnson, Mark Buehrle, Jose Reyes among 5 Miami Marlins unloaded in blockbuster trade,\"Nov. 14, 2012\n\nMiami Herald, \"County to state: we back Dolphins plan,\" Jan. 24, 2012\n\nMiami Herald, \"Feds open probe into stadium,\" Dec. 3, 2011\n\nYahoo!
