["A screenshot of what appears to be a combative tweet by President Donald Trump about former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick being added to EA Sports\u2019 Madden 21 NFL video game is going around Facebook.", "Except, it isn\u2019t real.", "The fabricated tweet says, \"Hey @EASPORTS, I hear Kaepernick is available as a free agent in Madden 21. I'm also a free agent, so why not add me? I'm equally worthless as a NFL player as Kaepernick.\"", "The screenshot also adds in a reply from Kaepernick that reads: \"Why not elect me President? I\u2019m as equally worthless as a President as you.\"", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The page says it posts parody NFL-related memes, but many users didn\u2019t seem to know that and criticized Trump and Kaepernick in the post\u2019s comments.", "We rate this Pants on Fire!", "Facebook post, Sept. 8, 2020", "Twitter, Donald Trump twitter, accessed Sept. 10, 2020", "Twitter, Colin Kaepernick twitter, accessed Sept. 10, 2020", "ProPublica.org, PolitWoops Deleted Tweets From Donald J.
