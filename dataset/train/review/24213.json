Trump rushed in reinforcements, threatened to destroy Iran, & made sure no lives were lost in Baghdad. That\u2019s the difference between a traitor & a leader.\"", "The post is wrong in its assertions about Clinton, who was secretary of state during the attack in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. The only element of truth in this comparison is that Trump did rush in military reinforcements.", "The Benghazi attacks killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.", "It\u2019s true that the State Department did not honor requests for more security prior to the attacks, but there was no evidence that Clinton was made aware of those requests.", "As for Clinton\u2019s response, none of the many congressional investigations about the attacks asserted (as Trump did) that she was inattentive throughout the hours in which the attacks occurred.", "Moreover, it was not Clinton\u2019s responsibility to send troops to the scene \u2014 the military chain of command took that responsibility. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred.", "Several investigations found that no action by Clinton, or anybody in the administration, could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths.", "The terrorist attacks were much more violent than the storming of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.", "As Time magazine reported, protesters broke into the U.S. Embassy compound shouting \"Death to America!\" and \"Death to Israel!\" and smashed through a main door, set a reception area on fire, and covered the embassy wall with militia flags and anti-U.S. graffiti.", "The same day, Dec. 31, U.S. marines deployed to Iraq. The next day, Trump deployed more troops to the Middle East.", "Trump blamed Iran for the attack and issued a threat.", "\"Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,\" Trump tweeted on Dec. 31: \"They will pay a very BIG PRICE!
