["Wisconsin\u2019s election is under a microscope as President Donald Trump cries fraud about the Nov. 3 presidential\u00a0election that Democratic nominee Joe Biden is projected to win.", "The president and his supporters have said, without evidence, that rampant voter fraud allowed his opponent to claim victory after he started election night ahead. Biden took the lead in Wisconsin and other key battleground states after clerks counted mail-in ballots largely cast by Democrats, according to unofficial results\u00a0\u2013 a trend observers predicted heading into the election.", "Now, a new claim is making the rounds on social media.", "A Nov. 8 headline in the Daily Wire initially reported, \"Wisconsin Election Commission Might Have Violated State Law By Allowing Clerks To \u2018Fix\u2019 Ballots, Report Says.\".", "It relies in part on a WISN radio\u00a0story out of Milwaukee that makes a similar claim.\u00a0The claim was also widely circulated by conservative websites.", "On Nov. 12, the Daily Wire updated its headline and story to reflect the findings of this fact-check.", "Wisconsin Republicans have latched onto the issue in their longshot effort to overturn the state's presidential results\u00a0\u2013 four years after members of their own party pushed to allow clerks to fill in missing witness information.", "Fact check:Wisconsin county did not have a glitch that stole votes from Trump", "Here\u2019s what we know about it.", "Absentee voters in Wisconsin place their ballot in an envelope, also called a certificate, that they sign before returning it. A witness must also sign the envelope and provide their address.", "The state Elections Commission sent a memo to clerks on Oct. 19 instructing them how to\u00a0spoil absentee ballots for voters who wanted to vote in person. The memo also provides\u00a0guidance on how to handle absentee ballot errors, including missing witness signatures or addresses.", "\u201cThe witness can appear without the voter to add their signature or address,\u201d the memo states. \u201cPlease note that the clerk should attempt to resolve any missing witness address information prior to Election Day if possible, and this can be done through reliable information (personal knowledge, voter registration information, through a phone call with the voter or witness). The witness does not need to appear to add a missing address.\u201d", "The commission\u2019s public information officer, Reid Magney, said this guidance has been in place since October 2016 and was brought forward that year by Republicans\u00a0on the commission. Indeed, an Oct. 18, 2016, memo states\u00a0that clerks are required to \u201ctake corrective actions in an attempt to remedy a witness address error.\u201d", "\u201cThe guidance has been in effect for 11 statewide elections, including the 2016 presidential and presidential recount, and no one has objected to it until now,\u201d he said.", "Fact check:Georgia ballot curing is not election fraud", "According to the commission, clerks can\u00a0\"reasonably discern\" a missing witness address by\u00a0using\u00a0voter registration records or any personal knowledge\u00a0they have about the person's address. They\u2019re required only to contact the voter before correcting the envelope if they can\u2019t find the address using outside sources.", "In those cases, the voter or witness can appear in person to add the missing information or provide it by phone, fax, email or mail. Voters can also request that clerks return the envelope so they can add the witness address themselves, or spoil that ballot and get a new one.", "Clerks must initial anything they add to the envelope. Magney said they use\u00a0red pen to mark the additions and noted that observers could watch the process. We should also point out that any changes to the envelope do\u00a0not alter the ballot inside, despite what some headlines suggest.", "Magney said \u201cthere\u2019s no way to know\u201d how many envelopes were corrected by clerks without reviewing election inspectors\u2019 statements from the state\u2019s 2,408 polling sites.", "Fact check:Milwaukee wards did not have more votes for president than registered voters", "Conservatives have argued the commission\u2019s guidance violates Wisconsin state law, which states, \u201cIf a certificate is missing the address of a witness, the ballot may not be counted.\u201d The statute also requires witnesses to watch voters fill out the ballot and place it in the envelope, without seeing their selections.", "\u201cThe one meaningful path that the president would have in Wisconsin would be to challenge the I believe illegal clerks writing in the addresses for the absentee voters\u2019 witnesses,\u201d\u00a0former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.", "However, Magney said state law doesn\u2019t specify who puts the address on the envelope.", "\u201cIf an absentee certificate does not contain a witness address (i.e. the witness forgets or the clerk cannot add it based on acceptable information), then the ballot cannot be counted,\u201d he said.", "Fact check:Wisconsin turnout in line with past elections, didn't jump 22% as claimed", "We rate this claim as missing context because it omits key facts that would give readers a different understanding of the issue, and may be misleading without that additional context. The Daily Wire and WISN stories don't\u00a0explain this policy has been in place since 2016 without objection, or that it was brought forth by Republicans and unanimously passed by a nonpartisan commission.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
