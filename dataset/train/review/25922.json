(AP)", "An Iraq War veteran asked Donald Trump at NBC\u2019s Commander-in-Chief Forum how the Republican nominee would support veterans, beyond words.", "Trump referred the speaker to his website, saying one of the big problems veterans face is wait times to see doctors. He said his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has been dismissive of the crisis.", "\"And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated essentially just fine, there's no real problem, it's over-exaggerated,\" Trump said. \"She did say that.\"", "Host Matt Lauer cut in, saying, \"No, no, she went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.\"", "Trump doubled down: \"Look, I mean, she made up half of the things she said about me. I'm telling you, this is -- she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.", "We wondered if in fact Clinton had used those words to downplay reports about veterans waiting for months to get medical care.", "Trump\u2019s campaign issued a news release quoting Clinton at a November 2015 event, where she said, \"I think Secretary (Robert A.)

But it\u2019s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,\" Clinton responded. \"Now, I do think that some of the reforms that were adopted last year should be given a chance to work. If there is a waiting period that is just unacceptable, you should be able to, in a sense, get the opportunity to go out, have a private physician take care of you, but at the cost of the VA.\"", "Clinton went on to say the problem went \"deeper\" than access to health care and also included a backlog of disability determinations.", "\"There\u2019s something not working within the bureaucracy,\" she said.", "Clinton spoke before Trump at the NBC forum and said she was \"outraged\" by the stories about the V.A. and that she has been \"very clear\" about the necessity to move the department into the 21st century.", "Clinton has called for addressing the VA\u2019s problems at multiple town halls and campaign events.", "At a June 2015 roundtable in Nevada, she said transforming the VA across the country should be a priority and \"what happened in Phoenix and elsewhere is absolutely unacceptable, period,\" transcripts show.", "Later in November 2015, Clinton said at a town hall that the VA \"does a lot of good work\" but also \"has systemic problems.\"", "\"And those have been revealed, and it's been shameful that people have been mistreated.
