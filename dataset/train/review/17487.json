["About this rating", "A group of refugees threatened to attack their hosts at Hope Farms.", "The attackers were all Muslim migrants.", "On 27 December 2015, the disreputable web site\u00a0Mad World News\u00a0published a sensational article about an incident at Hope\u00a0Farm in South Africa. \u00a0The story centered around a South African couple, who had taken in 143 people following a wave of xenophobic attacks which\u00a0swept\u00a0the country in\u00a0April 2015.", "A white bleeding-heart leftist couple made headlines when they generously opened their home to a group of Muslim refugees allegedly fleeing devout Muslim militants. However, it didn\u2019t take long for their liberal policies to backfire in a racist and ironic way \u2014 and it\u2019s exactly the poetic justice we\u2019ve been warning about all along.", "In July, the headline read \u201cMeet the angels who opened their hearts and home to 143 lost strangers,\u201d and the left was drooling over the couple who followed their socialist values to the letter. Andrew and Rae Wartnaby opened up their 50-acre farmland to over 100 Muslim refugees who were reportedly displaced during \u201cxenophobic attacks,\u201d according to News 24.", "After escaping Islamic brutality in the Central African Republic, the Muslim migrants traveled to South Africa, where they were again set upon by South African natives in black-on-black attacks. So, the good-natured yet naive white couple welcomed the refugee families to their land, which included Obama\u2019s favored \u201cwidows and orphans.\u201d", "However, after only a few months of graciously allowing the Muslim migrants to live for free on their property, the loving couple soon found that they would actually be the refugees. The Wartnabys were threatened with slaughter by the same people they were helping escape brutality.", "While Mad World News\u00a0repeatedly states that the incident involved \"Muslim refugees,\" less sensationalized reports from local sources such as\u00a0News 24 \u00a0and\u00a0eNCA\u00a0made no mention of the group's religions, referring to them instead as \"foreign nationals\" -- among the many who had initially fled other parts of Africa because of political persecution and extreme poverty.", "As the people staying at Hope Farm\u00a0came\u00a0from a wide variety of countries and backgrounds, it\u00a0is unclear how Mad World News\u00a0concluded that they were all Muslim. \u00a0Nor were they all from the Central African Republic, as\u00a0the article\u00a0reported. \u00a0According to farm owner Andrew Wartnaby's personal blog, their\u00a0guests\u00a0originally\u00a0came\u00a0from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and all were\u00a0legally in the country as refugees or asylum seekers.", "The\u00a0Mad World News\u00a0article also cherry-picked and exaggerated facts in order to chastise this \"bleeding heart liberal\" couple for taking in refugees. For instance, while it's true that\u00a0Andrew and Rae Wartnaby were threatened by the refugees, the threats came from a \"breakaway group\" and not the entire community:", "The situation took a turn for the worse two months ago, when the group was informed that each family must make individual applications to the United Nations for relocation.", "Fifty Five members accepted the terms, but the remaining 85 refused saying they wanted to be moved as a group. Since then, tensions between the two sides have risen.", "Wartnaby claims that on Tuesday the opposing group refused any food or water that was provided and the next morning, he had to call police to disperse the group which was protesting outside his home.", "Later that day, the electric fence around his property was cut and Wartnaby later discovered that the main tent had been torched.", "Mad World News\u00a0also claimed that the Wartnaby's were \"threatened with slaughter,\" but this, too, seems to be an exaggeration. The article published by\u00a0News 24, which was\u00a0the same piece quoted in the\u00a0Mad World News\u00a0article, reported that while Wartnaby did feel unnerved by the threats, he did not believe that the group had any intention to follow through on it:", "\"The parents were screaming that we had ruined their lives and threatened to kill us, but we did not take them seriously. We, however, later called the police.\"", "Wartnaby said he truly believed that the foreign nationals were making a fuss so that the government would put them up in a refugee camp.", "Wartnaby told\u00a0reporters\u00a0that while he does not regret taking in the refugees, he does want the breakaway group to leave his farm:", "\"I am not going to help them anymore. The accommodation is burnt and my fence is cut.\u00a0We have done so much for them in the last five months, we know every one of them by name, we have loved and cared for them and this is how they chose to respond.", "\"If they want to reject our help, then it is fine, but I still don\u2019t regret taking them in.\"", "The Wartnabys also had to contend with pressure from the local municipality, which in September 2015 ordered them\u00a0to either evict the people living on their\u00a0farm, or rezone the property\u00a0for residential use, a costly and time-consuming endeavor.", "Wartnaby wrote in a blog entry dated 3 December 2015 that the other group of people staying on their farm \"are an entirely different story.\"", "They have decided to do everything they can to improve themselves by learning skills, doing courses and building a resume of skills. They are wanting to leave the farm with a \u00a0reference that will help them in the future.\nThey have joined us as volunteers and are helping on the farm, building walls, planting veg and helping in every way they can.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
