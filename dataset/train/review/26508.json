If they are at war against us, which they have declared, we must commit ourselves to unconditional victory against them,\" Giuliani said.", "\"This includes undoing one of the worst deals America ever made - Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran that will eventually let them become a nuclear power and it\u2019s putting billions of dollars back into a country that\u2019s the world\u2019s largest supporter of terrorism. We are actually giving them the money to fund the terrorists that are killing us and our allies. We are giving them the money. Are we crazy? Donald Trump will make sure any agreement with Iran meets the original goals of the U.N. and our allies - a non-nuclear Iran.\"", "Republicans in Congress have opposed the nuclear deal.

If the U.S. had not cut a deal with Iran, the funds would still be frozen under the sanctions. So while no taxpayer money goes to Iran, the U.S. allowed Iran to receive billions of dollars.", "It\u2019s unclear how much money has been released to Iran.
