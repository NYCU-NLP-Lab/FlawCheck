["By Robert Farley and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on November 19, 2018", "President Donald Trump in recent days has engaged in some post-election spin:", "Trump\u2019s claim about the Florida race came during an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Nov. 18, as the president boasted about the positive effect his campaigning had on behalf of several Senate candidates.", "Trump, Nov. 18: Look at Florida. I went down to Florida. Rick Scott won and he won by a lot. I don\u2019t know what happened to all those votes that disappeared at the very end.", "According to the Florida Division of Elections, after a recount, Scott beat incumbent Florida Sen. Bill Nelson by 10,033 votes. That\u2019s out of 8.19 million votes cast, a razor-thin margin of 0.12 percentage points. It was the closest Senate race in the country this year.", "That also makes it the narrowest win ever in a Senate race decided by Florida voters.", "\u201cIn short, the Rick Scott vs. Bill Nelson race goes down in the history books as the most competitive and narrowly-decided of the 38 U.S. Senate races in Florida during the direct election era,\u201d Eric Ostermeier, a research associate for the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota, told us via email.", "Since the ratification of the 17th Amendment in 1913, U.S. Senators have been chosen by popular vote in each state \u2014 in other words via direct election. Prior to that, senators were chosen by state legislatures.", "Ostermeier, who runs a nonpartisan political news site, Smart Politics, at the Humphrey School\u2019s Center for the Study of Politics and Governance, has compiled a list of the closest Senate elections in all 50 states. Only eight other states have ever had a closer Senate race than Florida\u2019s this year.", "The New Hampshire Senate race in 1974 wins the crown as the closest in history. After a recount, the state\u2019s secretary of state declared Democrat John Durkin the winner over Republican Louis Wyman by 10 votes. After its own partial recount, the state\u2019s ballot commission concluded Wyman won by two votes. After a great deal of political and legal maneuvering, the two sides agreed to a special election do-over the following September and Durkin ended up winning by a convincing 27,000 votes.", "The second closest Senate election was the Minnesota race in 2008, when, after a mandatory recount, Democrat Al Franken edged Republican Norm Coleman by 225 votes, out of nearly 3 million votes cast.", "The Florida race wasn\u2019t quite that close, but it was awfully close by historical standards.", "For days, Trump has complained about the Florida race, wrongly claiming that Scott \u201cwon\u201d on election night \u201cby a comfortable margin,\u201d and that Democrats were trying to go back and \u201csteal\u201d the election. But, as we wrote, that wasn\u2019t accurate. Election officials were counting absentee and provisional ballots, which reduced Scott\u2019s lead. In addition, the razor-close results triggered an automatic machine and manual recount.", "So, while Scott\u2019s margin of victory narrowed to just over 10,000 votes as a result of those counts, no votes \u201cdisappeared at the very end,\u201d as Trump claimed. Nelson conceded the race on Nov. 18.", "\u201cThe only way for President Trump to claim that Scott won by \u2018a lot\u2019 is to simultaneously claim that either a) a very large number of votes were cast for Scott and not counted or b) a very large number of votes cast for Nelson were fraudulent and improperly counted,\u201d Ostermeier said. \u201cTo date, no evidence has demonstrated either scenario. A U.S. Senate race has not been any closer than this one in the Sunshine State.\u201d", "In a Nov. 16 tweet, the president complained that \u201cfake news\u201d was not telling the American people about his \u201cepic victory\u201d in the Senate and \u201conly wants to speak of the House, where the Midterm results were better than other sitting Presidents.\u201d", "People are not being told that the Republican Party is on track to pick up two seats in the U.S. Senate, and epic victory: 53 to 47. The Fake News Media only wants to speak of the House, where the Midterm results were better than other sitting Presidents.", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2018", "The Republicans did retain control of the Senate, although it is still unclear if the party will wind up with 52 or 53 seats. This has been widely reported, despite the president\u2019s claim of \u201cfake news.\u201d", "The party had 51 seats before the election and, as of Nov. 19, has netted one additional seat with Scott\u2019s victory\u00a0over Nelson in Florida. The GOP could further expand its Senate majority to 53 if Republican Sen.\u00a0Cindy Hyde-Smith wins the Nov. 27 runoff election against Democratic challenger Mike Espy in Mississippi. (Neither candidate in Mississippi won a majority of the vote in the Nov. 6 general election, forcing a runoff.)", "Whether winning one or two seats qualifies as an \u201cepic victory\u201d is a matter of opinion. But it is true that the president\u2019s party generally loses seats in midterm elections, as the Cook Political Report explained before the 2018 midterms.", "\u201cHistory tells us that the president\u2019s party will lose seats in midterm elections,\u201d the Cook Political Report writes. \u201cIn the House, the president\u2019s party has lost seats in 35 out of 38 elections (92%) since the end of the Civil War. In the Senate, the president\u2019s party has lost seats in 19 out of 26 elections (73%) since\u00a01913 (when the 17th Amendment allowed for direct election of Senators).\u201d", "Although it maintained control of the Senate, the Republican Party lost the House. As of Nov. 19, the Republicans had a net loss of 37 seats\u00a0\u2014 which is not \u201cbetter than other sitting Presidents\u201d in most midterm elections since 1946.", "The chart below shows that a net loss of 37 House seats, so far, is worse than the president\u2019s party has done in 12 of the 19 midterm elections since 1946.", "The GOP House losses, however, are in line with unpopular presidents.", "\u201cIn Gallup\u2019s polling history, presidents with job approval ratings below 50% have seen their party lose 37 House seats, on average, in midterm elections,\u201d Jeffrey M. Jones, of Gallup, wrote prior to the election. \u201cThat compares with an average loss of 14 seats when presidents had approval ratings above 50%.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s approval ratings ranged from the mid-40s to the high-30s since taking office in January 2017, according to Gallup polling data.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
