["A variant of the iconic pride flag, using a similar though not identical striped color pattern, has been shared across social media platforms with a warning. One screenshot of a tweet featuring this flag reads: \u201cMinors beware: if you see this flag on someone\u2019s profile, block them immediately. This flag is for MAPS, minor-attracted people, aka pedophiles. They are not LGBTQ and are not welcome to the community.\u201d", "This sort of warning post began to flourish on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook in June 2018, and resurfaced in 2019 during Pride Month. In 2018, news websites such as The Daily Caller and LifeSite News claimed that pedophiles were attempting to be included in the LGBTQ community, while on the online forum 4chan, a user looking for \u201cimages that prove LGBT community is advocating for pedophilia,\u201d was given the flag as a reference. Together, these articles and forum posts were shared more than 20,000 times on Facebook, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.", "However, no evidence suggests a concerted effort to push for the inclusion of MAPs in the LGBT community with the use of the flag. Russell Dick, co-founder of B4U-ACT, a non-profit organization that promotes resources for self-identified individuals who are sexually attracted to children, told AFP that his organization hasn\u2019t seen \u201cany MAPs trying to become part of the LGBT movement but have seen some MAPs denying it in apparent response to such accusations.\u201d", "The concept of Minor-Attracted Persons (MAPs), which is perceived by some as part of the attempt to normalize pedophilia, is an umbrella term used by organizations such as B4U-ACT or The Global Prevention Project, an organization that addresses \u201crisky sexual thoughts, fantasies, and non-contact problematic sexual behavior in adult men and women,\u201d in order to prevent child sexual abuse, as well as some researchers, to define a variety of people attracted to minors.", "These include nepiophiles (attracted to babies and toddlers), pedophiles (attracted to prepubescent children), hebephiles (attracted to pubescent children and early adolescents), and ephebophiles (attracted to late adolescents).", "Due to past criticism, The Global Prevention Project states in bold font on its website a disclaimer on the use of the term MAP: \u201cTo reiterate, this is not a term we invented, NOR is it a term used to rebrand pedophiles OR link them to the LGBTQ community.\u201d", "The earliest online instance of the flag appears to be this Tumblr page, archived by US fact-checking website Snopes, which called the initiative a troll experiment. One user of the online platform for visual content presented the flag on a thread dedicated to acceptance of MAPs, \u201cSupport NOMAPS\u201d (for non-offending minor attracted persons).", "\u201cThe NOMAP community doesn\u2019t really have a pride flag, so in honor of pride month I designed a NOMAP pride flag,\u201d the self-proclaimed flag designer wrote, before going in detail over the meaning of each colour.", "AFP Fact Check was not able to verify the identity of the author of the post and cannot ascertain whether the person truly identified as a pedophile or simply posed as one.", "One Twitter user and self-identified MAP told AFP he knew several people that have been using the flag. \u201cIt became pretty popular on Tumblr initially, then over time it spread through Twitter,\u201d David, who uses a pseudonym to protect his identity, told AFP.", "\u201cIt\u2019s still not by any means a universally accepted part of the MAP community or anything like that. I have mixed feelings about it. I\u2019m wary of people assuming that it\u2019s malicious, trying to get at the LGBT community, but as far as visual symbols go I think it can be useful and it\u2019s a good-looking flag,\u201d he added.", "Some Twitter accounts of self-proclaimed MAPs do use the MAP flag in their avatars, but AFP could not verify the identities of the account holders.", "Determining the difference between real MAPs who embrace or refuse the flag and trolls posing as MAPs is complicated by the anonymity provided by pseudonyms and aliases used online.", "Russell Dick told AFP, \u201cWe think there may be some anti-MAPs posing as MAPs and doing various things to create and maintain a very negative picture and understanding of MAPs. So it is hard to tell what\u2019s really happening!\u201d", "\u201cThe flag has nothing to do with normalizing pedophiles or an attempt to make pedophilia a part of the LGBTQ movement,\u201d Candice Christiansen, founder of The Global Prevention Project, told AFP.", "Christiansen, who has received criticism for her work in the past because it was interpreted as an attempt at normalizing pedophilia, said she was targeted because of the flag.", "\u201cI received death threats from trolls last year as a result of this flag being attached to my CSA (child sexual abuse) prevention project when I had no idea what it even was,\u201d she told AFP.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think Pflag Canada has heard of this,\u201d Omid Razavi, media coordinator for Pflag Canada, a national nonprofit dedicated to helping families understand their relatives\u2019 sexual orientation, told AFP of the MAP flag.", "Jennifer Boyce, spokesperson for Egale Canada, another national nonprofit working to promote human rights and inclusion for the LGBTQ community, also told AFP: \u201cNo, we were not previously aware of this flag.\u201d", "There is no evidence that the flag created in June 2018 to represent MAPs is part of a wider campaign to normalize pedophilia or include it under the LGBT umbrella, as several associations told AFP.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
