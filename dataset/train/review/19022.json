["On Friday, April 17, Hindi media outlet News24 shared a video on Facebook titled, \u201c\u0915\u094b\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u092c\u0926\u0932\u093e \u0907\u092c\u093e\u0926\u0924 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u0940\u0915\u093e,\u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u091c\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092e\u0938\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0926 \u0915\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0939\u094c\u0932 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948?\u201d This translates to \u2013 \u201cCororna has changed the ways of worship, what is the atmosphere in Delhi\u2019s Jama Masjid?\u201d", "The broadcast started with the anchor informing that the coronavirus scare has caused Islamic nations across the world to alter the ways of offering prayers. \u201cPeople are being advised to offer namaz at home. But today we are at Delhi\u2019s Jama Masjid and here Friday namaz is being offered as usual.\u201d The channel gave its viewers the impression that worshippers gathered at the mosque on Friday despite the lockdown imposed due to coronavirus pandemic.", "News24 took down the video after it was pointed out that the broadcast was over a month old. It was first aired on March 13. In its response, the channel claimed that an \u201cold video was shared by mistake\u201d and that it can assure its users that this was \u201ctotally unintentional\u201d.", "Dear Zubair, this old video was shared by mistake and was taken down as soon as the mistake was realised. We can assure you and all our followers that this was totally unintentional.", "\u2014 Corona Warrior News24 India (@news24tvchannel) April 17, 2020", "However, several people downloaded the video and shared it on social media, believing that it is recent.", "The channel claimed that it made a genuine mistake. But did it really?", "News24 wasn\u2019t lying that the broadcast was first aired on March 13. However, it is difficult to believe that sharing the clip on April 17 was an inadvertent error when this was the third time that the same broadcast was uploaded after its initial airing.", "The channel had also shared the broadcast on March 19 and on April 1. News24 conveniently misled its audience that worshippers unfazed by the coronavirus outbreak were gathering in large numbers at Delhi Jama Masjid, putting themselves and everybody else at risk.", "Below is the broadcast in question.", "On the initial date of upload \u2013 March 13 \u2013 coronavirus had not gained centre stage in mainstream media reports. In fact, the Union Ministry of Health had declared that it wasn\u2019t a health emergency. However, by March 19, when the channel reuploaded the broadcast for the first time, the Delhi government had banned all social, political and religious gatherings of more than 50 people. On April 1, when the video was reshared for the second time, the centre had announced a nationwide lockdown to tackle coronavirus. On April 17, as the channel uploaded it once again (and later took it down), the discourse around coronavirus had already taken an anti-Muslim shape after Nizamuddin Markaz was identified as a hotspot. News24\u2019s broadcast has a cumulative view count of over 6 million.", "News24 has put out a clarification for the April 17 \u2018mistake\u2019 (sans an apology). But it would be interesting to find out its justification for reuploading the video on the two previous occasions.", "Donate Now", "Pooja Chaudhuri is a senior editor at Alt News.", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
