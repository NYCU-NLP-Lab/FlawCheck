["By D'Angelo Gore, Robert Farley and Lori Robertson", "Posted on November 22, 2019", "President Donald Trump called into \u201cFox & Friends\u201d a day after the impeachment hearings ended and repeated false statements that have been debunked by fact-checkers and, in some cases, members of his own administration.", "The day before Trump\u2019s call to the cable morning show, Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council aide, testified at a public hearing and debunked the theory that Ukraine, and not Russia, conducted a campaign to interfere in the 2016 elections.", "\u201cThis is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves,\u201d she said in her opening statement.", "That message also has been relayed recently to senators by U.S. intelligence officials, according to the New York Times. After Trump\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d interview, the Times reported: \u201cAmerican intelligence officials informed senators and their aides in recent weeks that Russia had engaged in a yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow\u2019s own hacking of the 2016 election, according to three American officials.\u201d", "But Trump is still repeating the unsupported theory that Ukraine has a DNC server that was hacked during the 2016 election cycle.", "\u201cThey gave the server to CrowdStrike,\u201d Trump said in the Fox News interview, before falsely claiming that the company is \u201cowned by a very wealthy Ukrainian.\u201d", "Trump, Nov. 22: A lot of it had to do they say with Ukraine. You know, it\u2019s very interesting, it is very interesting. They have the server, right? From the DNC, Democratic National Committee.", "Brian Kilmeade: Who has the server?", "Trump: The FBI went in and they told them, \u201cGet out of here. You\u2019re not getting \u2014 we\u2019re not giving it to you.\u201d They gave the server to CrowdStrike or whatever it\u2019s called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian. And I still want to see that server. You know the FBI\u2019s never gotten that server. That\u2019s a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukranian company?", "Steve Doocey: Are you sure they did that? Are you sure they gave it to the Ukraine?", "Trump: Well, that is what the word is. And that\u2019s what I asked, actually, in my phone call, if you know. I mean, I asked it very point-blank, because we\u2019re looking for corruption.", "We\u2019ve written about these claims before, but we\u2019ll go over them again.", "CrowdStrike is a U.S. cybersecurity firm based in California. It is not owned by a Ukranian. The firm was founded in 2011 by George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch, who are both Americans. Alperovitch, the firm\u2019s chief technology officer, was born in Russia but came to the U.S. with his family in the 1990s.", "In May 2016, the DNC hired CrowdStrike to investigate whether its computer networks had been hacked during that election cycle. The firm concluded that DNC servers were breached in 2015 and 2016 by two separate Russian espionage groups that stole DNC emails and other documents.", "It\u2019s true the FBI was not given access to any physical DNC servers or hardware when the agency later conducted its own investigation into the cyberattack. Instead, CrowdStrike made a copy of what was on the DNC\u2019s computer systems and provided that information to the FBI to use during its investigation.", "\u201cWe never got direct access to the machines themselves,\u201d former FBI Director James Comey confirmed in congressional testimony in March 2017. \u201cWe got the forensics from the pros that they hired which \u2014 again, best practice is always to get access to the machines themselves, but this, my folks tell me, was an appropriate substitute.\u201d", "But CrowdStrike said it wasn\u2019t given the servers, either. \u201cWe have never taken physical possession of any DNC servers,\u201d the firm stated on its website.", "\u201cWhen cyber investigators respond to an incident, they capture that evidence in a process called \u2018imaging.\u2019 It involves making an exact byte-for-byte copy of the hard drives. They do the same for the machine\u2019s memory, capturing evidence that would otherwise be lost at the next reboot, and they monitor and store the traffic passing through the victim\u2019s network. This has been standard procedure in incident response investigations for decades. The images, not the computer\u2019s hardware, provide the evidence,\u201d CrowdStrike explained.", "There also wasn\u2019t just one DNC server, as Trump\u2019s claims suggest.", "According to court documents filed in a DNC lawsuit against Russia and other parties, the DNC said that \u201cin order to remove the unauthorized users from its network,\u201d it had to \u201cdecommission more than 140 servers, remove and reinstall all software, including the operating systems, for more than 180 computers, and rebuild at least 11 servers.\u201d And some of the servers the Russians accessed were \u201cvirtual servers,\u201d not physical ones, another\u00a0court filing said.", "Trump\u2019s claims are based on conspiracy theories that assert it was Ukrainians who hacked the DNC and then framed it on the Russians, and that CrowdStrike or Ukraine may be hiding a DNC server containing thousands of deleted emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state.", "Trump asked Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate CrowdStrike during their July 25 phone call that is at the center of the House impeachment inquiry into Trump.", "\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it,\u201d Trump said, according to a memo of the call released by the White House. The ellipses are in the memo.", "To be clear, the DNC servers are not the same as the private email server Clinton used as secretary of state. Plus, CrowdStrike\u00a0has denied ever working for Clinton or having access to her server or emails.", "Furthermore, the U.S. intelligence community concluded in 2017 that Russia hacked the DNC, which was also covered in the 2019 report from Russia investigation special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. That investigation was the basis for the Department of Justice charging multiple Russian individuals and groups with \u201ccommitting federal crimes while seeking to interfere in the United States political system.\u201d", "During the hearing, Hill, the former NSC aide, said that at least some of Trump\u2019s senior advisers had informed the president that the conspiracy theory was false, apparently to no avail.", "Former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, for one, said in an ABC News interview in September that he had explained to the president that these theories about Ukraine and the server had been \u201ccompletely debunked.\u201d", "David Holmes, a political counselor for the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine who testified to the House intelligence committee alongside Hill on Nov. 21, was asked, \u201cWhy would it be to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin\u2019s advantage to promote this theory of Ukraine interference?\u201d", "Holmes responded: \u201cFirst of all, to deflect from the allegations of Russian interference. Second of all, to drive a wedge between the United States and Ukraine, which Russia wants to essentially get back into its sphere of influence. Thirdly, to besmirch Ukraine and its political leadership, to degrade and erode support for Ukraine from other key partners in Europe and elsewhere.\u201d", "Trump continued to push the false narrative that European countries aren\u2019t sharing the financial burden in terms of aid to Ukraine, saying that\u2019s why he withheld aid from the U.S. In fact, according to several sources, the European Union\u2019s aid to Ukraine far surpasses that from the United States.", "In his \u201cFox & Friends\u201d interview, Trump said that he held up the aid for \u201ctwo reasons.\u201d The first, he said, was concerns about corruption. \u201cI want to make sure the money is going to be spent properly.\u201d (That is despite the fact, as we have written, that the Department of Defense certified in May that Ukraine had made\u00a0 substantial progress in fighting corruption.)", "\u201cBut there\u2019s another reason that is maybe to me the most important,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Germany, France, the European Union, why aren\u2019t all those countries in Europe, why aren\u2019t they paying? Why is it always the United States, the sucker? I got elected on that.\u201d", "Earlier in the interview, the president made the same argument, that he held up the aid due to concerns about corruption and because European countries weren\u2019t contributing.", "Trump, Nov. 22:\u00a0 Why isn\u2019t Germany putting up money? Why isn\u2019t France putting up money? Why isn\u2019t all of the European nations, why aren\u2019t they putting up? You have the European Union, and they\u2019re benefitting a lot more by Ukraine than we are. \u2026 Why aren\u2019t they putting up money? How come it\u2019s always the United States that puts up money? The suckers. Why is it always the United States? These are the questions I asked. I continue to ask them.", "But as we have written, the European Union and European financial institutions have contributed $16.4 billion in grants and loans to Ukraine since 2014, considerably more than the U.S.", "European countries have contributed an estimated two-thirds of all of the aid to Ukraine since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and launched a conflict in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine,\u00a0according to Iain King, a visiting fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. That estimate doesn\u2019t include funding from joint institutions for the EU and the U.S., such as NATO and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.", "According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, EU institutions top the OECD\u2019s list of the top 10 donors of official development assistance to Ukraine, with $425.2 million contributed on average for 2016-2017. The U.S. was second with $204.4 million in assistance, closely followed by Germany, which contributed $189.8 million on its own, in addition to contributions it would have made through the European Union.", "When Trump tweeted on Sept. 30 that he held up Ukraine aid because \u201cI was looking for Corruption and also why Germany, France and others in the European Union don\u2019t do more for Ukraine,\u201d Carl Bildt, co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations, responded via Twitter that Trump\u2019s claim had \u201cno relation to reality.\u201d Since 2014, Bildt wrote, \u201cthe EU and the European Financial Institutions have mobilised more than \u20ac15 billion [or about $16.5 billion U.S. dollars] in grants and loans to support Ukraine. Add to that large amounts from member states. This is way more than the US!\u201d", "During his impeachment hearing testimony this week, Holmes, the political counselor for the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, said the error of Trump\u2019s assumption about lack of support from European countries was communicated to the White House in late August.", "Holmes testified that after the hold was placed on the security assistance to Ukraine, people from the State Department involved with Ukraine diplomacy were \u201cscrambling to try to understand why.\u201d When Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, shared that Trump was concerned about burden-sharing with European countries, Holmes said he and others on the Ukraine team, in coordination with other U.S. missions in Europe and NATO, began \u201clooking into the facts of what the Europeans have provided and what we have provided.\u201d The results, he said, were \u201cvery illuminating.\u201d", "Holmes said they learned that the United States provided combined civilian and military assistance to Ukraine since 2014 of about $3 billion, plus $3 billion in loan guarantees that he said \u201cget paid back largely.\u201d", "\u201cThe Europeans at the level of the European Union plus the member states combined since 2014, my understanding, have provided a combined $12 billion to Ukraine,\u201d Holmes said.", "In other words, he said, \u201cIf the concern was \u2026. that others weren\u2019t spending as much as we were to support Ukraine then that information showed a different story.\u201d Holmes said he believed that information was communicated to the White House in late August.", "Under questioning from the intelligence committee\u2019s Republican counsel, Steve Castor, Holmes then confirmed that the pause in aid was lifted just a couple weeks later, in mid-September. But if the argument is that Trump released the aid after he learned that Europe was indeed paying more than its fair share, we should note that in his Fox News interview on Nov. 22, Trump continued to maintain that Europe is not.", "The president added a twist to his well-worn talking point that Schiff, the House intelligence committee chair, \u201cmade up\u201d a statement on Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president. Trump said \u201cafter he got caught, three days later he started saying parody.\u201d Schiff said it was a parody the same day he gave the embellished, dramatic rendition of the call.", "Trump, Nov. 22:\u00a0Adam Schiff gets up before Congress and he made up my statement. \u2026 He made it up. Then after he got caught, three days later he started saying parody. \u2026 I released the transcript of the call immediately. Had I not done that, I would have had a big problem. A big problem because they all lied about my call. My call was perfect. If you heard Adam Schiff\u2019s made-up version of my call, I mean it was the worst thing I\u2019ve ever heard.", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve explained before, the White House\u00a0released\u00a0a\u00a0memo\u00a0on the July 25 phone call on Sept. 25 that represents the recollections of staff assigned to listen in on the call. The following morning, at the beginning of a\u00a0Sept. 26 House intelligence committee hearing, Schiff\u00a0gave a dramatic retelling\u00a0of that White House memo. Schiff said he was recounting \u201cthe essence of what the president communicates\u201d in his call with Ukrainian President Zelensky \u201cin not so many words.\u201d", "We leave it for readers to judge whether or not it was immediately clear that Schiff wasn\u2019t reading from the White House memo, but rather giving his own take on it. And as\u00a0we\u2019ve said before, some of Schiff\u2019s version was similar to the memo and some wasn\u2019t. He wrongly said the president told Zelensky: \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to say this only seven times so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand. Lots of it.\u201d", "The memo doesn\u2019t show Trump saying anything about \u201cseven times\u201d or asking Zelensky to \u201cmake up dirt.\u201d", "But Trump is wrong to say that Schiff \u201cgot caught\u201d and \u201cthree days later he started saying parody.\u201d About an hour after Schiff\u2019s remarks, during the committee hearing, Republican members called out Schiff for misrepresenting the phone call, and he responded by saying his comments were partly \u201cin parody.\u201d", "\u201cBut luckily the American public are smart, and they have the transcript. They\u2019ve read the conversation; they know when someone\u2019s just making it up,\u201d Republican Rep. Mike Turner\u00a0said, indicating it was clear to him and others that Schiff was giving his own dramatic reading.", "A few minutes later, Schiff\u00a0responded: \u201cMy summary of the president\u2019s call was meant to be at least part in parody. The fact that\u2019s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself. Of course, the president never said if you don\u2019t understand me, I\u2019m going to say it seven more times. My point is that\u2019s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words.\u201d", "Trump also repeated his false claim that the\u00a0Aug. 12 whistleblower complaint\u00a0\u201cbore no relationship to my call,\u201d meaning the July 25 phone call to Zelensky.", "As we have written,\u00a0more than once, the whistleblower\u2019s account of that call largely reflects the White House-released memo about it.", "The whistleblower made three main claims about the call that were corroborated by the memo: Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cinitiate or continue an investigation\u201d into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden; assist the U.S. in investigating allegations that \u201cRussian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine\u201d; and \u201cmeet or speak\u201d about these matters with Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr.", "Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire also\u00a0testified\u00a0on Sept. 26, the day the intelligence committee\u00a0publicly released\u00a0the whistleblower complaint, that the complaint \u201cis in alignment with\u201d the White House memo of the call.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
