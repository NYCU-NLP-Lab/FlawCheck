["Some explosive rhetoric followed the political grenade that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker lobbed Feb. 11, 2011, when he proposed rolling back collective-bargaining rights for public employees as part of a budget-repair bill.\n\nMuch of it, we have found, missed the mark.\n\nWisconsin doesn\u2019t have a budget deficit, it\u2019s on track for a surplus: False.\n\nWalker\u2019s proposal would leave collective bargaining for public employees \"fully intact\": Pants on Fire.\n\nMadison protests against the plan have led to riots: Pants on Fire. \u00a0\n\nNow comes a statement comparing the Republican governor to one of history\u2019s \u00a0most evil despots.\n\n\"The history of Hitler,\" Wisconsin state Sen. Lena Taylor told a reporter on Feb. 15, 2011, \"in 1933, he abolished unions, and that\u2019s what our governor\u2019s doing today.\"\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican Party said it videotaped the Milwaukee Democrat\u2019s statement and a similar one she made the same day at one of the many Madison rallies called to protest Walker\u2019s plan.\n\nSigns at some of those demonstrations compared Walker to Hitler, but Taylor\u2019s claims stand out.\n\nThe eight-year state lawmaker, who lost a bid to unseat Walker as Milwaukee County executive in 2008, also wrote Feb. 17, 2011, on the Twitter social networking website: \"LIKE HITLER in 1933, WALKER is busting unions.\"\n\nSo, is Walker trying to abolish unions in the manner Hitler did?\n\nWe asked Taylor for evidence. In an e-mail, she cited several points that she said show Walker has a \"legislative goal of union busting in the coming years, if not in this (legislative) session.\"\n\nTaylor pointed out that Walker\u2019s budget-repair bill -- which contains the collective bargaining changes -- limits public employee unions to negotiating wages, not fringe benefits and other matters, and requires them to be re-certified each year through employee votes.\n\nTaylor also pointed out that as a state lawmaker, Walker supported right-to-work legislation, which prohibits unions from negotiating contracts with employers that require employees to pay union dues or fees. \u00a0\n\nTo be sure, the bill curtails collective-bargaining rights, and many opponents say it would effectively cripple unions that represent state, local government and public school employees. It does not, however, \"abolish\" unions as Taylor claims. Indeed, some public employee unions -- those covering public safety -- are exempt. And it does not affect private-sector unions, which are created under federal law.\n\nIn defending her statement about Walker, the only reference Taylor made to Hitler\u2019s actions was that he abolished German unions on May 2, 1933.\n\nLet\u2019s look more closely at what Hitler did that year.\n\nReviewing a transcript of the opening statement of the chief U.S. counsel in the Nuremberg Trials, we found the Nazis:", "So, Hitler abolished all unions and collective bargaining by decree, not with legislation. And he used force to liquidate the unions that did exist. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe sheer scope of all of Hitler\u2019s actions, not just those affecting unions, led the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Milwaukee Jewish Federation to condemn \"the hyperbolic use of Nazi and Holocaust references\" by protesters in the budget repair bill debate.\n\nWhile some protesters outside the Wisconsin Capitol have used images of the German dictator, the more pervasive cry has been chants of: \"This is what democracy looks like.\"\n\nIndeed, the changes in Madison are the direct result of Wisconsin voters making a historic change in who controls state government -- turning over the governor\u2019s office, as well as control of the Senate and Assembly, to Republicans.\n\nIn response to Walker\u2019s targeting of collective bargaining, groups are considering recalling some of the GOP senators, while other groups are eyeing a recall of Democratic senators. That, too, is part of the democratic process.\n\nAnd Taylor and the other Democrats who went to Illinois to prevent a Senate vote on the bill have not been brought back to Madison by force. They argue they are simply using a tool available to them in the democracy.\n\nLet\u2019s return to the statement.\n\nTaylor said Hitler abolished unions \"and that\u2019s what our governor\u2019s doing today.\" Walker has not proposed abolishing any unions. His budget-repair bill would prohibit some government workers from joining unions and it would curtail the collective bargaining rights of most public employees.\n\nBut Walker cannot order any of the changes; they would have to be approved by the Legislature, put in place by voters in November 2010. Hitler, by fiat, not only ended all collective bargaining, he abolished all unions, seized their funds and sent their leaders to concentration camps.\n\nTaylor\u2019s comparison is ridiculously extreme.\n\nIt deserves our most extreme rating: Pants on Fire.", "PolitiFactWisconsin.com, Rachel Maddow claim on budget surplus, Feb. 18, 2011\n\nPolitiFactWisconsin.com, Scott Walker claim on collective bargaining, Feb. 18, 2011\n\nPolitiFactWisconsin.com, Paul Ryan statement on riots, Feb. 18, 2011\n\nWisconsin Senate, Lena Taylor biography\n\nE-mail interview, Sen.
