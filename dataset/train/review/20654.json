The image has been shared online for years, with the Christmas tradition description being attached to it later on.", "Previous postings of the image contain different explanations as to what\u2019s going on in the photo. A reverse-image search showed that it was widely circulated on various websites in 2014 with captions that simply said \"women begging men\" (with no mention of Christmas, marital relationships, or forgiveness).", "It has also been shared on many Russian-language websites for years.
