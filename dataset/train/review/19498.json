["About this rating", "Hamilton, the Tony-winning Broadway musical that retells the story of the United States' founders with a multicultural cast and a\u00a0hip-hop score, attracted unwanted controversy in March 2016 when its producers issued a casting call specifying \"NON-WHITE men and women\" actors for ongoing and future productions of the show.", "The advertisement came to the public's attention after a prominent civil rights attorney, Randolph McLaughlin, questioned the legality of its wording.", "CBS News reported:", "\u201cWhat if they put an ad out that said, \u2018Whites only need apply?\u2019\u201d said McLaughlin, of the Newman Ferrara Law Firm. \u201cWhy, African-Americans, Latinos, Asians would be outraged.\u201d", "McLaughlin believes the ad violates the New York City Human Rights Law, which makes it unlawful \u201cfor an employer\u2026 because of the actual written or perceived\u2026 race of any person, to discriminate.\u201d", "\u201cYou cannot advertise showing that you have a preference for one racial group over another,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cAs an artistic question \u2013 sure, he can cast whomever he wants to cast, but he has to give every actor eligible for the role an opportunity to try.\u201d", "That is also the policy of Actors Equity, the Broadway union, which says, \u201c\u2026producers agree that auditions for all productions\u2026 will be conducted in such a manner as to provide full and fair consideration to actors of all ethnicities.\u201d", "Though the producers of Hamilton maintained that the ad had been approved by Actors' Equity, the union's general counsel said it had not and would not approve such language, the CBS report continued.", "The issue revolved not around the fact that the cast was predominantly non-white \u2014 which is called for in the script \u2014 but rather the specific verbiage of the ad, which left the impression that white actors were not eligible or invited to audition. This is how Actors Equity explained the problem in a statement to Playbill:", "Equity spokesperson Maria Somma told Playbill.com, \u201cThe Hamilton call on their website is inconsistent with Equity's policy. All of our calls have the following language: \u2018Performers of all ethnic and racial backgrounds are encouraged to attend.\u2019 We also have strong language in our Production Contract agreement which states, \u2018The parties hereto affirm their commitment to the policy that employment hereunder shall be without discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, creed, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression or political persuasion or belief. Consistent with the foregoing and with the procedure set forth in Rule 5(E)(4), it is the intention of the parties that the casting of productions will be conducted in a manner which provides equal and fair consideration to all Actors including, but not limited to: Actors with disabilities, ethnic minorities, seniors and women.\u2019\u201d", "The Hamilton producers re-wrote the casting call and issued a statement in response to the controversy:", "The producers of Hamilton regret the confusion that's arisen from the recent posting of an open call casting notice for the show. It is essential to the storytelling of Hamilton that the principal roles \u2014 which were written for non-white characters (excepting King George)\u2014 be performed by non-white actors. This adheres to the accepted practice that certain characteristics in certain roles constitute a \u2018bona fide occupational qualification\u2018 that is legal. This also follows in the tradition of many shows that call for race, ethnicity or age specific casting, whether it's The Color Purple or Porgy & Bess or Matilda. The casting will be amended to also include language we neglected to add, that is, we welcome people of all ethnicities to audition for Hamilton.", "The casting call was so amended. Despite its rapid resolution, however, the incident was ripe for politicization eight months after the fact, when GOP Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended a performance of Hamilton during which he was directly addressed by one of the actors, who expressed the multi-racial cast's fear that the Trump/Pence administration would not \"defend us and uphold our inalienable rights.\"", "After President-elect Donald Trump labeled the actor's speech \"harassment,\" some partisan news outlets attempted to draw a contrast between the show's ideology of inclusiveness and the \"non-white\" casting call in March, implying hypocrisy on the part of the producers and cast:", "When the show\u2019s producers and staff were confronted about this seeming violation of federal employment laws, show producer Jeffrey Seller insisted that Hamilton encourages \u201cdiversity,\u201d but that it was perfectly legitimate to exclude all white people. \u201cI stand by it and believe it to be legal,\u201d Seller said of the controversial casting call.", "Apparently, \u201cdiversity\u201d does not include white people as far as Lin-Manuel Miranda and Hamilton are concerned.", "But such a characterization ignores the fact that the \"seeming violation of federal employment laws\" was purely technical, and pertained not to what was stated in the ad, but rather what was unstated. Given that the roles being cast were written as non-white, it wasn't discriminatory for the producers to seek non-white actors to play them.", "What was further needed to meet requirements for fair hiring practices, however, according to Actors' Equity, was an addendum to the effect of: \"Performers of all ethnic and racial backgrounds are encouraged to attend.\" It was added, making any subsequent controversy moot.", "Huston, Warner Todd.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Flashback: 'Hamilton' Cast Lectures VP-Elect on 'Diversity,' but Issued 'Whites Need Not Apply' Casting Call.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Breitbart.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a019 November 2016.", "Paulson, Michael.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"'Hamilton' Producers Will Change Job Posting, but Not Commitment to Diverse Casting.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The New York Times.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a030 March 2016.", "Viagas, Robert.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"'Hamilton' Producers Respond to Casting Criticism.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Playbill.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a030 March 2016.", "CBS New York. \u00a0 \"Broadway Union Takes Issue With \u2018Hamilton\u2019 Casting Call For \u2018Non-White\u2019 Performers\r\nHamilton Producers Respond to Casting Criticism.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a029 March 2016.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
