Chris Larson, has cast Abele as out of touch -- and too powerful. Larson, who was a member of the county Board of Supervisors before Abele took office, won election to the Senate in 2010 after defeating a Democratic incumbent.", "On the Nov. 22, 2015 \"Upfront with Mike Gousha\" public affairs TV show, Larson decried the power Abele he has gained at the expense of the County Board, which is essentially moving to part-time status as a result of a 2014 voter referendum.", "With the referendum, which Abele supported, salaries for the 18 County Board supervisors will be cut in half following the April 2016 elections. In addition, the supervisors\u2019 health insurance will end and no additional pension benefits will be accrued.", "Gousha asked Larson whether a full-time County Board is better than a part-time board.", "Larson answered by making a claim we want to check, as well as a reference to rapper-producer Kanye West.", "\"I do understand that there\u2019s a lot of people who don\u2019t like the County Board.

He has unilateral authority over the County Board -- or, the County Board has no oversight over land sales, including the museum, the airport and the zoo. That's just scary to think what he could do with that. And to paraphrase Kanye West: No one man should have all that power.\"", "So -- not that it's likely -- but does the Milwaukee County executive have the power, on his own, to sell the Milwaukee Public Museum, General Mitchell International Airport and the Milwaukee County Zoo.
