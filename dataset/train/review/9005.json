["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on December 14, 2018", "A $23.9 million mansion was falsely identified as Rep. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s home in a viral meme. Pelosi actually lives in the same neighborhood in a $2.3 million house.", "A photo of a turreted mansion with views of San Francisco Bay that sold for $23.9 million in 2015 has been circulating online.", "The problem is that the picture has been plastered with this false statement: \u201cThis is mega millionaire Nancy Pelosi\u2019s mansion on San Francisco bay. This elitist snob called a thousand dollars \u2018crumbs\u2019, that was given out in bonuses by employers after Trump\u2019s tax cuts. What an entitled pig she is. (Notice she\u2019s surrounded, and protected by a wall)\u201d", "The house, which is located at 2724 Pacific Avenue in the Pacific Heights section of San Francisco,\u00a0doesn\u2019t belong to Pelosi. It is owned by\u00a02728 Pacific LLC.\u00a0A lawyer who represents the company declined to name the investors, but she did confirm that neither Pelosi nor any of her immediate family are involved.", "Pelosi does live in that neighborhood, though.

According to a list compiled by OpenSecrets.org that is based on financial disclosures from 2015, Pelosi was ranked the seventh richest with an estimated net worth of $100.1 million.", "And the claim that Pelosi called $1,000 bonus checks \u201ccrumbs\u201d is based on a criticism she made of GOP tax changes, comparing the benefits that would flow to corporations versus the bonuses they were giving to workers. We wrote about that earlier this year.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Report for: 2724 Pacific Avenue.
