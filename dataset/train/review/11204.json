It shows a photoshopped image of Bush in front of the Trump Towers, holding up a \"Vote for Trump\" sign.", "Seems innocuous enough. Until you see the account it's retweeted from: @WhiteGenocideTM.", "But that's not even the worst of it. A @WhiteGenocideTM photoshop creation shows Trump in a Nazi uniform flipping on the gas switch on a gas chamber housing\u2026 Jewish candidate Bernie Sanders.", "The editorial asserted that\u00a0Trump's ostensible re-tweeting of material from an account populated largely by racist and anti-Semitic material was perhaps troubling. However, the chain of responsibility for the re-tweet remained a matter of dispute, as the Trump tweet in question occurred nine days\u00a0after the offensive \"gas chamber\" image was reportedly first published by @WhiteGenocideTM. Whether Trump was even aware such an image previously appeared on @WhiteGenocideTM's timeline was unclear and perhaps improbable.", "We attempted to validate the existence\u00a0of the original 13 January 2016 \"gas chamber\" tweet on\u00a0@WhiteGenocideTM's Twitter feed, but if it had once been published there, it was deleted at some point prior 24 January 2016.\u00a0Jewish Daily Forward shared a screenshot of the purported tweet, however:", "A significant amount of scrolling was required to ascertain that the reported tweet from 13 January 2016 was no longer available. However, the account in question did primarily publish material of a similar bent, and Trump's 22 January 2016 re-tweet remained intact:", "\"@WhiteGenocideTM: @realDonaldTrump Poor Jeb.

The article's original headline suggested that\u00a0Trump re-tweeted an image of himself placing rival Bernie Sanders in a gas chamber, but it was later changed (without an editor's note explaining the significant modification). Due to the nature and timing of re-tweets, it's likely Trump was unaware of the nature of the account from which the image originated.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
