["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 21, 2018", "Q: Did the alleged gunman in the deadly shooting at Santa Fe High School confess \u201clove for Obama\u201d?", "A:\u00a0No. That story was first published on a self-described satirical website.", "The alleged 17-year-old gunman\u00a0who authorities say confessed to the shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas last week\u00a0\u2014 which killed eight classmates and two teachers \u2014 did not tell police that he had \u201clove\u201d for former President Barack Obama. Nor is there any evidence that Dimitrios Pagourtzis said he hoped to \u201cend gun violence\u201d by carrying out another mass shooting.", "Yet those false claims circulated online in recent days after a self-described satirical website carried a May 18 story stating as much. The story was then picked up elsewhere, including on viralitythings.us, which did not label it as satire.\u00a0Facebook users rightly flagged the report as potentially false.", "The article originated on\u00a0Daily World Update, a website that routinely\u00a0labels\u00a0its work as satire. But its posts are often republished and treated as fact.", "The piece is filled with absurd statements that might betray its dubiousness \u2014 for those who read beyond the headline.", "For instance, it refers to a \u201cTexas Rangers Inner-City Cooperative that pairs wealthy white folks with impoverished black and Latino kids to make them some extra money mowing lawns and doing some gardening.\u201d There is no evidence of such a cooperative, and certainly not one associated with\u00a0the actor Chuck Norris (known for his role in Walker, Texas Ranger), as the story says.", "Authorities have said\u00a0Pagourtzis confessed to the shooting, but have not determined a motive for the attack.", "False news often percolates amid national tragedies, as affirmed by the misinformation shared after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "\u201cAbout.\u201d Daily World Update.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
