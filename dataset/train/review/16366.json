The program has helped boost graduation rates in the city\u2019s school district, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said at a budget hearing in Albany.", "\"Since the program has been in place in our community, high school graduation rates, which sadly were abysmally low in Buffalo hovering around 48 percent are now up to 64 percent,\" Brown said at the hearing.", "Is Brown right about the district\u2019s graduation rates?", "Say Yes to Education", "The Say Yes program was launched in Buffalo in December 2011.
