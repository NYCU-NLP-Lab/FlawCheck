["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on March 12, 2021", "After the Senate passed its version of the American Rescue Plan Act, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney claimed \u201cthe result of that package is going to be middle-class tax increases.\u201d The legislation cuts middle-income taxes.", "Cheney assumes Congress will one day pay for the law with middle-class tax hikes.\u00a0But that\u2019s a questionable assumption, and one reminiscent of the way each party reacts when the other spends money.", "Congress faces a mountain of debt it one day should start paying for, and there\u2019s little indication it has the political desire to do so, let alone with \u201cmiddle-class tax increases.\u201d", "Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us it seemed there was \u201cno political will to do what Rep. Cheney is talking about\u201d \u2014 raising middle-income taxes \u2014 and no real interest in Congress in paying for anything. \u201cWe have been spending money and cutting taxes now for a decade and no one has shown any interest in paying for it.\u201d", "Cheney made her claim in a March 9 Republican House press conference. She said the American Rescue Plan Act \u201cis a real tragedy. When you look at that package, we know that the result of that package is going to be middle-class tax increases.\u201d", "The legislation, which Biden signed into law on March 11, provides an average tax cut to middle-income earners of $3,720 this year, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. That\u2019s for tax filers earning between $51,000 and $91,100 a year.", "The legislation, which, among other measures, includes direct stimulus payments and increased earned income and child tax credits, provides larger average tax cuts to the bottom 80% of income earners than to the top quintile. The only effective tax increase falls on the top 1%, and in particular the top 0.1%, whose after-tax income, on average, rises by an estimated $970 due to the allocation of corporate tax increases to shareholders. Those in the top 0.1% earn more than $3.5 million.", "The corporate tax increase involves interest costs for multinational companies and would raise $22.3 billion over 10 years, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates.", "A spokesperson for Cheney told us she meant that middle-class tax increases would be required in order to pay for the Democrats\u2019 COVID-19 relief package. The legislation carries a cost of $1.9 trillion over 10 years, with the bulk of the spending in 2021, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.", "The spokesperson also pointed to Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s late February comment that \u201ceverything\u2019s open for discussion,\u201d in speaking of a repeal of the 2017 GOP tax cuts.", "But as a Feb. 25 article in The Hill made clear, Democrats aren\u2019t united on whether a repeal of those tax cuts should be done in the near future, nor on whether an anticipated infrastructure spending bill should include some kind of tax increases to cover the cost. Manchin told a business group that \u201cnobody likes taxes,\u201d but \u201csooner or later, we\u2019ve got to pay.\u201d", "But Democrats have talked about tax increases on the wealthy, not those in the middle of the pack.", "Sen. Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has been working on tax legislation, mentioning measures such as capital gains rates and taxes on inherited estates.", "Biden has said he wants to repeal the GOP tax law, signed by then-President Donald Trump at the end of 2017, but he pledged\u00a0not to raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000.", "Democrats, meanwhile, have continued to misleadingly describe the Trump tax measure as a $1.9 trillion bill that gave \u201c83% of the benefits to the top 1%,\u201d as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before the final passage of the American Rescue Plan Act.", "As we\u2019ve written, that\u2019s true for 2027, only because most of the individual income tax changes in the law expire by then. Two years earlier, in 2025, 25% of the tax cuts go to the top 1%. The tax law cost an estimated $1.9 trillion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.", "But just as Congress didn\u2019t pay for that law, it\u2019s not clear if or how it will pay for the American Rescue Plan Act either \u2014 or earlier COVID-19 relief measures that totaled $4 trillion in spending. And if Congress does raise taxes, Gleckman told us, who\u2019s to say which part of the deficit-spending that revenue is meant to cover?", "Gleckman said it was an \u201copen question\u201d as to whether Congress really has to pay for the latest COVID-19 relief act. \u201cNobody shows interest in paying for anything these days,\u201d he said.", "And \u201cif we do pay for it, who pays for it?\u201d he added. Mathematically, he said, there are ways to do it besides raising taxes on those in the middle of income earners. Gleckman argued in an April 2020 post that, politically speaking, Congress would have to look at other means besides federal income taxes to pay for coronavirus relief.", "But with so much public debt \u2014 $21.8 trillion \u2014 there would be no way of knowing which causes of the debt Congress would be addressing if it does raise revenue in the future.", "Maya MacGuineas, president of the budget watchdog group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told CNN on Jan. 13 that deficit spending during this time is necessary to boost the economy. But eventually, Congress should do something about the rising debt.", "\u201cAnd yes, I worry about the debt and the debt is too high, but the first thing we have to do is deficit spend till we can get the economy strong enough to then pivot and worry about some of those other longer-term issues,\u201d said MacGuineas, who recently criticized the American Rescue Plan Act for including \u201chundreds of billions of dollars where it isn\u2019t needed.\u201d", "In the CNN interview, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should start raising taxes right now while the economy is weak,\u201d but something could be done once \u201cthe economy is strong enough.\u201d", "On the campaign trail, Biden had proposed tax increases on upper-income earners that would raise $4 trillion over 10 years, as estimated by the Tax Policy Center. But Biden said the money could fund infrastructure, higher education and more.", "\u201cThe Biden campaign and the president-elect have been very clear that they want to target those revenue raisers to people, corporations and people on the higher end of the income spectrum,\u201d MacGuineas said. \u201cThat said, they aren\u2019t enough to cover the entire cost of the very large policy plan that he has laid out, from green infrastructure to education to health care. So as the economy stabilizes and we have to get much more serious about dealing with the mountain of debt that we have at near record levels, we\u2019ll have to fill in some of the gap with even more offsets if they want to have as expansive an agenda as they\u2019re talking about.\u201d", "Cheney\u2019s claim that the Democrats\u2019 spending bill would eventually cause a \u201cmiddle-class\u201d tax hike reminds us of Democrats claiming Republican plans would lead to similarly unpopular policies.", "For instance, in 2018, a Democratic ad claimed that in order to pay for the GOP tax cut law, \u201cthere\u2019s a plan to cut Medicare for seniors.\u201d Some lawmakers had talked about reducing the growth of Medicare in order to lower deficits, but there was no plan to cut the program.", "And back in 2012, Democrats made the groundless claim that then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney would increase middle-class taxes in order to pay for the rest of this tax cut proposal. That was based on a Tax Policy Center analysis that said it was mathematically impossible for Romney to reduce tax rates across the board without losing revenue \u2013 not that he would raise middle-class taxes.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
