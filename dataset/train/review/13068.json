["The Indian Premier League (IPL) under way in the UAE garnered controversy after social media outrage that former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar made a \u2018distasteful\u2019 remark on Royal Challengers Banglore (RCB) captain Virat Kohli and his wife Anushka Sharma during live commentary. Indian mainstream media joined the bandwagon publishing reports citing the alleged comment made during a match between RCB and Kings XI Punjab (KXIP).", "News18 ascribed the following quote to Gavaskar, \u201cInhone lockdown me toh bas Anushka ki gendon ki practice ki hai,\u201d suggesting he made a double entendre. While the article remains as of this writing, News18 took down its tweet.", "Bollywood Hungama, Asianet News, Mumbai Mirror and DNA India were among other prominent English media organisations that attributed the same quote to Gavaskar. Its unsavoury English translation reads, \u201cVirat Kohli has only trained against Anushka\u2019s balls during the lockdown.\u201d", "This slideshow requires JavaScript.", "Hindi media outlets Jansatta, Zee News and Live Hindustan also did not miss the opportunity to criticise Gavaskar.", "This slideshow requires JavaScript.", "Times Now anchor Navika Kumar demanded that Gavaskar should be removed from the commentators\u2019 panel. Journalist Chaitali Narula also criticised him for his \u201cobscene\u201d comment.", "For Tweeple to troll @AnushkaSharma for @imVkohli performance is disgusting. And the less said about Sunil Gavaskar the better. In fact BCCI should remove him from the commentators\u2019 panel for the MCP attitude. #BoycottGavaskar", "\u2014 Navika Kumar (@navikakumar) September 25, 2020", "Soon, #BoycottGavaskar became a Twitter trend.", "A few other outlets termed his remarks \u2018distasteful\u2019, \u2018unsavoury\u2019 and \u2018sexist\u2019 without carrying the alleged quote in the reports. The News Minute quoted Gavaskar saying, \u201cDuring the lockdown, he [Kohli] just practised his bowling with Anushka,\u201d and suggested that the remark was made after \u201cKolhi was dismissed for 1 in RCB\u2019s run-chase.\u201d The report was later updated.", "Similarly, The Indian Express republished a PTI copy which said Gavaskar\u2019s remarks were \u201cunsavoury\u201d and \u201cin bad taste\u201d. This article was also updated later.", "Actor Anushka Sharma put out a statement criticising Gavaskar for \u201caccusing a wife\u201d for her husband\u2019s game. \u201cMr. Gavaskar your message is distasteful is a fact but I would love for you to explain why you thought of making such a sweeping statement on a wife accusing her for her husband\u2019s game?\u201d", "#AnushkaSharma sends out a message to veteran cricketer #SunilGavaskar after his remark on #ViratKohli\u2019s performance during the #IPL game last night. pic.twitter.com/NityLDuNRl", "\u2014 Filmfare (@filmfare) September 25, 2020", "Journalist Barkha Dutt commended the actor and tweeted, \u201cGood on you Anuskha for calling out the crap, whether from Sunil Gavaskar or anyone else. Hurrah.\u201d", "Alt News watched the live footage of the match and found that Gavaskar had been grossly misquoted. Virat Kohli, well-known for his batting and fielding prowess, had dropped two catches of KXIP\u2019s KL Rahul in the first innings. While Rahul had scored an impressive 132 not-out in the game, Kohli got out for 1 while trying to hook KXIP\u2019s bowler, Sheldon Cottrell.", "Gavaskar\u2019s remark came as Kohli was about to face the third delivery of the third over bowled by Cottrell. As Kohli walked to bat after the early dismissal of Josh Philippe, Gavaskar mentioned his dropped catches and said, \u201c[Josh Philippe\u2019s early dismissal] has given Virat Kohli a chance to play more overs [Kohli walked out in the 12th over in RCB\u2019s first match]. He dropped two catches in the field. So he knows he has to do something [special].\u201d", "After Kohli played the first ball, commentator Akash Chopra (along with Sunil Gavaskar) discussed how the players had been out of practice.", "Chopra: As all the players have set their foot on the field after a long time, [you can] feel that the swords have caught rust, they are not as ready. If you see the IPL career [of Virat Kohli] \u2013 he has unparalleled 5427 runs. But Sunny bhai, not playing cricket for 6-8 months, it is not easy.", "Gavaskar: Absolutely. He [Kohli] didn\u2019t get a chance to undertake the necessary practice. He knows that the more he practices, he\u2019ll improve. When the lockdown happened, he only practised against Anuskha\u2019s bowling, we have seen the video, but nothing is going to come of that.", "Chopra: He was practising in his apartment. There is no privacy at all. (People in the) nearby building also shot a video of it.", "While it can be argued that Sharma\u2019s name should not have found a place in the commentary, Gavaskar neither made an indecent remark nor blamed the actor for her husband\u2019s performance.", "Speaking with India Today, Gavaskar said, \u201cFirstly, I would like to say it again. Where am I blaming her? I am not blaming her. I am only saying that the video said that she was bowling to Virat. Virat has played only that bowling during the lockdown period. It\u2019s a tennis ball, fun game that people have to pass time during the lockdown. That\u2019s all. Where am I blaming her for Virat\u2019s failures?\u201d", "A remark made by commentator Sunil Gavaskar during RCB vs KXIP on September 24 was blown out of proportion on both mainstream and social media, leading actor Anushka Sharma to say that Gavaskar made \u201csweeping\u201d and \u201cdistasteful\u201d comments on her private life.", "Donate Now", "Jignesh is a writer and researcher at Alt News.
