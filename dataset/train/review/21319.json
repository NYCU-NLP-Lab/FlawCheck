["By Katie Busch", "Posted on March 8, 2021", "Posts circulating on social media falsely claim that Vice President Kamala Harris supports deep cuts to veterans\u2019 programs, telling them to \u201cget a job.\u201d It\u2019s a fabricated quotation that originated on a satirical website.", "During her 2020 presidential campaign, then-Sen. Kamala Harris announced her plan to expand veterans\u2019 health benefits and housing assistance. The plan, released in September 2019, also said she would work to \u201ccreate new economic opportunity for military families by fighting to expand and institutionalize hiring and government contracting preferences for veterans and military families.\u201d", "But social media posts have been spreading bogus claims that Harris, who is now the vice president, opposes benefits for veterans and has called for closing down the Department of Veterans Affairs.", "One post falsely claims Harris said: \u201cVeterans Affairs coddles them. It creates a dependency upon us which is not doing these former soldiers any good. They need to learn to live on their own two feet and be responsible adults.\u201d", "\u201cThe easiest way to assist them on this journey is to cut them off. Within these next four years, we will be shuttering the VA, taking away soldier welfare.\u201d The post concludes:\u00a0 \u201cSo here\u2019s a message to the soldier boys. Get a job.\u201d", "Slightly different versions of the fabricated quote have been circulating on Facebook, all of which center around Harris\u2019 purported desire to cut funding for veteran services.", "These comments have not appeared on Harris\u2019 Twitter account or Facebook page, and there is no evidence to suggest that Harris said any of these statements.", "In fact, the bogus quotes attributed to Harris originated on a satirical website. An article titled \u201cMilitary-Hating Kamala Wants To Shut Down The VA\u201d appeared Feb. 9 on America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a website that describes itself as \u201csatire for your confirmation bias.\u201d We\u2019ve included the website in our Misinformation Directory of websites that post deceptive content.", "The article, which was published before the social media posts in question, includes the erroneous quote in its entirety.", "To the contrary, the Biden administration proposed $20 billion for veterans\u2019 health care when it announced the COVID-19 relief bill known as the American Rescue Plan. The bill, as approved by the Senate on March 6, currently provides more than $15 billion for veterans.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
