["Where in America is the gap largest between the haves and have-nots?\n\nMilwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy says it\u2019s right here, in southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nAt a Nov. 5, 2010, Common Council meeting, the chairman of the council\u2019s Finance & Personnel committee said he fears there will be cuts in shared revenue that the state gives to cities. If there are, Murphy said, he hoped they would adhere to the shared revenue formula, which takes into account the higher level of poverty in Milwaukee versus cities such as Mequon.\n\nThen Murphy declared:\n\n\"Mequon and Milwaukee have the highest disparity of income in the country.\"\n\nMequon is well known to be one of Milwaukee\u2019s most well-to-do neighbors. And for years Milwaukee has ranked among the nation\u2019s most impoverished cities -- a ranking reconfirmed by U.S. Census data released in September.\n\nBut in a nation filled with poor cities and wealthy suburbs, is the largest chasm really between Milwaukee and Mequon? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMurphy, a 21-year alderman not known for hyperbole, cited U.S. census figures to back up his statement: Based on the most recent data, 31.9 percent of Milwaukee families had incomes of less than $25,000 and 1.9 percent of Mequon families did.\n\nThat\u2019s a gap of 30 percentage points.\n\nWhen asked about his statement by PolitiFact Wisconsin, Murphy said: \"I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s anywhere in the country that beats that.\"\n\nNot the strongest start when it comes to research methodology.\n\n\"If I\u2019m wrong,\" Murphy added, \"I\u2019ll be happy.\"\n\nOK. Let\u2019s find out.\n\nMurphy told us he was referring to big cities and suburbs that share a border. That\u2019s an unconventional way to look at it -- for instance, it includes Mequon, in Ozaukee County, but not River Hills in Milwaukee County. But we\u2019ll start there.\n\nFor the numbers, Murphy used 2009 figures for Milwaukee and 2006-2008 numbers for Mequon -- cities its size are not updated as frequently as Milwaukee.\n\nWe can make a better comparison -- between Milwaukee and Mequon, and between other U.S. cities and their suburbs -- by using 2006-2008 census figures for all of them.\n\nThose figures show 27.5 percent of Milwaukee families had incomes of less than $25,000. That means the gap between Milwaukee and Mequon was 25.6 percentage points.\n\nThat\u2019s our marker, as we look at other communities.\n\nWe didn\u2019t look at every major U.S. city and its suburbs. But with just a few checks -- focusing on cities near Milwaukee on the income scale -- we found two city-suburb combinations that had larger income gaps.", "There may well be others with a greater disparity, but we stopped there.\n\nMeanwhile, what about other suburbs in the Milwaukee area -- those that don\u2019t necessarily share a border with Milwaukee?\n\nFor communities with a population under 20,000, the most recent figures for families with an income of less than $25,000 are from the 2000 census. Using those numbers, we looked at each community in Milwaukee, Ozaukee and Waukesha counties.", "In Milwaukee, 31.9 percent of families earned less than $25,000 and in Mequon the figure was 3.7 percent.", "But the gap was even larger between Milwaukee and six other suburbs, all in Waukesha County: Chenequa (3.3 percent), North Prairie (3.2 percent), Town of Delafield (3.2 percent), Wales (3 percent), Genesee (2.8 percent) and Merton (2.7 percent).", "Of course, Murphy was making a national comparison. And the approach he used was just one way of looking at income disparity in a region.", "In an October 2010 study, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researcher Lois Quinn looked at 55 metropolitan areas and what percentage of the poor residents in each -- those with income below the federal poverty level -- lived in the major city. For Milwaukee, 73.2 percent of the area\u2019s poor residents were in the city.\n\nIn contrast, Lincoln, Neb., was home to 94 percent of that metro area\u2019s poor. Several others, based on the data available, also had higher percentages.\n\nUsing a different measure, median income, a 2010 study by the Brookings Institution also cited Milwaukee as among the metro areas with high city-suburb income disparity -- but again not the highest.\n\nIn Milwaukee, Cleveland and Detroit, the gap in median income between the city and its suburbs reached nearly $30,000 in 2008, the study said. But the gap reached $40,000 between two Connecticut cities -- Hartford and Bridgeport -- and their suburbs.", "To be sure, the city\u2019s poverty rate is among the highest in the nation -- a stubborn statistic that has defied efforts by policymakers and politicians to change it. But in neither measure was the city\u2019s disparity gap at the top.", "OK, enough numbers. What do they show us?\n\nIn making a point about how state shared revenue should be distributed to cities, Milwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy said the largest income disparity in the country is between Milwaukee and Mequon. While comprehensive studies have ranked Milwaukee near the top in income disparity, Murphy went too far in lining Milwaukee up against neighboring Mequon.\n\nWith just a little checking, we found two city-suburb combinations that have a larger disparity. Murphy said he\u2019d be happy if proven wrong, since that would mean Milwaukee doesn\u2019t have the worst income disparity.\n\nPut a smile on your face, alderman: We rate your statement False.", "Brookings Institution, State of Metropolitan America(page 136), 2010\n\nMilwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy, comments at Common Council budget meeting (afternoon session), Nov. 5, 2010\n\nMilwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy, interviews, Nov. 5 and 8, 2010\n\nMilwaukee Common Council, Alderman Michael Murphy biography\n\nMilwaukee Common Council, Alderman Michael Murphy committee assignments\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, Milwaukee now fourth poorest city in nation, Sept. 28, 2010\n\nEmail interview, University of Wisconsin-Madison Institute for Research on Poverty assistant researcher Joanna Young Marks, Nov. 9, 2010\n\nEmail and phone interviews, University of Wisconsin-Madison Institute for Research on Poverty senior editor Deborah Johnson, Nov. 8 and 9, 2010\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Employment and Training Institute, Drilldown on Poverty and the Recession working paper, October 2010\n\nInterview, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Employment and Training Institute senior scientist Lois Quinn, Nov. 10, 2010\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, various family income comparisons\n\nInterview, Wisconsin Demographics Services Center research analyst David Egan-Robertson, Nov. 5, 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
