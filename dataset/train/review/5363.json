["About this rating", "It's natural for children to want to talk to Santa Claus when the holiday season comes around, but as of December 2016, at least one Facebook page has been that sentiment. The \"Real Santa Hotline,\" as it calls itself, is an actual phone number. But before you put your child on the phone to talk to jolly old Saint Nick, consider this: Instead of reaching the \"North Pole,\" callers to this \"hotline\" are connected not to a kindly older man who wants to hear Christmas wishes, but to the notoriously unfriendly Westboro Baptist Church.", "The number was also passed off as family-friendly by \"satirical\" publications:", "Authorities urge all parents across the nation to call the Safe Santa Hotline at (785)273-0325, to guarantee that your local mall has a Santa that won\u2019t scar your children for life.", "However, that is only one misleading number among several that do allow for the full Christmas experience. Heavy.com published a list in 2015 of phone numbers that actually do let you leave a message for Santa. FreeConferenceCall.com also offers its own Santa hotline, which it established in 2009.", "Arturo Garcia is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
