Blood runs from his ear as he lies on the ground.", "Another video shows him being transported by paramedics on a stretcher, with a cervical collar around his neck and a bandage over his head.", "The incident came during protests across the country over police brutality against African Americans that were sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.", "It led to assault charges against Buffalo police officers, both of whom pleaded not guilty.", "Other posts making similar claims about Gugino faking an injury appear on Facebook here, here and here.", "But the claims are false.", "Gugino \u201cis still at the Erie County Medical Center (ECMC),\u201d Peter Cutler, its vice president of communications and external affairs, told AFP by phone, saying that the man is now in rehabilitation.", "\u201cHis medical status was updated from serious to fair\u201d on June 9, Cutler added.", "Kelly Zarcone, Gugino\u2019s attorney, said claims that her client faked an injury and staged his fall \u201care ridiculous and absolutely false.\u201d", "\u201cNo one from law enforcement has even suggested anything like that,\u201d she told AFP by email.", "And the Erie County District Attorney\u2019s Office also confirmed that Gugino was injured in a statement on charges against the two police officers involved in the incident.", "\u201cThe 75-year-old male victim was taken to ECMC to be treated for a head injury, loss of consciousness, and bleeding from the right ear.
