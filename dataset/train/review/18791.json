["On March 1, 2012, Comedy Central\u2019s Stephen Colbert moved in on Florida\u2019s controversial new election law for a recurring segment, \"People Who Are Destroying America.\"\u00a0The target: a Panhandle teacher\u00a0named Dawn Quarles, who turned in 76 voter registration forms from her students beyond the state\u2019s new 48-hour deadline. She could face a $1,000 fine.", "One of the people Colbert interviewed for his sarcastic report is Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida.

In 2011, Florida\u2019s 11 attacks comprised 38 percent of the nation\u2019s total and 15 percent of the world\u2019s attacks. Volusia County, home to the spring-break mecca of Daytona Beach, had the most attacks (six).", "While the shark attack figures are cut and dry (sorry!), the voter fraud numbers are not. There could be more cases than we know about, involving more people. The numbers\u00a0may not represent total voter fraud cases, as those could be handled by local supervisors and state attorneys.", "Also, one \"case\" may represent multiple counts of voter fraud, perpetrated by multiple people, said agency spokesman Chris Cate. He points to a November 2011 case that resulted in the arrests of nine people from the North Florida town of Madison, including the supervisor of elections.", "On the other hand, the fraud list does not count only convictions. So some of these cases could be proven unfounded.", "The ACLU\u2019s claim is true on its face, but we\u2019re knocking it down a peg with consideration of a few things.
