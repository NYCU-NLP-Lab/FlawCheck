["A viral Facebook post says Target installed urinals in a women's restroom", "Has Target added urinals to a women\u2019s restroom in California?", "That\u2019s the claim in a Facebook post that\u2019s been shared more than 14,000 times as of April 26, 2016,\u00a0one week after the mega-retailer announced transgender customers are\u00a0welcome to use bathrooms\u00a0that match up with their gender identity at their stores nationwide.", "Target is the latest corporation to announce the policy, just as state legislatures have debated or approved so-called \"bathroom laws.\" Those laws, including one signed by the governor of North Carolina in late March, would prohibit transgender people from using restrooms that do not\u00a0correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate.", "Target\u2019s policy has led to mixed customer reviews. Some have cheered it, while more than\u00a0half a million people\u00a0had signed a boycott petition by American Family Association, a conservative Christian activist group, as of Tuesday. The group contends the policy encourages sexual predators and puts women and young girls in danger.", "We know the policy alone is controversial. But we wondered whether Target had taken its stance to an even more contentious level by installing urinals in a women\u2019s store restroom? That\u2019s the claim in the\u00a0popular Facebook post\u00a0by a user named Kathleen Crawford:", "\"It's true. ..I'm in the women's bathroom at a Target north of LA...they actually took out a stall for women in order to accommodate the ones who have giblets...yes, these are urinals...for men...and so the war on women progresses. \u2026\"", "The allegation inspired outrage on some conservative\u00a0blogs, where it was taken as fact.", "It shouldn\u2019t be.", "Our research", "The Facebook post includes a photo of two urinals wrapped in plastic inside a restroom with a red wall. It shows no evidence of where, exactly, the photo was taken.", "When we contacted Target, a corporate spokeswoman called the claim on Facebook \"inaccurate.\"", "\"We have not made any changes to the restrooms,\" the spokeswoman, Molly Snyder, said in an email. \"We have not added any urinals to any women's restrooms nor do we have any plans to do so.\"", "She said the company never had past plans to do so.", "So what\u2019s going on with the photo?", "It\u2019s hard to say for certain.", "We reached out to the person who posted it on Facebook, but we haven\u2019t heard back.", "The myth-busting website Snopes.com also\u00a0checked out\u00a0the Facebook post and found it False. It said the \"picture has\u00a0nothing to do with Target's restroom policy. The image was not taken in a women's restroom at a Los Angeles Target store (rather a men's room that was undergoing repair or refurbishment).\"", "Snopes.com did not say how it found out where the photo came from. Snyder, the\u00a0Target spokeswoman, said she did not know its source.", "If Target had made this change, we\u2019d expect more than just one photo to surface.", "We reached out to the woman on Facebook, and we'll add her response should we hear back.", "Our ruling", "A popular Facebook post alleged last week that Target installed urinals in a women\u2019s restroom in California.", "Target representatives told us the claim is \"inaccurate,\" and that the company has no plans to change its restrooms, and never did. Best we can tell, the Facebook post is a one-off picture that hasn\u2019t surfaced in any other form (other than the thousands of people sharing it).", "So stop that!
