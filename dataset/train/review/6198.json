["Four images of light-weight helicopters stationed alongside each other have been shared widely on social media.", "\u201cThis is Nigeria first set of made in Nigeria\u00a0helicopters made by Nigeria agency for science and engineering infrastructure (NASENI) (sic),\u201d reads the most viral post, published from a Facebook account called \u201cAmazing African Facts\u201d and shared nearly a thousand times since January 28, 2021.", "Similar claims were also shared on Facebook (here, here and here)\u00a0and on Instagram here. Nigerian Television Authority, a state-owned media company, shared the claim on Twitter.", "NASENI is the Nigerian National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure\u00a0and represented the Nigerian government in a deal concluded with\u00a0Belgian aircraft manufacturing firm, Dynali Helicopter Company.", "The post on \u201cAmazing African Facts\u201d was published shortly after Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari reaffirmed his support for NASENIs collaboration with Dynali, according to\u00a0a statement shared on Facebook last month by the president\u2019s spokesperson, Femi Adesina.", "This was followed by a press release from NASENI repeating Buhari\u2019s call\u00a0for local production of helicopters in Nigeria with fresh directives to the agency\u00a0and the national aviation authority to secure relevant certifications that would ensure this happens before he leaves office in 2023. Component parts are already being manufactured locally.", "However, the helicopters seen\u00a0in the social media posts have nothing to do with the deal between Nigeria and\u00a0Dynali. In fact, no helicopters have been made in Nigeria since the agreement was announced in 2018.", "By running several reverse image searches, AFP Fact Check was able to find one of the photos, used widely with the false claims, on Dynali\u2019s website.", "The image, of four helicopters lined up in a row, appears in a company\u00a0press release from May 19, 2017, announcing the delivery of Dynali\u2019s\u00a050th H3 Sport light helicopter to a client in France.", "By accessing the photo\u2019s metadata using the InVID WeVerify tool, AFP Fact Check found that the photo was taken on April 13, 2017. Dynali also posted the same photo on their Facebook account the following day.", "Another image from one of the false posts shows seven helicopters inside a hangar. It\u00a0was published, also on Dynali\u2019s website, on March 9, 2020.", "Similarly, a third photo of a helicopter standing at the entrance of a hangar can be found on the company\u2019s website. Like the other helicopters pictured in the false claims, it was not built in Nigeria.", "The last image of a close-up photo of a helicopter cockpit was first published by Dynali on June 5, 2015, years\u00a0before the company\u2019s agreement with Nigeria was announced and just days after Buhari was sworn in as president.", "Dynali Helicopter Company confirmed with AFP Fact Check that the four photos were taken in Belgium, not Nigeria. \u201cThe photos that you cite in your email were actually taken in Belgium,\u201d said No\u00ebl Howard-Jones, the company\u2019s marketing director, in an email on February 2, 2021.", "Howard-Jones confirmed there is an agreement between the company and NASENI \u201cwhich will ultimately lead to a full technology transfer for the manufacturing of our H3 microlight helicopter in Nigeria\u201d.", "However, several factors have delayed the project, according to Howard-Jones, including the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to travel restrictions across the globe and reduced airline operations.", "\u201cWe are getting teed up to train technicians from NASENI in the assembly of our helicopters from sets of parts as an initial step and this phase will be implemented as soon as the Covid evolution allows for the required travel,\u201d Howard-Jones said.", "\u201cOnce Nigerian assembly is running smoothly, we will work on the technology transfer for the fabrication of all the mechanical parts.\u201d", "Meanwhile, NASENI has already secured\u00a0delivery of its first H3 helicopter. The second is \u201cnow being prepared for shipment later this week in a 20-foot container,\u201d\u00a0according to Howard-Jones.", "The physical appearance of the second helicopter bound for Nigeria\u00a0does not match those in the images circulating on social media.", "Dynali sent AFP Fact Check a picture of the helicopter, which has been branded in white, red and green, along with a large NASENI\u00a0emblem.", "NASENI has not yet responded to AFP Fact Check\u2019s request for comment.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
