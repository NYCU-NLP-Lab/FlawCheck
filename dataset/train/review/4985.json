["\u201cI ask this government if people should prepare for internment camps,\u201d Ontario provincial member of parliament (MPP) Randy Hillier asked the central Canadian province\u2019s legislature during Question Period on October 7, 2020.", "In the week that followed, a meme made comparisons between the quarantine sites and Nazi Germany\u2019s camps, while one Facebook user raised fears about having to stay quarantined \u201cfor the rest of your life.\u201d On Hillier\u2019s Facebook page, some commenters called them \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d", "The National Citizens Alliance, a far-right political party with no seats in Parliament,\u00a0picked up on Hillier\u2019s language to denounce \u201cinternment camps,\u201d while falsely claiming that children could be taken from parents for quarantine. Variations of the claims were present in a few online videos.", "Government-run quarantine facilities are allowed in Canada under the Quarantine Act, passed in 2005 under Liberal prime minister Paul Martin.", "In June 2020, the federal government issued its third order requiring every person entering Canada to quarantine for 14 days.", "In his speech, Hillier was referring to facilities that the federal Canadian government deployed across the country and \u201care being used to address the Covid-19 fourteen day quarantine requirements for international travellers not having a suitable place to isolate,\u201d according to a government document.", "\u201cIn general, those are hotels, so I don\u2019t really know where the notion of internment camps comes from,\u201d Andre Gagnon, a spokesman for Health Canada, the government agency in charge of the Covid-19 pandemic response, told AFP.", "During his speech at Question Period, Hillier mentioned a Request For Information dated September 17, 2020, issued by the Canadian federal government, seeking estimations on the costs and logistics of managing \u201cFederal Quarantine / Isolation sites that will be used to house and care for people for public health and other related federal requirements associated with the COVID-19 pandemic response.\u201d", "According to a more detailed Letter of Interest, there are currently 11 such \u201cDesignated Quarantine Sites\u201d in Canada\u2019s main urban centers, which can accommodate 1,600 people in total. Ten new sites are under consideration.", "Hillier also claims that the quarantine facilities were designed to house \u201ca broad spectrum of people, not limited to travelers,\u201d alleging that the phrase \u201cinternational travellers\u201d is absent from government documents. However, those words are found in the Letter of Interest, and nothing suggests the facilities will be used for other individuals.", "The Canadian government is currently in charge of those sites, but is considering delegating this responsibility to third-party service providers, the letter of interest reads. Gagnon from Health Canada told AFP that this potential contract would be attributed in March 2021.", "Gagnon told AFP that as of October 12, 126 travellers were housed in the designated quarantine sites, and that 3,922 travellers had quarantined in such sites since March 2020.", "Quarantine facilities are common practice in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In the early days of the pandemic, UK residents repatriated from Wuhan were held at a hospital, while in France they stayed at a seaside town on the Mediterranean.", "Australia and India also built facilities for nationals returning from abroad.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
