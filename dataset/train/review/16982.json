The photo has been\u00a0used in a misleading context; the map shows projections made by a scientist from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of where marine debris from the 2011 tsunami in Japan could circulate.", "A reverse image search on Google and subsequent keyword searches found this edition of\u00a0Mariners Weather Log\u00a0magazine published in December 2011 by the U.S. National Weather Service.", "The image appears on page 8, in a chapter titled, \u201cMarine Debris\u201d, written by NOAA marine debris program coordinator Carey Morishige.", "Below is a screenshot of the image in the magazine:", "The\u00a0article's first paragraph states: \u201cOf all Earth\u2019s natural hazards, tsunamis may be among the most infrequent, but they pose a major threat to coastal populations, particularly in the seismically active Pacific Ocean. The tragedy of the March 11, 2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan could have far-reaching effects to areas like the U.S. West Coast and Hawai\u2018i. As the tsunami receded from land in northern Japan, it washed much of what was in the inundation zone into the ocean. Heavier materials sank closer to shore while buoyant materials made up debris fields that were seen briefly in satellite imagery and aerial photos of the waters surrounding Japan.\u201d", "The image's caption states: \u201cNOAA has run a model using OSCURS (Ocean Surface Current Simulator).
