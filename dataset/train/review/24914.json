["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on October 18, 2019", "Social media posts falsely claim that former President Barack Obama signed a bill that made it permissible for \u201cthe media\u201d to get \u201caway with lying.\u201d The bill had no bearing on private media outlets or what they can report.", "A piece of legislation signed into law under the Obama administration didn\u2019t give license to \u201cthe media\u201d to get \u201caway with lying,\u201d contrary to what social media posts on\u00a0Facebook and Twitter claim.", "\u201cHave you ever wondered how the media gets away with lying? It\u2019s because on 12/29/2012, Barack Obama signed the NDAA bill. (HR 4310 / Sec 1078),\u201d the posts read. \u201cThis authorized the use of propaganda within America \u2013 which had been illegal since 1948.\u201d", "Obama signed H.R. 4310, or the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, in January 2013, but nothing in that bill applies to what private media organizations in the U.S. are allowed, or not allowed, to report or publish. That independence is enshrined in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.", "In reality, one section of that massive bill lifted a decades-old ban on content produced by media organizations funded by the government\u2019s Broadcasting Board of Governors (now called the United States Agency for Global Media) from being distributed domestically.", "Some history: In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed into law a charter for Voice of America, a government-funded broadcast station. Its stated mission was to \u201cserve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news\u201d for the world. Included in its principles: \u201cVOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive \u2026 and will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions.\u201d", "Today, the U.S. Agency for Global Media oversees Voice of America and also supports other networks, such as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The agency\u2019s overarching mission is to \u201cinform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy.\u201d", "In a fact sheet, the agency said the 2013 change in the law \u201callows the agency and its broadcasters to respond positively to requests from within the United States for their content. Much, but not all, of this programming is now available online.\u201d Still, it notes, the agency \u201cis not authorized to begin broadcasting or to create programming for audiences in the United States. We do not seek to change that. USAGM continues to focus on overseas audiences.\u201d", "The agency rejects the notion that its supported outlets create \u201cpropaganda.\u201d", "\u201cOur journalists must abide by legally mandated\u00a0broadcasting standards and principles to present accurate and objective news and information,\u201d the agency\u2019s fact sheet said. \u201cThey provide responsible discussion and open debate in places where it is rare in the media. To call these efforts \u2018propaganda\u2019 is an affront to those journalists, many of whom work in some of the roughest spots in the world, putting themselves and their loved ones at great risk.\u201d", "Voice of America also notes that U.S. law guarantees a \u201cfirewall\u201d that \u201cprohibits interference by any U.S. government official in the objective, independent reporting of news, thereby safeguarding the ability of our journalists to develop content that reflects the highest professional standards of journalism, free of political interference \u2026 The firewall ensures that VOA can make the final decisions on what stories to cover, and how they are covered.\u201d", "Regardless of one\u2019s opinion about those organizations, the changes in law dealt with allowing government broadcasts created for international audiences to be made available in the U.S. As we said, the bill Obama signed didn\u2019t have anything to do with the reporting of traditional, private news organizations in the U.S.", "And while the posts blame Obama for the bill, it\u2019s worth noting that a Republican-controlled House approved the legislation in 2012 \u2014 with more Republicans (205) voting in favor than Democrats (110). The section of the bill that reversed restrictions on government-funded news programming originated as a separate bill with bipartisan support: the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act was co-sponsored by Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington, and Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Republican from Texas.", "In a press release at the time, Thornberry\u2019s office said that the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (known as the Smith-Mundt Act) was a \u201cCold War-era law that hampers diplomatic, defense, and other agencies\u2019 ability to communicate in the 21st century.\u201d", "\u201cFor example, in 2009 the law prohibited a Minneapolis-based radio station with a large Somali-American audience from replaying a Voice of America-produced piece rebutting terrorist propaganda,\u201d the release said.\u00a0 \u201cEven after the community was targeted for recruitment by al-Shabab and other extremists, government lawyers refused the replay request, noting that Smith-Mundt tied their hands.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
