Certainly, food supply and the health system. We still need water, electricity and the internet. Supply chains for critical things need to be maintained.

All but five states have exceptions for non-medical reasons. Some are for religious exemptions, some are for \"personal beliefs,\" and some are for both.

This came amid concerns about outbreaks of measles and other diseases that were believed to stem from growing opposition to vaccination.", "Ultimately, several states narrowed exemptions in 2019, including California, Maine, New York and Washington.
