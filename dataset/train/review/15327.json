["President Donald Trump recently cast himself as the hero in a story about a congressional race in North Carolina, according to a speech recently obtained by Bloomberg News.", "The congressional race was in North Carolina\u2019s 9th district, where Republican Dan Bishop defeated Democrat Dan McCready in a special election on Sept. 10.", "Trump\u2019s comments came during a private event in New York on Sept. 27. Trump told the crowd that Bishop was behind in the race until he visited North Carolina and tweeted about the race.", "\"But the candidate, Dan Bishop, won \u2014 by a lot. He was down by 17, and they had lines a mile long. I mean the lines going into those voting booths were unbelievable,\" Trump said, according to\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s transcript of the speech.", "This is at least the second time Trump has claimed that Bishop was down 17 points. The first came on the night of the election.", "\"Dan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race. Big Rally last night. Now it looks like he is going to win,\" he\u00a0tweeted.", "PolitiFact looked at publicly available polling, as well as the race results, to see whether Trump was correct about its competitiveness.", "We couldn\u2019t find any public poll that showed Bishop behind by 17 points, or even double-digits. And we found his description of the election results to be exaggerated.", "WHAT POLLS REPORTED", "The website FiveThirtyEight tracked some of the\u00a0polling of the district. No public poll had McCready up by 17. The most favorable poll for him had him up five points, and the poll most favorable to Bishop had him up four points.", "A\u00a0Co/Efficient poll\u00a0published three days before the election had McCready up three points. Public Policy Polling, known as\u00a0PPP, conducted a private poll of District 9 residents about two weeks prior to the election. That poll showed Bishop up, said Tom Jensen, the company\u2019s director.", "Vox, an online news source, conducted a\u00a0similar fact-check\u00a0and couldn\u2019t find a poll to support Trump\u2019s claims, either.", "The piece of polling that comes close to supporting Trump\u2019s claim was\u00a0tweeted\u00a0by Jim Blaine, a campaign consultant for Bishop. An internal campaign poll showed McCready up 14 percentage points on Bishop.", "But that poll is an outlier. And details \u2014 such as who conducted the survey, who responded to the survey, the date \u2014 aren\u2019t available to the public.", "PolitiFact contacted Blaine and Samantha Cotten, a regional communications director for Trump\u2019s campaign, but didn\u2019t receive a response by the time this fact check was published online.", "THE RESULTS", "Most experts considered the race a\u00a0toss-up, a surprise given the district\u2019s history.", "\"While we\u2019ve thought the Republicans were better positioned to win the NC-9 do-over special election \u2014 and that may end up being the case \u2014 the latest data, and the latest circumstances, suggest that the race is close enough that we should make it a Toss-up with less than a week to go until Tuesday\u2019s election,\" Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball,\u00a0wrote on Sept. 5.", "Trump won the district by 12 points in 2016. No Democrat had won the congressional race since 1963, according to the\u00a0Charlotte Observer.", "It didn\u2019t happen this year either.", "Bishop beat McCready by 3,788 votes \u2014 96,573 to 92,785. That breaks down to 50.69% of the vote for Bishop and 48.70% of the vote for McCready, a difference of 1.99 percentage points.", "Not exactly a blowout.", "OUR RULING", "Trump said Bishop was \"down by 17\" points in NC congressional race and then won \"by a lot.\" No public polls came close to supporting Trump\u2019s claim, and the final margin was only 2 percentage points. We rate this claim False.", "A tweet by President Donald Trump on Sept. 10, 2019.", "A tweet by Jim Blaine, campaign consultant for Republican Dan Bishop.", "Email correspondence with Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling in Raleigh, NC.", "Transcript of a speech President Donald Trump gave on Sept. 27, 2019, published online by Bloomberg News.", "An aggregation of polls conducted on North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District race, posted on FiveThirtyEight.com.", "Blog update by Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, \"House Ratings Changes: NC-9 do-over election going down to the wire,\" posted Sept. 5, 2019.", "Story by Vox, \"Trump brazenly rewrites history while giving himself credit for Dan Bishop\u2019s win,\" posted on Sept. 11, 2019.", "Story by the Charlotte Observer, \"He\u2019s not on the ballot, but Trump has jumped into NC\u2019s 9th District race. Will it work?\" posted Sept. 6, 2019.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
