["One post was published on Facebook here on March 4, 2020.", "Below is a screenshot of the post, which has since been deleted:", "The Sinhala-language text translates to English as:\u00a0\u201cThe awareness post issued by UNICEF to prevent infection of deadly coronavirus /\u00a0The coronavirus is comparatively larger and a cell diameter is about 400-500 micro. Therefore, any commonly available mask will prevent the entrance of the virus /\u00a0The virus does not remain in air and is grounded, therefore it is not airborne /\u00a0When the corona virus touches a metal surface, it can live up to 12 hours /\u00a0Therefore, it is enough to wash hands using soap and water /\u00a0When the coronavirus touches fabrics, it lives up to nine hours. Therefore, either washing the clothes or exposing them to sunlight for two hours will kill it /\u00a0When the virus touches the palms it can live up to 10 minutes. Therefore, disinfection can be done using alcohol /\u00a0If the virus is exposed to a temperature of 26-27 degrees it dies /\u00a0Warm water and sunlight will do this /\u00a0It is important to stay away from ice cream and other cold food /\u00a0The germs will be killed by warm water and garlic dipped in salt water and it will prevent the virus from leaking into the lungs /\u00a0By following these instructions, the viral infection can be prevented /\u00a0This is a translation of an UNICEF English article submitted by Doctor Nisali Ekanayake.\u201d", "A similar claim\u00a0about UNICEF\u00a0releasing the advisory was\u00a0made on Facebook here, here, here, here and here. The claim also circulated in Malaysia, such as on Facebook here; in the Philippines, including on Twitter here and on Facebook here and here; and in India, for example\u00a0on Facebook here, here and here.", "The purported advisory\u00a0was also shared widely among WhatsApp users with a similar claim,\u00a0as seen in the screenshot below:", "The claim is\u00a0false; UNICEF officials refuted the claim that they released\u00a0the guidelines.", "\u201cA recent erroneous online message circulating in several languages around the world and purporting to be a UNICEF communication appears to indicate, among other things, that avoiding ice cream and other cold foods can help prevent the onset of the disease. This is, of course, wholly untrue,\u201d Charlotte Petri Gornitzka, UNICEF\u2019s Deputy Executive Director for Partnerships, said in a statement on March 6, 2020.", "\u201cTo the creators of such falsehoods, we offer a simple message: STOP,\u201d Gornitzka added.", "\u201cSharing inaccurate information and attempting to imbue it with authority by misappropriating the names of those in a position of trust is dangerous and wrong.\u201d", "Jeremy Sprigge, a UNICEF Communications Specialist in Sri Lanka, also told AFP by email on March 5, 202 that the claims circulating on social media were \u201cnot issued by the agency and are therefore false\u201d.", "Furthermore, UNICEF Malaysia, UNICEF India and UNICEF Philippines both published tweets, here, here and here respectively, denying the organisation had released the purported advisory.", "UNICEF also urged those concerned about the coronavirus to refer to the agency\u2019s official website here.", "To keep ourselves and our loved ones safe from #coronavirus, it is critical to seek accurate information from verified sources, such as @UNICEF or @WHO, government health officials and trusted healthcare professionals. https://t.co/eC0ODBbWYP", "Much of\u00a0information listed in the misleading posts is inaccurate.", "Regarding the claim that masks will block the virus, for instance, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that masks only provide limited protection and has urged only health workers and people ill with coronavirus symptoms to wear masks.", "\u201cIf you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask,\u201d the organisation said. \u201cThere is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.\u201d", "The claim that sunlight and warm temperatures will kill the virus is also misleading. This article published on February 19, 2020 by Caixin, a Chinese financial and business news media group, cites several top Chinese health experts who note that while higher temperatures would decrease the survival time of the coronavirus, they do not affect its ability to infect.", "The posts also make misleading claims about the life span of the coronavirus on inanimate surfaces.", "The WHO notes that \u201cit is not certain\u201d how long the virus can survive on inanimate surfaces and states that the life span could range from a few hours to several days depending on varying conditions such as surface type, temperature and humidity.", "The claim that garlic water is an effective coronavirus remedy is also false and was debunked by AFP Fact Check\u00a0here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
