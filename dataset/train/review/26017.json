Jerry Brown was \"caught in the middle\" of a huge corruption probe.", "The April 17, 2017 headline on consjournal.com read \"CA Gov. Jerry Brown Caught in the Middle of a $60 Billion Corruption Investigation.\" Just below the headline is a giant, blaring graphic reading \"BREAKING NEWS.\"", "If correct, this would be a seismic story across California and the nation. We set out to see if there\u2019s even a hint of truth in this claim.", "Our research", "The article cites news reports in the Sacramento Bee and Los Angeles Times that detail a very real investigation Brown ordered into the Board of Equalization. The governor asked state prosecutors in April to examine claims that employees of the state tax agency misused state resources. The agency is headed by a five-person independent board elected by the public.", "The governor\u2019s call for action followed an audit by his administration that uncovered mismanagement in the tax agency, which is responsible for collecting $60 billion in taxes annually.", "Nothing, however, in the consjournal.com article or the Bee or the Times suggest that Brown is a subject of that investigation as the headline strongly implies.", "We asked consjournal.com for evidence Brown was \u2018caught in the middle\u2019 of the probe.

In October 2015, the website published an article with a reckless headline saying \"BREAKING: Illegal Aliens In California Able To VOTE, New Bill Just Signed.\"", "It referred to Brown\u2019s signing of the state\u2019s New Motor Voter Law that registers eligible citizens to vote when they obtain or renew their driver\u2019s license. There is a separate process that allows people in the country illegally to obtain a California driver\u2019s license. Those individuals are not given the option to register to vote.", "\"We\u2019ve built the protocols and the firewalls to not register people that aren\u2019t eligible,\" Alex Padilla, the state\u2019s top elections official told the Los Angeles Times in 2015. \"We\u2019re going to keep those firewalls in place.\"", "In March 2016, the website also published a misleading headline saying \"California Gov. Jerry Brown Says If Trump Is Elected He Will Build A Wall Around The State.\" Several lines into the article, it notes Brown added: \"By the way that is a joke. We don\u2019t like walls, we like bridges.\"", "Our rating", "The conservative website consjournal.com recently claimed in a headline that California Gov. Jerry Brown was \"Caught in the Middle of a $60 Billion Corruption Investigation.\"", "In reality, Brown ordered the investigation in question.", "There\u2019s no evidence in the corresponding story or in any articles by outlets that have covered the investigation in-depth to show the governor is in any way a subject of the probe.", "This isn\u2019t the website\u2019s first headline to mangle the truth about Brown and his administration.", "We rate its claim Pants On Fire.", "PANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.", "Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "Consjournal.com, \"CA Gov.
