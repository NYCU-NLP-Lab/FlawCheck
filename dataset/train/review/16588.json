Two illegal aliens, Ralphel Resindez, 23, and Enrico Garza, 26, probably believed they would easily overpower home-alone 11-year-old Patricia Harrington after her father had left their two-story home. It seems these crooks never learned two things: 1. They were in Montana. 2. Patricia had been a clay shooting champion since she was nine...\"", "The post goes on to say that the girl grabbed a shotgun and killed both men before police were able to arrive and that one of the immigrants had already killed another man during an earlier home invasion.
