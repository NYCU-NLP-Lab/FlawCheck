Rather, Alex Jones, who created the Infowars website, appears on camera to make the unfounded allegation that the president is being assassinated.", "\"President Trump is being given very dangerous experimental drugs that no one has ever been given together,\" Jones says in the video. \"President Trump is in great danger. Evidence is mounting that he\u2019s being deliberately killed at Walter Reed Military Hospital.\"", "He goes on to claim that the \"facts are overwhelming.\"", "\"Either the doctors at Walter Reed Medical Facility in DC are trying to kill President Trump,\" he says, \"or they are the most inept idiots in the medical field that modern history has ever seen.\"", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Here\u2019s what we know about the president\u2019s medical care since news broke that he tested positive for COVID-19.", "On Oct. 2, before he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, he was given an experimental antibody drug at the request of his physician, Dr. Sean Conley. It was given under \"compassionate use\" provisions, when an experimental medicine can be tapped on an emergency basis, the Associated Press reported. The drug, made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, is considered a promising approach to preventing serious illness from COVID-19 but it\u2019s still in late-stage testing and its safety and effectiveness are not known.", "At the medical center that day, Conley said that Trump had received remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug shown to help some COVID-19 patients recover faster. Trump was later given a steroid called dexamethasone, which has been shown to help very sick COVID-19 patients but could be dangerous if administered early after the onset of the disease.", "In addition to those drugs, Conley said that the president was also taking zinc, vitamin D, an antacid called famotidine, melatonin and aspirin.", "While there is nothing to suggest that the president is receiving these drugs and vitamins because medical professionals are trying to kill him, some doctors and researchers have questioned his care and expressed concerns that too many people involved could result in overtreatment, USA Today reported.", "\"Excessive care isn\u2019t necessarily good quality care,\" Dr. J. Randall Curtis, a University of Washington professor of pulmonary and critical care, said in the story.", "Alden Landry, an emergency medicine physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told USA Today that it\u2019s \"interesting and a bit concerning that they are trying so many therapies that are both experimental and unproven.\"", "\"They\u2019re pulling out all the stops,\" Dr. Eric Topol of the Scripps Research Translational Institute told USA Today. \"You just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because of the VIP syndrome \u2014\u00a0doing too much \u2014\u00a0or whether he\u2019s started to show some signs that it\u2019s taking a toll on his body.\"", "Several of the doctors USA Today interviewed supported the decision to try both the experimental antibody drug and remdesivir, according to the story, though the doctors also said they\u2019ve never been studied in combination.", "Conley, meanwhile, has said that doctors are using a \"multi-prong approach\" to treat the president.", "\"He is receiving all of the standard of care for routine, international COVID protocols,\" Conley said. \"If there was any possibility that it would add value to his care and expedite his return, I wanted to take it.\"", "Some experts have wondered whether the president is directing his own care, according to the New York Times, and if he is the one demanding intense treatment in spite of potential risks.", "Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that though he hasn\u2019t been involved in Trump\u2019s direct care, Conley among others treating the president \"are very good physicians and they\u2019re very qualified, so I\u2019m really confident that the president of the United States is getting the optimal care that you can get with the team over at Walter Reed.\"", "There are several guiding principles in the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics that conflict with a plot to kill the president. \"A physician shall, while caring for a patient, regard responsibility to the patient as paramount,\" for example. Also: \"A physician shall respect the law.\"", "And the law does not look kindly on anyone trying to assassinate a president, whether they\u2019re a doctor or not.
