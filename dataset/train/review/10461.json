In Wisconsin, third-degree sexual assault is defined as: \u201cWhoever has sexual intercourse with a person without the consent of that person is guilty of a Class G felony.\u201d", "Snopes reported on Blake's sexual assault charges in more detail here.

Police initially attempted to use a Taser on him and also said Blake admitted to having a knife. Ben Crump, a lawyer for Blake\u2019s family denied that Blake was carrying a knife and said he had been trying to break up a disturbance involving two women. Police shot Blake seven times in the back in front of his children. A neighbor recorded the shooting with a cellphone. Protests spread across Kenosha in the aftermath.
