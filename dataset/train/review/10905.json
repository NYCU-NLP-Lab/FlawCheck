["About this rating", "A video clip of a man (engineer Bruno Kammerl) in a neoprene suit shooting down a waterslide, flying off a ramp, traveling an amazingly long distance, and landing smack in the middle of a tiny wading pool hit the Internet in August 2009:", "This clip not a visual recording of a real event, but rather a viral advertisement for Microsoft Germany accomplished through a combination of video editing techniques as explained at NewTeeVee.com:", "It's a case of creative compositing, meaning that the clip we get to see is based on multiple elements that were combined together to create a final video. A stuntman slides down the slide, secured by a rope. Then there's a body flying through the air, which is animated. And finally, the big splash. \"He actually jumped from a wooden ramp into the pool,\" explained [Maik] Koenigs. Of course, you don\u2019t get to see any of this in the final clip, thanks to careful editing that makes it look like a single take.", "A clip from a portion of the shoot shows a stuntman going partway down the slide for the initial segment of the video:", "Nichols, Chris. \u00a0 \"Microsoft's Marketing Stunt Goes Viral.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Yahoo Finance!. \u00a0 13 August 2009.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
