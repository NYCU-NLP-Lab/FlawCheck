["About this rating", "A 14 July 2016 Bastille Day attack in Nice claimed more than 80 lives when a man plowed through a large crowd of celebrants with a truck.  Almost immediately, gun rights advocates began pointing out that the attacker had killed dozens of people without the use of a gun, prompting inevitable comparisons of calls for more stringent regulation of firearms with the folly of blaming vehicles and drivers for massacres such as the Nice tragedy:", "tfw you tell a US gun lover to stop using Nice attack as \"proof\" assault rifles are amazing & a cascade of morons descends on ur mentions ?", "\u2014 ekaterina (@katmikh) July 19, 2016", "Strict gun control does not stop terrorism!!! https://t.co/kUZHCqGv0d", "\u2014 Construction Machine (@c_machines) July 19, 2016", "Terrorists use cars, trucks, airplanes, bombs , guns: media calls for gun control.

The purchaser will have to fill out a lengthy application explaining why he needs a truck, and the application will limit the number of wheels that the truck can have.\u201d Presidential press secretary Josh Earnest clarified that any buyer wanting to acquire, rent or use a truck with more than 4 wheels would have to submit to an additional background check. He added that the definition of wheel falling under this limit includes both a steering wheel and any tires. Earnest explained, \u201cThe President imposed an executive order because the attack in France demonstrates that an immediate danger to the American people exists, one that cannot wait for the Republican-dominated Congress to act.\u201d", "Likely most of these pundits experienced the Political Writing Game article only as previewed on social media, referencing it without opening the underlying link and reading the article through.
