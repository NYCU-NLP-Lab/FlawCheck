["The GOP tax plan is fodder for campaign ads from both sides in Pennsylvania's special House election and races across the country.", "By Eugene Kiely and Lori Robertson", "Posted on March 7, 2018", "In a preview of this fall\u2019s midterm elections, Democrats and Republicans are airing TV ads in Pennsylvania\u2019s special House election and in swing congressional districts across the country that stretch the facts about the impact of the new tax law:", "The\u00a0Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0\u2014 a\u00a0Republican-crafted tax bill that President Donald Trump\u00a0signed\u00a0into law on Dec. 22 \u2014 is emerging as one of the major issues of the 2018 midterm congressional elections. Both parties are using the tax law to attack each other, and they\u2019re stretching the facts in the process.", "Ads attacking Republicans in three states use the misleading Democratic talking point that\u00a083 percent of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest 1 percent. As we\u2019ve written before, that\u2019s true for 2027 but only because most of the individual income tax changes are set to expire by then.", "In 2025, a quarter of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent.", "Republicans wrote the legislation with sunsetting tax cuts to meet Senate rules that enabled them to pass the bill with a simply majority (and no Democratic votes). They expect a future Congress to extend the individual income tax cuts, they say.", "The\u00a0Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic group, is making the claim in ads airing in Indiana, where Democratic Sen.

We\u2019ve written before that one might argue Republicans basically wrote this talking point for the Democrats by structuring the legislation with sunsetting individual tax cuts. But the claim still leaves\u00a0a misleading impression that the law is more lopsided than it actually is.", "In 2018, one-fifth of the tax cut benefits goes to the top 1 percent of income earners, according to an\u00a0analysis by the Tax Policy Center. In 2025, a quarter goes to the top 1 percent \u2014 a sizable percentage but far below the 83 percent figure. Those wealthy taxpayers in 2025 would earn more than $837,800 and get an average tax cut of $61,090, the TPC says.", "Senate Majority PAC sent us support for the ad, which includes a Dec. 18 Vox article that notes: \u201c[E]ven in the first years of the bill\u2019s implementation, when it\u2019s an across-the-board tax cut, the benefits of the law would be heavily concentrated among the upper-middle and upper-class Americans, with nearly two-thirds of the benefit going to the richest fifth of Americans in 2018.\u201d That\u2019s correct, per the TPC analysis, and it\u2019s still the case in 2025.", "But Democrats instead have focused on the most lopsided figures for 2027, when\u00a0the percentage of benefits going to the top 1 percent more than triples to 82.8 percent, \u201cbecause almost all individual income tax provisions\u00a0would sunset after 2025,\u201d says the TPC. The corporate tax cuts remain in effect, including the drop in the top corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, and wealthy individuals still get some benefits from those remaining cuts.", "Republicans included sunsetting individual income tax cuts in their bill so they could pass it through budget reconciliation, which requires only a majority vote in the Senate. Under reconciliation, lawmakers couldn\u2019t add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, or add to the deficit beyond those 10 years.", "GOP lawmakers\u00a0say\u00a0they expect a future Congress to extend those cuts.", "Not One Penny is running another ad in Iowa\u2019s 1st and 3rd Districts that claims:\u00a0\u201cFor people who have to work for a living, Rod Blum\u2019s [or David Young\u2019s] vote raises taxes on the majority of Americans.\u201d The ad shows a CNBC headline that reads, \u201cGOP plan will ultimately raise taxes on 50% of Americans, nonpartisan assessment says.\u201d", "But that again pertains to the year 2027, \u201clargely because the legislation\u2019s personal tax cuts expire in 2026,\u201d as the\u00a0Associated Press story on CNBC\u2019s website says. Before that year, the vast majority of Americans get a tax cut under the law.", "In 2018, 80.4 percent of all taxpayers get a tax cut, and in 2025, 75.5 percent get a tax cut, according to the Tax Policy Center analysis.", "It\u2019s worth noting that the average tax hike on 50 percent of Americans in 2027 isn\u2019t particularly large. In the middle fifth of taxpayers, those earning between $54,700 and $93,200, 70 percent would see a tax increase that year, compared with what they would have paid in the absence of the new tax legislation.

Lawmakers have talked about the need to cut the growth of spending in these programs in order to reduce deficits, and reducing Medicare spending was part of the president\u2019s budget proposal.", "It\u2019s not unusual to hear politicians of both parties talk about reducing the growth of Medicare in particular, as we\u2019ve explained before. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that deficits will continue to rise over the next three decades, \u201cbecause spending growth is projected to outpace growth in revenues.\u201d Charts on the spending growth show that Social Security and major health care programs make up about half of that spending growth. \u201cIn particular, spending as a share of GDP increases for Social Security, the major health care programs (primarily Medicare), and interest on the government\u2019s\u00a0debt,\u201d the CBO said, citing the aging of the population for much of the growth in Social Security and Medicare.", "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is expected to exacerbate the problem. The Hill wrote in a Dec. 3 story: \u201cThe projected increase in the debt from the tax package could make the situation worse, budget experts say.\u201d William Hoagland,\u00a0senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told the newspaper that \u201c[i]f we are talking about the kinds of deficits\u201d that are projected from the tax bill, \u201centitlement cuts are definitely on the table.\u201d", "Republicans have said that the tax cuts will produce significant economic growth, and therefore revenue. But even taking into consideration macroeconomic effects, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the tax cuts would add $1.1 trillion to the deficit over 10 years.", "The story cited in the Senate Majority ads\u00a0is a December article in U.S. News and World Report and is based on Democrats expressing concern with some remarks made by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.", "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit,\u201d Ryan said on Dec. 6 on The Ross Kaminsky Show on talk radio, adding that \u201cit\u2019s\u00a0the\u00a0health\u00a0care entitlements that are the big drivers of our debt.\u201d", "But by January,\u00a0Ryan said he didn\u2019t think the House would address Medicare changes (or Social Security) this year, adding that he wants a \u201cbipartisan consensus\u201d on those issues.", "The Lamb ad points to a Newsweek article from Dec. 1, on Rubio\u2019s comments. He spoke generally about making changes in Medicare and Social Security for \u201cfuture beneficiaries\u201d to reduce the growth of the debt and deficits.", "Here\u2019s the fuller quote from Rubio, made in an interview with Politico\u00a0when he was asked about concerns that the GOP tax plan would increase the deficit. The part in bold appeared in the Newsweek story:", "Rubio, Nov. 29, 2017,\u00a0Politico interview (starting at the 21:46 mark):\u00a0The argument would be we can\u2019t cut taxes because it will drive up the deficit. That assumes that somehow we can fix the deficit through higher taxes, and we can\u2019t. The only way you\u2019re going to deal with the debt is you have to do two things. \u2026 You have got to, you have got to generate economic growth, because growth generates revenue. But you also have to bring spending under control. And not discretionary spending. That isn\u2019t the driver of our debt. The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries.", "We still have time not just to save those programs but to responsibly structure them in a way that doesn\u2019t impact current retirees or people about to retire, but in a way that would probably impact it for me and people younger than me \u2014 in ways that quite frankly you wouldn\u2019t really notice and you wouldn\u2019t really object to, because it\u2019s reasonable. And if we did that in combination with growth, you can begin to bring the trajectory of the debt to a responsible and acceptable level. That is the only way forward.", "The Florida senator\u2019s remarks make clear he wasn\u2019t talking about a concrete plan to cut Medicare and Social Security, but rather his thoughts in general on reducing the debt.", "After that interview, in\u00a0late December, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said changes to Medicare and Medicaid were off the table for 2018.\u00a0\u201cI think Democrats are not going to be interested in entitlement reform, so I would not expect to see that on the agenda,\u201d he said,\u00a0according to the Washington Post. \u201cWhat the Democrats are willing to do is important, because in the Senate, with rare exceptions like the tax bill, we have to have Democratic involvement.\u201d", "The Post story noted that \u201cDemocrats are already warning Republicans against attempting to force any reductions to entitlement spending, making it almost certain that if the GOP goes ahead with such changes, they will be doing so without any Democratic support \u2014 and exposing themselves to attacks on the campaign trail.\u201d", "But they\u2019re being attacked on this point anyway, despite not moving ahead with such spending cuts.", "In its support for the ads, Senate Majority also points to the president\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal 2019. It would reduce Medicare spending by $236 billion over 10 years, Reuters reported. But the news service noted: \u201cThere is little chance of those cuts becoming real, as presidential budgets are rarely enacted by the U.S. Congress, which controls federal purse strings.\u201d", "The Associated Press reported that Trump\u2019s proposed changes to Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program would \u201ccreate winners and losers,\u201d with some seniors saving money and others paying more.", "We don\u2019t know whether Congress will move forward on such a prescription drug plan. McConnell has said he doesn\u2019t expect Medicare to be on the Senate\u2019s agenda this year.", "So, there\u2019s no \u201cplan\u201d to\u00a0cut Medicare, or Social Security, as these campaign ads claim. Nor have Republicans said they\u2019d \u201cpay\u201d for their tax cut with such spending reductions. But the Democrats have a point that Republican lawmakers have discussed the need to reduce spending on those programs to lower long-term deficits \u2014 deficits that the tax cuts are expected to boost.", "Republican groups have been proactive in promoting the benefits of the new tax law \u2014 not only in Pennsylvania\u2019s special election but across the country, mostly in competitive districts.", "American Action Network, a Republican political group organized as a\u00a0501(c)(4)\u00a0nonprofit, announced on March 5 that it would spend $1 million on a TV ad campaign in 24 House districts in 16 states.", "The ad features Natalie Mihalek, a young mother of three small children, who thanks Congress for passing the tax bill, which she says increased her take-home pay because her employer is now withholding less in federal income tax. (Mihalek is a Republican who ran for the Pennsylvania Senate in 2015 and\u00a0lost.) On the screen, the ad displays these words: \u201c$2,000 middle class tax cut.\u201d", "The ad offers no source for the $2,000 claim, but it is a familiar Republican talking point developed by the Republican staff of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. The GOP staff\u00a0estimates\u00a0that \u201cthe\u00a0typical family of four earning the median family income of\u00a0$73,000\u201d will save $2,059.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan frequently cites the $2,059 figure, which is displayed prominently on his website. Trump cited the figure in remarks on March 7 to a Latino business group.", "The estimate is accurate, but only for certain families \u2013 specifically those that have younger children and do not itemize their deductions. And even for that family, the tax savings will dwindle over time.", "The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center released a report on Dec. 22 that looked at how \u201crepresentative families\u201d would fare under the new law. Two of those families had adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 \u2013 which is close to the \u201ctypical family\u201d that Republicans say will save $2,059.", "The Tax Policy Center\u00a0calculated that a family of four with two young children (younger than 17 years old) and an adjusted gross income of $75,000 would see a tax savings of $2,119 in 2018. But the savings would be nearly half that ($1,119) for a couple earning the same amount ($75,000) but with two older children (17 and 18 years old). That\u2019s because of changes to the child tax credit and elimination of the personal exemptions.", "As we explain in our guide to the tax changes, the new law increases the standard deduction from $12,700 to $24,000 for a married couple filing jointly. It also doubles the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000. But the new law eliminates the personal exemption, which is\u00a0$4,050 per person.", "The couple with the younger children would benefit from the increased child tax credit. But that tax credit is only for children 16 years old and younger. For older children, parents would receive $500 per dependent \u2014 which cuts deeply into their tax savings.", "Also, the couple with the younger children would see their $2,059 tax cut reduced over time. That\u2019s because the child tax credit \u2014 unlike the old personal exemption \u2014 is not indexed to inflation, and it expires in 2025. \u201cWhile the higher CTC would help many families today, inflation would erode the additional benefit over time,\u201d Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center,\u00a0writes.", "Tax Policy Center, Dec. 22, 2017: Over time, the net benefit of the combination of an expanded CTC and the loss of personal exemptions would narrow because the personal exemption amount is indexed for inflation but the CTC is not. Because all the individual income tax provisions of the TCJA would expire after 2025 except for the less generous inflation measure for indexing the tax system, both families would see a modest tax increase in 2027.", "By 2027, both of the couples would be paying $150 more in taxes, the Tax Policy Center says. TPC did not provide estimates for years other than 2018 and 2027.", "In Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District, the Congressional Leadership Fund has\u00a0aired several ads that attack Lamb, the Democratic candidate, for opposing the GOP tax law changes.", "One ad (below) starts by saying, \u201cConor Lamb isn\u2019t telling you the truth.

Lamb\u00a0tweeted this in response to Sen.

We were promised infrastructure & jobs, instead we get big tax cuts for the rich written by & for corporate lobbyists. People in #PA18 are tired of being lied to. We\u2019ll put an end to this hypocrisy on March 13th.\u201d", "As it did in other ads airing in the Pennsylvania race, the Congressional Leadership Fund says in this ad that the new tax law will provide a \u201c$2,900\u00a0middle-class tax cut\u201d for taxpayers in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District. That\u2019s more than a third higher than the Republicans say the \u201ctypical family\u201d in the U.S. would receive.", "The\u00a0ad provides no information on which families\u00a0might see a $2,900 tax cut \u2014 except for a footnote that gives the source as the House Ways and Means Committee. On its website, the Republican committee staff says it estimated how much the tax cut would save families in every congressional district based on the U.S. Census median household income for a family of four in that district.", "For the 18th Congressional District in Pennsylvania, the committee based its estimate on a household income of $100,920.\u00a0But the median household income for a family with children under 18 years old in the 18th District is $91,983, according to the U.S. Census. The median family income \u2014 which takes into account all family types \u2014 is $81,024 for that district.", "The $2,900 savings is also subject to the same caveats as the $2,000 savings for the \u201ctypical\u201d U.S. family. The tax cut would be less for families with children 17 years and older, and the tax savings would be smaller over time as certain provisions of the law take effect or expire.", "As we have said before, the impact of the tax bill varies, depending on each taxpayer\u2019s income, tax credits, deductions and expenses.
