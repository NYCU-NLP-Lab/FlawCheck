["About this rating", "In September 2018, Nike's announcement of a commercial deal with free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick prompted fierce debate over the national anthem protests led by Kaepernick, as well as widespread calls for a boycott of Nike products.", "Kaepernick began to \"take a knee\" during the playing of the national anthem in 2016 as a protest against racial injustice and police brutality and was at the forefront of such protests among National Football League players and staff.", "In the days following the announcement, we received multiple enquiries from readers about a letter purportedly written by the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) which called upon its members to boycott Nike.", "The letter is authentic and was issued by NAPO president Michael McHale, addressed to Nike CEO Mark Parker. NAPO is a law enforcement union founded in 1978 and described as representing 241,000 officers from more than 1,000 police organizations.", "The letter, dated 4 September, read as follows:", "On behalf of the more than 241,000 law enforcement officers represented by our Association across the country, I write to you to condemn in the strongest possible terms your selection of Colin Kaepernick for Nike\u2019s \u201cJust Do It\u201d ad campaign. Mr. Kaepernick is known, not as a successful athlete, but as a shallow dilettante seeking to gain notoriety by disrespecting the flag for which so many Americans have fought and died ...", "In featuring Mr. Kaepernick in the \u201cJust Do It\u201d campaign, Nike grossly insults the men and women who really do make sacrifices for the sake of our nation. We are calling on all our member officers, their families and friends to join in boycotting all Nike products.", "NAPO was joined in critizing Nike and Kaepernick by the National Fraternal Order of Police, whose president, Chuck Canterbury, issued a press release addressing (but not calling for) a boycott of Nike:", "Press Release on Nike\"Since 2016, 381 cops have been killed in the line of duty. They believed in something and sacrificed everything as did the families they left behind.

In our experience, boycotts and similar exercises do not succeed and often serve only to enrich the company -- which is not what we want to do. Our members and, for that matter, any American citizen understands when the law enforcement profession is being insulted -- we have no doubt they will make their purchases with that insult in mind.", "These vehement criticisms sparked something of a controversy among police unions, with the National Black Police Association (NBPA) issuing a strong rejection of McHale's letter. On 5 September, NBPA chairperson Sonia Y.W. Pruitt wrote a letter of her own to Nike's CEO, offering the support of her organization's members:", "The National Black Police Association is not in agreement with NAPO on this matter, and we strongly condemn their call for police officers and their families to boycott Nike and its products ... NAPO believes that Mr. Kaepernick's choice to openly protest issues surrounding police brutality, racism and social injustices in this country makes him anti-police. On the contrary, the NBPA believes that Mr. Kaepernick's stance is in direct alignment with what law enforcement stands for -- the protection of a people, their human rights, their dignity, their safety, and their rights as American citizens ...", "The NBPA proudly supports Nike and your use of Mr. Kaepernick in you new \"Just Do It\" advertising campaign...We will likely be buying and wearing Nike products in the near future.", "Maaddi, Rob. \u00a0 \"Colin Kaepernick's Nike Deal Prompts Flurry of Debate.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Associated Press. \u00a0 5 September 2018.", "KDFW-TV. \u00a0 \"National Police Group Calls for Nike Boycott Due to Kaepernick Ad Campaign.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0  4 September 2018.", "McHale, Michael. \u00a0 \"Letter to Mark Parker Re: Colin Kaepernick and Nike's 'Just Do It' Campaign.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 National Association of Police Organizations. \u00a0 4 September 2018.", "National Fraternal Order of Police. \u00a0 \"Press Release -- FOP Responds to Nike's New Ad Campaign.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 4 September 2018.", "Pruitt, Sonia Y.W. \u00a0 \"Letter to Mark Parker.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 National Black Police Association. \u00a0 5 September 2018.", "Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the National Fraternal Order of Police had called for a boycott of Nike.", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
