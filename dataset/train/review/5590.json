["About this rating", "Nicholas Sandmann (sometimes referred to as the \u201cMAGA hat kid\u201d) and the McCloskeys (sometimes referred to as the \"gun-toting St. Louis couple\") are on the official list of featured speakers at the Republican National Convention.", "Dr. Stella Immanuel, Scott Baio, Kid Rock, and Mike Lindell are not on the official list of RNC speakers.", "The list of featured speakers at the 2020 Republican National Convention (RNC) was announced on Aug. 23, as the party ramped up for the November presidential election in which their candidate, incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump, would face off against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.", "Before the official announcement was made, a meme (see above) began circulating on Facebook highlighting a supposed list of featured speakers ranging from the absurd to the plausible. The meme included names of people who have gained prominence over the past few years for their connection to right-wing movements and conspiracy theories.", "We went through the real list \u2014 available here \u2014 and learned that only a few of these people are actually going to speak at the RNC, which begins on Monday, Aug. 24.", "Firstly, the student often described as \"the MAGA hat kid from Covington Catholic\u201d will indeed be speaking at the second day of the convention. Nicholas Sandmann was a high school student at the center of a viral video from early 2019. In the video, Sandmann was wearing a Make America Great Again hat and was in Washington, D.C., for the March for Life rally. The video appeared to show him staring down a Native American activist who played a drum. Mainstream and social media commentators accused Sandmann of harassing the activist, but a longer version of that video contradicted the notion. Sandmann sued CNN and The Washington Post for defamation surrounding their coverage of the incident, in cases that were later settled for undisclosed amounts.", "Next up is Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow, a pillow manufacturing company, and Trump\u2019s friend. He has been promoting oleandrin, a toxic botanical extract, as a treatment for COVID-19, despite a lack of proof that it works. He does not appear to be on the speaker\u2019s list, though he will be speaking at a Republican fundraiser in September. (Update: Though he was not a featured speaker, Lindell did speak briefly during the roll call portion of the convention.)", "Third on the list is Dr. Stella Immanuel, nicknamed \u201cThe Demon Sperm Doctor\u201d in the meme. Immanuel gained notoriety after Trump himself pushed her theories that face masks were not necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19. She has also said that a range of medical issues usually occurring in women are caused by demonic sperm after having sex with demons. She is not speaking at the convention.", "Actor Scott Baio spoke at the 2016 RNC, while musician Kid Rock was being considered for a performance at this year's convention before the pandemic struck in 2020. Neither appear to be on the official speaker\u2019s list for 2020.", "Finally, Mark and Patricia McCloskey (dubbed \"the racist gun couple\u201d in the meme) are, in fact, speaking on the first day of the RNC. The duo brandished their firearms at Black Lives Matter protesters in St. Louis in June 2020 in the wake of police custody deaths of Black men that resulted in nationwide demonstrations.", "Only three people \u2014 including a couple \u2014 named in this meme will actually be speaking at the RNC. As such, we rate this claim \"Mostly False.\"", "Booker, Brakkton.\u00a0 \u00a0\"St. Louis Couple Who Waved Guns At Black Lives Matter Protesters To Speak At RNC.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0NPR.\u00a0 \u00a018 August 2020.", "Donaldjtrump.com.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Trump Campaign Announces Speakers for this Week's Historic Republican National Convention.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a023 August 2020.", "Haggery, Meredith.\u00a0 \u00a0\"The MyPillow Guy, Explained by Someone Who Read his Memoir.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Vox.\u00a0 \u00a019 August 2020.", "Johnson, Ted.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Nick Sandmann, Student At Center Of Viral Video, Settles Defamation Lawsuit Against Washington Post.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Deadline.\u00a0 \u00a024 July 2020.", "McCaskill, Nolan D.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Trump Campaign Announces Speakers for Republican Convention.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Politico.\u00a0 \u00a023 August 2020.", "Morrill, Jim, and Tim Funk.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Bill O\u2019Reilly, Britney Spears and Celebrations Galore: The Parties that Went Poof at RNC.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Charlotte Observer.\u00a0 \u00a021 August 2020.", "Sommer, Will.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Trump\u2019s New Favorite COVID Doctor Believes in Alien DNA, Demon Sperm, and Hydroxychloroquine.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Daily Beast.\u00a0 \u00a028 July 2020.", "Swan, Jonathan.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Trump Eyes New Unproven Coronavirus \"Cure\".\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Axios.\u00a0 \u00a016 August 2020.", "The Perry News.\u00a0 \u00a0\"My Pillow Guy to Headline Annual Dallas County GOP Fundraiser.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a016 August 2020.", "Zaru, Deena.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Scott Baio, Donald Trump Supporter, to Speak at Republican Convention.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0CNN.\u00a0 \u00a016 August 2020.", "Update [Sept. 2, 2020]: Updated to note that Mike Lindell spoke briefly during the roll call.", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
