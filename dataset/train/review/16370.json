But the ruling goes for all religions.", "In a June 17, 1963 opinion, then-Supreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark wrote that the subject of religion could still be taught in schools. He wrote: \u201cIt might well be said that one\u2019s education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities.
