["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "In their race for a U.S. Senate seat, Democrat Tammy Baldwin and Republican Tommy Thompson depict each other as out of touch with the typical Wisconsin voter.\n\nThe Madison congresswoman brands Thompson as a wealthy insider who is \"not for you anymore.\" And the former governor labels Baldwin an extreme liberal.\n\nThompson continued his line of attack on WISN-AM in Milwaukee on Sept. 27, 2012, hours before his first debate with Baldwin. He told conservative talk show host Jay Weber that Baldwin\u2019s \"philosophy is to spend as much money as possible and forget about the consequences of the next generation, the consequences of the declining dollar, the consequences of our debt load.\"\n\n\"In fact she is so liberal -- I don\u2019t know if people out there really know this -- she joined the Progressive Caucus, which introduced a budget that spent trillions -- not billions, trillions -- more money than the Obama budget.\" \u00a0\n\nIn the same vein, Thompson during the debate called Baldwin the House\u2019s \"number one spender\" and alluded to her support of \"increased spending\" with the Progressive Caucus budget.\n\nLet\u2019s see if Thompson\u2019s right about the trillions.\n\nThe caucus\n\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus, according to its website, consists of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, and 75 Democratic members of the House of Representatives. Baldwin is a vice-chair of the group.\n\nThe caucus gained attention when U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., claimed in April 2012 that its members were members of the Communist Party. That rated a Pants on Fire from PolitiFact Florida, which confirmed through the Communist Party USA that no members of Congress are members of its party.\n\nThe fiscal 2012 budget proposed by the Progressive Caucus was what Thompson was referring to when he made his trillions more comment about Baldwin, Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe told us.\n\nThat plan, unveiled in April 2011, was offered as an alternative to budgets proposed by President Barack Obama and by House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee.\n\nBaldwin did vote for the caucus budget, which was introduced as an amendment to Ryan\u2019s budget. The amendment failed in the House, 347-77.\n\nBudget comparisons\n\nThe Progressive Caucus budget would have spent $44.5 trillion from 2012 to 2021, according to an analysis done for the caucus by the labor-backed Economic Policy Institute.\n\nTo see how that compared with Obama\u2019s plan over 10 years, we contacted experts from two nonpartisan think tanks: Taxpayers for Common Sense, a government spending watchdog; and the Concord Coalition, which seeks balanced federal budgets.\n\nThey agreed that Obama\u2019s fiscal 2012 spending plan called for $46 trillion in spending.\n\nThat\u2019s $1.5 trillion more than the Progressive Caucus Budget.\n\nSo, Thompson was wrong when he said the Baldwin-backed caucus would spend \"trillions more\" than Obama\u2019s budget.\n\nThompson has said, in prepared statements before and after his radio interview, that the Progressive Caucus budget would have raised trillions more in taxes than Obama\u2019s budget. And our experts agreed the caucus budget would have collected $42 trillion in taxes over 10 years, some $5 trillion more than Obama\u2019s.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t Thompson\u2019s claim on the radio.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, raising taxes doesn\u2019t automatically mean a corresponding increase in spending. Indeed, The Economist magazine, among others, pointed out the Progressive Caucus budget would have reduced federal deficits more than both the Obama and Ryan budgets -- primarily because of its higher taxes and cuts in defense spending.\n\nOur rating\n\nThompson claimed Baldwin supported the Progressive Caucus budget, which he said spent \"trillions more\" than a budget from Obama.\n\nBaldwin did back the proposal, which would have raised taxes by trillions more than the president. But the caucus plan would have actually spent less money than the Obama plan.\n\nWe rate Thompson\u2019s statement False.", "WISN-AM, Jay Weber interview of Tommy Thompson, Sept. 27, 2012\n\nTommy Thompson campaign, news release, Oct. 1, 2012\n\nTommy Thompson campaign, news release, Sept. 25, 2012\n\nThe Washington Post, \"The House progressive budget,\" April 25, 2011\n\nThe Atlantic, \"The plan to raise taxes by $7 trillion,\" April 25, 2011\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee, news release, Sept. 25, 2012\n\nCongressional Progressive Caucus, fiscal 2012 budget proposal\n\nCongressional Progressive Caucus, fiscal 2013 budget proposal\n\nGovTrack.us, House vote on Progressive Caucus budget amendment, April 15, 2011\n\nThe Economist, \"The courageous Progressive Caucus budget,\" April 22, 2011\n\nInterview and email, The Concord Coalition policy director Josuha Gordon, Oct. 2, 2012\n\nInterview and email, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget policy director Jason Peuquet, Oct. 2, 2012\n\nInterview and email, Taxpayers for Common Sense vice-president Steve Ellis, Oct. 2 and 3, 2012\n\nWTMJ-TV, video of Tommy Thompson-Tammy Baldwin debate, Sept. 28, 2012\n\nEmail interview, Tammy Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus, Oct. 2, 2012\n\nEmail interview, Tommy Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe, Oct. 2, 2012\n\nEconomic Policy Institute, analysis (Table S-1) of Congressional Progressive Caucus fiscal 2012 budget\n\nCongressional Budget Office, analysis of President Barack Obama\u2019s fiscal 2012 budget (Table 1-2), April 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
