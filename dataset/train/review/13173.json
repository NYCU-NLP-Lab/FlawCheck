Today we honor this great man and the legacy of love and unity he left behind.\"", "The above is a genuine photograph of Martin Luther King, Jr. sitting in the back seat of a police vehicle in the company of a police dog. However, we couldn't find any credible sources to support the claim that the dog had been put there in an attempt to intimidate King, or that King and the dog subsequently \"became friends.\"", "The photograph was taken on 12 June 1964 and captured King and the dog as they were being escorted back to jail from King's grand jury testimony in St. Augustine, Florida, following his arrest the day prior for staging a sit-in at a segregated restaurant.", "Here are some other images of King and the dog in the police car, as well as the captions that accompanied them from the Associated Press, the State Library and Archives of Florida, and the Civil Rights Library of St. Augustine:", "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. rides in the back seat of a police car with a police dog as he is returned to jail in St. Augustine, Fla., after testifying before a grand jury investigating racial unrest in the city, June 12, 1964.
