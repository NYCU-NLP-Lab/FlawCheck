The third and largest package included one-time $1,200 payments to many Americans, temporary $600-per-week bonuses on unemployment checks, and loans and grants to small businesses.", "Two days after the Treasury announcement, Paul was asked on Fox News' \"America's Newsroom\" whether there will be a fourth stimulus.", "\"To people who ask me, I remind them that we have no money. We have no rainy day account, we have no savings account,\" he said. \"The $3 trillion that we've already passed out is imaginary money. It's being borrowed basically from China.
