["Pundits are dissecting the complicated legacy of Attorney General Eric Holder, who intends to resign the position he\u2019s had since 2009 when the Senate confirms his successor.", "Some have analyzed the move with less accuracy than others.", "Jane Harman, a former Democratic congresswoman from California and CEO of the Wilson Center, argued Holder accomplished many good things as the nation\u2019s first black attorney general, but he could be faulted \"for being politically tone-deaf.\"", "\"And some of the things he did I think backfired. Not dropping Fast and Furious, which started in the Bush administration, was a mistake,\" she said during a Sept. 28 Fox News Sunday panel. \"Not notifying people about the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed trial in New York before he announced it, was a mistake. And not -- and the timing of the indictments of the Chinese was a mistake. But on balance is, I think his tone and his professionalism and his focus on race were pluses.\"", "Harman\u2019s claim about the origin of the Justice Department\u2019s controversial \"Fast and Furious\" program was flagged by one of our readers. It is inaccurate.", "President Barack Obama made the same error during the 2012 election season in describing the program\u2019s launch. PolitiFact rated his claim that it started \"under the previous administration\" as False.", "The \"Fast and Furious\" operation started in October 2009, about 10 months into Obama\u2019s first term. Under the program, federal agents based in Arizona allowed straw buyers to buy guns in the United States and cross into Mexico so the weapons could be traced to, in theory, high-level drug cartel members.", "The idea backfired when two guns that the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had lost track of were found at the crime scene of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, who was killed Dec. 14, 2010.", "Investigations launched by Congress and the Justice Department in the wake of Terry\u2019s death found many flaws with the \"gun-walking\" program designed by ATF\u2019s Phoenix Field Division to go after cartels.", "So Fast and Furious doesn\u2019t date back to Bush.", "But the idea of gun-walking in general does trace back to the previous administration.", "The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general noted that the gun-walking strategy originated in the ATF\u2019s Phoenix office under a 2006 program named \"Operation Wide Receiver.\"", "Operation Wide Receiver unfolded between March 2006 and December 2007 with ATF agents based in Tucson. The agents knew firearms were being purchased by straw buyers for illegal use in Mexico but did not go after the weapons. Ultimately, the inspector general\u2019s report found that the agents did not make any arrests as a result of the program and seized fewer than 100 of about 400 firearms that were purchased.", "Harman said via a spokesman, \"The gun-walking program began in 2006 under the Bush Administration. It had a different name, but it was a similar program.\"", "Our ruling", "Harman said Fast and Furious \"started in the Bush administration.\"", "Like a similarly worded claim from Obama two years ago, her claim is inaccurate. There was a\u00a0program run by ATF\u2019s Phoenix Field Division called Operation Wide Receiver that started\u00a0during the Bush administration, but Operation Fast and Furious was a specific effort launched after Obama took office in 2009.", "We rate her claim False.", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Barack Obama said Fast and Furious began under Bush,\" Sept. 24, 2012", "Fox News Sunday transcript, Sept. 28, 2014", "Minority staff of U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee report, \"Fatally Flawed: Five years of gunwalking in Arizona,\" Jan. 31, 2012", "U.S. Department of Justice, \"A review of ATF\u2019s Operation Fast and Furious and related matters,\" September 2012", "ABC News, \"President Obama falsely claims Fast and Furious program \u2018begun under the previous administration,\u2019 \" Sept. 21, 2012", "The Washington Post\u2019s The Fact Checker, \"Obama\u2019s Univision denial that Fast and Furious started on his watch,\" Sept. 21, 2012", "Interview with Drew Sample, Wilson Center spokesman, Sept. 28, 2014", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
