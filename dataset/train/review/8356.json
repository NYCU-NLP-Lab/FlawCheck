It was part of Transport for New South Wales' \"Towards Zero\" campaign that sought to \"highlight the human element of the road toll and encourage all road users to change the way we think about road safety,\" with the goal of reducing traffic fatalities to zero.", "In the original video, a man in the street was interviewed, informed that \"last year, 347 people died on our roads,\" and asked what he thought would be a more acceptable number of deaths. After the man replied \"70,\" the announcer proceeded to show him what a group of 70 people looks like by bringing out 70 members of the man's family:", "https://youtu.be/ra5LK8x86zU\n\nA man is interviewed in the street.", "Interviewer: So last year, 347 people died on our roads. What do you think would be a more acceptable number?", "Man: Um, acceptable, 70 maybe, probably 70.", "[The interviewer speaks into a radio.]", "Interviewer: Can you send 70?", "[A group of 70 people emerges from around a corner and walks toward the man. They are all members of his family.]", "Interviewer: Actually, this is what 70 people looks like.", "[The man realises the people are all members of his family.]", "Man: That\u2019s my family.", "Interviewer: So, now what do you think would be a more acceptable number?", "Man: Zero ... zero.", "Regardless of the underlying subject, the message remains a powerful one: It's sometimes all too easy for us to consider deaths as a mere abstraction or statistic -- as something that happens to other, faceless people -- when making life-and-death decisions, but our viewpoint becomes a very different one when we ponder the potential outcome of those decisions on people we know and love.", "Transport for New South Wales. \u00a0 \"Towards Zero.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 12 May 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
