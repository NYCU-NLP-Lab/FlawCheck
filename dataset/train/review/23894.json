Save the company name, it was practically a carbon copy of previous anniversary scams. As we previously reported:", "These web pages (which are not operated or sponsored by the companies they reference) typically ask the unwary to click what appear to be Facebook \u201cshare\u201d buttons and post comments to the scammer\u2019s site (which is really a ruse to dupe users into spreading the scam by sharing it with all of their Facebook friends). Those who follow such instructions are then led into a set of pages prompting them to input a fair amount of personal information (including name, age, address, and phone numbers), complete a lengthy series of surveys, and finally sign up (and commit to paying) for at least two \u201cReward Offers\u201d (e.g., Netflix subscriptions, credit report monitoring services, prepaid credit cards).", "Bond Huberman is a former editor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
