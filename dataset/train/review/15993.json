["By Ilana Nathans", "Posted on June 12, 2020", "A Facebook meme falsely claims a Colorado bill is \u201cremoving exemptions\u201d for parents who don\u2019t want to vaccinate their children in order to attend school. The bill adds new requirements to opt out of vaccinations, but does offer medical and nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal beliefs.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than 2 million cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., including more than 113,000 deaths, in mid-June, as state governments considered how to prevent the spread of the disease in schools once a vaccine is available.", "The state House of Representatives in Colorado \u2014 where child vaccination rates are among the lowest in the nation \u2014 passed the School Entry Immunization Bill, SB20-163, on June 10. The bill, which returned to the Senate for another vote, is aimed at increasing vaccination rates, and it formalizes the process for receiving a nonmedical exemption for an immunization.", "But a\u00a0meme circulating on Facebook and other versions on social media claim the bill does not give parents any opportunity to avoid vaccinations for their children.", "\u201cMy heart is with Colorado!\u201d the meme reads. \u201cThey passed bill SB-163 removing exemptions for vaccines. Very horrendous bill. Students must take Flu, HPV AND COVID19 vaccine to attend school.\u201d The HPV vaccine protects against cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers caused by human papillomavirus.", "That\u2019s wrong on several counts.", "First, the bill has not become law yet. As we noted, the current version must still be approved by the Colorado Senate and then be signed by the governor.", "Also, the bill does not mention the HPV vaccine or the flu shot. It does not make any reference to COVID-19, and there is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet, as we\u2019ve reported.", "It is also not true that the bill removes exemptions for vaccines or that \u201cstudents must take\u201d vaccines \u201cto attend school.\u201d", "Colorado state law currently requires any student under 18 to submit a certificate of immunization, a doctor-certified medical exemption, or a statement of religious or personal belief that bars immunization.", "The new bill makes no changes as to who can choose to exempt their children and does not take away the opportunity to claim an exemption based on \u201ca religious belief whose teachings are opposed to immunizations or a personal belief that is opposed to immunizations.\u201d", "In cases where a student\u2019s health would be harmed by an immunization, parents can seek a medical exemption signed by a physician, physical assistant, advanced practice nurse, or person authorized to administer immunizations to students.", "The bill adds a new process for those seeking a nonmedical exemption due to religious or personal beliefs. It requires a parent, legal guardian, emancipated student, or student age 18 or older to submit a signed certificate of nonmedical exemption or a certificate of completion of an online education module \u2014 a state-produced video on vaccinations \u2014 administered by Colorado\u2019s Department of Public Health and Environment.", "The bill also sets a goal of 95% of the student population to be vaccinated and requires schools to publish their immunization and exemption rates for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Colorado currently has the lowest rate of immunization \u2014 87.4% \u2013in the country for the MMR vaccine, according to the CDC.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
