This time, we wondered if he was right about race and the placement of toxic facilities.", "O'Rourke's claim mirrors a statement by an NAACP program that highlights environmental and climate issues affecting communities of color and low-income, and draws from a 2016 editorial in The Nation citing examples of \"environmental racism.\"", "We asked about half a dozen experts to weigh in to help us evaluate the claim and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s evidence.

Those studies used \"distance-based\" methods and examined racial and socioeconomic disparities at the time of the facilities\u2019 siting.", "In a study published in 2015, Mohai and Robin Saha, a collaborator at the University of Montana, explored\u00a0which came first to a neighborhood, people of color and low-income, or commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. They examined facilities sited from 1966 to 1995 and\u00a0the demographic composition of host neighborhoods around the time of siting and demographic changes after siting.", "\"Our findings show that rather than hazardous waste (treatment, storage, and disposal facilities) 'attracting' people of color, neighborhoods with already disproportionate and growing concentrations of people of color appear to 'attract' new facility siting,\" their study said.", "Experts said that factors analyzed regarding\u00a0the racial disparity in the location of hazardous facilities include:", "\u2022 \u00a0intentional discrimination in siting;", "\u2022 historical zoning and land use patterns related to segregation and redlining;", "\u2022 minority communities having less political clout to fight back a proposed facility;", "\u2022 and a \"coming to the nuisance\" phenomenon in which after a facility decides where to locate, people of color and low-income move in as property values and quality of life decline, and people who can afford to move out do so.", "This general topic has been studied for decades and has yielded varying results as researchers employ different methodologies.", "A 1995 report\u00a0by the U.S. General Accounting Office summarized findings in 10 studies mainly focused on the demographics of people living near hazardous waste facilities.\u00a0(The agency\u2019s name changed in 2004 to the Government Accountability Office.) The studies\u2019 conclusions varied, the report said, because researchers used different methodologies, different definitions of \"racial minority\" and analyzed different types of facilities. GAO told PolitiFact it wasn\u2019t aware of an updated version of the 1995 report.", "Journalist\u2019s Resource, a website that curates scholarly studies and reports, in September published a research roundup centered around environmental justice. It pointed out that people most at risk of living near toxic waste sites are often low-income or racial/ethnic minorities.", "The roundup included state-specific studies with different results. A 2000 study on Texas and Louisiana said that race was \"not a significant correlate with the location of hazardous waste sites.\" But a 2009 study on Illinois said, \"Our results support prior research that suggested race, rather than class, was the major indicator of environmental inequality.\"", "The 2016 editorial in The Nation, which O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign flagged as evidence, linked to a 1983 GAO\u00a0report\u00a0and to 1987 and 2007 studies prepared by researchers for the United Church of Christ.
