It is so much more.\n\n\"Executive residences,\" as the National Governors Association calls them, are \"regarded as an important symbol of the state\u2019s culture and heritage. As state treasures, executive residences provide an appropriate setting for official state entertaining and are often highly valued as a venue for community functions.\"\n\nOh.\n\nThe NGA goes on:\n\n\"Given the critical role executive residences play in official state and cultural activities, considerable care is required in managing, staffing and maintaining the executive residence.\"\n\nGee, sounds like that could get kinda expensive. Just how much does it cost taxpayers to run the Wisconsin governor\u2019s mansion -- ahem, executive residence?\n\nToo much, says state Sen. Bob Wirch, a Democrat from Pleasant Prairie in Kenosha County. Echoing a call he made in 2002, when Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle was elected, Wirch wants Republican Governor-elect Scott Walker to sell or lease the 34-room manor.\n\n\"Over the course of one four-year term,\" Wirch claimed in a news release Nov. 15, 2010, \"it costs taxpayers more than $1 million simply to operate.\"\n\nWirch also noted Walker\u2019s own call to citizens for ideas on how to make state government run more efficiently. After all, with a structural deficit, lost revenue because of a state Supreme Court decision and other issues, the new governor faces a projected shortfall of $3 billion for the 2011-\u201913 budget.\n\n\"It is hard to set a good example,\" Wirch said in his statement, \"if you are living in a mansion.\"\n\nWalker, who will be inaugurated Jan. 3, 2011, plans to move with his family from Wauwatosa into the residence, said his spokesman, Cullen Werwie.\n\nHe said Walker has no comment on Wirch\u2019s recommendation to sell or lease the mansion, which is perched on the shores of Lake Mendota.\n\nThe home\u2019s \"replacement value\" is $1.63 million, according to the state Department of Administration. But Wirch believes that with its 3.7 acres of land, the estate is worth more than $2.5 million.\n\nPerhaps, like us, you\u2019ve never been to the mansion (although you can see it in pictures).\n\nWell, according to the Department of Administration, the state Historical Society and the office of first lady Jessica Doyle, it:", "Nice. So, who takes care of it?\n\nSeven employees, according to Vicki Heymann, the mansion\u2019s residence director. Full-timers include Heymann, a chef, a gardener and a \"facilities maintenance specialist.\" The part-timers are a housekeeper, a \"laundress and flower arranger,\" and the head of the waitstaff, who has worked at the mansion for more than 32 years.\n\nOK, now let\u2019s get to Wirch\u2019s claim that operating the mansion costs more than $1 million during a four-year term.\n\nWirch\u2019s office said the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau put the operating costs at $265,000 per year. That would come to $1.06 million over four years.\n\nThe senator\u2019s per-year number is a touch high, but his four-year figure of more than $1 million is on target.\n\nThe fiscal bureau told PolitiFact Wisconsin that the mansion\u2019s operating expenses are budgeted at $262,500 in 2009-\u201910 and the same amount for 2010-\u201911, nearly all of which is salaries. That\u2019s a total of $1.05 million over four years.\n\nIn fact, actual expenditures are running higher, according to the state Department of Administration. They were $290,462 in 2008-\u201909 and $273,340 in 2009-\u201910. If that were carried out over four years, the total would be $1.13 million.\n\nWisconsin is one of 44 states that provided a governor\u2019s residence as of 2004, according to the most recent survey done by the National Governors Association.\n\nHere\u2019s how three of the other six treat their governors:", "OK, let\u2019s bring all this mansion talk home.\n\nIn calling on Governor-elect Scott Walker to save taxpayer dollars, state Sen. Bob Wirch said selling or leasing the governor\u2019s mansion would enable the state to cut more than $1 million over four years on the cost of operating the mansion. Based on the latest budget and expenditure figures, the operating costs do exceed $1 million over four years.\n\nWe rate Wirch\u2019s statement True.", "California Governor\u2019s Mansion senior guide Joe Wolfenden, interview, Nov. 18, 2010\n\nCalifornia State Parks, governor\u2019s mansion web page\n\nInterview, Idaho Gov.
