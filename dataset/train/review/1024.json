["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "The perception that Ohio\u2019s economy is in terrible shape is a big part of why John Kasich is Ohio\u2019s next governor and Ted Strickland will be Ohio\u2019s newest unemployed citizen next year. \u00a0\n\nKasich hammered home the theme of 400,000 lost jobs in Ohio in his rather narrow win over Strickland. And it\u2019s a perception that is a bone of contention with some Strickland supporters who see the state again on the road to prosperity.\n\nState budget director Pari Sabety appears to be in that crowd. She spoke two days after the Strickland defeat at a roundtable discussion at the Columbus Convention Center as part of the Impact Ohio Post-Election conference.\n\nDuring her Nov. 4 remarks, Sabety took pride in how the Strickland administration has managed the state\u2019s finances during the worst recession since the Great Depression. To give those in the audience a sense for why she thought things were moving in the right direction, Sabety passed out an \"economic dashboard,\" a color-coded chart that depicted 11 key economic indicators shaded red, yellow or green.\n\nThose indicators were a mix of red, yellow and green in Nov. 2007, and today they are almost all green, she explained to the audience.\n\nPraising the Strickland administration fiscal management, Sabety said Ohio is now on a steady course. She added, \"The economy is on the mend. \u2026 It is in better shape than it was when we took office.\"\n\nThat got our attention. Is Ohio\u2019s economy really on the mend? \u00a0And is it really in better shape today than it was when Strickland became governor in 2007?\n\nWe first looked at the \"economic dashboard\" Sabety used to support her assertions.\n\nDeveloped by Jim Koons of the governor\u2019s council of economic advisors, the dashboard covers 11 categories, including Ohio\u2019s employment rate, new building permits, wage and salary information, initial jobless claims as well as U.S. retail sales, light motor vehicle sales and other measures.\n\nBut the dashboard is only of limited use in evaluating Sabety\u2019s statement, primarily because it dates from November 2007, not January 2007 when Strickland took office. Koons said he didn\u2019t design it until November 2007.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s not designed to give a snapshot of Ohio\u2019s economy at a given time, but rather more of a \"forward-looking\" sense of what trajectory the state is on. Ultimately, Koons said, it\u2019s a tool to help predict whether the state\u2019s revenue forecasting will be on target in the coming months \u2014 a handy thing to know if you are running a $25 billion-a-year enterprise like state government. And it\u2019s weighted to favor the short term over the long term, he said.\n\nAsked if the state\u2019s economy is better now than 2007, Koons couldn\u2019t say.\n\n\"I haven\u2019t really spent much time thinking about that,\" he said. \"I would definitely say we are moving in a better direction.\"\n\nWe put the same question to a trio of other independent economic analysts \u2014 all based in Ohio. They consider the assertion false, laughable and downright bizarre.\n\nThat\u2019s because a state\u2019s employment figures are the true measure of the health of a state\u2019s economy, they all said.\n\n\"Frankly, an economist getting up in a meeting and saying things have improved in Ohio since 2007 would be laughed at,\" said Bob Rogers, an economics professor at Ashland University and former president of the Ohio Association of Economists and Political Scientists.\n\nSaid Ken Mayland, an economic analyst who is president of Clear View Economics in Pepper Pike: \"I think on the face of it that statement is blatantly false.\"\n\nSaid George Zeller, a economic research analyst based in Cleveland: \"When you look at it in terms of jobs, it\u2019s kind of a bizarre statement actually.\"\n\nAll three said the state\u2019s employment record is clear \u2014 5.65 million people employed in January \u00a02007 when Strickland became governor and 5.32 million today -- a difference of 330,000 jobs. And they all said that is clearly the best way to measure the health of the state\u2019s economy.\n\n\"It\u2019s a macromeasure,\" Mayland said. \"When people are employed they are producing things.\"\n\nOur trio of experts were somewhat more split when asked if Ohio\u2019s economy was on the mend.\n\nMayland said he thought Ohio\u2019s economy was definitely on the upswing.\n\n\"I do believe that the Ohio economy is recovering, we are probably going to get a pretty big share of the national economic recovery,\" he said. \"Manufacturing, in general, and the auto industry in particular, they are rebounding,\" he said. \"But when I say they are recovering you have to keep in mind there had been permanent job loss that will never be recovered, so they won\u2019t get back to their former selves.\"\n\nProfessor Rogers agreed there has been a bit of a rebound in Ohio\u2019s economy this year.\n\n\"Steel has made a little bit of a recovery, but in the last month or two it\u2019s backed down. The auto industry is better, but it\u2019s certainly not back to where it was before the crash.\"\n\nOther outside experts have seen signs that Ohio\u2019s economy is rebounding including the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which rated Ohio as having the fifth-fastest growing economy during the past 12 months. And personal income tax collections are up 5 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 as well as sales tax collections over the past four months when both are compared to the same period a year ago.\n\nBy far, the most pessimistic was Zeller who said that small gains in employment in Ohio that have been reported are a mirage caused by a faulty national modeling which has overestimated new firms being born. He predicted that the state\u2019s employment figures will be downgraded by 86,000 in January when the national model is evaluated by federal officials erasing, the 15,000 or so jobs that Ohio has gained on paper in 2010. Instead, Ohio will have lost 70,000 jobs this year.\n\n\"There is no evidence at all that Ohio has gained even one job in 2010,\" said Zeller. \"Ohio is still losing jobs right now, so therefore the economy is not on the upswing. I will say that the rate at which we\u2019re losing jobs has slowed dramatically.\"\n\nZeller compared it to a football team that is getting destroyed, but manages to tack on a few points. \"If the Browns are behind 48-0, and they kick a field goal, are things on the upswing?\" he asked. \"Well, yes, because they have three points now, but they are still way behind. That\u2019s kind of the position the state\u2019s economy is in.\"\n\nSo add it all up, and what do we have:", "Allowing for the evidence that Ohio\u2019s economy is rebounding, we\u2019ll give Sabety credit for the first part of her claim. But we take away points for the second part.\n\nWe rate her statement that the economy is on the mend and that it is in better shape than when Strickland took office to be Half True.", "Video of Sabety\u2019s remarks during the roundtable discussion on Ohio\u2019s economy at the Impact Ohio conference.
