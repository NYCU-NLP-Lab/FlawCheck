["By Saranac Hale Spencer and Robert Farley", "Posted on June 9, 2020", "With no evidence, President Donald Trump promoted a conspiracy theory that Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old man who was hospitalized after being pushed by police during a June 4 protest in Buffalo, New York, was an \u201cANTIFA provocateur\u201d who was trying to \u201cblack out\u201d police equipment.", "While Gugino\u2019s own Twitter account and his history as an activist suggest that he subscribes to far-left views, the primary support for Trump\u2019s claims appears to be the dubious website where they originated. Trump referenced a segment from the One America News Network, which cited a website called The Conservative Treehouse as the source for similar claims about Gugino. That site has published several bogus claims that we\u2019ve debunked over the years.", "Despite the sketchy origin of the claims, Trump tweeted on June 9: \u201cBuffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment. @OANN I watched, he fell harder than was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?\u201d", "We\u2019ll address the two major claims in that tweet:", "On the first claim, Gugino has made comments critical of police on Twitter, and he has reportedly retweeted a comment that said: \u201cUS police forces are the terrorist organization, not Antifa.\u201d", "Gugino also has noted on his blog that he has \u201cfour arrests, no convictions,\u201d which The Conservative Treehouse characterized as bragging \u201cabout the number of times he can get arrested and escape prosecution.\u201d", "But that doesn\u2019t make him an \u201cANTIFA provocateur.\u201d", "As we explained in a recent story about the president\u2019s pledge to designate antifa a terrorist organization, antifa isn\u2019t actually an organization at all. It\u2019s an umbrella term for far-left anti-fascists.", "\u201cNobody is a member of antifa,\u201d said Leslie James Pickering in an interview with FactCheck.org. Pickering is one of the owners of Burning Books, a leftist bookstore in Buffalo, and said that he knows Gugino, a frequent patron of the store who has attended some anti-fascist events there as well as many other events aimed at feminism, animal rights and anti-war issues.", "People think of antifa as \u201cmasked-up\u201d agitators fighting at rallies and breaking windows, Pickering said. \u201cMartin\u2019s never done that.\u201d", "He described Gugino as a subdued protester who sometimes takes photos or videos.", "Pickering described Gugino as a \u201c75-year-old suburban\u201d man who \u201cdoes not get involved in fist fights at protests.\u201d", "Another friend of Gugino dismissed the idea that he could be called a \u201cprovocateur,\u201d telling the Religion News Service that the idea is \u201cludicrous.\u201d", "Tom Casey, a local Buffalo coordinator for the Catholic peace movement Pax Christi, said that Gugino was opinionated, but always respectful, according to RNS.", "\u201cI have never heard him use a vile or angry word against anybody and I spent a lot of time talking to him,\u201d Casey said.", "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0to the\u00a0Buffalo News, Gugino\u2019s lawyer, Kelly Zarcone, called Trump\u2019s tweet \u201cdark, dangerous and untrue.\u201d She also told FactCheck.org by email, \u201cMr. Gugino denies those accusations. They are not factual and no one in law enforcement has even suggested such a thing.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s second claim has even less support.", "A video of Gugino\u2019s confrontation with police shows him approaching police who are in riot gear. Though there is no audio of his exchange with the police officers, Gugino has something in his right hand that he gestures with or waves in the direction of a police officer\u2019s midsection. That\u2019s the behavior that Trump speculates could have been Gugino trying to \u201cblack out\u201d police communication equipment.", "Both The Conservative Treehouse and OANN claimed that Gugino was using antifa-like tactics, with the former speculating that Gugino was employing \u201ca method of police tracking used by Antifa to monitor the location of police.\u201d", "But Adam Scott Wandt, an assistant professor of public policy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, where he is a researcher at the Center for Cybercrime Studies, said he has viewed the video more than a dozen times and, \u201cEverything I\u2019m seeing tells me that was not an attempt to block police communication.\u201d", "It is certainly possible to jam police communication frequencies \u201cusing a radio transceiver set up to do so,\u201d Wandt told us in a phone interview. And there are hand-held radio frequency jammers that are readily available for purchase by the general public. But the device held by Gugino \u201clooks nothing like a hand-held frequency scanner,\u201d which usually would have one or two antenna, he said.", "Wandt said the object in Gugino\u2019s hand appears to have a glass or shiny surface.", "\u201cIt looks like a cell phone,\u201d Wandt said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like a device that could jam a radio frequency.\u201d", "Zarcone, Gugino\u2019s lawyer, confirmed to us that it was a cell phone. \u201cI have seen his phone in the hospital \u2013 it is nothing particularly impressive,\u201d she said.", "It is possible to convert an Android phone into a radio frequency scanner, Wandt said, though it is a \u201chighly technical endeavor.\u201d", "While the device in Gugino\u2019s hand looks nothing like a radio frequency jammer, Wandt said, even if it were, \u201cthere is no reason he would need to be next to or up close to the officer\u201d to operate one.", "\u201cThere is zero reason he would need to be up in front of the officer,\u201d Wandt said. \u201cThere is no reason he would need to wave it around a person\u2019s body.\u201d", "Wandt noted that while it is not a crime to own a radio frequency jammer, it is a crime to use one. Wandt said he would expect that if Gugino had been attempting to \u201cblack out\u201d police communication, as the president put it, we would likely have heard about such equipment having been confiscated at the scene or Gugino being charged with crimes related to using such a device. There have been no reports of that.", "A person could jam the frequency and be standing 100 feet away, he said. And a person attempting to do that without being caught would not want to be in such close proximity to the officers, he said.", "Could Gugino have been attempting to intercept police communication? Again, it is possible to do that, but you don\u2019t need to be so close to do it, Wandt said. Radio frequency scanners that can be used to listen to police communications are common, he said. Provided the police communications were not encrypted, it would be fairly easy to listen in on police communications that day. You could be a mile away, Wandt said.", "\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing he was not doing, it was that,\u201d Wandt said.", "\u201cThe evidence I\u2019ve seen, there isn\u2019t much to this theory,\u201d he said.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
