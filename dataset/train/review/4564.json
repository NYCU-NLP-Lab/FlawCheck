["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 5, 2021 | Updated on February 10, 2021", "Headlines shared on social media distort the facts of a recent order by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that mandates face masks be worn on public transportation. The order doesn\u2019t require that individuals wear two masks. CDC guidance issued with the order does say that cloth masks should be made of at least two layers.", "Multiple lines of evidence back the use of face masks to protect against the coronavirus, although some uncertainty remains as to how effective mask interventions are in preventing spread in the community.", "Lab tests, for example, show that certain masks and N95 respirators can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets or aerosols, which are thought to be the primary ways the virus spreads.", "Observational studies, while limited, have generally found mask-wearing to be associated with a\u00a0reduced\u00a0risk\u00a0of contracting the virus or\u00a0fewer\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0cases\u00a0in a community.", "A\u00a0few\u00a0randomized controlled\u00a0trials have found that providing free masks and encouraging people to wear them results in a small to moderate reduction in transmission, although these results have\u00a0not always\u00a0been statistically significant.", "Masks should not be viewed as foolproof, as no mask is thought to offer complete protection to the wearer or to others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wear the most protective mask that fits well and can be worn consistently. Loosely woven cloth masks are the least protective. Layered, tightly woven cloth masks offer more protection, while well-fitting surgical masks and KN95 respirators provide even more protection and N95 respirators are the most protective.", "Link to this", "Some independent experts are now advising that wearing two masks \u2014 such as a cloth mask paired with a surgical mask \u2014 in some situations could provide greater benefit when it comes to controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus. The advice to improve masks comes as the U.S. documents cases of more transmissible variants of the virus.", "Whether the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will officially endorse the advice of double-masking isn\u2019t yet known. Officials have said they are currently exploring relevant data, and a CDC spokesperson told us the agency hopes to offer additional insight next week.", "(Update, Feb. 10: The CDC has now\u00a0posted\u00a0the results of a lab experiment that found that a cloth mask worn over a medical procedure mask can significantly improve the fit and effectiveness of the masks. The CDC\u2019s website\u00a0now\u00a0suggests\u00a0that form of double-masking as one modification for better protection.)", "But the federal agency has not issued a \u201cdemand\u201d that the public wear two masks, as a headline shared on social media claims.", "A recent video by the \u201cRon Paul Liberty Report\u201d on YouTube, viewed more than 18,000 times, was titled: \u201cCDC Now Demands TWO Masks \u2013 Science\u2026Or Tyranny?\u201d", "That\u2019s wrong. And those who watch the video are presented with a muddied take on a recent order by the CDC that stipulates that those using public transportation must wear a mask. The order went into effect Feb. 1.", "More than seven minutes into the video, a co-host of the show, Daniel McAdams, shows a headline from ZeroHedge, an unreliable website with a history of peddling misinformation, that reads: \u201cMedical Tyranny: CDC Announces All Travelers Must Wear Two Masks, Threatens Arrest.\u201d", "(In an example of how misinformation spreads, ZeroHedge actually credits the faulty report to another website, \u201cPlanet Free Will.\u201d And that website had republished the story after it appeared on the conspiracy theory website InfoWars.)", "The \u201cLiberty Report\u201d video then points to a CNN report about the CDC\u2019s order. That article said, in part, \u201c[t]he coverings need to be at least two or more layers of breathable fabric secured to the head with ties, ear loops or elastic bands \u2014 and scarves and bandanas do not count, the order says.\u201d", "The actual text of the order simply defines \u201cmasks\u201d as \u201ca material covering the nose and mouth of the wearer, excluding face shields.\u201d A footnote adds that, \u201cMasks can be either manufactured or homemade and should be a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, or punctures.\u201d", "The CNN report was referencing the CDC\u2019s guidance issued with the order. That guidance says\u00a0that cloth masks, among other attributes, \u201cshould be made with two or more layers of a breathable fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not let light pass through when held up to a light source).\u201d (Emphasis is ours.)", "But a mask \u201cmade with two or more layers\u201d\u00a0is not the same as two masks, as the video and headlines claim.", "Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases doctor and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told us the recommendation that cloth masks be made with at least two layers has been around \u201cfor some time as one layer is not very efficient at filtering virus.\u201d", "In fact, the CDC\u2019s own website instructed as much\u00a0months\u00a0before President Joe Biden took office\u00a0\u2014 so it isn\u2019t some new guidance related to the transportation order. A CDC page about face masks archived on Aug. 27, 2020, advised: \u201cWear masks with two or more layers to stop the spread of COVID-19.\u201d", "Many face masks available for purchase are made with more than one layer.", "The CDC spokesperson, Jason McDonald, reiterated to us in an email that the CDC website \u201crecommends wearing masks with 2 or more layers of washable, breathable fabric. If you\u2019re wearing a cloth mask, the layers of fabric should be tightly woven and you should not be able to see light through it.\u201d", "He added: \u201cIf the mask you have is a single layer of fabric, you could wear another one on top to achieve the recommended level of protection.\u201d", "In other words, you could double-up a cloth mask that only has one layer to create a covering that meets the two-layer recommendation.", "Gandhi said in an email that her recommendation \u2014 through her work with Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech \u2014 \u201cis to use a cloth mask with a filter inside when indoors in areas where high rates of transmission are occurring. So, two pieces of cloth with a filter inside since the filter blocks the virus electrostatically and the cloth blocks it physically.\u201d", "It\u2019s worth noting that while the text of the CDC order on wearing masks on public transportation\u00a0says it \u201creserves the right\u201d to enforce the order through criminal penalties, it said it \u201cdoes not intend\u201d to rely on such penalties \u2014 and instead anticipates voluntary compliance.", "The \u201cLiberty Report\u201d video goes on to present a video clip of Dr. Anthony Fauci saying, \u201cThere are many people who feel, you know, if you really want to have an extra little bit of protection, maybe I should put two masks on. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But there\u2019s no data that indicates that that is going to make a difference.\u201d", "That was during a Jan. 28 live-stream video with the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association.", "Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, went on to say that while the CDC had not changed its mask guidance, the agency would continue to review data on the issue. \u201cBut the bottom line is, the minimum thing you need to do is always wear a mask under circumstances when you\u2019re in settings, where you\u2019re with people, or you\u2019re in congregate settings,\u201d he said.", "During a Feb. 3 briefing (at 23:15), he made a similar point, saying that the CDC would continue to update recommendations based on data. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky agreed, saying her agency was \u201cactively looking\u201d at the matter and \u201cmore data will be forthcoming from the CDC with regard to the value of double-masking.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
