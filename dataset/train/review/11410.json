["About this rating", "On June 28, 2019, the internet\u2019s collective fury became laser-focused on a woman shown in an Instagram video removing the top of a Blue Bell ice cream tub, licking the creamy surface, and returning the product to the Walmart freezer from which it came. By early July the perpetrator seen in the video had been identified and arrested, and in an emailed statement to the New York Times, Blue Bell announced they had identified a Walmart store about 120 miles northeast of Houston \u201cas the store where the malicious act of food tampering took place.\u201d", "Shortly afterwards, a well-shared Facebook post alleged massive collateral damage from this reviled stunt, suggesting the perpetrator's antics had led to a change in packaging regulations at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA):", "Those claims were complete fiction. We reached out to the FDA to ask if the Blue Bell incident had led to any regulatory changes, and in response spokesperson Peter Cassell told us the viral claims were \u201cnot accurate\u201d and that the FDA does not now require plastic packaging on ice cream as a result. \u201cThe issue that sparked this [rumor] is a matter for local law enforcement at one retail location,\u201d said.", "Indeed, it would have been virtually impossible to pass a regulation change so rapidly, given that FDA rule changes must be formulated in detail, published publicly, and made open for a period of public comment before they can be implemented.", "Garcia, Sandra E. \u00a0 \u201cBlue Bell Ice Cream Licker in Viral Video Is Found, Police Say.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 6 July 2019.", "Food and Drug Administration. \u00a0 \u201cFDA Rules and Regulations.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 11 July 2019.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
