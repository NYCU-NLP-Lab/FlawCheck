["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on September 30, 2019", "A photo was manipulated to show young climate activist Greta Thunberg with philanthropist George Soros, who is known for funding progressive causes. The original image was of Thunberg and former vice president Al Gore.", "Young climate activist Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old from Sweden, has received considerable attention in recent weeks for her work raising awareness about climate change: She testified before a congressional committee on Sept. 18, spoke at the United Nations\u2019 Climate Action Summit on Sept. 23, and became a subject of a tweet by President Donald Trump.", "She also has received some unwanted attention from social media users, who have spread a doctored image that shows her with philanthropist George Soros.", "The original image appeared on Thunberg\u2019s Instagram in December 2018 and in reality shows Thunberg meeting former vice president Al Gore, a Democrat who is also known for his advocacy against climate change.", "The manipulated photo has a small green watermark reading \u201cSecret News\u201d \u2014 which we found is an online French satirical website. The website published the edited photo in an Aug. 28 story that falsely claimed Thunberg was Soros\u2019 granddaughter.", "But the photo circulated on social media with no indication of satirical intent, and users made comments suggesting that Thunberg is \u201cscripted\u201d or that Soros is \u201cpaying\u201d Thunberg. The billionaire philanthropist, known for funding liberal causes, has become a staple target of conspiracy theories and falsehoods over the years \u2014 some of which we\u2019ve debunked.", "The photo was passed around amid other online attempts to tie Thunberg to Soros.", "The Gateway Pundit, a popular conservative blog, claimed in a misleading headline that the \u201cOfficial Escort for 16-Year-Old Global Warming \u2018Expert\u2019 Greta Thunberg Is a Leftist Hack Funded by George Soros Org.\u201d The post centered on Thunberg\u2019s fellow climate activist Luisa Neubauer \u2014 not an \u201cofficial escort\u201d or \u201chandler,\u201d as the story says. The story cites Neubauer\u2019s connection to the organization ONE, a nonprofit working to combat poverty and disease that has received \u201cmajor backing\u201d from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.", "It\u2019s correct that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation credits Soros with being involved in the origins of ONE, and that Soros\u2019 nonprofit Open Society Foundations and its Open Society Policy Center are among nearly 50 publicly listed donors to ONE. But Neubauer was a youth ambassador to the organization \u2014 which ONE describes as a \u201cvolunteer\u201d role for young activists \u2014 and the Gateway Pundit offered no substantiation in its article for the idea that Neubauer herself was \u201cfunded\u201d by a \u201cGeorge Soros Org.\u201d", "Furthermore, Neubauer, 23, told another fact-checking site, Lead Stories, that she \u201cnever received any money from the ONE position.\u201d She described Thunberg as a \u201cfriend,\u201d\u00a0saying she has never been in a position to supervise her.", "Neubauer in a recent TEDx Talk said that she first participated in a climate strike when she joined a Thunberg demonstration at the U.N.\u2019s Climate Change Conference in 2018 \u2014 which prompted her to begin FridaysForFuture demonstrations, inspired by Thunberg, in Germany.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
