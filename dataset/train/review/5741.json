Kaepernick had become a central figure in ongoing National Football league protests again racial injustice after he first \"took a knee\" during the playing of the national anthem before games in the 2016 season.", "The deal was met with calls for a boycott of Nike products as well as criticism of the tenor and theme of the advertising campaign that accompanied it. One promotional image shows a close-up of Kaepernick's face with the message \"Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything\":", "Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. #JustDoIt pic.twitter.com/SRWkMIDdaO", "\u2014 Colin Kaepernick (@Kaepernick7) September 3, 2018", "This could be interpreted as an allusion to Kaepernick's own football career.

The Daily Caller, for example, reported:", "Kyle took to Facebook to level a brutal critique of Nike and their decision to promote a player who has regularly disrespected the American flag. \u201cSacrificing what exactly?

Your new ad with Colin Kapernick, I get the message, but that sacrificing everything thing\u2026. It just doesn\u2019t play out here. Sacrificing what exactly? A career? I\u2019ve done that both times I chose to stay home and be with my kids instead of continuing my business climb\u2026 and it wasn\u2019t sacrificing everything. It was sacrificing one career and some money and it was because of what I believe in and more importantly, who I believe in.", "At best, that is all Colin sacrificed ... some money and it\u2019s debatable if he really lost his career over it. Maybe he sacrificed the respect of some people while he gained the respect of others. Or maybe he used one career to springboard himself into a different career when the first was waning. I don\u2019t know. What I do know is, he gained popularity and magazine covers he likely wouldn\u2019t have gotten without getting on his knees or as you say, \u201cbelieving in something.\u201d I\u2019m also thinking the irony is that while I am not privy to the numbers, it\u2019s likely he gained a lucrative Nike contract.

Well, the irony of your ad..it almost leaves me speechless. Were you trying to be insulting?", "Maybe you are banking on the fact we won\u2019t take the time to see your lack of judgement in using words that just don\u2019t fit. Maybe you are also banking on us not seeing Nike as kneeling before the flag. Or maybe you want us to see you exactly that way. I don\u2019t know.
