["About this rating", "Social media giant Facebook purchased the popular texting app WhatsApp in 2014,  and in 2016 WhatsApp announced they would be sharing user information with Facebook \u2014 leading some users to worry that personal information contained with WhatsApp would be spilled to the social media-using public. But while the app will share some user data with Facebook to improve targeted advertising and other business interfaces, WhatsApp says information such as messages, pictures and other personal data will not be shared onto other platforms. Furthermore, users can theoretically opt out of sharing non-personal data with Facebook.", "The WhatsApp web site rather passive-aggressively instructs users how to opt out:", "If you are an existing user, you can choose not to share your account information with Facebook to improve your Facebook ads and products experiences.", "The site offers instructions on two methods for opting out of data sharing.

When you and the people you message are using the latest version of WhatsApp, your messages are encrypted by default, which means you're the only people who can read them. Even as we coordinate more with Facebook in the months ahead, your encrypted messages stay private and no one else can read them. Not WhatsApp, not Facebook, nor anyone else. We won\u2019t post or share your WhatsApp number with others, including on Facebook, and we still won't sell, share, or give your phone number to advertisers.", "But by coordinating more with Facebook, we'll be able to do things like track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on WhatsApp. And by connecting your phone number with Facebook's systems, Facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them. For example, you might see an ad from a company you already work with, rather than one from someone you've never heard of.
