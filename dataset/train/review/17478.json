["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Some of us might not believe Wisconsin\u2019s budget battle had gone viral unless it was debated on national TV by, say, comedian David Letterman and, oh, a senator from Kentucky.\n\nLo and behold:\n\nOn the Feb. 24, 2011 edition of CBS-TV\u2019s \"Late Show with David Letterman,\" the inimitable talk show host raised the Wisconsin controversy with U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. \u00a0\n\nLetterman asked:\n\n\"Why don\u2019t we just raise the taxes and let these folks have their collective bargaining, have their union representation and go back to their jobs?\"\n\nLetterman\u2019s reference was to Wisconsin public school teachers who had skipped school to protest Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s budget-repair bill, which was introduced 10 days earlier. That measure would require most public employees to pay more for benefits, to help close a deficit in the state budget ending June 30, 2011. It would also eliminate collective bargaining rights for some public employees and sharply curtail them for others, a move Walker says is aimed at helping balance future state and local government budgets.\n\nPaul, a freshman senator and co-founder of the Senate Tea Party Caucus, responded to Letterman\u2019s question by saying:\n\n\"But I guess the argument is -- is, you have to look at the details and say: Have we been generous with (public school) teachers in Wisconsin? The average teacher in Wisconsin\u2019s making $89,000 a year to work nine months.\"\n\nIs Paul right?\n\nThe $89,000 claim prompted this comment from a guy named Tom on the Wisconsin Unions page of the Facebook website: \"Holy cats, Batman, my wife is hiding $40,000 a year from her paychecks.\"\n\nPaul made a similar claim, varying his wording a little, a day earlier on ABC-TV\u2019s \"Good Morning America.\" He told host George Stephanopoulos that Wisconsin teachers \"are making $89,000 a year. Their benefits greatly exceed the private sector.\"\n\nIn the Letterman interview, Paul seemed to be saying $89,000 was the average salary for a public school teacher in Wisconsin. But on \"Good Morning America,\" he seemed to suggest that the $89,000 included salary plus benefits, just as Fox Business Network anchor Eric Bolling did in making a similar claim that was assessed by our colleagues at PolitiFact National.\n\nWe left messages with two staffers in the senator\u2019s office, asking for clarification of Paul\u2019s statements and for evidence to back up the figure, but got no response.\n\nIn the Wisconsin budget debate, both sides have said it\u2019s important to look at overall compensation -- pay and benefits. So, by that measure, is the average public school teacher in Wisconsin \"making $89,000 a year\"?\n\nThe latest figures available are for 2009-2010, according to a state Department of Public Instruction spokesman. Public school teachers in Wisconsin earned an average of $49,816 in salary plus $25,325 in benefits for a total of $75,141.\n\nThat\u2019s about 16 percent less than the $89,000 claimed by Paul.\n\nThe $75,141 total compensation figure, of course, is a statewide average.\n\nThe figures vary across districts, according to tallies from the Department of Public Instruction. The average total compensation ranged from just over $55,000 in the Linn Joint 6 School District in Lake Geneva near the Wisconsin-Illinois border to just over $103,000 in the Nicolet district in suburban Milwaukee. \u00a0\n\nTime for the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nPaul said twice on national television that the average public school teacher in Wisconsin \"is making $89,000 a year.\" We\u2019re assuming his figure isn\u2019t just for salary, in which case his number would be too high by $40,000. But even if he meant salary plus benefits, his figure is too high by $14,000.\n\nWe rate Paul\u2019s statement False.", "Editor\u2019s note: On March 8, 2011, this item was changed to correct an error in information provided by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.
