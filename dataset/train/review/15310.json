Photo by Bob LoCicero/VT Digger", "A Saturday Night Live skit on September 29 spoofed Vermont\u2019s reputation as a \"Caucasian paradise\" with a fake meeting held by white supremacists. In response, Agency of Commerce and Community Development Secretary Michael Schirling sent SNL some Vermont flannel shirts Oct. 2 and responded to the show\u2019s creators that Vermont is becoming more racially diverse.", "\"We invite SNL viewers to Vermont to see all that we have to offer, including our increasingly diverse communities and wide array of tourist destinations including the African American Heritage Trail,\" said Schirling in the statement, which the department sent to Boston.com.", "\"Now is a perfect time to visit or to consider a move here. The leaves are changing and so is Vermont,\" he said.", "We decided to see if Schirling's statement was true, given that Vermont remains the second whitest state in the union. Is the state becoming more racially diverse? It turns out there has been a slight uptick in Vermont's non-white population.", "Schirling said he obtained his information from the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey, a research project that produces population, demographic and housing estimates, indeed has found that Vermont is becoming more racially diverse, or at least less white.", "The survey found that Vermont was 95 percent white in 2013 and 94.2 percent white in 2017, a drop of 0.8 percent, according to a spokesperson for the American Community Survey.", "Within the category of non-white races in the Census data, there are many variations.", "From 2013 to 2017, the increase in the African-American population from 1.1 percent to 1.3 percent, was not statistically significant. But the percent change in the Asian and Hispanic populations was: Asians went from 1.2 percent of the Vermont population to 1.8 percent, a 0.6 percentage point increase; Hispanics went from 1.5 percent to 1.9 percent, a 0.4 percentage point increase.", "Our ruling", "The statement that Vermont is becoming increasingly diverse needs further clarification. Schirling does not explain that the increase in Vermont's racially diverse populations is slight.", "We rate the statement Half True.", "Saturday Night Live skit on Youtube,\u00a0Sept. 29, 2018.", "Boston.com, \"Vermont tourism department responds to \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 sketch that cast the state as a \u2018Caucasian paradise,\u2019\"\u00a0Oct. 2, 2018.", "Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey, 2017.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
