["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "A new ad claims President Barack Obama broke his promise about the impact of the economic stimulus plan.\n\nThe ad uses a familiar Republican talking point, that Obama \"promised\" low unemployment if the stimulus was passed. We've checked many claims it would stay below 8 percent, but this ad says it would drop to 5.6 percent.\n\nIt's a flashy ad from pro-Republican super PAC American Crossroads, using gleaming Minority Report-style graphics manipulated by a narrator in an empty warehouse. The version we've seen still running this week uses an outdated number, saying unemployment is \"actually\" 8.1 percent. The latest monthly report, which came out Friday, says it is now 7.8 percent.\n\nIn this fact-check, we\u2019re focusing on what Obama said the jobless rate would be if Congress passed a stimulus plan.\n\nSeparately, we are checking the ad\u2019s claim that \"Obama\u2019s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt.\"\n\nHere\u2019s the full narration:", "The screen displays the line, \"We can\u2019t afford 4 more years.\"\n\n What Obama said\n\nWe asked American Crossroads for material to support the ad. Spokesman Jonathan Collegio referred us to a Jan. 9, 2009, report prepared before Obama took office, and a speech by the president-elect.\n\nThe report, designed to help Obama argue for an aggressive response to the burgeoning jobs crisis, featured projections for the effect of a stimulus plan.\n\nThose estimates include a chart, \"Unemployment Rate With and Without Recovery Plan,\" that displays a post-stimulus jobless rate around 5.6 percent in mid 2012, like the chart in the American Crossroads ad.\n\nBut Christina Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser, also wrote that their estimates were \"subject to significant margins of error,\" and \"considerable uncertainty.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve previously ruled that the report was not a promise, but a projection, noting its several caveats.\n\nHow about the president-elect\u2019s speech introducing the report?\n\nHere, too, we find it's a stretch to describe it as a promise. It doesn\u2019t get into specific jobless rates, but does talk about projected job gains if a stimulus plan \u2014 which Congress had yet to write \u2014 were to pass.\n\nCollegio pointed out that Obama:\n\n\u2022 Said the report presented \"what this plan will mean,\" not \"roughly what this plan might mean.\"\n\n\u2022 Said \"we\u2019ll create jobs\" not \"could create jobs.\"\n\n\"Obama did promise it,\" Collegio said.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s speech first presents the report\u2019s findings as \"projections,\" and later says that a stimulus plan would \"likely\" save or create 3 million to 4 million jobs. Only then does he simplify his language to say, \"we\u2019ll create\" as he talks about a focus on jobs in energy, health care and infrastructure.\n\nHere\u2019s how he sets it up:", "And as we mentioned, the report carried Romer and Bernstein\u2019s warnings about the uncertainty of their projections, including that \"the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.\"\n\nAs we now know, as the pair prepared their estimates, the economy was already far worse than the best numbers at the time captured. The unemployment rate hit 8 percent even before Obama signed a stimulus package into law in February 2009.\n\n Our ruling\n\nAn ad from American Crossroads says, \"This is what President Obama said the jobless rate would be if we passed the stimulus: 5.6 percent.\"\n\nBut we find that's a stretch. In the evidence the group provided, Obama doesn\u2019t mention that statistic. Rather, he introduced \"projections\" that included a chart showing the jobless rate falling to 5.6 percent under a recovery plan. The report highlighted the estimates\u2019 \"significant margins of error\" and high uncertainty due to a recession that was \"unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.\" The economy was, in fact, much worse than economists knew. The chart is now infamous, but it was never pitched as a promise.
