["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on July 20, 2018", "In recent tweets, President Donald Trump has made erroneous statements about U.S farmers, and soybean prices in particular, while complaining about trade barriers:", "The president has made negotiating better trade deals a high priority in his first term. In his attempt to gain leverage in negotiations, his administration has imposed tariffs, for example, on the importation of solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminium, as chronicled by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.", "On July 6,\u00a0the U.S. began imposing tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports. China\u00a0retaliated with equal tariffs on $34 billion in U.S. goods,\u00a0including\u00a0on\u00a0U.S. soybeans, wheat, corn, sorghum and beef.", "As we wrote in a previous article, soybeans were the top U.S. agricultural export in 2017 at $21.6 billion,\u00a0according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Agricultural economic experts we spoke with for that story warned that a prolonged trade war would hurt U.S. farmers in general and soybean farmers in particular.", "In a July 20 tweet, the president said that \u201cFarmers will WIN!\u201d under his trade policies, which is his opinion. But he made false claims in supporting that position in two recent tweets:", "I am in Brussels, but always thinking about our farmers. Soy beans fell 50% from 2012 to my election. Farmers have done poorly for 15 years. Other countries\u2019 trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses. I will open\u2026", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 11, 2018", "Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2018", "It is simply not true that \u201cFarmers have done poorly for 15 years.\u201d", "U.S. farms have seen net farm income generally decline in the last five years.\u00a0But they\u00a0\u201cexperienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014 due to strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports,\u201d according to a\u00a0February report\u00a0by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.", "According to\u00a0USDA\u00a0data, net farm income in real inflation-adjusted dollars reached a record $133.6 billion in 2013. (That was due in large part to the 2012 drought, as we\u2019ll explain.)", "Net farm income has been in decline since 2013, as the USDA chart below shows.", "It is also not true that the recent \u201cdownward trend,\u201d as Trump called it, is due to trade.", "As\u00a0Wallace E. Tyner, an agricultural economics professor at Purdue University, told us for a previous story:\u00a0\u201cThe ag sector is seeing some hard times, but it is because of lower prices and not trade.\u00a0Weather has been pretty good, production high, and prices therefore lower.\u201d\u00a0(See \u201cTrump Distorts Facts on Agricultural Trade\u201d for more information.)", "As for soybeans, Trump is generally correct that soybean prices are down from five years ago \u2014 but not as much as he says and not for the reason he claims.", "A\u00a0July 16 USDA report\u00a0shows that soybean prices received by U.S. farmers were\u00a0$14.40 per bushel in the 2012/2013 marketing year, which is from September through August. The price in the 2017/2018 marketing year was $9.35 per bushel \u2013 a decline of $5.05 per bushel or 35 percent.", "Monthly USDA data\u00a0show that the peak price for soybeans since 2009 came in August 2012, when it reached $16.20 per bushel.\u00a0As of May 2018, the most recent month for which data are available, the price was $9.84 \u2014 a 39 percent decline from the peak.", "That\u2019s not quite 50 percent, but it is a considerable drop. What caused the decline in prices? Trump says \u201ca big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries.\u201d That\u2019s false.", "For Trump\u2019s claims on soybeans, we again contacted Tyner, the Purdue agricultural economics professor. Tyner\u00a0told us that the decline in prices for soybeans \u201cwas not due to trade policy.\u201d", "\u201cRemember that 2012 was a severe drought year, so the prices were high because of low production \u2013 not policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you start from a high number, the change looks larger. Look at the non-drought years.\u201d", "How bad was the 2012 drought?", "In November 2012, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a report on the impact of the 2012 drought on crops. BLS called it \u201cthe most severe drought the United States has seen since the 1950s.\u201d", "But, the report said, \u201cthe severe drought that has affected much of the nation drove crop prices up.\u201d U.S. soybeans had their \u201csmallest harvest in 9 years,\u201d the report said.", "As we noted earlier, the price of soybeans peaked in the 2012/2013 marketing year.", "An Aug. 30, 2013, report\u00a0by the Congressional Research Service on U.S. farm income said the unexpected drought caused a \u201cdramatic reversal of fortunes\u201d for U.S. farmers.", "\u201cThe 2012/2013 growing season will be remembered for the dramatic reversal of fortunes where by early springtime prospects for record harvests and low commodity prices were transformed in a two-month period into an outlook of supply shortages and record-high commodity prices,\u201d the report said.", "So, contrary to the president\u2019s claim, \u201cbad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries\u201d are not to blame for the drop in soybean prices from five years ago.", "The prices have, in fact, returned to those in non-drought years, as Tyner said and as the chart below shows.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
