["About this rating", "A July 2019 social media meme presented a transcript of a brief excerpt from a radio interview with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) in a way seemingly calculated to make the Congresswoman seem as inarticulate as possible:", "In a literal sense, this meme does reflect the words actually spoken by Ocasio-Cortez during the course of an hour-long interview for the The New Yorker Radio Hour on July 5, 2019. But the meme transcribes those words in a way that makes the speaker seem almost incoherent, through a number of techniques:", "The context of the quoted passage was Ocasio-Cortez's answer, in response to an interview question, about why she had declined an offered seat on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.

And when the actual, in my opinion, structure of [the committee] is compromised in very deep ways, you know it\u2019s not ... I don\u2019t think it was like, \"I\u2019m going to take my ball and go home\" -- it\u2019s, \"We have a select committee whose mission I was uncertain on, [and] whose members take fossil fuel money.\" You know [my decision was] beyond just a mere disagreement [with the committee's mission].
