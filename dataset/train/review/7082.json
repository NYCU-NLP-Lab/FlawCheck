["Teachers celebrate after West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice and Senate Republicans announced they reached a tentative deal to end a statewide teachers' strike by giving them 5 percent raises on March 6, 2018. (AP)", "West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, facing a competitive Republican primary in 2020, recently introduced an ad touting his accomplishments in office, including a focus on K-12 education.", "The ad, released in a Dec. 4 tweet, features several West Virginians reading off a series of scripted accomplishments from Justice\u2019s tenure. One of the accomplishments, voiced by a teacher, is that \"Jim Justice is the first West Virginia governor to fight for pay raises for educators.\"", "Governor @JimJusticeWV\u2019s campaign released a new television ad titled \u201cRight Reasons\u201d today. The ad highlights successes during his time in office, including creating jobs, growing the economy, a ten percent pay raise for educators, and getting results for West Virginians. #WVGov pic.twitter.com/ujWxekP34h", "This struck us as odd, since governors of all parties regularly tout their support for teachers \u2014 a group that\u2019s popular with voters and, in many states, a politically powerful constituency.", "Teacher salaries have been an especially sensitive issue in West Virginia. Between 2005 and 2017, West Virginia teacher salaries never rose higher than 44th in the nation. That history set the stage for a 2018 teacher strike in West Virginia, which was the state\u2019s first major K-12 walkout in almost three decades. Justice eventually signed a 5% pay bump, which is more than the legislature had offered prior to the strike.", "So is Justice really the first West Virginia governor ever to push for teacher pay raises? His office did not respond to inquiries for this article, but we found that each of Justice\u2019s five immediate predecessors either proposed or enacted teacher pay raises.", "In his first state of the state address in 2011, Tomblin proposed a one-time, across-the-board $800 increase for teachers. \"Frankly, it should be more and we need to strive for a day when our teachers are paid at a rate equivalent to the most important role they play,\" he said in the speech, according to the Associated Press.", "In 2014, despite offering few increases in his relatively austere budget proposal, Tomblin did include a 2% pay raise for teachers. The bill he eventually signed contained a $1,000 raise for teachers for the 2014-2015 school year.", "As governor, Manchin \u2014 now a U.S. Senator \u2014 periodically sparred with teachers\u2019 unions over the size of his salary increase proposals. But both Manchin\u2019s Senate office and West Virginia teachers\u2019 unions agree that he proposed a teacher salary increase and signed it into law.", "During his tenure, Manchin raised teacher salaries by 3.5%, according to a joint statement released by the West Virginia Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, and the West Virginia School Service Personnel Association when the groups endorsed Manchin\u2019s Senate reelection bid in 2018. Manchin\u2019s Senate office cited the same 3.5% increase when we inquired.", "The legislation Manchin signed also improved teachers\u2019 annual salary increments and allowed educators to move from a 401(k)-style defined contribution plans to a defined-benefit system.", "In his 2001 state of the state address, Wise proposed raising teacher salaries by $1,000, plus $2,500 in incentives. \"Teachers are the heart of the educational system. We must honor the work of our teachers,\" he said.", "After leaving the governor\u2019s office, Wise became CEO of the Alliance for Excellent Education, an education advocacy group.", "In his 1998 state of the state address, Underwood proposed giving teachers a $750 pay raise. He signed a three-year pay raise into law later that year.", "Caperton was governor during a divisive, 11-day West Virginia teacher strike in 1990, but he ended up presiding over a significant pay increase for the state\u2019s teachers. The strike was settled when all parties agreed on a $5,000 pay increase phased in over three years.", "Last year, PolitiFact reported that most significant recent improvement in West Virginia teacher pay compared to other states came between 1990 and 2000, a period during which Caperton and Underwood were in office.", "Like Wise, Caperton headed an education group \u2014 the College Board \u2014 after serving as governor.", "Justice\u2019s ad said he\u2019s \"the first West Virginia governor to fight for pay raises for educators.\"", "That\u2019s far off-base. Seeking pay raises for teachers is practically a rite of passage for governors, and West Virginia is no exception. Not one, not two, but each of Justice\u2019s five most recent predecessors \u2014 Tomblin, Manchin, Wise, Underwood, and Caperton \u2014 either proposed a teacher pay raise, signed one into law, or both.
