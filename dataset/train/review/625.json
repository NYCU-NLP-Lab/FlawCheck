Of course, this is the People\u2019s Republic of California, so such things are to be expected. They are so far down the totalitarian, Globalist path that they are oblivious to any sane, sensible ideas.\"", "The controversy is over California bill AB 2943, a measure that puts strict limits on programs that aim to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation. The legislation, which passed out of the state assembly and over to the Senate, bans any \"advertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts with an individual.\"", "The bill does this by amending the state\u2019s consumer protection law, which covers such things as false advertising, selling defective goods and the like. So, the prohibition would only apply when money changed hands. Someone needs to be selling and someone needs to be buying a service called \"sexual orientation change efforts\" for this bill to apply.", "The Oath Keeper headline (since changed) spoke of a complete ban on the Bible with no mention of selling. But in the video interview that went along with the post, the Oath Keeper host asked, \"Would this prohibit the sale of the Bible?\" We\u2019re checking whether the law would ban the sale of the holy book.", "While the odds are remote, some legal scholars said the law as written could lead to issues.", "Even some opponents to AB 2943 argue that it likely wouldn\u2019t ban the sale of Bibles across the board.", "\"It is virtually impossible that California will immediately attempt to ban the sale of the Bible itself,\" wrote Robert Gagnon in the Federalist. \"But citations of Bible verses in the context of declaring homosexual practice and transgenderism to be morally debased could indeed get one into serious trouble with the law if it comes in the context of selling or advertising a product or service.\"", "Concerned Women for California of America, a group that \"promotes biblical values\" through prayer and advocacy, told lawmakers that the bill \"puts in question the sale of books, participation in events, and related activities.\"", "So from opponents, the impact on Bible sales is a question, not a certainty.", "By one estimate, Americans buy about 25 million Bibles each year.

And the statute is only triggered when a person promotes or advertises the Sexual Orientation Change Effort solution.\"", "Ross also noted that the proposed law regulates commercial speech, which she said the Bible is not.", "\"The brief passages in the Bible that concern homosexuality would keep the book as a whole well below the standard for triggering the statute,\" Ross said. \"An offer to sell a Bible would not bring the content of the Bible itself into the definition of commercial speech.\"", "The Oath Keepers group said that a California law would ban the sale of the Bible.", "We found that even some opponents of the bill don\u2019t go that far. The general consensus is that the Bible covers a lot of ground and the proposed law would have no effect on the ordinary sale of Bibles.", "If the law had any impact at all, it would be on those occasions when a Bible is sold in conjunction with a program to change someone\u2019s sexual orientation.
