This post claims that the image is of a 10 rupee note which was scrapped by Nehru.", "Did the Nehru led government demonetise currency featuring Subhas Chandra Bose as claimed by certain sections? It did not, for the simple reason that these currency notes whose images are circulating on social media, were never legal tender. They were issued in pre-independent India.", "The currency notes featuring Subhas Chandra Bose were issued by Azad Hind Bank, which can be seen inscribed on the currency note. Kanailal Basu\u2019s book Netaji: Rediscovered states that the Azad Hind Bank was formed in Rangoon (now Yangon) in Burma (now Myanmar) in April 1944 for the purpose of organizing funds to finance the war effort against the British. The bank printed Indian currency notes and managed contributions from Indians from across the world. Azad Hind Bank also finds mention in Fiery Dragons: Banks, Moneylenders and Microfinance in Burma by Sean Turnell.", "There are several kinds of currency notes featuring Subhas Chandra Bose which were issued before independence by the Azad Hind Bank (also known as Bank of Independence). Some of these notes have found their way to the public domain, mainly forming part of personal collections. The Hindu had reported in January 2010 that one such currency note had been made public.", "The Telegraph, in a recent report, has stated that the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Birthplace Museum in Cuttack, Odisha has a rare collection of coins and currency notes which were issued by the Azad Hind Bank. In fact, a rather bizarre request had been made to the Central government in 2016 when several borrowers petitioned the Finance ministry seeking to repay loans through currency issued by the Azad Hind Bank. The request followed the declassification of files related to Bose. The Economic Times reports, \u201cWe have received representations from some individuals who want the currency issued by Azad Hind Bank or similar variants to be recognised as legal tender,\u201d said one of them. \u201cSome of them even want their existing loans to be repaid through these currency notes.\u201d The second official said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had said it doesn\u2019t have any record of such an entity and therefore the currency can\u2019t be recognised as legal tender.\u201d", "The claim that the Nehru government demonetised these currency notes featuring Subhas Chandra Bose is patently false. These notes were never recognized by the British Indian government or by the Indian government after independence, as they were issued by the Azad Hind Bank that was established by the \u2018Provisional government of free India\u2019 set up by Bose in 1943.", "Recently, a \u2018letter\u2019 of dubious authenticity claimed to have been written by Nehru calling Bose a \u2018war criminal\u2019 was shared widely on social media. Vested interests on social media have sought to portray Jawaharlal Nehru in poor light vis-a-vis Subhas Chandra Bose, outrightly accusing India\u2019s first Prime Minister of deliberately scuttling the legacy of Bose, despite there being little evidence available in the public domain to suggest the same.", "Donate Now", "Arjun Sidharth is a writer with Alt News.
