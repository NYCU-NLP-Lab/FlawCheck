Follow our post-election coverage here.", "In Nov. 2020, the junk news site Your News Wire (which had previously renamed itself News Punch) returned to the world of fake news by pushing an election conspiracy rumor that international financier George Soros had been arrested in Philadelphia on charges related to election interference:", "George Soros has been arrested and is currently being held in federal custody in Philadelphia. According to a recently unsealed indictment filed in the Western District of Pennsylvania, Soros has been charged with a number of serious crimes relating to the US election.", "The indictment lists only on the criminal activity Soros participated in prior to the November election, such as wire fraud, identity theft, aiding and abetting, and damage to computers.", "The FBI stated that the indictment will likely be updated to reflect election interference charges in relation to Dominion Voting, once the full scale of Soros\u2019 operations has been exposed. Soros is currently being interrogated by the FBI.", "None of this was true. Soros had neither been arrested nor charged with crimes related to \"election interference\" in any jurisdiction in the U.S.", "The Your News Wire article included an image of the supposed indictment against Soros, along with the claim that the \"judge put a publication ban on Soros\u2019 arrest\":", "In fact, this image was an altered version of a real indictment that had nothing to do with Soros.
