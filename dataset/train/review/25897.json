["During the Jan. 23, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Fla., Mitt Romney said that \"we have 25 million Americans out of work.\"\u00a0But he\u2019s not correct.", "Officially, there were about 13.1 million unemployed Americans in December 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government\u2019s official source of employment statistics. This is the number that\u2019s used to calculate the official unemployment rate, which during that month was 8.5 percent.", "But 13.1 million is only about half of what Romney claimed. What\u2019s going on?", "Here\u2019s the explanation.", "Some critics have long argued that the BLS definition of unemployment is too limiting, since it doesn\u2019t count people who have stopped looking for work or who are working part time, even though they\u2019d prefer a full-time job. So BLS also offers an alternative measure (known to economists as \"U-6\") that factors in both groups.", "Using this measure, BLS in December 2011 found an additional 2.6 million Americans who are \"marginally attached\" to the labor force, meaning they\u2019d be ready to work if a job became available, and another 8.1 million Americans who are working part time but who would prefer a full-time job.", "Together, these three categories added up to 23.8 million people in September 2011, for a total \"U-6\" rate of 15.2 percent, or well above the official unemployment rate.", "So Romney is a little high for the broader statistic -- 25 million as opposed to 23.8 million -- but he\u2019s in the ballpark. The question is whether it\u2019s fair to describe these roughly 25 million people as \"out of work.\"", "To make the definition work, you have to include the 8.1 million Americans who are \"working only part-time for economic reasons.\" These people would certainly rather have a full-time job. However, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate to describe them as \"out of work.\"", "Our ruling", "While the U-6 measurement is not the official gauge of unemployment in the United States, it\u2019s a valid statistic to consider in conjunction with others. However, Romney\u2019s use of the term \"out of work\" seems to be a stretch when about one-third of the \"25 million Americans out of work\" are actually working part-time. On balance, we rate the\u00a0statement Half True.", "Mitt Romney, transcript of the Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Jan. 23, 2012 (accessed via CQ; subscribers only)\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, \"Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey,\" accessed Jan. 23, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, \"Are statistics in the Occupied Wall Street Journal correct?,\"\u00a0Oct. 11, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
