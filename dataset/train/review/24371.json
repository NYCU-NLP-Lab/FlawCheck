["Nigeria is battling a decade-long Boko Haram insurgency, which has seen the abduction of hundreds of children across the country's north.", "Armed men, hired by Boko Haram\u00a0militants, kidnapped more than 300 secondary schoolboys in Nigerian\u2019s northwestern Katsina state on December 11, 2020, and held them captive for nearly a week, as AFP reported here.", "After their release, Bashir Ahmad, the personal aide of President Muhammadu Buhari, posted the following statement\u00a0on his Twitter account on December 20, 2020:", "\u201c\u2018We commend President Buhari for the swiftness and efficiency with which the lads were rescued from their abductors. Such swiftness would have made all the difference had such occurred in 2014 when schoolgirls were similarly abducted from their school\u2019 - the EU Human Rights Forum.\u201d", "The tweet has been\u00a0shared more than 750 times since its publication.", "A Google search revealed that the quote came\u00a0from a statement mentioned in online news reports by leading Nigerian media organisations including Leadership, The Sun, The Independent, The Nation, New Telegraph, Legit NG, and Channels TV.", "All angled the story on the EU hailing Buhari's\u00a0rescue efforts.", "The statement also accuses his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan,\u00a0of complacency\u00a0over the 2014 kidnapping of\u00a0276 schoolgirls in Chibok.\u00a0Some 112 girls still remain missing.", "The quotes were attributed to Joseph Cullen, identified as a \u201cspecial rapporteur, Lake Chad/West Africa\u201d for the European Union Human Rights Forum.", "While most of the websites ran the story on December 20 -- the same day as Ahmad\u2019s tweet was posted -- AFP Fact Check found that Nigerian daily newspaper Vanguard published a version a day earlier,\u00a0with no byline.", "AFP Fact Check has contacted Vanguard to enquire how it obtained the statement\u00a0but is yet to get a response.", "Meanwhile, the Guardian Newspaper removed the story from its website after doubts emerged over the sourcing, its\u00a0online editor Tonye Bakare said.", "\"Publishing a story that has a dubious origin does no media organisation that values its name and prioritises accuracy of its content any good. So it is important to act fast when there are doubts about a story,\" he told AFP Fact Check.", "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive body, has dismissed the claim as false.", "\u201cThis was misinformation and no such organisation or person exists,\u201d Commission spokesman Peter Stano told AFP Fact Check.", "AFP Fact Check found no official\u00a0trace of so-called special EU rapporteur\u00a0Joseph Cullen. There is also no public record of an EU agency named the European Union Human Rights Forum.", "Searches for \u201cJoseph Cullen\u201d and \u201cEUHRF\u201d on Google and social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle only return a small number of Nigeria results all from December 20, 2020.", "A separate search for the \u201cEuropean Union Human Rights Forum\u201d revealed this 2010 statement on the website of the Belgian government.", "\u201cThe EU Human Rights Forum is an annual event that brings together around 150 participants, mainly representatives of NGOs from around the world, but also of European and international institutions and from the 27 EU Member States,\u201d the publication partly reads. The forum was last held between December 9 -10, 2020 --\u00a0 a day before the abduction of the schoolboys.", "Again, there is no evidence of anyone called\u00a0Joseph Cullen in relation to the event.", "AFP Fact Check further found that \u201cthe European Union Human Rights Forum\u201d is not among the EU's fourteen institutions.", "Several Nigerian media including the Sahara Reporters and Peoples Gazette dismissed Ahmad\u2019s statement as fabricated.", "In response, the presidential aide posted a tweet saying he got the story from Channels TV.", "AFP Fact Check has contacted Ahmad\u00a0for comment but is yet to receive a reply.", "Meanwhile, Channels TV has corrected its story following AFP Fact Check\u2019s revelation, acknowledging that there is no relationship between the EU and the forum. The Leadership Newspaper also removed the publication from its website.", "Our investigation showed the United Nations released a \u00a0statement\u00a0on December 18, 2020, commending Nigeria's\u00a0\"swift\u00a0action\" in the rescue of the kidnapped children.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
