None. Even --", "Lemon: You\u2019d have to be more specific about what data and what nonsense you\u2019re talking about.", "Clarke: That law enforcement officers treat black males different than white males in policing in these urban areas.", "Lemon: There is data that supports that.", "Clarke: There is not data.", "Lemon: The president spoke about it. Cedric Alexander, who\u2019s a law enforcement officer --", "Clarke: The president has been lying about it. He said it again the other day, when he said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males. Don, that is a lie.", "Lemon: That is not a lie.", "So, Clarke makes a two-part claim:", "1. That Obama said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males.", "Is that what Obama said?", "2. That the figure Obama cited is \"a lie\" because \"there is no data\" to back it up.", "In other words, are black males twice as likely as white males to be shot by police?", "In paraphrasing the president and calling a statistic a lie, even while saying there is no relevant data, Clarke makes a claim that\u2019s on an important topic but in a somewhat muddled way.", "Let\u2019s try to sort it out.", "What Obama said", "Clarke didn\u2019t provide us any evidence that Obama said what he said he did.", "But the White House provided us, and PolitiFact National has annotated, what the president said July 7, 2016 in Warsaw, Poland. Obama spoke days after the fatal police shootings of two African-American men -- Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile, in Falcon Heights, Minn.", "One statistic the president recited was: \"Last year, African-Americans were shot by police at more than twice the rate of whites.\"", "So, Clarke was slightly off in his paraphrasing.

It's chock full of data that supports my position.\"", "Mac Donald, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research in New York, told us she didn\u2019t have any statistics on whether black males are more likely to be shot by police.", "Mac Donald did emphasize that how often black males are shot by police should be considered not in terms of what percentage black males are of the total population, but their rates of violent crime, since being involved in violent crime increases the likelihood of being shot by police.", "That view has been advanced by some criminologists.
