["One post on Facebook from November 30, 2018 is a link to an article headlined: \u201cHeavy protest as Zimbabwe's Economy collapses, citizens cry for return of white farmers\u201d. This has been shared 2,552 times.", "A few comments on the post prophesy that the same fate will befall South Africans, \u201cTake note South Africans and all that happens here is that the farmers are being slaughtered daily\u201d", "Another comment with 42 likes wrote, \u201cYou got what you wanted, didn't you!!
