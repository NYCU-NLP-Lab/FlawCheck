This video was taken at Danger Danger bar in Wellington as the clock struck midnight on June 9, 2020, ending the country's social distancing enforcement.", "Matt McLaughlin, the owner of Danger Danger, told Australia's Stuff news outlet the following:", "\"It's a great video of midnight hitting and everyone jumping off their chairs and jumping on the dance floor.
