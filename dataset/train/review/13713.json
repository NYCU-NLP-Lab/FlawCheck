["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on March 6, 2017 | Updated on March 20, 2017", "With no evidence, President Donald Trump called it a \u201cfact\u201d that \u201cPresident Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!\u201d He compared the alleged surveillance to the criminal acts of \u201cNixon/Watergate.\u201d", "It was a startling and serious allegation about a former president,\u00a0made in a series of four tweets on March 4. Yet, Trump provided no support for it, and the White House remained silent for a day. When\u00a0the White House press office finally got around to explaining the\u00a0president\u2019s tweets, it undercut Trump\u2019s baseless claim:", "We will break this down into two parts: What Trump claimed, and the evidence that the White House provided that failed to support his claim.", "It began with a tweet at 6:35 a.m. from Mar-a-Lago, the so-called winter White House that Trump owns in Florida:", "Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017", "Trump continued in this fashion for three more tweets for\u00a0about a half hour:", "Is it legal for a sitting President to be \"wire tapping\" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017", "I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017", "How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017", "What is Trump talking about? The White House didn\u2019t respond for more than 24 hours. When it did, the press secretary issued a brief statement, which we run here in its entirety:", "Spicer, March 5: Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling.", "President Donald J. Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016.", "Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted.", "The \u201cRussian activity\u201d is a reference to the\u00a0U.S. intelligence community\u2019s finding in January that \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.\u201d The FBI and several congressional committees are continuing to investigate Russia\u2019s role and possible connections between Russia and Trump associates.", "Spicer didn\u2019t say much in his brief statement, but we learned the president\u2019s claim of Watergate-style criminal abuse of power was not based on U.S. intelligence briefings, but on \u201creports.\u201d", "Later that day, Sanders went on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d where she reiterated the White House\u2019s call for an investigation and cited news organizations that \u201creported on the potential of this having had happened.\u201d", "In essence, Spicer and Huckabee aren\u2019t saying the president\u2019s statement is accurate; they are saying it may be accurate \u2014 without providing any evidence to support even that possibility.", "Sanders went even further by claiming that Trump was only citing what \u201cmultiple news outlets\u201d have already reported.", "Sanders, March 5: Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there. There are multiple news outlets that have reported this.", "That is false, as we explain next as we look at the news stories cited by the White House as evidence.", "When we asked for the news articles referenced by Sanders, the White House provided us with a timeline of events from five news stories written by four news organizations. Only two of the stories were relevant to Trump\u2019s accusations, and none of them claimed that Obama ordered illegal wiretaps.", "Trump\u2019s claim rests primarily on the reporting of Heat Street, a conservative website owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp and started by Louise Mensch, a former Conservative Party member of the British Parliament.", "In a Nov. 7, 2016, article, Heat Street wrote that the FBI on two occasions sought a warrant from the\u00a0Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISA court,\u00a0as part of its investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. presidential election, and Trump associates who were suspected of contacts with Russian officials.", "Heat Street reported that the FBI failed in June to obtain a warrant, but it was successful in October after the request was narrowed to focus on possible \u201cfinancial and banking offenses\u201d involving two Russian banks:", "Heat Street, Nov. 7, 2016: The first request, which, sources say, named Trump, was denied back in June, but the second was drawn more narrowly and was granted in October\u00a0after evidence was presented of a server, possibly related to the\u00a0Trump campaign, and its alleged links to two banks; SVB Bank and Russia\u2019s Alfa Bank.", "The administration also referred us to a Jan. 12, 2017, report\u00a0on the BBC website, which also cited anonymous sources who said that the FBI received a FISA court warrant in October.", "The BBC report said the warrant targeted two Russian banks suspected of sending \u201cmoney to Mr Trump\u2019s organisation or his election campaign.\u201d However, the BBC report said that \u201cneither Mr. Trump nor his associates are named in the FISA order\u201d:", "BBC, Jan. 12, 2017: On 15 October, the US secret intelligence court issued a warrant to investigate two Russian banks. This news was given to me by several sources and corroborated by someone I will identify only as a senior member of the US intelligence community. He would never volunteer anything \u2013 giving up classified information would be illegal \u2013 but he would confirm or deny what I had heard from other sources. \u2026", "Neither Mr Trump nor his associates are named in the Fisa order, which would only cover foreign citizens or foreign entities \u2013 in this case the Russian banks. But ultimately, the investigation is looking for transfers of money from Russia to the United States, each one, if proved, a felony offence.", "These stories,\u00a0which were based on anonymous sources and have not been confirmed, do not support Trump\u2019s claims that \u201cPresident Obama was tapping my phones in October,\u201d or that the alleged wiretapping was illegal.", "First, the president has no role in the FBI\u2019s decision to seek a warrant or the FISA court\u2019s approval for one, as explained in a 2006 story by the New York Times\u00a0on how the FISA application process works. The warrant application would be initiated by the FBI and presented to the FISA court by Justice Department attorneys.", "Second, the FBI must prove to the court that there is \u201cprobable cause\u201d that the target of the warrant is \u201can agent of a foreign power\u201d and engaged in criminal activity, as explained in a joint statement last year to Congress by the intelligence community officials.", "Neither Heat Street nor the BBC alleged any wrongdoing by Obama or the FBI in allegedly obtaining a FISA court warrant in October.", "On the same day that the White House provided us with these stories,\u00a0James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence under Obama, appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and\u00a0denied that a FISA court warrant was issued to monitor Trump Tower.", "\u201cFor the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI, there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president, the president-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign,\u201d Clapper said.", "Clapper said he would have known whether the FBI had a court order for surveillance, and he was not aware of one.", "Obama\u2019s spokesman, Kevin Lewis, also denied Trump\u2019s allegation, calling it \u201csimply false\u201d in a statement issued on Twitter.", "\u201cA cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen.\u201d", "The three other stories cited by the White House:", "It is the responsibility of the politician making a claim to provide information to support it. But Trump\u00a0has failed to do so.", "First, there is no evidence that the FBI wiretapped Trump\u2019s phone or his campaign offices in Trump Tower. Indeed, the director of national intelligence flatly denied it.", "Second, the claim is loosely based on two reports \u2014 a conservative blog and a BBC report \u2014 that cited anonymous sources who claimed that the FBI obtained a warrant in October to investigate two Russian banks. Neither report\u00a0alleged any wrongdoing by Obama or even evidence that the warrant was obtained illegally.\u00a0In fact, Heat Street and the BBC claimed that the FBI obtained a legal warrant from the FISA court.", "Finally, there is no evidence Obama ordered any wiretapping, as Trump alleged. That would be handled by the FBI and Justice Department independently of the White House.", "Update, March 16: In a March 15 interview, Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson asked Trump why he made his accusation without providing evidence. Trump said that the New York Times \u201cwrote about it \u2026 on January 20 using the word wiretap.\u201d That is the New York Times story we mention earlier. It was posted to the paper\u2019s website on Jan. 19 and published Jan. 20 in the paper under the headline, \u201cWiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides.\u201d However, that story made no mention of Obama ordering a wiretap of Trump\u2019s phones, and, as we wrote, the paper said it \u201cwas not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201d", "Update, March 20: At a March 20 hearing of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, FBI Director James Comey testified that the Department of Justice and the FBI have no information to support Trump\u2019s tweets that the Obama administration wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower. \u201cWith respect to the president\u2019s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI,\u201d Comey said. \u201cThe Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components. The department has no information that supports those tweets.\u201d", "Update, Sept. 25:\u00a0CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0on Sept. 19 that federal investigators \u201cwiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election,\u201d citing unnamed sources. Some\u00a0have\u00a0cited\u00a0the CNN story as evidence that Trump was right. It isn\u2019t.
