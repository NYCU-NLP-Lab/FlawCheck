The image is available via Getty Images. where it is presented with the caption \"An eagle of the Guard from Above company, grasps a drone during a police exercise in Katwijk, on March 7, 2016.

As demonstrated by the Mythbusters crew, who are among the preeminent scientific experimenters of our time, drone blades, especially carbon fiber ones, can cause serious damage to an animal. If an eagle were to misjudge its attack, or if the drone operator were to take evasive or defense maneuvers, a bird could be struck by the blades and seriously injured or killed ...", "Even if birds are well trained and are unexpectedly effective at avoiding rotors, how many eagles are we willing to risk if something goes wrong?", "Seriously, bald eagles have been through enough. Bald eagles were taken off the Endangered Species List less than ten years ago, which is about 15 minutes in evolutionary time. Humans nearly wiped them out through a combination of pesticides (primarily DDT), habitat destruction, and illegal shooting. In 1963, bald eagles hit a population low in the United States of just 487 pairs. Since then they\u2019ve battled back and are just now repopulating old territories and establishing a stable population", "Guards from Above wrote on their website that \"animal welfare is very important\" and noted that they are currently studying the possible impact on the birds' claws:", "In nature, birds of prey often overpower large and dangerous prey. Their talons have scales, which protect them, naturally, from their victims\u2019 bites. The Dutch National Police has asked the Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) to research the possible impact on the birds\u2019 claws. The results are not yet known. Of course, we are continuously investigating any extra possible protective measures we can take in order to protect our birds.", "BBC News. \u00a0 \"The Eagle that Chases Drones.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 5 April 2016.", "Lund, Nicholas. \u00a0 \"Let\u2019s Not Force Eagles to Fight Rogue Drones.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 National Geographic. \u00a0 5 February 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
