It has donated 30 million doses to the U.S.", "While Novartis paid Giuliani a speaker\u2019s fee in 2006, there is no publicly available evidence that he currently has a financial stake in the company. He has denied having one in press reports.", "Financial disclosure documents indicate that Trump does not have a current connection to Novartis.", "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s promotion of a lupus and arthritis drug to treat COVID-19 patients is raising eyebrows about his motivation.", "In an interview with Fox News on April 5, Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, said hydroxychloroquine could potentially be used to alleviate symptoms associated with the coronavirus.", "\"I think we should let doctors decide whether we should use hydroxychloroquine, not the national bureaucracy,\" he said. \"Everything shows that it works.\"", "Giuliani\u2019s comments echo what Trump has said over the past few weeks, despite the fact that medical experts still don\u2019t know much about the drug\u2019s efficacy against COVID-19. (Not every study shows that it works, for instance.) But a tweet published the same day as the Fox interview claims Giuliani has ulterior motives for promoting the drug.", "\"Here @whpresscorps Ask Trump about THIS!!\" @Wiseronenow said in the tweet. \"\u2018Giuliani, in early February, bought $2M in shares of Novartis, a primary supplier of hydroxychloroquine. How many shares did Sean Hannity & the Trump family buy?\u2019\"", "(Screenshot from Twitter)", "The tweet was referred to us by VineSight, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation.

The company paid Cohen more than $1 million in consulting fees in 2017, not 2016. And while Trump did attend a dinner with a Novartis leader in January, it was not a one-on-one meeting with the CEO.", "Novartis is a Swiss pharmaceutical company. It has donated hydroxychloroquine to the U.S. National Strategic Stockpile for use in treating COVID-19 patients.", "On March 29, the Department of Health and Human Services published a statement saying that it had accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated by Sandoz, the generics division of Novartis. The company said in an earlier press release that it plans to give out 130 million doses by the end of May.", "The donation came after Trump said during a March 19 press briefing that chloroquine could potentially be used to treat COVID-19.

Giuliani told the Times he does not have any financial interests in hydroxychloroquine. We reached out to him for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.", "Novartis has had connections with another Trump associate.", "In May 2018, the company disclosed that it had paid Cohen, the former Trump personal attorney, for health care policy consulting.

However, Cohen was still paid for a year under the terms of the contract.", "In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for campaign finance violations and lying to Congress.", "The connection between Cohen and Novartis has led some to speculate that Trump has financial motives for promoting hydroxychloroquine.

The event included a slew of executives from other companies around the world.", "Even if Trump or his associates did have some stake in Novartis, it\u2019s uncertain whether they\u2019d reap financial benefits from the increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine.
