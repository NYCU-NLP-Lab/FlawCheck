["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on October 29, 2020", "President Donald Trump and his allies continue to ignore Joe Biden\u2019s written plan to only prohibit permits for new oil and gas drilling on federal land and waters. That plan would allow for extraction methods, such as fracking, to continue under existing permits and in nonfederal areas \u2014 where the vast majority of U.S. oil and natural gas is produced.", "Instead, the president and pro-Trump groups supporting his reelection claim the Democratic presidential nominee will end or ban fracking based on confusing statements Biden made \u2014 but he and his campaign later clarified \u2014 during the primaries.", "A TV ad the Trump campaign started running Oct. 27 in Pennsylvania features \u201cJen,\u201d a \u201cfracking technician,\u201d saying, \u201cIf Joe Biden\u2019s elected, he\u2019ll end fracking. That would be the end of my job and thousands of others.\u201d It\u2019s almost identical to an ad, featuring the same woman, the Trump campaign released Oct. 1.", "In addition, on Oct. 23, America First Action, a conservative super PAC backing Trump, began airing an ad in the state that makes the same claim. It features \u201cBrian,\u201d an \u201coil and gas worker,\u201d saying, \u201cJoe Biden says he wants to ban fracking. That would ruin us.\u201d A graphic shown on screen also says, \u201cJoe Biden would cost Pennsylvania,\u201d the second largest natural gas producing state, \u201c600,000 jobs.\u201d", "We\u2019ve already written about similarly misleading attacks on Biden from that group, including the estimate of 609,000 lost jobs by 2025. That figure comes from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Global Energy Institute\u2019s 2019 analysis of a nationwide ban on fracking, which isn\u2019t what Biden has proposed. Combined, there were only about 47,000 direct petroleum and natural gas jobs in the state in 2019, according to the 2020 Pennsylvania Energy Employment Report.", "Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, his vice presidential running mate, have both repeatedly said that Biden won\u2019t push to ban all fracking if he\u2019s elected. The energy plan he has released, and that is available on his website, supports that claim.", "Mainly, it states: \u201cAs president, Biden will lead the world to address the climate emergency and lead through the power of example, by ensuring the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050.\u201d Net-zero emissions means the amount of greenhouse gases emitted in the U.S. would be matched by the amount sequestered, or removed, from the atmosphere.", "The plan says Biden will provide incentives for the development and use of carbon capture technology, and work to hold polluters financially accountable. It also promises that Biden will demand a worldwide ban on fossil fuel subsidies, and help fossil fuel workers, such as coal miners and power plant operators, transition to clean energy jobs.", "As for fracking, otherwise known as hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technique used to extract oil and natural gas from underground rock formations, the plan mentions \u201cbanning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters\u201d as part of \u201cBiden\u2019s Day One Unprecedented Executive Actions to Drive Historic Progress.\u201d That, as we said, allows existing drilling permits to continue on federal lands and does nothing to stop drilling on private land.", "To support the claim that Biden will or wants to end fracking, Trump and others point to unclear comments Biden made primarily before he clinched the Democratic nomination for president.", "During the final presidential debate, for example, Trump, Biden and the moderator, Kristen Welker of NBC News, had this exchange:", "Trump, Oct. 22: We\u2019re going to have the greatest economy in the world, but if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. \u2026 And what about fracking?", "Welker: Let me-", "Trump: Now we have to ask him about fracking.", "Welker: Let me allow the Vice President Biden to respond.", "Biden: I never said I oppose fracking.", "Trump: You said it on tape.", "Biden: Show the tape, put it on your website.", "Trump: I\u2019ll put it on.", "Biden: Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he\u2019s flat lying.", "But Trump wasn\u2019t lying; Biden had made statements about his climate policies that critics interpreted as voicing support for a fracking prohibition. Some of those remarks are included in a campaign video that Trump has shown at recent rallies in West Salem, Wisconsin; Circleville, Ohio; and Martinsburg and Lititz, Pennsylvania.", "And some of the edited clips in that video leave out important context.", "To start, in the section of the video titled \u201cBiden Will Ban Fracking,\u201d it shows CNN\u2019s Dana Bash asking Biden at a July 2019 Democratic candidates debate, \u201cWould there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?\u201d In the Trump video, Biden answers: \u201cNo, we would \u2014 we would work it out. We would make sure it\u2019s eliminated.\u201d", "\u201cJoe Biden is committed to achieving a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050,\u201d his campaign said in a statement clarifying his remarks the night of that debate. \u201cHe supports eliminating subsidies for coal and gas and deploying carbon capture sequestration technology to create economic benefits for multiple industries and significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\u201d", "Next, the video shows a clip of Biden telling an environmental activist in September 2019, \u201cI guarantee you, we\u2019re going to end fossil fuel,\u201d which includes oil and gas.", "Then, it transitions to a video of Biden from a March 15 debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \u201cNo more \u2013 no new fracking,\u201d Biden says in the clip.", "Not shown in Trump\u2019s video is that Biden went on to say \u201cno more drilling on federal lands,\u201d which is closer to what his energy plan says. His campaign also said that night that he only meant no new permits for oil and gas drilling on federal land and offshore.", "After that, the video shows Biden telling CNBC in May, \u201cI\u2019d gradually move away from fracking.\u201d", "But Biden was even more emphatic about not banning all fracking in that interview, in which he said: \u201cThe whole idea of whether or not we\u2019re going to stop fracking, I would not stop fracking. I\u2019d gradually move away from fracking. I would just not do more fracking on federal lands. I would gradually move us out of the position of relying on oil and gas, excuse me, and coal.\u201d That part isn\u2019t in the Trump campaign video.", "Later in the video, Biden is heard saying at a February rally interrupted by protesters that the protesters \u201cwant to do the same thing that I want to do. They want to phase out fossil fuels and we\u2019re going to phase out fossil fuels.\u201d", "And, finally, the video ends with the portion of the Oct. 22 debate where Trump pressed Biden on his plans for the oil industry. \u201cWould you close down the oil industry?\u201d Trump asked his Democratic challenger. Biden is then shown responding, \u201cI would transition from the oil industry, yes.\u201d", "In the debate, but not shown in the video, Biden went on to explain what he meant. \u201cBecause it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time, over time, and I\u2019d stop giving to the oil industry, I\u2019d stop giving them federal subsidies,\u201d he said.", "When Trump later claimed Biden \u201cis going to destroy the oil industry,\u201d Biden responded by saying: \u201cHe takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2035 is in energy production, by 2050 totally.\u201d Again, that is more in line with the proposal Biden has released.", "The key takeaway: Biden undoubtedly wants the U.S. to be much less dependent on energy from fossil fuels, and is aiming for net-zero emissions within the next 30 years. But his platform does not call for a full ban on either fossil fuels or fracking, which would take an act of Congress.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
