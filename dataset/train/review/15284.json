I won with women by vast, vast majorities. I was way, way up with women far above anybody else in the exit polls of the recent election.\"", "Clinton may have gleefully embraced Trump\u2019s \"woman card\" attack line, but we thought it\u2019s still worth checking whether Trump is right that Clinton \"doesn\u2019t do very well with women.\"", "Trump, as it turns out, couldn\u2019t be more wrong.", "The recent primaries", "Let\u2019s give Trump his due: He has a right to be braggadocious about his own record with women voters in recent GOP primaries.", "Trump unquestionably routed his opponents among female voters during the four recent primaries for which exit polls exist. He won 57 percent of women in the New York primary, 55 percent of women in the Connecticut primary, 50 percent of women in the Maryland primary, and 54 percent of women in the Pennsylvania primary.", "That said, even among women voting in these GOP primaries, Trump experiences a gender gap: According to these exit polls, women -- by a modest but consistent margin -- supported Trump by smaller margins than men did. In New York, he was six points stronger among men. In Connecticut that gap was five points, in Maryland it was nine points, and in Pennsylvania it was seven points.", "And there\u2019s an even more important problem for Trump\u2019s claim: His own success among Republican women doesn\u2019t have anything to say about how well or poorly Clinton is doing with women.", "Polling a Clinton vs. Trump matchup", "We found seven April polls at realclearpolitics.com that asked respondents about how they would vote if Clinton faced off against Trump in November.

In April\u2019s GWU/Battleground poll, for instance, Clinton scored a 51 percent favorable rating among women, with 47 percent unfavorable. By contrast, Trump\u2019s rating among women in the same poll was 26 percent favorable, 71 percent unfavorable.", "The flip side is that Clinton does under-perform among men; the GWU/Battleground poll found that views of Clinton among men are 33 percent favorable, 66 percent unfavorable. Karlyn Bowman, a poll analyst for the American Enterprise Institute, considers this \"a big problem for her.\"", "But the silver lining, she added, is that \"if past elections are a guide, more women will vote than men \u2013 probably about 53 to 54 percent.\"", "Our ruling", "Trump said, \"Frankly, (Hillary Clinton) doesn\u2019t do very well with women.\"", "The evidence he used to support this claim during the CNN interview -- his large margins among women in recent GOP primaries -- is undeniable, but says nothing about how well Clinton does among women. In fact, looking at a cross-section of April polls, Clinton\u2019s average lead over Trump among female voters is bigger than any nominee has registered in an actual presidential election election in at least 36 years.
