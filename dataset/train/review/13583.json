["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on September 25, 2020", "For nearly two months, President Donald Trump has touted an 85% decline in the nation\u2019s COVID-19 case fatality rate since April \u2014 and has attributed the drop to improvements in treatment. But better treatment is only part of the story.", "Experts say part, if not most, of the decline can be explained by expanded testing and a shift toward younger people \u2014 rather than higher-risk older folks \u2014 catching the coronavirus.", "Since the end of July, Trump has wielded the impressive-sounding statistic in press briefings and rallies, playing up the effectiveness of existing therapies and claiming credit for those discoveries.", "\u201cDue to the medical advances we\u2019ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus,\u201d he said in a July 27 briefing in North Carolina, \u201cthe mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85% lower than it was in April \u2014 think of that: 85%.\u201d", "In early August, Trump began mentioning specific drugs, even though several of them have yet to be proven to be effective in reducing COVID-19 mortality \u2014 and knowledge about another came from a British clinical trial.", "\u201cWe\u2019re developing a bounty of therapies such as remdesivir, dexamethasone, antibody treatments \u2014 the antibody treatments are really working out well, really well \u2014 and many more that have allowed us to reduce mortality by 85% since April,\u201d he said in remarks at a Whirlpool plant in Ohio on Aug. 6.", "In rallies and other speeches throughout September, the mortality drop has been one of his go-to lines. \u201cThrough pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate 85% since April,\u201d Trump has said, with slight variation, more than 10 times, often mentioning the antiviral drug remdesivir and convalescent plasma.", "In an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, Trump went so far as to suggest that current treatments are so good that they\u2019re \u201cpretty close to a cure.\u201d", "Trump, Sept. 12: We also have already come out with therapeutics, if you look at remdesivir and others, the plasma. You take a look at the things that we\u2019ve come out with already and the number, we\u2019re 85% better in terms of fatalities. You look at the kind of numbers, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been seeing this, but we\u2019re in \u2014 we\u2019re really rounding the corner. And this is actually without anything further than we already have but we have some very good things out there already in terms of \u2014 I would say in terms of \u2014 you can\u2019t use the word cure yet but pretty close to a cure. You\u2019re going to be pretty close to a cure.", "In fact, few proven therapies exist for COVID-19.", "\u201cWe are nowhere close [to] a cure,\u201d Dr. Eric Meyerowitz, an infectious disease specialist with the Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, told us in an email, \u201cthough we are certainly better off than we were in early March at the beginnings of the major surges in New York City and Boston.\u201d", "As we\u2019ll explain, Trump\u2019s statistic is a reference to the case fatality rate, which is an imperfect measure of mortality, as it is highly dependent on diagnostic testing. While he\u2019s right on its precipitous drop, he gives the inaccurate impression that those gains are entirely due to treatment advances.", "Increased testing and a greater proportion of infections among younger individuals are significant factors.", "\u201cMore effective medical management may be playing a role in the falling case fatality rate in the US, but I suspect this improvement has been small relative to the large decrease,\u201d said University of Pennsylvania infectious disease fellow Dr. Aaron Richterman in an email.", "Neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to repeated inquiries about the source of 85% statistic, but our colleagues at PolitiFact were told by the White House that the president was referring to the case fatality rate \u2014 and were directed to a graph made by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine and an economist at Stanford University.", "The case fatality rate, or CFR, is the percentage of deaths from the coronavirus among the confirmed cases.", "In the graph, which plots the CFR on a weekly basis using a two-week lag to accommodate delayed deaths, the CFR reaches nearly 30% in mid- to late-March, before falling to about 10% on April 1 and steadily declining to less than 2% by late July.", "It\u2019s a bit unclear if Trump\u2019s specific statistic is derived from the graph, although the approximate numbers are consistent with an 85-90% decline between the beginning of April and late July. Bhattacharya told us he shared his graph with some colleagues, but didn\u2019t know how the White House came to be aware of it.", "We arrived at a similar result looking through a COVID-19 dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Using the ratio of COVID-19 deaths to probable and suspected COVID-19 cases, we calculated a crude CFR of 7.7% for all ages for the month of April. That dropped 83% to 1.3% in the month of July and further slipped to 0.9% for the month of August, for a total decline of 88% since April. (Note: The cumulative CFR remains much higher, at 3.4%, as it is predominated by the larger number of deaths early in the pandemic; the figures can be found using the visualization tool.)", "Regardless of the exact data, Trump is correct that the case fatality rate has fallen substantially since April. Where he goes wrong is in attributing the steep decline to treatment improvements when other factors are also at play.", "We\u2019ve noted before the challenges in interpreting the CFR. Because it\u2019s just a raw calculation of the number of observed deaths divided by the number of identified cases, it\u2019s not an accurate estimate of the percentage of people who are infected with the coronavirus die, since it\u2019s hard to know the true number of infections.", "In the beginning of the pandemic, when testing was still extremely limited, the U.S. was not capturing many of the less severe COVID-19 cases, which invariably led to an artificially high CFR. As testing expanded, more and more of those cases were included.", "\u201cIn the early days, only the sickest cases were getting diagnosed, so unsurprisingly a higher % of these died relative to now, when many other cases are identified,\u201d explained Richterman.", "During the month of April, only about 5.3 million tests were performed, versus more than 23 million each in the months of July and August, according to the COVID Tracking Project.", "It also matters who is getting sick, and that has also changed over time. Richterman noted that early on, many outbreaks occurred in nursing homes \u2014 places with elderly folks with underlying conditions \u2014 where COVID-19 mortality is very high.", "\u201cNow, the epidemic is being propagated more in younger people, people living in congregate settings, people doing work in close quarters with inability to socially distance, etc.,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of these people have an inherently lower risk of death.\u201d", "Indeed, the CDC published a report on Sept. 23 describing the changing age distribution among those infected with the coronavirus, noting that in the early months \u201cCOVID-19 incidence was highest among older adults\u201d but that shifted to people ages 20 to 29 over the summer. That younger cohort accounted for more than 20% of cases from June to August.", "Improvements in treatment are likely part of the reason for the declining CFR \u2014 but not the only one, as Trump suggests.", "Bhattacharya, who has said the scientific community has \u201coverreacted\u201d to the pandemic, told us there have been \u201csubstantial improvements\u201d in COVID-19 treatment since the start of the pandemic, including \u201cimproved protocols for ventilator use for people with severe viral pneumonia, and the availability of drugs like remdesivir and dexamethasone which have definitely improved outcomes.\u201d", "But he also said other contributors to the falling CFR were the shift toward lower-risk younger people and the fact that more widespread testing is picking up mild or asymptomatic coronavirus cases.", "\u201cI do not know of a study that \u2026 systematically decomposes these three contributors to declining CFR,\u201d he said. \u201cAll three are important and the fact that the CFR picks up changes in all three makes it a statistic worth tracking.\u201d", "In his view, the high CFR numbers reported early on \u201cspread fear and panic,\u201d and he added that \u201c[i]t seems the responsible thing to do to report that the CFR has dropped since those early days.\u201d", "Other experts were less certain of the impact of improvements in treatment.", "\u201cThe mainstay of treatment for severe COVID-19 is excellent supportive care in an intensive care unit, and this has not fundamentally changed over time,\u201d said Richterman. \u201cThat said, in areas experiencing very large epidemics (New York City comes to mind), [it\u2019s] plausible that overwhelmed health systems were unable to provide the best possible supportive care early on in the pandemic.\u201d", "Tara C. Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University\u2019s College of Public Health, also told PolitiFact that she suspects what matters most for the declining CFR are increases in testing and the switch to more infections in younger people \u2014 and that drug advances would be \u201ca much smaller piece of the pie.\u201d", "Richterman noted that in terms of specific therapies, only two evidence-based treatments are available: remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone.", "\u201cWhile both might reduce risk of death, only dexamethasone has been proven to do so, and this would account for only a moderate reduction in risk of death relative to the large drop in case fatality rate,\u201d he said.", "\u201cWe have a long way to go in our treatment,\u201d he added, contradicting the president\u2019s rosy assessment of current COVID-19 therapies.", "Although Trump frames the dexamethasone finding as an American development, it was the RECOVERY randomized controlled trial in the U.K. that first identified a mortality benefit of using the drug in select hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The finding was announced on June 16, well after the U.S.\u2019s CFR began to fall.", "To be sure, some American doctors used steroids such as dexamethasone prior to the study results, but until that point, whether the medication would hurt or help patients was unclear. And the study revealed that the drug did not help patients who did not need supplemental oxygen, and may have harmed them.", "Remdesivir, which is made by the U.S. company Gilead Sciences, has not yet shown that it helps COVID-19 patients survive. The drug received an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for those with severe COVID-19 on June 1 based on a study that found the drug shortened the time to recovery among hospitalized patients.", "The study\u2019s\u00a0results hint at a possible survival advantage with the drug: the\u00a014-day mortality was 7.1% among those given remdesivir versus 11.9% for those who received placebo.\u00a0But\u00a0Meyerowitz said the finding \u201cdid not meet statistical significance, so with the data available there is no clear mortality benefit for remdesivir for hospitalized patients.\u201d", "If additional data show that those relative mortality figures hold, he added, then those getting remdesivir would be about 30% less likely to die.", "As for convalescent plasma, although some of the results are promising, it too has not yet been proven to reduce COVID-19 mortality, as we\u2019ve written before.", "Following the FDA\u2019s EUA for plasma for hospitalized COVID-19 patients on Aug. 23, the National Institutes of Health\u2019s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued a statement explaining that there is \u201cno data from well-controlled, adequately powered randomized clinical trials\u201d that show the therapy is safe and effective for COVID-19.", "The statement noted that the FDA\u2019s analysis of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Expanded Access Program for convalescent plasma, which was at the core of the EUA decision, did not find a difference in seven-day survival among those given high- versus low-concentration plasma. Instead, a survival benefit was only observed in a subset of patients who were not intubated, with 11% of those receiving antibody-rich plasma dying within a week compared with 14% of patients given low-concentration plasma.", "Based on the data, the panel neither recommends for nor recommends against the use of plasma.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
