On 24 May 2016, a spokesperson stated that Clinton would not be participating in any further debates, due to time constraints:", "Hillary Clinton will not debate Bernie Sanders in California, her top campaign spokeswoman said Monday.", "\"As we have said previously, we plan to compete hard in the remaining primary states, particularly California, while turning our attention to the threat a Donald Trump presidency poses,\" Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's spokeswoman, said. \"We believe that Hillary Clinton's time is best spent campaigning and meeting directly with voters across California and preparing for a general election campaign that will ensure the White House remains in Democratic hands.\"", "The report originated with Trump's 25 May 2016 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live:", "The idea of a debate between the two men came up on Wednesday when Mr. Trump was appearing on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d and Mr. Kimmel said that Mr. Sanders had passed along an invitation to Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.

If we can raise $10 or $15 million for charity, which would be a very appropriate amount.\" \"I understand the television business very well. I think it would get high ratings,\" Trump added. The Republican nominee said his team has been in conversations with several networks about hosting the debate. \"It should be in a big arena somewhere. And we can have a lot of fun with it. I'd love to debate Bernie\" he said. \"The problem with debating Bernie is he's going to lose. Because honestly his system is rigged.

Trump\u2019s high bar for the debate make such a meeting before the California primary highly unlikely, but Trump sees it as a win-win proposition, as it puts likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a bind.

Likewise, the networks want to make a killing on these events and are not proving to be too generous to charitable causes, in this case, women\u2019s health issues.
