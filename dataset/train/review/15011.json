According to a BFAD statement, too much intake of 'vetsin' or MSG causes adverse effects on health that could lead to death if the body is not able to cope. According to BFAD, 'vetsin' is a food additive that has extremely harmful or 'fatal' effects to health if consumed without mixing with any food.\"", "The post also includes photos of several MSG products, one of which is overlaid with text that states: \u201cMSG / A Silent Killer\u201d.", "BFAD was the name of the FDA until 2009.", "MSG, known in the Philippines as \u201cvetsin\u201d, is a flavour enhancer -- a white or off-white crystalline powder used to add flavour to food.", "An identical claim was shared here and here on Facebook; and here on Twitter.", "This report, posted August 3, 2008 on the website of local news organisation Philstar.com, also contains an identical claim but without photos of MSG\u00a0products.", "Yet these posts omit important details about MSG.", "In response to the posts, Dr. Eric Domingo, FDA director general, sent AFP this 2006 issuance that lists MSG among \u201cadditives permitted for use in food in general\u201d.", "\u201cThis is the latest about MSG and it still holds,\u201d Domingo said in a Viber message on October 15, 2020.", "This 2013 FDA issuance reiterates MSG is \u201csafe\u201d and among the list of permissible food additives.", "The same advice about MSG safety is also reflected in this US FDA page, which states: \u201cFDA considers the addition of MSG to foods to be \u2018generally recognized as safe\u2019 (GRAS).
