There is no maximum limit on super PAC donations, and donors are public.", "\"Soros could give a million to New Day for America,\" said Sutton, referencing the super PAC supporting Kasich. \"He doesn\u2019t have to hide it, why would he do that? If he\u2019s artificially manipulating Kasich\u2019s campaign in the name of other people, just look at the list of donors and explain all these other companies that have given more.\"", "We looked at the list of donors ourselves.", "There are donations to the New Day for America PAC from two individuals linked to Soros. Scott Bessent is a former chief investment officer for Soros Fund Management who left to start his own hedge fund company last year, with $2 billion in seed money from Soros. Campaign finance records show that he donated $200,000 to New Day for America, as well as $2,700 to Kasich directly.", "Bessent has\u00a0donated to other conservative causes since 2015, including the Right to Rise PAC that supported Jeb Bush ($5,000) and to the Republican National Committee ($39,800). But he's donated to Democrats too; in 2013 he gave $25,000 to the Ready for Hillary PAC.", "Similarly, Stanley Druckenmiller, who managed assets for Soros from 1988 to 2000, gave $450,000 to New Day for America last year. If Druckenmiller shares any of Soros\u2019 political philosophies, they aren\u2019t apparent in his donor history. He has also consistently given money to Republican candidates\u2019 super PACs and the Republican National Committee.", "A Trusted Leadership PAC spokeswoman confirmed that Bessent and Druckenmiller are the donors that\u00a0connect Soros to Kasich.", "According to OpenSecrets.org, which tracks campaign contributions, Soros has given $7 million this cycle to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC that supports Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. He also gave $25,000 to the pro-Clinton Ready PAC, and $1 million to American Bridge 21st Century, which funds opposition research against Republican candidates and causes.", "There is a \"firewall\" between candidates and the super PACs backing them, said Sutton, and while Kasich may not be happy about contributions from people connected to Soros, he can\u2019t tell them to knock it off.", "Candidates cannot have any contact with PACs or their donors.", "For these reasons, Sutton said, \"If there was a conspiracy, it\u2019s the worst conspiracy ever, because it\u2019s not working.\"", "He added: \"Kasich\u2019s people would love to have power at this level, because then they might be able to raise enough money to rival anything near what\u2019s going on in other campaigns.\"", "The most recent campaign finance filing from the pro-Kasich PAC shows nearly $10 million in contributions from individual donors, and $14 million in expenditures.", "Connie Wehrkamp, spokeswoman for New Day For America, told PolitiFact Ohio that the organization sent station managers in Wisconsin a letter on March 29, reading, \"We demand that your station investigate the false, misleading, and deceptive claims contained in this advertisement and remove it from the air.\"", "So far, three television statements in Green Bay and one station in Wausau have pulled the ad, Wehrkamp said.", "Our ruling", "A pro-Cruz ad says, \"Millionaires working side by side with George Soros are bankrolling his (Kasich\u2019s) super PAC.\"", "Donations totalling $650,000 from two guys who once worked with Soros hardly equate to \"bankrolling\" Kasich. The ad\u2019s on-screen text goes even further to mislead voters with a blatantly false claim that Soros is directly giving to Kasich.
