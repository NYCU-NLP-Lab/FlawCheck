["By Robert Farley and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on October 31, 2017", "A day after the FBI announced that George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, had pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI, the\u00a0president tweeted: \u201cFew people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.\u201d", "In a press briefing on Oct. 30, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was similarly dismissive, calling Papadopoulos\u2019 role in the campaign \u201cextremely limited.\u201d Ten times, Sanders noted that Papadopoulos was a volunteer on the campaign, and that he served on an advisory council that only met once.", "Asked about his activities, Sanders said she could not \u201cspeak on behalf of the thousands of people that may have volunteered on the campaign.\u201d", "Those descriptions might conjure images of someone whose role amounted to little more than putting up lawn signs and licking envelopes, but there was more to Papadopoulos\u2019 position than that.", "Court documents released on Oct. 30 indicate that Papadopoulos, as a foreign policy adviser, was in communications with senior members of the Trump campaign. The documents did not name the campaign officials, identifying them only as \u201cthe High-Ranking Campaign Official,\u201d \u201cthe Senior Policy Advisor,\u201d and \u201cthe Campaign Supervisor.\u201d", "He also met with Trump at least once in a foreign policy meeting, as evidenced by a picture of Trump meeting with his \u201cnational security team\u201d on March 31, 2016, that was posted to Trump\u2019s own Instagram account. Papadopoulos is pictured (third from the left) sitting at the table for that meeting.", "Meeting with my national security team in #WashingtonDC. #Trump2016", "A post shared by  President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Mar 31, 2016 at 7:09pm PDT", "When he\u00a0met with the Washington Post editorial board on March 21, 2016, Trump named Papadopoulos as one of only a few members of the campaign\u2019s foreign policy team. \u201cGeorge Papadopoulos. He\u2019s an oil and energy consultant. Excellent guy,\u201d Trump said.", "It\u2019s true that Papadopoulos\u00a0was a volunteer for the campaign. But that doesn\u2019t always indicate a diminished role. As CNN notes: \u201cAccording to previous reporting, [campaign manager Paul] Manafort, [deputy campaign manager Rick] Gates, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and senior strategist Steve Bannon were all unpaid \u2018volunteers\u2019 while doing extensive, high-level work for the campaign.\u201d", "Papadopoulos wasn\u2019t that kind of volunteer, either. But he had contacts with Trump\u2019s senior campaign aides, court documents show.", "Who is George Papadopoulos?", "He started the 2016 campaign as a foreign policy adviser to Ben Carson, one of Trump\u2019s vanquished rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. The Carson campaign named Papadopoulos to its foreign policy team in December 2015, describing him as an energy consultant who had worked as an analyst and researcher at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C.", "According to his LinkedIn page, Papadopoulos earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science and government from DePaul University in 2009, and a master\u2019s degree from University College London in 2010.", "Shortly after Carson dropped out of the race in early March, Papadopoulos became a Trump campaign adviser. He first came into contact with a Russian intermediary on March 14, 2016, while traveling in Italy, according to the Justice Department. In a chance meeting, Papadopoulos met a professor\u00a0who he \u201cunderstood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials,\u201d the department said.", "The professor, whose name has been withheld by the Justice Department, took an interest in Papadopoulos because of his role in the Trump campaign. He would soon introduce Papadopoulos to two others: a \u201cFemale Russian National,\u201d\u00a0who Papadopoulos believed had \u201cconnections to Russian government officials,\u201d and \u201can individual in Moscow \u2026 who told defendant Papadopoulos he had connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\u201d the Justice Department said.", "Joseph Mifsud, an academic at the University of Stirling in Scotland, has since confirmed to the Telegraph that he is the \u201cprofessor\u201d named in the court documents, though he contests Papadopoulos\u2019 account.", "What contacts did Papadopoulos have with Russians and the Trump campaign?", "In announcing the guilty plea, the Department of Justice released a \u201cStatement of the Offense\u201d that lays out some \u2014 not all \u2014 of\u00a0Papadopoulos\u2019 work on behalf of the campaign and the contacts he had with \u201cthe Russians\u201d and Trump campaign officials.", "The statement\u00a0does not \u201cconstitute all of the facts known to the parties concerning the charged offense,\u201d but rather provides \u201cselected events\u201d to demonstrate that \u201csufficient facts exist\u201d for the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the Justice Department said. Both sides \u201cstipulate and agree\u201d that the facts contained in the statement \u201care true and accurate.\u201d", "In the statement, Papadopoulos was identified as having contacts with senior members of the Trump campaign on at least a dozen occasions from March through August of 2016 \u2014 including the March 31, 2016, national security meeting. At that meeting,\u00a0Papadopoulos \u201cintroduced himself to the group\u201d as someone who \u201chad connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin,\u201d according to the Justice Department statement.", "Seven days earlier,\u00a0Papadopoulos met with two Russian intermediaries in London and discussed the possibility of arranging a meeting between Trump and Putin. After his March 24, 2016, meeting in London,\u00a0Papadopoulos sent an email to \u201cthe Campaign Supervisor and several members of Campaign\u2019s foreign policy team,\u201d explaining that his Russian contacts wanted \u201cto arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump.\u201d", "\u201cThe Campaign Supervisor responded that he would \u2018work it through the campaign,\u2019 but that no commitments should be made at that point,\u201d the Justice Department statement says. \u201cThe Campaign Supervisor added: \u2018Great Work.\u2019 \u201d", "The Department of Justice did not name any of the campaign aides referenced in its statement.
