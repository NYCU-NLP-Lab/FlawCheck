If the state had been at the April 13 level for some time, then an increase from that level could be proof of a new trend.", "But that\u2019s not what happened.", "April 13 was a very unusual day for coronavirus testing. The state administered an average of 1,600 coronavirus tests daily in the first three weeks of April. But on April 13 it administered only 940 \u2014 400 less than any other day.", "Predictably, with fewer tests came fewer positive results, and a large dip in the number of new confirmed cases.", "The rise in the days after \u2014 identified by the story as proof of the election impact \u2014 was actually just a result of the number of tests growing to 1,355, then 1,495, then 1,802 the four days after April 13.

In the state\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing on April 20, 2020, she also noted the time between contracting the disease and being a confirmed case involves more than just the five-day median incubation time.", "\"I think folks do need to remember sort of the progression of this virus, from infection to symptoms to the conversation with your physician to the test to the test results,\" Palm said. \"It\u2019s not surprising that we have not seen \u2026 a large uptick from in-person voting.\"", "RELATED: Tracking coronavirus in Wisconsin", "If we look closer at the data before and after April 13, we see the state has so far seen no change in the frequency of new cases.", "The state averaged 153 new cases per day the week before April 13, and 153 the week after.
