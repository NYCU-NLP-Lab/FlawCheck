As a result, he said, \u201cWe just haven\u2019t got enough hospitals. We haven\u2019t got enough doctors. We haven\u2019t got enough facilities.\u201d", "Without \u201cfundamental reforms,\u201d Farage said, the NHS is at a \u201cbreaking point.\u201d", "And he issued this warning for Americans: \u201cThe big, big point is this: when the state gives benefits to people, any attempt in the future to reform it or take those benefits back becomes politically impossible. \u2026 If you [Americans] were to introduce universal health care, paid for essentially out of taxes, you would never, ever be able to remove that.\u201d", "Soon after, Trump tweeted this:", "The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working.
