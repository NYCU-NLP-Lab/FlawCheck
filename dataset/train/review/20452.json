And for the first time in history that hammer is being held by a woman.\"", "Almost, Whoopi. Almost.", "Marvel Comics announced this week it will introduce a new God of Thunder in the new comic series Thor in October -- and she will be a woman. The company billed it as a shocking shakeup, releasing an image of a blond, muscular woman outfitted in metal plating and a helmet with Mj\u00f6lnir, the hammer of Thor, in her grasp.", "\"This is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR. This is the THOR of the Marvel Universe.

And there have been occasional stories where a female has picked up the hammer; like there\u2019s an X-Men story where Storm picked up the hammer. But there\u2019s never been a female Thor.\"", "The inscription of Mj\u00f6lnir reads: \"Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\" In the news release, Moss joked that it\u2019s time to update the inscription.", "Neil Johnson, owner of Emerald City Comics in Clearwater, Fla., said that,\u00a0\"All through the history of that character, when Thor\u2019s been knocked out by a supervillain or whatever, there have been characters that have been worthy enough to pick up and wield the hammer.\"", "Several female heroes have been \"worthy\" of holding the weapon, joining Superman, Captain America and male heroes deemed worthy. This often happens when Thor has been incapacitated or is being punished by his father Odin in alternate storylines and the main canon.", "We found examples from reddit, the website Den of Geek and Johnson.", "The earliest example of a woman wielding the hammer is Jane Foster, Thor\u2019s human love interest, in a 1978 What If? issue (No. 1 on this list). In this alternate storyline, she discovered the hammer and became Thordis, saving Thor\u2019s alter ego Donald Blake and beating off alien rock monsters.", "In another alternate reality issue in 1994, Rogue of the X-Men used her mutant power of absorbing others\u2019 powers and basically sucked up Thor\u2019s life force, using his hammer to wreak destruction on Thor\u2019s alien realm, Asgard, before seeing the light and becoming the hero.", "Our reader pointed us to a 1996 crossover event between DC Comics and Marvel in which DC\u2019s Wonder Woman wielded Mj\u00f6lnir. Wonder Woman obtained the hammer and its powers ahead of a showdown with Marvel\u2019s Storm, a female character from the X-Men, but decided not to use it because it would not be a fair fight. (And so she lost.)", "And then there was the Earth-X miniseries in which Odin transformed Thor into a female version of himself per the urging of Thor\u2019s mischievous brother Loki (see the cover). This was an alternate future timeline, and some reasonable comic fans may argue (as a few did in our reddit thread) that those are considered non-canon and should not count.", "Still, Storm is one example of a woman who held the hammer in a story within regular continuity \"if people are worried about it,\" Johnson said. Storm uses Thor\u2019s hammer in the 2011 comic X-Men: To Serve and Protect #3 to destroy an imitation hammer called Stormcaster given to her by Loki (again, bad intentions) in a 1985 comic.", "Other female hammer-holders include Black Widow and Crusader, both in What If scenarios.
