(The liberal website Media Matters for America published a timeline of the events as they spread on Fox News; the ISIS-tweet narrative lasted several hours.)", "The ISIS tweet spread like wildfire before people noticed the real timestamp of the pro-ISIS tweet.", "In an interview with PunditFact, Geller said that at the time she wrote her tweet, she was not aware that \"Twitter's time stamping was not uniform.\"", "\"I updated the post when new information became available,\" Geller said.", "We have not been able to find any additional tweets from Geller indicating the incorrect timestamp from her first tweet, which is still still published online.", "Geller did post an update to one of her website articles about the ISIS tweet and timestamp issue. Another article on her website has not yet been updated.", "Authorities are still investigating whether there is an ISIS connection. The shooter, Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, was killed by police.", "On her website, Geller points out that the ISIS tweet was posted before the shooter was named or \"before we knew that the killer was a devout Muslim waging jihad,\" which to her is enough proof that the shooting was at least ISIS-inspired.", "Other news sources have been more careful in describing Abdulazeez\u2019s possible motivations or allegiances. ABC News described Abdulazeez as a \"disturbed (and) suicidal\" man who wrote about \"becoming a martyr.\" Still, Abdulazeez apparently called ISIS a \"stupid group \u2026 completely against Islam\" during a conversation with a friend, according to CNN.", "There are also different interpretations of Abdulazeez\u2019s seven-month trip to Jordan. Family members said the trip was intended to \"get (Abdulazeez) away from bad influences in the U.S.\" A government source told CBS that Abdulazeez did not travel outside of Jordan during his visit and there is no proof of him visiting Iraq or Syria. But a close friend of Abdulazeez said he changed after coming back.", "Our ruling", "Geller\u00a0claimed that an ISIS supporter tweeted ahead\u00a0of the Chattanooga shooting. The claim gained a lot of traction before it became clear that the tweet\u00a0happened a few hours after the shooting.", "Geller updated the original post, but it did little to stuff the rumor back into the bag.", "We rate the claim False.", "CNN, \"Fifth service member dies after Chattanooga shooting,\" July 18, 2015", "Media Matters for America, \"TIMELINE: How Fox Got It Wrong In Its Rush To Link The Chattanooga Shooting To An ISIS Tweet,\" July 17, 2015", "Twitter, Pamela Geller, July 16, 2015", "Twitter, Terek Fatah, July 16, 2015", "Twitter, Eric Clay, July 17, 2015", "Twitter, Breaking911, July 16, 2015", "Jihad Watch, \"ISIS tweets \"Chattanooga\" as gunman begins shooting there; 4 murdered,\" July 16, 2015", "Pamela Geller\u2019s Website, \"4 MARINES SHOT DEAD, 1 COP DOWN in Multiple Terror Attacks on US Military Bases in #Chattanooga, ISIS Tweeted Warning,\" July 16, 2015", "Pamela Geller\u2019s Website, \"FIRST PHOTOS: Chattanooga Jihad Murderer Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez: Five things you need to know,\" July 16, 2015", "Pamela Geller\u2019s Website, \"House Homeland Security Chairman says Chattanooga shooter WAS \u2018ISIS-INSPIRED,\u2019 warns of OTHER attacks,\" July 17, 2015", "ABC News, \"Chattanooga Shooting: FBI Recovers Gunman's Disturbing Diary,\" July 20, 2015", "CBS News, \"Chattanooga gunman's kin encouraged his trip to Jordan,\" July 20, 2015", "CNN, \"Chattanooga shooting: New details emerge about the gunman,\" July 20, 2015", "CNN, \"4 guns seized after Chattanooga shooting, official says,\" July 18, 2015", "Email interview with Pamela Geller, President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative and Stop Islamization of America, July 20, 2015", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
