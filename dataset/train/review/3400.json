["By Ilana Nathans", "Posted on September 10, 2020", "A Facebook post falsely claims that Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser \u201cproposed using her power to remove\u201d the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial in the wake of protests against racism. Bowser asked an advisory panel to review possible changes to D.C.-owned assets; she did not propose removing any federal monuments.", "Protests against racism and police violence in cities across the U.S. have ignited debates over whether monuments to Confederate generals and other historical figures should be relocated or taken down.", "In response to the protests, Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser formed a working group \u2014 the District of Columbia Facilities and Commemorative Expressions, or DCFACES \u2014 in July. The group was asked to review D.C.-owned facilities\u00a0and recommend whether they should be \u201cremoved, renamed or contextualized\u201d if their namesake has a \u201ckey disqualifying history,\u201d such as participation in slavery, systemic racism, or mistreatment of minority groups.", "After DCFACES released its report on Sept. 1, a viral Facebook post falsely claimed that Bowser proposed removing two of the nation\u2019s iconic landmarks. The post includes an image of the sites and reads: \u201cBREAKING: DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has just proposed using her power to REMOVE the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death to push for \u2018inclusion, equality, and justice.\u2019\u201d", "But Bowser never recommended removing the Washington Monument, and the Lincoln Memorial was not even mentioned in the report.", "President Donald Trump echoed the false claim at a campaign rally in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on Sept. 8. Referring to the protests and the movement to relocate or remove statues, Trump said, \u201cYou want to knock them down? That\u2019s fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. \u2026\u00a0But the DC committee, did you see about that? They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, we\u2019re talking the big stuff.\u201d", "An initial, 24-page version of the DCFACES report did include a list of federal statues and memorials. Its recommendation was, \u201cUsing the Mayor\u2019s position on the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission, recommend the Federal government remove, relocate, or contextualize\u201d a list of eight assets, including the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial. This was a recommendation of the working group and did not clarify which option \u2014 \u201cremove, relocate, or contextualize\u201d \u2014 it was suggesting for the Washington Monument or Jefferson Memorial. And, again, it did not mention the Lincoln Memorial.", "Following a\u00a0backlash to the suggestion that federal monuments could be affected, Bowser deleted the page of federal sites from the report on the day it was released, Sept. 1.", "At a Sept. 3 press conference, when asked for her reaction on the DCFACES report and why the recommendations on federal monuments were taken out, Bowser said her \u201cexpectation of the report was that it would not include any recommendations on federal buildings.\u201d When she saw the report, Bowser said, \u201cI could see immediately how its recommendations could be easily misconstrued.\u201d She removed the recommendations on federal assets, and asked the working group \u201cto stay focused on local D.C.\u201d", "The group\u2019s amended report recommends renaming 49 assets owned or managed by the district, including public schools, residential buildings and campuses, parks, fields and playgrounds, and government buildings.", "Although the D.C. mayor is a member of the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission \u2014 which advises federal agencies \u201con policy and procedures\u201d of \u201ccommemorative works in the District of Columbia\u201d \u2014 the commission does not have the jurisdiction to rename, relocate, or remove a national monument or memorial.
