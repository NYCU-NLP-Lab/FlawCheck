["About this rating", "We received multiple reader inquiries in December 2019 about news reports that claimed a man in Kampala, Uganda, had been hired by mosquito repellent companies because, according to him, they were interested in studying how his flatulence purportedly kills mosquitoes.", "On Dec. 10, the U.K. tabloid newspaper The Sun published an article with the headline \"Man Whose Deadly Farts 'Can Kill Mosquitoes Hired to Create Mosquito Repellent Made From His Intestinal Gas.'\" The article reported that:", "\"A man whose farts kill mosquitoes claims to have been signed up by insect repellent companies probing the secret of his killer gas. Joe Rwamirama, 48, from Kampala, Uganda says boffins have launched a study into the chemical properties of his unique trouser toxin. The odd job man says no one in his home village has ever contracted malaria because his powers knock out insects over a six mile radius. If true, that would make his fallout zone larger than that of the atomic bomb which destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.\"", "The Sun's article also included purported quotations from a \"local barber\" and a \"local chief\":", "\"Local barber James Yoweri said: 'He is known all over the city as the man who can kill mosquitoes with his farts. When Joe is around we all know that mosquitoes will vanish. He is respectful of people around him and will only fart when there are mosquitoes around which bring malaria. His farts gets rid of this disease.'", "\"A Local chief who knew Joe, when he was growing up as a child, said he took him in to live with him during the malaria season and claimed no one nearby caught the disease. The chief said: 'I heard about Joe's gift and I took him in to help mop out the mosquitoes infesting our surroundings. He respectfully drops these bloomers and it helped eradicate the insects. He does his thing and they drop - like flies.'\"", "Similar stories were published by other U.K. tabloids the Daily Mirror and Daily Star, and in several countries around the world, including Denmark, Germany, Croatia, Ecuador, and India. BBC Somali and the New Zealand Herald also published stories on \"Joe Rwamirama's\" legendary flatulence, as did the U.S.-based websites Barstool Sports and RedState.", "However, the entire episode was a hoax. The Rwamirama story first emerged on Dec. 9 on the website Ihlayanews. The site's header contains the disclaimer \"nuusparodie waarvan jy hou,\u201d which is \"news parody you like,\u201d in the Afrikaans language. We have previously examined several articles labeled as satire, which emerged from the same website. The Ihlayanews Facebook page carries the following disclaimer, clearly labeling Ihlayanews.com \"a news parody and satire website\":", "\"Posts on this page and ihlayanews.com website may contain traces of truth.

Many of the reports mentioned in this fact check, including the original Ihlayanews piece, used the same image, giving readers the clear impression that it showed Rwamirama:", "In reality, that photograph was taken by the photographer Olivia Acland in the Democratic Republic of Congo and published by Reuters news agency in July 2019. The photograph's original caption read: \"A health worker checks the temperature of a man as part of the ebola screening upon entering the General Hospital in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, July 15, 2019.\"", "While all of the news organizations and websites mentioned above were taken in by what turned out to be a hoax, The Sun engaged in the greatest measure of embellishment in their retelling of the false story.", "First, the tabloid greatly expanded the purported range of Rwamirama's flatulence, taking the (non-existent) \"six-meter radius\" from the original (fake) Ihlayanews article, and increasing it more than a thousandfold, to a \"six mile radius,\" which authors Nick Parker and Chris Maximim breathlessly compared to the impact range of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb.", "Second, despite the fact that the story was a hoax, the Sun managed to obtain additional comments on Rwamirama's purportedly powerful flatulence, attributing two separate direct quotations to a \"local barber\" identified as \"James Yoweri\" and an unnamed \"local chief.\" Either Parker and Maximim were taken in three times over by including what they thought were quotes from two additional authentic sources, or they made those sources up.", "After Newshub reported that the story was a hoax, the New Zealand Herald deleted their original article. However, as of Dec. 12, every other report cited in this fact check was still available online.", "Parker, Nick and Colin Maximin. \u00a0 \"Man Whose Deadly Farts 'Can Kill Mosquitoes Hired to Create Mosquito Repellent Made from His Intestinal Gas.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Sun. \u00a0 10 December 2019.", "Best, Shivali. \u00a0 \"Man Whose Farts 'Can Kill Mosquitoes Six Metres Away Hired to Create New Repellent.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Daily Mirror. \u00a0 11 December 2019.", "Micklethwaite, Jamie. \u00a0 \"Bloke Who Kills Mosquitoes Within 6-Mile Radius with His Farts Probed by Experts.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Daily Star. \u00a0 11 December 2019.", "Overgaard, Jakob A. \u00a0 \"Denne Mands D\u00f8delige Prutter Sl\u00e5r Myg Ihjel.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Dagens.dk. \u00a0 11 December 2019.", "Stern.de. \u00a0 \"Mann Soll Mit Seinen Flatulenzen M\u00fccken T\u00f6ten K\u00f6nnen und Sein Dorf Frei Von Malaria Halten.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 12 December 2019.", "Net.hr. \u00a0 \"Ovaj Lik Tvrdi da je Hodaju\u0107i Insekticid: 'Velikodu\u0161no Prdi i Poma\u017ee nam Rije\u0161iti se Komaraca.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 12 December 2019.", "El Comercio [Ecuador]. \u00a0 \"En Uganda Consideran H\u00e9roe a un Hombre Que Supuestamente Elimina Mosquitos con Sus Flatulencias.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 12 December 2019.", "TimesNowNews.com. \u00a0 \"Man's Deadly Farts 'Can Kill Mosquitoes 6 Miles Away, Hired to Make Insect Repellent.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 12 December 2019.", "BBC News Somali. \u00a0 \"Shirkado Heshiis la Galay nin Dhuusadiisa 'Ay Disho Kaneecada Iyo Cayayaanka Kale.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 12 December 2019.", "New Zealand Herald. \u00a0 \"Man's Farts So Deadly He Kills Mosquitoes in a 6m Radius.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 12 December 2019.", "IhlayaNews.com. \u00a0 \"Man Whose Farts Can Kill Mosquitoes Paid Millions by Mosquito Repellent Company.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 9 December 2019.", "Ashaolu, Oluwafemi. \u00a0 \"Repellent Manufacturing Companies Discover Man Whose Fart Can Kill Mosquitoes.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Newsbreak.ng. \u00a0 9 December 2019.", "Abul-Basit, Dagana. \u00a0 \"Man Whose Farts Can Kill Mosquitoes Paid Millions by Mosquito Repellent Company.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 TalkofNaija.com. \u00a0 9 December 2019.", "Satherly, Dan. \u00a0 \"Fake News About Ugandan Man's Mosquito-Killing Farts Fools World Media.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Newshub. \u00a0 12 December 2019", "Parker, Alex. \u00a0 \"A Man Whose Farts Kill Mosquitoes Claims Companies Are Working to Bottle His Gas as Insect Repellent.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 RedState. \u00a0 11 December 2019.", "Thornton, Jerry. \u00a0 \"This Hero's Mighty Farts May Win Mankind's War on Mosquitoes.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Barstool Sports. \u00a0 11 December 2019.", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
