["A Facebook post published on November 29, 2020 and shared more than 2,800 times claims: \u201cTHE SAME CNN THAT PROJECTED BIDEN A WINNER THE SAME CNN IS NOW SAYING THAT TRUMP WILL WIN! SO IF GOD SAYS IT WHO CAN COME AGAINST IT\u201d.", "The post was shared by \u201cGracee TV NetWork\u201d, a Facebook page that regularly publishes pro-Trump content.", "It is accompanied by a video in which we see someone shakily filming a screen on which CNN anchor Fareed Zakaria\u2019s CNN show, called GPS, is paused.", "An offscreen woman\u2019s voice says: \u201cThe same mouths that projected Biden to win -- the same mouths are going to correct their mistake right before our faces. Guys, this is going to happen. These guys are going to redo everything that they have said, all the false news they have given, they are going to revert that false news and give it back to Trump. Listen to what he says here.\u201d", "The show is then unpaused to play a short clip in which Zakaria lays out a scenario that would lead to a Trump win.", "The same video has been shared alongside similar claims here, here, and here.", "On November 7, 2020, CNN projected former US vice-president Joe Biden as the winner of the\u00a0presidential race after he secured 306 electoral votes. He needed 270 to win.", "Since then, and to date, CNN has referred to Biden as the president-elect.", "AFP Fact Check traced the original video to Zakaria\u2019s Facebook page, where it was uploaded on September 27, 2020 -- more than a month before the election.", "The clip shared on Facebook, which cuts out about two minutes of Zakaria's analysis, left out important context and was shared without specifying that it was more than two months old.", "At no point in the original, five-minute\u00a0video did Zakaria assert that Trump would win.", "Rather,\u00a0he said \u201cimagine the\u00a0scenario during election week\u201d, making it clear to viewers that he was painting a hypothetical situation.", "Zakaria\u2019s hypothetical scenario was this: In states that Biden won with close margins thanks to mail-in votes -- which then become the focus of lawsuits -- Republican-majority state legislatures could decide to choose Republican electors, which are individuals that cast the final electoral votes that decide the presidency.", "Democrats could oppose the move and in states with Democrat leaders, they might present their own electors. This confusion could then lead the nation\u2019s Congress to contest the electors\u2019 legitimacy and decide disputed states not be counted, leading to a situation where the US House of Representatives would vote on the president, with each state getting one vote.", "However, this scenario -- which law experts deemed far-fetched from the start -- has not come to pass. Following the election, Republican leaders in four critical states won by Biden quashed any doubts as to whether they would try to flip their states\u2019 electors. And with only days to go until the December 8, 2020 deadline for assigning electors, there has been no indication of this changing.", "Trump is still refusing to concede defeat in the election, but the transition process to a Biden administration has begun.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
