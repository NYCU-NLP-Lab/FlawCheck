Immediately after the order came down, some activists and observers on the right began to allege that the recount was being conducted in a fraudulent way by perceived liberal election officials intent on reversing the narrow leads held by the Republican candidates.", "These claims of electoral fraud were led by Governor Rick Scott himself as well as President Donald Trump, who claimed on Twitter, without citing any evidence, that an effort was under way to \"steal\" the Senate and gubernatorial elections.", "On 12 November, Trump appeared to call for the recounts to be halted and said Scott and DeSantis should be declared winners, due to what he claimed -- again without evidence -- was electoral fraud which had \"massively infected\" the counting of ballots:", "The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018", "In response to this tweet, some news reports claimed that Trump's call for the preliminary results to be finalized meant that the ballots mailed by U.S. military personnel stationed overseas would not be counted. The New York Daily News carried the headline \"Trump demand would eliminate active service members' votes in Florida midterms,\" adding:", "As the rest of the country observed Veterans Day, President Trump on Monday demanded that election officials stop counting votes in Florida\u2019s razor-thin midterms and instead \u201cgo with\u201d the Election Day results \u2014 a proposal that would effectively exclude active duty U.S. soldiers from having their voices heard.", "The New York Post, for their part, reported that:", "President Trump\u2019s demand that Florida election officials stop recounts and declare his favored candidates the winners could disenfranchise members of the US military serving overseas.", "The reason, according to both articles, was that Florida law requires all valid overseas ballots, including those cast by military service members, to be counted and provides a 10-day window after Election Day for this to take place. This is entirely accurate. Chapter 101.6952(5) of the Florida Statues states the following:", "A vote-by-mail ballot from an overseas voter in any presidential preference primary or general election which is postmarked or dated no later than the date of the election and is received by the supervisor of elections of the county in which the overseas voter is registered no later than 10 days after the date of the election shall be counted as long as the vote-by-mail ballot is otherwise proper.", "Since the date of the election in 2018 was 6 November, overseas mail-in ballots will be eligible to be counted after 16 November, provided they were postmarked no later than 6 November and otherwise valid. As confirmed on the web site of the Florida Division of Elections, those ballots had not yet been counted as of 12 November.", "In his tweet, President Trump wrote \"must go with Election Night\" and urged that \"The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis.\" At the time he wrote this (12 November), the 10-day extension overseas ballots had not yet been counted.", "Therefore, if Trump's proposal were carried out, the election of Scott and DeSantis would indeed by finalized based on the initial election results and without taking into account the legitimate votes of Floridians overseas, including military service members.", "The central claim contained in articles by the  New York Daily News and New York Post is therefore largely accurate, although their headlines do take some rhetorical license by emphasizing the hypothetical effect on military personnel, when votes by all Floridians overseas would be adversely affected.", "Furthermore, it's worth noting that it is not specifically President Trump's apparent call for the recount to be ended which would cause overseas and military votes to be excluded, but rather his call for the preliminary election results to be finalized four days before the deadline for overseas ballots.
