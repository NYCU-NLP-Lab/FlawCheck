Scott Walker, has pledged to seek $606.1 million increase in funding for special education programs, which would bring funding for such services to $900 million by 2021.", "\"School districts have a legal obligation to kids with disabilities, and they are required to provide those services,\" Evers said when he made the announcement. \"That, in turn, puts pressure on the rest of the school budget. It\u2019s time to change that momentum.\"", "States use different methods to allocate special education funds. Wisconsin is one of five that reimburse schools for the costs incurred for educating special-needs students. It is considered \"categorical aid\" -- that is, based on a category outside of the regular funding formula.", "According to a report from the state Department of Public Instruction: \"This categorical aid is the state\u2019s primary direct fund source to recognize the additional costs of educating pupils with disabilities. This critical aid program has widespread statewide impact providing funding for all pupils with disabilities, approximately 14 percent of Wisconsin pupils, providing equal benefit across all school districts.\"", "Evers\u2019 request would more than double the state reimbursement rate for school districts\u2019 special education costs, from 27 percent to 60 percent by 2019.", "\"We\u2019re going to add $600 million to special education categorical aid; it hasn\u2019t been raised in over a decade,\" Evers said at a primary election forum broadcast Aug. 16, 2018, by WRRD Resistance Radio \"Devil\u2019s Advocates.\"", "Is Evers right?", "The evidence", "When asked about special education funding, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Instruction directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, a nonpartisan entity considered the gold standard on state budget matters.", "According to the fiscal bureau, in the 2006-2007 budget, the number was just over $350 million. In every year since then, the total has been just under $369 million -- $368,939,100, to be exact.", "Abdur Chowdhury, Marquette University Department of Economics Professor Emeritus, said inflation in the U.S. from 2007-\u201918 averaged between 1 percent and 2 percent. Thus, he said, \"in later years, you need to provide more nominal aid in order to be equal to real aid in the early years.\"", "So, to keep up with inflation, the $368,939,100 in fiscal year 2007 aid would have to have amounted to this much in subsequent years:", "2008-\u201909 -- $381,741,700", "2009-\u201910 -- $388,003,320", "2010-\u201911-- $400,250,755", "2011-\u201912 -- $408,533,744", "2012-\u201913 -- $414,517,781", "2013-\u201914 -- $421,242,038", "2014-\u201915 -- $421,742,043", "2015-\u201916 -- $427,062,373", "2016-\u201917 -- $436,160,315", "At the same time, the report notes that while costs have increased, Wisconsin has experienced a decrease in special education enrollment since fiscal year 2007:", "2007-2008 -- 124,520", "2008-2009 -- 123,734", "2009-2010 -- 123,412", "2010-2011 -- 122,763", "2011-2012 -- 121,881", "2012-2013 -- 121,378", "2013-2014 -- 120,698", "2014-2015 -- 118,601", "2015-2016 -- 118,923", "2016 -2017 -- 118,209", "That represents an enrollment drop of 5.07 percent from 2007-\u201908 to 2016-\u201917. The enrollment counts for 2018-\u201919 are not final, but they are expected to again decrease.", "So, all this raises a question about what has happened with the per-student average -- and whether that has kept up with inflation.", "According to the Department of Public Instruction, special education costs per pupil in 2008-\u201909 was $10,388, with the state on average paying $2,981, or nearly 29 percent per pupil.", "In 2018, the estimated cost per pupil is at $12,084, with the state on average paying $3,140, or nearly 26 percent per pupil.", "So, had the per-pupil amount being paid by the state kept pace with inflation, it would be an estimated $3,489.18 in 2018, not the projected $3,140.", "A DPI spokesman pointed out that the per pupil figures are just special education costs, and \"those ride on top of regular education costs.\"", "The Walker team", "When asked about Evers\u2019 claim, Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to Walker education initiatives that feature targeted aid in the form of grants and other avenues for special education students:", "Altenburg did not say whether he was arguing these programs more than make up for the lack of increase in the main aid program. In any case, Evers was talking about the main categorical state aid for education, and that is what we are focusing on here.", "Our rating", "Evers said \"special education categorical aid\" from the state \"hasn\u2019t been raised in over a decade.\"", "The Walker administration has launched several initiatives that feature targeted aid in the form of grants for special education students, but the special education categorical aid continues to be set at nearly $369 million.", "Data shows a per-pupil increase in raw dollars paid by the state, from $2,981, or 28.6 percent, per pupil in 2008 to an estimated $3,140, or 25.98 percent, paid per pupil in 2018.
