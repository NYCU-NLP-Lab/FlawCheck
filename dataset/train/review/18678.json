["The misleading post, which has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook, for example here and here contains two photos: one of a relatively quiet street, the other of a street blocked by cars and scooters.", "Below is a screenshot of the post:", "The top photo\u2019s Indonesian-language caption says:\u00a0\u201cTanah Abang during the Ahok era\u201d.", "\u201cAhok\u201d is the nickname of Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who\u00a0served as governor of Jakarta from 2014 to 2017. A photo of him has been added on the left hand side of the street image.", "The bottom photo\u2019s Indonesian caption says: \u201cTanah Abang during the 'Peribumi' era\u201d.", "\"Peribumi\" is likely a misspelling of the Indonesian word \"pribumi\", which means indigenous or native Indonesian. It is a reference to\u00a0current Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan, who used it in his inauguration speech on October 16, 2017. A photo of Baswedan has been added on the right hand side of the street image.", "AFP conducted a reverse image search of\u00a0the photo purportedly showing\u00a0the area during Anies Baswedan's administration\u00a0and found was used in this article from Jakarta-based news outlet Media Indonesia published on May 16, 2017.", "Baswedan was\u00a0sworn in as Jakarta governor on October 17, 2017.", "Below is a screenshot of the article:", "The photo\u2019s translated caption reads: \u201cStreet vendors operate on side roads of Jati Baru street, Tanah Abang region, Jakarta, Thursday, May 11\u201d.", "AFP\u00a0conducted a reverse image search on the top photo purportedly showing the area during Purnama\u2019s administration\u00a0and traced the photograph back to this\u00a0August 13, 2013 image published on Merdeka.com which\u00a0shows the Tanah Abang business area.", "Purnama was\u00a0sworn in as Jakarta governor on November 19, 2014.", "At the time the image was taken,\u00a0the Jakarta governor was now-President Joko Widodo. Purnama was his\u00a0deputy governor.", "A translation of the Indonesian headline reads: \u201cAhok says the situation in Blok G -- where new kiosks sold unlawfully by applicants -- resembles that in Marunda\"", "Blok G refers to the Blok G building in Tanah Abang market, which was constructed to house street vendors outside the market.", "\"Marunda\" refers to a low-cost apartment provided by the Jakarta city administration in the north of the capital.", "AFP has circled the photo used in the misleading Facebook post.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
