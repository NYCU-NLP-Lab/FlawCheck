["Florida\u2019s CEO-turned-governor Rick Scott wants more control over the state\u2019s response to emergencies, like hurricanes.\n\nDuring his first State of the State address on March 8, 2011, Scott said he has asked the Division of Emergency Management to \"report directly to me.\"\n\n\"If a hurricane comes our way -- I hope it doesn\u2019t -- I will be personally and continuously engaged in solving problems,\" he said. \"Direct, clear lines of authority will expedite our efforts.\"\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Scott announced his intention to move the division within the Executive Office of the Governor. That news arrived simultaneously with his appointment of Wal-Mart emergency management director Bryan Koon to the agency\u2019s helm on Dec. 28, 2010, a week before Scott\u2019s inauguration.\n\n\"If approved,\" Scott said in a press release, \"this move will create a direct reporting structure and enhance communication and cooperation across all federal, state and local entities involved in Florida\u2019s disaster preparedness efforts and response. This transfer will help cut bureaucratic red tape during emergencies and ensure the director has full access and accountability to Florida\u2019s CEO.\"\n\nScott cited the proposal, which needs legislative approval, as an example of his mission to streamline the way state government operates. So we wanted to see just how many government hoops Scott's plan would eliminate.\n\nThe Division of Emergency Management was created in 1969 by the Florida Legislature to act as a liaison between federal and local bodies amid environmental and man-made disasters. The division currently is housed within the Department of Community Affairs -- an agency the governor already controls.\n\nThat, by itself, gives the governor broad leeway in handling personnel and policy decisions.\n\nAnd the division itself, it turns out, already reports to the governor.", "Gov. Lawton Chiles came up with the idea after Hurricane Andrew came ashore in 1992 but the direct\u00a0link between the governor's office and the division became permanent under Gov. Jeb Bush after the 2004 hurricanes when Bush sought legislation to put it into law.\u00a0Craig Fugate, now director of FEMA, was head of the division at the time.", "Sen. Mike Fasano, R-Port Richey,\u00a0 sponsored the bill in the Senate. Rep. Tom Anderson, R-Dunedin, was the House sponsor.\u00a0The law was effective July 1, 2006, and created\u00a0the Division of Emergency Management\u00a0as an independent agency with its own budget and a director appointed by the governor.\n\u00a0\nFugate said, in an interview\u00a0with the St. Petersburg Times' Lucy Morgan on March 9, that the change was made so it was easier to coordinate the state\u2019s emergency response in the face of a disaster.", "The division explained it this way as part of its 2009 annual report (the most recent report we could find online):\n\n\"Though the Division is administered through the Department of Community Affairs, Section 20.18 (2) (a) of the Florida Statutes states that the Division\u2019s executive leadership reports directly to the Governor on all matters concerning the agency\u2019s purview.\"\n\nWe checked the statutes. They establish the division as a unit of DCA, note that the division is a separate budget entity not within DCA\u2019s control, and require the governor to appoint the division director.\n\nScott\u2019s budget proposal would formally transfer the Division of Emergency Management (and a budget of $238,593,605 plus 128 positions) from DCA to the Governor\u2019s Office. That\u2019s about the extent of the formal changes we could find.", "Scott took time during his first State of the State speech to say that he wants to have the Division of Emergency Management \"report directly to me.\" By statute, it already does. All that seems to be changing is where the division is housed for budgeting purposes. He's really just redrawing lines on an org chart, and it's not\u00a0as groundbreaking a change as it sounds.\n\nWe rate this claim\u00a0Barely True.", "St. Petersburg Times, \"Scott hires Indiana's Edwin Buss to head Florida Department of Corrections; Walmart's Bryan Koon as Emergency Management chief,\" Dec. 28, 2010\n\nScott transition press release, Dec. 28, 2010\n\nFlorida Division of Emergency Management website, accessed March 8, 2011\n\nScott\u2019s 2011-2012 budget proposal, accessed March 8, 2011\n\nFlorida Division of Emergency Management, 2009 annual report, accessed March 8, 2011\n\nFlorida Statutes, Chapter 20.18(2)(a)", "Interview with Craig Fugate, March 9, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
