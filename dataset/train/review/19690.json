["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on May 27, 2020", "California will send every registered voter in the state a mail-in ballot for the November general election. But President Donald Trump falsely said, on Twitter and at the White House, that the ballots would go to \u201canyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there\u201d and \u201cpeople that aren\u2019t citizens.\u201d", "The president went on to make the unsupported claim that mail-in voting would be \u201csubstantially fraudulent.\u201d Experts have told us that voter fraud via mail-in ballots is rare, though more common than in-person voting fraud \u2014 another topic Trump has repeatedly been wrong about.", "Five states already conduct elections primarily by mail-in vote: Utah, Colorado, Hawaii, Washington and Oregon. All of them will send registered voters a mail-in ballot in advance of the election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures and the individual state election materials. In Utah, all but two counties automatically sent ballots to registered voters in the 2018 elections, and this year\u2019s June 30 primary will be conducted primarily by mail, due to the coronavirus pandemic, with no regular polling places available in all but one county.", "Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah told reporters on May 27, according to ABC News: \u201cIn my state, I\u2019ll bet 90% of us vote by mail. It works very very well and it\u2019s a very Republican state.\u201d", "Twitter dipped its toe in the fact-checking waters after Trump\u2019s May 26 tweets by adding a \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots\u201d link below the president\u2019s words. The link went to a list of news articles, tweets and other information on Trump\u2019s claims.", "A Twitter spokesperson told us the tweets \u201ccontain potentially misleading information about voting processes and have been labeled to provide additional context around mail-in ballots.\u201d The decision was \u201cin line with\u201d its new policy \u201cto limit the spread of potentially harmful and misleading content\u201d regarding COVID-19, the spokesperson said.", "The president, who later tweeted that he would \u201cregulate\u201d or \u201cclose \u2026 down\u201d social media companies that \u201csilence conservative voices,\u201d had expanded on his tweets in remarks to reporters on May 26. He falsely said Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom was sending ballots \u201cto anybody. People that aren\u2019t citizens, illegals. Anybody that walks in California is going to get a ballot. \u2026 Millions and millions of ballots to anybody in California that\u2019s walking or breathing, many of those people don\u2019t have the right to vote.\u201d", "Newsom\u2019s May 8 executive order pertained to registered voters. It said that due to the potential threat of COVID-19 in November \u201ceach county elections officials shall transmit vote-by-mail ballots for the November 3, 2020 General Election to all voters who are, as of the last day on which vote-by-mail ballots may be transmitted to voters in connection with that election, registered to vote in that election.\u201d", "Sam Mahood, press secretary for California\u2019s secretary of state, reiterated that in an email to FactCheck.org, saying: \u201cVote-by-mail ballots will only be sent to active registered voters ahead of the November 3, 2020 General Election.\u201d Mahood called Trump\u2019s tweets \u201ccompletely false\u201d and noted other states \u201chave used vote-by-mail extensively for years.\u201d", "Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in a May 8 press release the ballots would be mailed to registered voters living domestically 29 days before the Nov. 3 Election Day. (Military and overseas absentee voters get their ballots 45 days beforehand.) And in-person voting would also be available. \u201cWhile expanding vote-by-mail is critical, we remain committed to providing as many in-person voting opportunities, on and before Election Day, in a manner that is safe for both voters and election workers,\u201d Padilla said.", "Two days before Trump made his claims about California, the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the California Republican Party sued to block Newsom\u2019s executive order. In a press release, the RNC said ballots would be sent to \u201cinactive voters.\u201d But Mahood said that\u2019s not the case; the ballots would be sent to \u201cactive\u201d voters.", "He explained that a voter would be considered \u201cinactive\u201d if the \u201ccounty elections office receives an undeliverable/returned election mailing (such as a voter information guide or vote-by-mail ballot) indicating the voter no longer lives at that address.\u201d And if such a voter doesn\u2019t vote in two subsequent federal elections, \u201ctheir registration will be cancelled.\u201d", "California has encouraged voters to make sure their contact information is current. \u201cA voter can re-activate their registration if they vote, update their voter registration, or the county elections official can otherwise confirm their address before cancellation,\u201d Mahood said.", "Trump\u2019s claims continue a trend in criticizing some states \u2014 but not others \u2014 that have expanded mail-in voting during the coronavirus outbreak.", "Last week, Trump made the false claim on Twitter that Michigan was \u201cillegally\u201d sending \u201cabsentee ballots to 7.7 million people\u201d for this year\u2019s primary and general elections. The state said it will send absentee ballot applications to all registered voters. Trump later corrected his tweet on that point but still claimed it was against the law. However, Iowa,\u00a0Georgia,\u00a0Nebraska\u00a0and\u00a0West Virginia also have sent absentee applications.", "He further claimed Nevada was sending \u201cillegal vote by mail ballots.\u201d The Republican secretary of state in Nevada announced: \u201cAll active registered voters in Nevada will be mailed an absentee ballot for the primary election,\u201d and her office noted that a federal judge had ruled this was a lawful exercise of her authority.", "As we\u2019ve explained before, experts say mail-in voting fraud is rare. Yet Trump claimed, \u201cYou can\u2019t do the mail-in ballots because you\u2019re going to have tremendous fraud.\u201d", "Trump, May 26: People steal them out of mailboxes. People print them and then they sign them, and they give them in. The people don\u2019t even know where they\u2019re double counted. People take them where they force people to vote. They harvest. You know what harvesting is. They take many, many ballots and they put them all together, and then they just dump them, and nobody has any idea whether they\u2019re crooked or not.", "When Trump made similar exaggerated claims in April, Richard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, and author of \u201cThe Voting Wars,\u201d told us: \u201cElection fraud committed with absentee ballots is more prevalent than in person voting but it is still rare.\u201d", "In an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0published in the\u00a0Washington Post, Hasen pointed to News21, a national investigative reporting project that tracks cases of election fraud. It found that about 24% of reported prosecutions between 2000 and 2012 concerned absentee-ballot fraud, making it the most prevalent type of election fraud. \u201cBut the total number of cases was just 491 \u2014 during a period in which literally billions of votes were cast,\u201d Hasen wrote.", "He told us that states take actions to minimize the risk of fraud.", "\u201cThe most common method for verifying ballots is signature matching,\u201d Lorraine Minnite, a professor at Rutgers University and author of \u201cThe Myth of Voter Fraud,\u201d told us in April.", "That\u2019s what Mahood told us California would do to prevent fraudulent voting.", "\u201cCalifornia county elections officials check each and every vote-by-mail ballot that is cast,\u201d he said. \u201cA voter\u2019s signature on the vote-by-mail ballot return envelope is compared against the voter\u2019s registration record. If a signature is missing or does not match the registration record, elections officials will reach out to the voter. If the voter does not respond and provide a missing/corrected signature, the ballot will not count.\u201d", "California voters can also use a \u201cWhere\u2019s My Ballot?\u201d online tool to get updates on the status of their ballots.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can give you a reliable measure of the prevalence of voter fraud with mail-in ballots, but my sense is that it is not much more frequent than in-person voter fraud, which rarely occurs,\u201d Minnite said.", "In a well-known recent case, the results of the 2018 midterm election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District were overturned after a state investigation found a Republican political operative improperly collected and possibly altered or discarded ballots to sway the election. The operative was indicted on felony charges.", "Trump also claimed that Democrats wanted mail-in voting \u201cbecause, in theory, it\u2019s good for them.\u201d But a recent study disputes that.", "Stanford University\u2019s Democracy & Polarization Lab found that neither party would benefit from an entirely mail-in-voting system. \u201cWe find that universal vote-by-mail does not affect either party\u2019s share of turnout or either party\u2019s vote share,\u201d the study said.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
