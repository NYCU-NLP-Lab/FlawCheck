(AP)", "H.R. 1 includes sections on absentee voting, in-person voting, campaign finance and ethics.", "The ACLU told lawmakers in 2019 that it opposed the bill. The group said it supported provisions to expand voting rights, but opposed campaign finance provisions that it said would limit free speech.", "In 2021, the ACLU didn\u2019t use the word \u201coppose\u201d in their letter to lawmakers. But the group still has multiple criticisms of the bill. An attorney for the organization said it strongly supports many provisions.", "A major Democratic bill that aims to expand voting rights and overhaul campaign finance rules has resulted in some unusual allies.", "\"There\u2019s a reason even the ACLU opposes #HR1 \u2013 it threatens our freedom of speech,\" tweeted Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel.", "There\u2019s a reason even the ACLU opposes #HR1 \u2013 it threatens our freedom of speech.", "Known as the For the People Act, the 791-page H.R. 1 combines proposals for absentee voting, in-person voting, and campaign finance and ethics.", "The ACLU supports the bill\u2019s provisions to expand voting rights and while it has criticisms of the legislation, its senior counsel told PolitiFact that it has not formally opposed the 2021 version, saying \"a serious legislative effort to restore and strengthen our republic is needed now more than ever.\"\u00a0 But McDaniel is right in that the organization says certain campaign finance provisions would limit free speech \u2014 and the ACLU has formally opposed the bill in the past.", "With the House poised to vote on H.R. 1, we asked for evidence behind McDaniel\u2019s claim. A spokesperson for the RNC pointed to the ACLU\u2019s own writings \u2014 letters to lawmakers and statements issued in 2019 and 2021 detailing their criticisms of H.R. 1.", "The ACLU is officially nonpartisan, but its advocacy for immigrants, the LGBTQ community, women and prisoners is often aligned with policies supported by the left. At the same time, the ACLU\u2019s advocacy for free speech can sometimes put it on the same side as groups or individuals on the right.", "The ACLU has long opposed certain campaign finance proposals.", "In 2019, the ACLU told lawmakers it \"opposes H.R.1\" and asked lawmakers to amend the bill to \"avoid unconstitutionally burdening political speech.\" The ACLU said it supported goals in the bill to make it easier to vote, including restoring voting rights for felons, stopping the purge of inactive voters, increasing online voter registration and providing for no excuse absentee voting.", "That initial bill passed the House but never reached a vote in the Senate.", "When Democrats introduced a new version in January, the ACLU told lawmakers that it had \"significant constitutional concerns.\"", "\"We have not officially opposed the bill in the 117th Congress,\" Kathleen Ruane, senior legislative counsel for the ACLU, told PolitiFact. \"Following the Trump administration\u2019s relentless attacks on our democratic system of government, a serious legislative effort to restore and strengthen our republic is needed now more than ever, and we strongly support many of the voting rights provisions in H.R. 1.\"", "But the ACLU said requirements for organizations to disclose certain donors are \"onerous and dangerous.\"", "The ACLU\u2019s 2021 letter largely highlights its objections to the Shield Act and the Disclose Act, two Democratic bills rolled into H.R. 1.", "While the ACLU said it agrees with the Shield Act\u2019s goal to limit interference of foreign adversaries in elections, the act goes too far.", "The group objected to a provision that makes campaign finance law violations deportable offenses.

It demands that organizations that make campaign-related disbursements of more than $10,000 in an election reporting cycle disclose the names of donors who give $10,000 or more. The legislation makes it harder for \"dark money\" groups to avoid disclosures.", "Super PACs can raise and spend unlimited amounts, as long as they don't directly coordinate with candidates or party committees. Super PACs publicly disclose their receipts and expenditures, though they sometimes get big donations from nonprofits, which don't have to disclose their donors.", "The ACLU said it supports mandated reporting of spending for public communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate for office, but it said the Disclose Act goes beyond those bounds. The legislation \"could harm political advocacy and expose non-profit donors to harassment and threats of violence should their support for organizations be subject to forced disclosure,\" the ACLU wrote.", "In 2019, the ACLU also said it objected to at least sections of other legislation incorporated into H.R. 1, calling some of the language too vague or invasive of donor privacy.", "McDaniel\u2019s tweet maintains that H.R. 1 \"threatens our freedom of speech\" \u2014 and she posits that she is in agreement with the ACLU on this point.", "The liberal Brennan Center for Justice at NYU disagrees with the ACLU\u2019s conclusions that the bill will interfere with free speech, said Daniel Weiner, the center\u2019s deputy director of election reform. Weiner said the goal isn\u2019t to target everyday Americans making small donations, but rather big corporations and powerful interest groups.", "\"It\u2019s misleading to characterize transparency measures as a significant restriction on freedom of speech,\" he said. \"The notion that these (powerful) groups will be shrinking violets who might get criticized from spending and it might drive them from the public square is a bit much to take.\"", "In a letter to lawmakers in support of H.R. 1, a few former ACLU officials joined with several constitutional scholars in calling the legislation the \"most significant pro-democracy legislation since the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\"", "\"We do not view First Amendment concerns over the precise scope of disclosure requirements affecting large donors to tax-exempt organizations operating on the margins of electoral politics as outweighing the need for expeditious enactment of the clearly desirable aspects of H.R. 1 into law,\" they wrote.", "The Institute for Free Speech, a conservative group that advocates against campaign finance restrictions, sides with the ACLU in arguing that it would chill free speech.", "\"These advocates of restricting free speech want to have it both ways, by arguing that restricting speech is necessary or beneficial, but also that what they propose does not restrict speech,\" said Bradley A.
