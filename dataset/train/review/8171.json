["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on August 5, 2016", "Donald Trump said that a reporter was \u201ctrying to change his story\u201d after writing an article that Trump said supported the discredited claim that Trump watched \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of people in New Jersey celebrate the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. But it\u2019s Trump who has changed his story, not the reporter.", "Trump, the Republican nominee for president, made the claim at a campaign rally in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Aug. 3. He was defending himself against a claim made in a Hillary Clinton TV ad that he mocked Serge Kovaleski, a disabled reporter who suffers from arthrogryposis, which primarily restricts joint movement in the limbs.", "Trump, Aug. 3: We had a story where I was talking about people dancing in the streets or dancing on the rooftops. You remember? Now, in all fairness, throughout the world they were dancing. But I said in New Jersey, they were dancing \u2026 when the World Trade Center came down. Nice. Real nice. So, here\u2019s the story. \u2026 So, you know what the word grovel is, right? When you\u2019re groveling. In other words, you\u2019re trying to tell something, you\u2019re trying to make something up. You\u2019re groveling. \u2026 So, I had a reporter who wrote a good story for making my case because it was a long time ago. This was like 15, 16 years from the time we started this narrative. So, it was a long time ago and it was during the World Trade Center. Right after the World Trade Center, this reporter wrote a story talking about people dancing in the streets or on rooftops or something. It was pretty good, so we used it. And then the reporter, after I\u2019m sure he was given tremendous pressure, he worked for, I believe, the Washington Post and he worked for the New York Times and he worked for different things. \u2026 But the reporter all of a sudden, remembered it totally different from his story and he was groveling. I won\u2019t make the motions because if I do they\u2019ll say something, you know? \u2026 So he was groveling and trying to change his story. And going, \u201cYou know, well, maybe not.\u201d", "However, Kovaleski, an investigative journalist at the New York Times, has not changed his story.", "Trump\u2019s original statement was that he saw on TV \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of people cheering in New Jersey after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. He didn\u2019t simply say that there were \u201cpeople dancing\u201d in the streets or on rooftops.", "Trump, Nov. 21, 2015: Hey, I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering. So something\u2019s going on. We\u2019ve got to find out what it is.", "A day later, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Trump stuck to that story: \u201cIt did happen. I saw it. \u2026 It was on television. I saw it. \u2026 There were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations. They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down.\u201d", "But we and other fact-checkers found no evidence that thousands of people in New Jersey cheered the 9/11 attacks. What is true is that local and national news organizations tried to verify reports of celebrations in New Jersey cities and turned up little or nothing.", "Then, on Nov. 23, two days after he first made his statement about celebrations on 9/11, Trump claimed to have evidence that supported him. He tweeted a link to a\u00a0Sept. 18, 2001,\u00a0Washington Post story and demanded an apology.", "Via @washingtonpost 9/18/01. I want an apology! Many people have tweeted that I am right! https://t.co/CpsMxs54qv pic.twitter.com/wrDEhXJlvR", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 23, 2015", "In his tweet, Trump does quote the Post article accurately. But it doesn\u2019t support Trump\u2019s claim. The article, written by Kovaleski and Fredrick Kunkle, did mention \u201calleged\u201d celebrations, but those allegations were unattributed and unverified. And it said nothing about TV broadcasts of \u201cthousands and thousands of people\u201d celebrating, as Trump had claimed.", "Trump is also wrong about Kovaleski, who he said was \u201ctrying to change his story\u201d after Trump tweeted a link to Kovaleski\u2019s\u00a0article. The Washington Post Fact Checker talked to both reporters on the Post story cited by Trump, and neither could recall if the allegations about the tailgate-style celebration were ever substantiated.", "\u201cI certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating,\u201d Kovaleski, who now works for the New York Times, told the Fact Checker. \u201cThat was not the case, as best as I can remember,\u201d Kovaleski said.", "CNN quoted Kovaleski telling the cable news organization the same thing.", "CNN, Nov. 24, 2015: \u201cWe did a lot of shoe leather reporting in and around Jersey City and talked to a lot of residents and officials for the broader story. Much of that has, indeed, faded from memory,\u201d said Kovaleski, who\u2019s now an investigative reporter for The New York Times. \u201cBut I do not recall anyone saying there were thousands, or even hundreds, of people celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember.\u201d", "In fact, Fredrick Kunkle, the other author of the Post story, told the Fact Checker that he could never confirm the reports of celebrations.", "\u201cI specifically visited the Jersey City building and neighborhood where the celebrations were purported to have happened. But I could never verify that report,\u201d Kunkle said.", "The Post never reported that there were \u201cthousands\u201d of people in New Jersey \u201ccelebrating\u201d the attacks, as Trump stated. So Kovaleski isn\u2019t \u201ctrying to change his story\u201d by saying that he doesn\u2019t remember anyone saying that that happened at the time.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1a36c8e6-e918-4425-86dd-01cdecf896b6", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
