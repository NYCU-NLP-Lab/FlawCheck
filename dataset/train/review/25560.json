["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on October 4, 2019", "Memes and videos misrepresent a New York City law by suggesting that everyone in the city will be \u201cbanned\u201d from using the term \u201cillegal alien,\u201d or face a $250,000 fine. Actually, the city has only clarified that immigration status can\u2019t be used to discriminate against people in certain situations under a decades old law.", "Nothing has changed about how the use of the term \u201cillegal alien\u201d could trigger a fine in New York City when used to discriminate against someone in an employment, housing, or service situation. But social media has been buzzing with indignation about the phrase recently.", "Much of that buzz is based on a misunderstanding of the law.", "Discrimination based on national origin in housing, employment, and service situations has been against the law in New York City since 1965, according to the legislative history included in recently released guidance from the New York City Commission on Human Rights. It\u2019s been against the law to discriminate against someone based on immigration status since 1989, according to the same legislative history.", "The city\u2019s human rights\u2019 commission clarified the ways in which discrimination based on citizenship status and national origin violate the law in a 29-page document released in September. It did so after seeing an increase in complaints about that type of discrimination, commission spokeswoman Alicia McCauley told us in an interview.", "That document used the term \u201cillegal alien\u201d as an example of language that could be used to discriminate against someone. It said, \u201cThe use of the terms \u2018illegal alien\u2019 and \u2018illegals,\u2019 with the intent to demean, humiliate, or offend a person or persons in the workplace, amounts to unlawful discrimination under the NYCHRL. As with other forms of harassment, employers are strictly liable for an unlawful discriminatory practice where the harasser exercises managerial or supervisory responsibility.\u201d Similar examples are given for housing and service discrimination.", "The highest possible fine that the human rights commission can levy for a discrimination case is $250,000, but it has only done so once, in a workplace sexual harassment case that is still working its way through the courts.", "Those two things \u2014 the example of \u201cillegal alien\u201d used in the guidance and the highest possible fine \u2014 have been misconstrued online to mean that anyone who uses the term \u201cillegal alien\u201d in New York City will face a $250,000 fine.", "Similarly, the recent guidance from the human rights\u2019 commission uses the threat of calling U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, as an example of potential discrimination. In that example, it said, \u201cAn Indian immigrant family complains to their landlord about mold and cockroaches in their unit. The landlord tells them to \u2018just deal with it\u2019 and threatens to call ICE if they file a complaint in housing court.\u201d", "That part of the guidance has spawned a meme that says, \u201cDO NOT THREATEN TO CALL ICE $250,000 FINE JUST CALL ICE 1-866-DHS-2-ICE.\u201d", "But, again, threatening to call ICE can lead to a fine only if the threat is used to discriminate against someone in an employment, housing, or service situation.", "The commission also clarified another part of the human rights law that prohibits discriminatory harassment. That section of the law applies more broadly \u2014 it goes beyond the employment, housing, and service arenas \u2014 but also requires force, or a threat of force, with the discriminatory behavior in order to be enforced.", "This is one example of a situation that could result in action under the human rights law, according to the new guidance: \u201cAn immigrant shop owner asks a couple of customers to leave his store after they start breaking merchandise. The customers tell the owner he should \u2018go back to where he came from,\u2019 and exit the shop. The next morning, the owner discovers that the windows have been smashed and the walls spray-painted with anti-immigrant obscenities.\u201d", "Those cases are much less common than the employment, housing, and service discrimination cases. In fiscal year 2019, for example, there was one complaint of discriminatory harassment for citizenship/immigration status or national origin and 334 complaints of discrimination in employment, housing, or service.", "The bottom line is that, people in New York City are free to call another person an \u201cillegal alien,\u201d if they don\u2019t use force or use the term to discriminate against an employee, a tenant, or a patron.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
