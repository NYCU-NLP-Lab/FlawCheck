Arthur \u2014 served their entire term without a vice president, as the 25th amendment did not yet exist to delineate how a veep vacancy was to be filled during those terms.", "Because a vacancy in the vice presidency is filled by the president, the claim that Pelosi would, de facto, become vice president if Mike Pence were elevated to president is therefore \"False.\"", "United States Senate. \u00a0 \u201cPresidential Succession Act.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 18 October 2019.", "Legal Information Institute. \u00a0 \u201c25th Amendment.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 18 October 2019.", "National Constitution Center. \u00a0 \u201c25th Amendment.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 10 February 2019.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
