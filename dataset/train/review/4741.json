The image was loosed into the wild, leading many viewers to believe that the rendering was indeed the official logo of the 2016 Iowa State Fair. The claim wasn't perceived as completely implausible due to Iowa's popular image as a farming state, so the image of a silo bookended with two bales of hay seemed appropriate in theme.", "We didn't find the image in the Iowa State Fair's media library's image section, nor did we find any other evidence the event had adopted such a logo. Most official channels for the Iowa State Fair display an image of what appears to be a butter cow against the background of a blue sky:", "We contacted the Iowa State Fair's marketing department for verification, and they confirmed that they were aware of the circulating \"logo\" but that it did not originate with the Iowa State Fair organization and was not an official or authentic logo.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
