Scott Peters, D-San Diego, said the billions needed to build the wall should be used elsewhere.", "Peters went on to make an eye-opening claim about what money for the wall could fund instead:", "\"We\u2019ve checked in with The Navy; if we don\u2019t pass the 2017 budget, they\u2019re talking here about five ships that won\u2019t be available to sail just out of the Western region \u2014 and 15 worldwide...the money for the wall? That\u2019s, by the way, (the cost of) one and a half aircraft carriers,\" Peters was quoted as saying on April 24, 2017 in a Politico news article.", "We know cost estimates for the wall are high. But would the price really equate to \"one and a half aircraft carriers\"?", "We set sail on a fact check.", "Paying for a \"big, beautiful wall\"", "The U.S. border with Mexico is nearly 2,000 miles long. It already includes about 650 miles of fencing constructed under previous administrations. Trump has said the wall doesn\u2019t need to span the entire border, adding in a television interview that \"We don\u2019t need 2,000 (miles), we need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.\"", "During his campaign, Trump initially said he could build a wall for $4 billion and later estimated $6 billion to $7 billion. In April 2017, he put it at $10 billion or less.", "The Associated Press reported in March that the Trump Administration wants to build a 30-foot-high border wall that \"looks good from the north side and is difficult to climb or cut through,\" according to a pair of contract notices posted to a government website.", "A drone's view of the US-Mexico border fence as seen from Nogales, Mexico, Sunday, April 2, 2017.
