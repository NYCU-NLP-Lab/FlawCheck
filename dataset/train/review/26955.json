["About this rating", "Beginning in August 2020, social media users in multiple countries began sharing a video that purported to show a drone delivering a carton of Indomie brand instant noodles to a directed spot in a household, then collecting a debit card payment via a point-of-sale device before flying off:", "https://youtu.be/qbnTwk2HUFE\n\nThis video appeared to have originated with a tweet posted by Uche Anisiuba, accompanied by the explanation that \"I ran out of Indomie yesterday, needed to make a quick restock, never knew we had a drone delivery service in Lagos\":", "However, Anisiuba's Twitter account identified him as the co-founder of Quadron Studios, \"Nigeria's leading digital content company,\" something that suggested a digital creation rather than a real-life video.  Indeed, Anisiuba later tweeted that the clip employed \"3d visual effects,\" and he followed that up with a \"before and after\" video showing how the 3D effects were added:", "In a video interview with Artfrocentric, Anisiuba discussed and demonstrated the creation of the video:", "https://youtu.be/FSlAPEjyBwI\n\nAnd in a print interview with Techpoint Africa, Anisiuba answered some questions about the origins and spread of his video:", "Q: I imagine many would be wondering, how did you make the video look so realistic?", "A: So I  got into visual effects, which is what this is, in late 2018. Basically, the kind of high-end 3D they use in Marvel \u2014 those Avengers-type 3D.", "I also run a company called Quadron Studios. We did a project of similar standard between 2018 and 2019 called Skelebe. It\u2019s about a Lagos Rat from Warri that has an attitude and talks to people. It\u2019s like Ratatouille but in Lagos.", "That was when I developed the skills. Since then, I\u2019ve done a couple of VFX projects but this is my first personal project that I did and put out there.", "I\u2019ve been doing animation for a while but there seems to be a stigma for cartoonish animation in Nigeria. The idea of animation is for kids. But I realised that folks still watch Avengers, not knowing that it\u2019s animation.", "Lion King is a hundred per cent animation and many people don\u2019t know. And since it takes almost the same time to do both of the different kinds of animation, I thought, why not move to where the market seems to be.", "Q: Before you posted the video, how did you think people would react to it? Did you expect it to go viral?", "A: I never expected it to go viral. Due to COVID-19, things were a bit slow, so I wanted to push it to some of my guys who work in advertising agencies to see if it\u2018s something that their clients would want. That was the essential idea. But the thing took off.", "Q: What has the feedback been like?", "A: I put it on Facebook and Instagram and it was going little by little. But once I dropped it on Twitter, the spread was exponential. In fact, celebrities have even come on board. I have Banky W and a couple of other guys following me. Niyi Akinmolayan who directed The Wedding Party 2 shared it on Twitter and Instagram. And then there is another producer that did Sugar Rush who now follows me based off that video on Instagram. So it seems to be moving, at least, it\u2019s definitely not what I expected \u2014 which is a good thing.", "As good as that is, I didn\u2019t expect some people to start stealing it to promote their businesses without tagging me. I get that some of it might not be malicious but a lot of us do not understand the gravity of intellectual property and how serious it can get if someone has the time to follow up.", "Okike, Samuel. \u00a0 \"How a 3D Visual Effects Video of a Drone Delivering a Carton of Indomie Fooled the Internet.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Techpoint Africa. \u00a0 28 August 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
