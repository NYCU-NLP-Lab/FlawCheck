(DIRK SHADD | Times)", "Whose epidemic is it anyway? The leading candidates in St. Petersburg\u2019s mayoral race are trading blows over the city\u2019s issue with automobile theft ahead of the Aug. 29 primary.", "Former Mayor Rick Baker told a Tampa Bay Times reporter that auto theft is \"now at epidemic proportions\" under Mayor Rick Kriseman.", "Kriseman defended himself \u00a0on Twitter and Facebook with a graphic showing the problem appeared worse during Baker\u2019s time in office.", "According to Kriseman\u2019s post, there were 2,761 auto thefts in 2006 under Baker, compared with 1,095 auto thefts in 2016 under Kriseman.", "With our colleagues at the Tampa Bay Times investigating the juvenile car-theft problem, we wanted to look at the trend under both mayors.", "The numbers Kriseman reported from the St. Petersburg Police Department checked out for those years.", "Baker was mayor from April 2001 to January 2010. Kriseman\u2019s campaign plucked the worst year to make its counterpunch.", "The year 2006 was the highest point for auto thefts since 2000 \u2014 although most other years were higher than any point in Kriseman\u2019s three full years since taking office in 2014.", "Choosing to compare raw numbers from Baker's 2008 and Kriseman's 2015, though, could leave a different impression, with 1,461 and 1,523 thefts, respectively.", "What does the bigger story tell you?", "The rate of car thefts in St. Petersburg remains\u00a0far higher than the national and state average, shown below, regardless of who was mayor.", "\"The number of auto-thefts, the number of auto burglaries, it\u2019s something you need to watch and something that\u2019s important, but the impact of the activity is more important than anything else,\" Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said.", "And in recent years, the impact of automobile thefts, specifically juvenile auto thefts, has been a priority for the department.", "The Tampa Bay Times documented the automobile theft issue, finding that children in Pinellas County were arrested more for stealing cars than anywhere else in Florida.", "Gualtieri said 2015 was \"ground zero\" for the juvenile auto-theft problem and said that\u2019s when the department really started noticing the trend of young kids stealing cars. In early 2016, three teenage girls drove a stolen car into a cemetery pond and drowned. At the time, Gualtieri called the incident \"unacceptable.\"", "\"Solutions need to come deep from within the community,\" Gualtieri said at the time. \"Kids need to know there are consequences. This is a systematic and complex problem.\"", "Automobile thefts became a priority for police in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 leading to a year-over-year drop.", "Law enforcement officials consider juvenile auto thefts a countywide problem; a drop in St. Petersburg doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the problem is over.", "Detective Paul Etcheson, who\u2019s been with the police department for almost nine years and works in the property crime unit, described automobile theft in St. Petersburg as a \"revolving door.\"", "\"The reason the numbers have fallen in the previous months is because we have juveniles placed in programs, or on 21-day hold or something,\" he said. \"As soon as they get back, they\u2019re right back at it.\"", "As we said, 2006 was a high point for auto theft. We wanted to understand why.", "Police officer Mark Williams, who has been with the deparment for over a decade, said cars were simply\u00a0easier to steal in 2005 and 2006 like the Dodge Ram 1500.

For instance, key holes are only on the driver side rather than on all doors.", "In response to Kriseman\u2019s image, Baker said, \"I\u2019ve been to 50 neighborhood organizations in the last six months and if Rick Kriseman thinks he doesn\u2019t have an auto theft problem, he needs to get out more.\"", "Kriseman\u2019s campaign emphasized the mayor is still concerned about automobile thefts, and said the image was meant to undermine Baker\u2019s remark that automobile theft is at \"epidemic proportions.\"", "Our ruling", "Kriseman pushed back against Baker calling the auto-theft problem an \"epidemic\" with a graphic that\u00a0said there were 2,761 auto thefts in 2006 under Baker and 1,095 auto thefts in 2016.", "Those numbers are accurate, but more information is needed to understand the full story. Kriseman cherry-picked the year of Baker\u2019s two terms with the highest amount of theft and compared it with his lowest year.", "To his overall point, the automobile theft per capita in St. Petersburg has been significantly higher than the national and state rates, regardless of who was in office.", "We rate this claim Mostly True.", "Interview, Jacob Smith, Rick Kriseman\u2019s campaign manager, July 25-27 2017", "Email exchange, Brigitta Shouppe, campaign spokeswoman for Rick Baker, July 25", "Interview, St. Petersburg Police Chief Tony Holloway, July 25, 2017", "Interview, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, July 24, 2017", "Interview, Detective Paul Etcheson with the St. Petersburg Police Department, July 26, 2017", "Interview, Officer Mark Williams, July 27, 2017", "Interviews, St. Petersburg Police Department spokesperson Yolanda Fernandez, July 26, 2017", "FBI UCR Data, 2000-2014, property crime rates, crime reported by St. Petersburg Police Dept, Florida, accesses July 25, 2017", "FBI UCR Data, 2000-2014, property crime rates, estimated crime in United States -Total, accessed July 25, 2017", "FBI UCR Data, 2000-2014, property crime rates, estimated crime in Florida, accessed July 25, 2017", "St. Petersburg police department, motor vehicle theft, 2015-16", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Hot Wheels,\" April 2017", "Tampa Bay Times, \"5 ways officials are trying to stop Pinellas' teenage car thieves,\" July 21", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Three teenage girls dead after stolen car plunges into St. Petersburg pond,\" March 31, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
