["By Robert Farley", "Posted on September 21, 2020", "President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden have made competing claims about Biden\u2019s early statements on the coronavirus.", "Following the disclosure of comments he made to journalist Bob Woodward in March about downplaying the coronavirus, Trump has tried to turn the tables on Biden, claiming it was Biden who maintained through late February that the coronavirus was \u201cnot even going to be a problem.\u201d That\u2019s not accurate.", "The former vice president warned early about the potential danger posed by the virus, and about the need for a thoughtful response by the federal government. The \u201ccoronavirus is a serious public health challenge,\u201d Biden said at a Feb. 28 campaign rally in South Carolina.", "Conversely, Biden stretched the facts at a CNN town hall on Sept. 17, claiming that in January he wrote an op-ed \u201csaying, we\u2019ve got a pandemic. We\u2019ve got a real problem.\u201d The op-ed did not go that far.", "We reviewed all of Biden\u2019s public comments that we could find in early 2020 about the coronavirus.  While some of his comments about the potential danger of the virus have proved prescient, Biden was not as far ahead of the curve as he sometimes makes it seem when it came to calls for deterrents like social distancing and wearing masks.", "We start with one comment from Biden via Twitter from October 2019, before the coronavirus emerged.", "We are not prepared for a pandemic. Trump has rolled back progress President Obama and I made to strengthen global health security. We need leadership that builds public trust, focuses on real threats, and mobilizes the world to stop outbreaks before they reach our shores. https://t.co/1qqpgayUEX", "\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 25, 2019", "That was more than a month before the earliest known instances of the disease occurred in early December in Wuhan, China, and more than two months before Chinese officials  reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31.", "The first public statement that we found from Biden about the coronavirus came in an op-ed for USA Today on Jan. 27. In it, he warned about the \u201cpossibility of a pandemic,\u201d writing that while there were only five confirmed cases in the U.S. at that time, \u201cThere will likely be more.\u201d", "Biden argued that \u201cTrump\u2019s demonstrated failures of judgment and his repeated rejection of science make him the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health challenge.\u201d Biden touted the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Ebola outbreak, and he criticized Trump for proposing budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Agency for International Development (although Congress did not enact those proposed cuts).", "That puts Biden on record as sounding an early warning about the coronavirus. But Biden went too far with comments at the\u00a0CNN town hall when he said he warned in the op-ed, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a pandemic. We\u2019ve got a real problem.\u201d", "Biden was responding to recently revealed comments Trump made to Woodward on Feb. 7 acknowledging the coronavirus was \u201cdeadly stuff,\u201d adding that it might be five times more lethal than the flu.", "Trump \u201cknew the detail of it,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe knew it in clear term. Imagine had he at the State of the Union [on Feb. 4] stood up and said, when back in January, I wrote an article for USA Today saying, we\u2019ve got a pandemic. We\u2019ve got a real problem. Imagine if he had said something. How many more people would be alive?\u201d", "But as we\u2019ve written, Biden didn\u2019t say in the op-ed that the outbreak was already a pandemic. He said it was a \u201cpossibility.\u201d He said Trump was not prepared to lead the country through a \u201cglobal health challenge,\u201d which Biden did predict would \u201cget worse before it gets better.\u201d (The World Health Organization didn\u2019t declare COVID-19 a pandemic until\u00a0 March 11.) In fact, a month after that op-ed, Biden still said it wasn\u2019t yet a pandemic. \u201cFolks, we can beat this virus. We can keep it from being a pandemic,\u201d Biden said at a a campaign rally on Feb. 28. \u201cBut it takes a lot of work.\u201d", "Four days after Biden\u2019s op-ed, on Jan. 31, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency for the novel coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. The policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S. But there were exceptions for permanent residents and the immediate family members of both U.S. citizens and permanent residents.", "That same day, at a campaign event in Fort Madison, Iowa, Biden said, \u201cWe have right now a crisis with the coronavirus,\u201d and warned that Trump was not a leader up to the challenge.", "Biden, Jan. 31: America needs a president they can trust, especially at times of a crisis. You know, we have right now a crisis with the coronavirus, emanating from China. A national emergency, you know, worldwide alerts. The American people need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it. In moments like this, this is where the credibility of a president is most needed, as he explains what we should and should not do. This is no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria, xenophobia \u2013 hysterical xenophobia \u2013 and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.", "(Trump has repeatedly cited the \u201cxenophobia\u201d comment as evidence that Biden opposed his decision to impose travel restrictions on China. The Biden campaign on April 3 said Biden supported the travel restrictions, and that the xenophobia comment was unrelated to them.)", "The following day, Biden tweeted: \u201cWe are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus.\u201d And he warned Trump was \u201cthe worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.\u201d", "Biden made nearly identical comments that day at a rally in North Liberty, Iowa.", "Biden said Trump had a credibility problem with the American people, who are \u201cfinding it harder and harder to believe what he says about this virus. Look, president\u2019s words matter. They matter, no matter who the president is. And in times of fear and concern, people need to have confidence in the word of a president. And, you know, this president, he has a trust deficit that is compounded by his record of hysterical xenophobia and fear mongering.\u201d", "In both rallies, Biden accused Trump of proposing \u201cdraconian\u201d cuts to the NIH, CDC and U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 which, as we said, Congress ignored.", "In some 35 public appearances at campaign rallies, in television interviews or in Democratic debates over the next three weeks in February, Biden was not asked about and did not mention the coronavirus at all.", "The issue next came up during a Democratic debate on Feb. 25. With the virus reaching a turning point, as the CDC warned schools they should prepare and might have to close, Biden was asked what he would do. Biden again talked about the Obama administration\u2019s response to Ebola in the context of what he would do now: set up a White House office for pandemic response and increase funding for the CDC and NIH. And Biden said he would insist that China allow American scientists in to \u201cknow what\u2019s going on.\u201d", "At a press briefing the following day, Feb. 26, Trump made several comments that suggested the U.S. had the coronavirus well under control.", "\u201cSo we\u2019re at the low level,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs they get better, we take them off the list, so that we\u2019re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we\u2019ve had very good luck.\u201d", "Trump insisted that \u201cwe\u2019re going very substantially down, not up\u201d in the number of cases, that \u201cwhen you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done.\u201d", "In a CNN town hall that night, Biden said Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, did not appear to be on the same page.", "Biden called the virus \u201ca concern\u201d and said, \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we understand that you have to have a president in charge. \u2026 We need to invest immediately. We should have done it from the beginning, the moment the virus appeared. But we\u2019re getting late, but we\u2019ve got good scientists. And I just hope the president gets on the same page as the scientists.\u201d", "Earlier this month, a new book by Woodward revealed that on March 19, Trump told Woodward that he had understated the threat of coronavirus on purpose. \u201cI wanted to always play it down,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201d", "In recent interviews, Trump has tried to suggest that it was Biden who downplayed the coronavirus.", "In an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Sept. 9, Trump claimed that Biden \u201cwas going around for many, many weeks\u201d after the travel restrictions on China were announced on Jan. 31, \u201csaying, it\u2019s not even going to be a problem. \u2026 And they were all going around, no problem, no problem, everybody, practically everybody. Nobody had any idea it would be as violent as it turned out to be.\u201d Later, Trump said Biden \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was going to be a problem until months later. He was way late.\u201c", "At a White House briefing the following day, Trump again claimed that for months after he imposed the China travel restrictions, Biden \u201csaid there\u2019s no problem.\u201d", "At the ABC News town hall on Sept. 15, Trump again claimed that as late as March, Biden was calling the coronavirus \u201ctotally over exaggerated.\u201d", "As we said, that is belied by Biden\u2019s repeated warnings, starting with the op-ed on Jan. 27, that the coronavirus could develop into a pandemic, and would require a sustained and strong federal response.", "The Trump campaign said the president\u2019s comment refers to statements Biden made on Feb. 28 that it was not a time to panic. (Trump told Woodward that he played down the virus because he didn\u2019t want to create a panic.)", "The first was at a campaign rally in Sumter, South Carolina.", "Biden, Feb. 28: I want to talk a moment about the coronavirus. And I just want to say a few things to set the record straight. Barack and I, as president and vice president, we took on the virus that was threatening all of Africa and the rest of the world, and we set up a mechanism that worked. But I want to take a moment to say, it\u2019s not a time to panic about coronavirus, but coronavirus is a serious public health challenge.", "Biden did say it was not a time to panic, but he never downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus threat, as Trump suggests. To the contrary, he claimed moments later that that\u2019s what Trump was trying to do.", "\u201cTrump thought that his upbeat tweets could somehow stop the coronavirus,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell I have news for Donald Trump, like the rest of us, this virus is not impressed by his tweets. And here\u2019s the point, and I\u2019m being deadly earnest about this, we need real action in the White House, not more lies. It\u2019s no surprise that the president who thinks that climate change is a hoax also thinks that coronavirus is a conspiracy. We need a president who stands for the truth over fiction, and facts and science over fiction. Folks, we can beat this virus. We can keep it from being a pandemic. But it takes a lot of work.\u201d", "At a campaign event in Spartanburg, South Carolina, the same day, Biden again said \u201cthere should be no panic about this.\u201d But he didn\u2019t downplay the virus, or say that it was \u201cnot even going to be a problem\u201d or that it was \u201ctotally over exaggerated,\u201d as Trump claimed. (Starting at the 105:20 mark.)", "\u201cThere should be just the straight facts laid out for people and now that\u2019s not happening,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHopefully the pressure is building on the president to step aside. He knows nothing about much. He knows nothing about this issue. Let science dictate the outcome,what we do. That\u2019s what I\u2019d be doing.\u201d", "That\u2019s different from what Trump was saying at the time. As we recently learned, Trump admitted he was purposefully downplaying the virus.", "Interestingly, in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on March 24, five days after Trump made his comments to Woodward about downplaying the virus, Biden said this: \u201cThe American people have never, ever, ever, ever let their county down when given an opportunity to respond. And we just have to level with them. They\u2019re tough. They\u2019re smart. They can handle it. But give them the facts. The only thing that\u2019s going to make things worse, if we, in fact, don\u2019t give them the facts, and then things turn out to be bad. Then who do they believe? What is there to believe? They can handle whatever comes their way.\u201d", "While Biden may have been earlier than many in warning about the potential seriousness of a pandemic, he and his campaign have occasionally made comments that suggest he was further ahead of the curve than he was on things like social distancing and wearing masks.", "For example, in a TV interview in Florida on Sept. 15, when asked how he would handle a new surge in the coronavirus, Biden said, in part, \u201cI would be setting the example that I\u2019ve tried to set since this began, of being responsible, wearing a mask.\u201d (Starting at the 1:46 mark.)", "Another example is a radio interview in May when Biden talked about a Columbia University study that concluded tens of thousands of deaths would have been avoided if social distancing and other enforcement measures, such as stay-at-home orders, had been widely implemented in the U.S. a week or two earlier. \u201cThey pointed out that if he had listened to me and others and acted just one week earlier to deal with this virus, there\u2019d be 36,000 fewer people dead,\u201d Biden said.", "At the Sept. 17 CNN town hall, Biden again cited the Columbia study and claimed that \u201call the way back in March, I was calling for the need for us to have masks.\u201d", "As we wrote back in May, we couldn\u2019t find any examples of Biden calling for social distancing, or something resembling a nationwide lockdown, by early March.", "In fact, Biden was still holding campaign rallies with large groups of people at that point. On March 9, he spoke at a crowded campaign event in Detroit. (Trump\u2019s last public event around that period was a Fox News town hall on March 5.)", "On March 12, Biden released \u201cThe Biden Plan to Combat Coronavirus.\u201d It made no mention of public mask-wearing. It called for the CDC to provide clarity to the general public \u201cabout when to move toward social distancing measures, like cancelling school, mass gatherings, and travel and when to move to tele-work and distance learning models.\u201d", "In comments posted the same day to Medium, Biden said that while the coronavirus would require a national response, it would also require individuals to \u201ctake appropriate precautions \u2014 to protect ourselves, and critically, to protect others, especially those who are most at-risk from this disease.\u201d", "\u201cIt will mean making some radical changes to our personal behaviors: more frequent and more through handwashing and staying home from work if you are ill, but also altering some deeply-ingrained habits, like handshakes and hugs, and avoiding large public gatherings,\u201d Biden said.", "The same day, the Biden campaign issued a memo to staff instructing all campaign staffers to work from home, beginning March 14.", "On March 16, Trump issued the 15-day \u201cCoronavirus Guidelines for America,\u201d in which he urged, \u201call Americans, including the young and healthy, [to] work to engage in schooling from home when possible. Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Avoid discretionary travel. And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts.\u201d", "On ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sept. 13, host George Stephanopoulos noted that in Biden\u2019s op-ed in late January, \u201che didn\u2019t explicitly call for travel bans or social distancing or wearing mask.\u201d", "Biden campaign Senior Adviser Symone Sanders responded that Biden \u201cwas not being briefed by national security experts who warned him how deadly the virus was. In January and February, Joe Biden did not have the knowledge that President Trump did.\u201d", "\u201cBut I will tell you that if Joe Biden were president in January or February, he would have taken proper precautions he would have warned the American people,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe would have told folks to social distance. He would model good behavior and wearing a mask.\u201d", "We don\u2019t know what national security experts may have been privately telling the president about the coronavirus back in January or February. (It was revealed in April that Trump\u2019s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, wrote a memo in late January advising federal officials that the global outbreak could become a pandemic and that more than half a million Americans could die in multiple scenarios.)", "But in public statements, Fauci has said Trump did listen to health experts. On April 13, Fauci said that when he and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, approached Trump about directing strong mitigation, the president\u2019s response was, \u201cYes, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d", "In a Feb. 29 interview, Fauci said that \u201cright now at this moment\u201d the risk from the coronavirus was \u201clow\u201d and there was \u201cno need\u201d for people \u201cto change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis.\u201d But he added that \u201cthis could change,\u201d that people needed to be wary of \u201ccommunity spread,\u201d and that it could develop into a \u201cmajor outbreak.\u201d", "In February and March, health experts such as Fauci and U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams were still telling the general public not to wear face masks. As late as March 30, the World Health Organization was recommending that healthy people should not wear masks. There was a concern among those health officials at that time that there would not be enough masks available for health care workers.", "However, as health officials learned more about the virus, and how often it was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, the CDC reversed course on April 3 and began recommending that people wear masks in public.", "We couldn\u2019t find any instances of Biden \u201call the way back in March \u2026\u00a0calling for the need for us to have masks,\u201d as he claimed.", "The Biden campaign noted that in a press call on March 20, Biden said that when staffers met with him in person, \u201cWe\u2019re following CDC guidelines. People are coming in with masks on, wearing gloves.\u201d And in an interview on March 24, CNN\u2019s Tapper asked Biden how he was keeping himself safe, given that older people are more adversely affected by the coronavirus. Biden responded, in part, \u201cI\u2019m just following the instructions that \u2014 and anybody who walks into the house from the Secret Service on, they\u2019re wearing masks and gloves.\u201d", "But that\u2019s not the same as a call for the general public to wear masks.", "The Biden camp also points to Biden\u2019s repeated calls in late March for Trump to ramp up the Defense Production Act, and specifically mentioned masks as a critical need. But in those instances, Biden was calling for the need to increase the number of masks available to medical workers to treat those with COVID-19, not for mass public use.", "Fauci in late March said the coronavirus task force was discussing whether to advise all Americans to wear masks in public. In a press conference on March 30, Trump was asked about the possibility of such federal guidance, and he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be wearing masks forever, but it could be for a short period of time.\u201d And as we said, the CDC made that recommendation several days later, on April 3.", "Although Biden was stretching the facts when he said he has advocated public mask-wearing \u201csince this began,\u201d he has been a strong advocate since health officials like those at the CDC began recommending it \u2014 standing in contrast to Trump, who on the day the CDC issued its guidance, announced, \u201cI won\u2019t be doing it personally. It\u2019s a recommendation.\u201d", "Two days later, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on April 5, Biden had a very different response when asked if he\u2019d be wearing a mask in public.", "\u201cYes,\u201d Biden said. \u201cLook, I think it\u2019s important to follow the science, listen to the experts, do what they tell you. It\u2019s, you know, you may not look \u2014 he may not like how he looks in a mask, but the truth of the matter is that follow the science, that\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us.\u201d", "And, of course, the stance taken by the political rivals has sharply contrasted since.", "On April 29, Biden tweeted, \u201cWear a mask in public.\u201d And Biden wore a mask on May 25 in his first public appearance in two months. Since then, he has worn a mask in public appearances, and has not held in-person campaign rallies.", "By comparison, it wasn\u2019t until July 20 that Trump tweeted a photo of himself wearing a mask. But he has remained inconsistent in his advocacy for mask-wearing. In the ABC News town hall on Sept. 15, Trump noted that health experts working for the government initially \u201ctalked about don\u2019t wear masks, and now they say wear masks. Although some people say don\u2019t wear masks.\u201d", "Trump said that he wears a mask \u201cwhen I have to and when I\u2019m in hospitals and other locations.\u201d But he added, \u201cNow there is by the way, a lot of people don\u2019t want to wear masks. There are a lot of people think that masks are not good.\u201d Asked who, Trump gave the example of waiters.", "And, of course, Trump has held several rallies with no social distancing, and few attendees wearing masks \u2014 including two rallies that were held indoors.", "At an outdoor rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in early September, Trump asked a densely packed, mostly mask-less audience if they knew \u201ca man that likes a mask as much\u201d as Biden.", "\u201cIt gives him a feeling of security,\u201d the president said. \u201cIf I were a psychiatrist, right?
