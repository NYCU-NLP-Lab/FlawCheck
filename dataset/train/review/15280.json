Mitt Romney took a shot at President Barack Obama\u2019s trade policies.", "\"We have to open up markets for our goods,\" Romney said. \"We haven't done that under this president. European nations and China over the last three years have opened up 44 different trade relationships with various nations in the\u00a0world. This president has opened up none.\"", "We won\u2019t check the claim about European and Chinese trade deals here, but we will look at whether\u00a0Romney is correct about Obama\u2019s record on trade agreements.", "After lengthy negotiations, Obama signed trade\u00a0agreements with\u00a0three separate nations on Oct. 21, 2011 -- South Korea, Colombia, and Panama.", "These were not trivial deals. The one with South Korea, in particular, was \"the largest trade deal since 1994,\" when the U.S. approved the North American Free Trade Agreement, Bloomberg News reported at the time, citing administration data. The South Korea deal was poised to increase U.S. export access \"for everything from cars to farm goods,\" Bloomberg wrote.", "All three deals were initially forged under President George W. Bush, but Bush was unable to get the deals past a Democratic-controlled Congress.", "After the GOP took control of Congress in the 2010 midterm elections, Congressional Republicans pointed to the proposed deals as rare areas of possible cooperation between the two parties. But implementation negotiations\u00a0initially stalled amid administration insistence on securing protections for workers. During the 2008 campaign, Obama had promised\u00a0to \"use trade agreements to spread good labor and environmental standards around the world.\"", "Even though negotiations with lawmakers dragged on, the administration was ultimately able to secure a legislative formulation that could garner enough votes to pass. Doing so required some political risk for the president with his own base, since a sizable faction within his own party is skeptical of expanding free trade agreements.\u00a0(Public Citizen, a group that opposed all three agreements, produced\u00a0a detailed comparison of what\u00a0Obama promised and what the trade agreement with South Korea contains.)", "We asked\u00a0the Romney camp\u00a0for their view, and\u00a0a spokesman said that Romney was\u00a0referring to\u00a0new\u00a0deals initiated and completed\u00a0by this administration, rather than\u00a0deals\u00a0initiated\u00a0during the previous administration and closed by Obama. But we think that's\u00a0a misleading standard.\u00a0If that's what Romney\u00a0means, he's effectively\u00a0stripping Obama of any credit for enactment\u00a0of\u00a0the three trade agreements, when in fact\u00a0bringing them to fruition\u00a0required significant negotiating efforts\u00a0with lawmakers of\u00a0the opposite party (and led to an achievement\u00a0that eluded his predecessor, Bush).", "Our ruling", "It did take the better part of three years for Obama and Congress to enact the languishing South Korea, Colombia and Panama trade agreements. But ultimately he did reach an accord with lawmakers that enabled the agreements\u2019 relatively easy passage in both the House and the Senate, including strong support from Republicans as well as the votes of several dozen Democratic lawmakers.
