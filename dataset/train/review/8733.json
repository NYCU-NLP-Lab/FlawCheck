And boil ginger and drink it like water but it has to be hot... You will drink it for 3 days continuously.", "\u201cWays to boil ginger\n\tBoil according to your taste because this is pungent. But better if you boil a lot so the virus dies faster.\u201d", "The post says that drinking hot liquid works because \u201ccoronavirus is a virus that lives only in cold weather... It is unlikely they'll live in warm weather\u2026 Remember that all kinds OF coronavirus only live in cold weather.\u201d", "Similar claims have also been shared here, here and here on Facebook.", "These claims are misleading; health experts say there is no scientific evidence boiled ginger can definitively cure people of the viral infection, and advised those showing symptoms to seek immediate medical help, instead of testing home remedies.", "In response to the claim, Dr. Mark Kristoffer Pasayan, a fellow at the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, told AFP on February 12, 2020: \u201cFor all coronaviruses, there is no evidence pointing to the efficacy of this method to prevent and even cure viral infections.", "\u201cHaving low humidity and cold environments makes it easy for one pathogen to be transmitted from one person to another... but it is not connected with the intake of any hot food or item.\u201d", "Pasayan also said the claim was a \u201cfalse report\u201d, like many circulating online, including drinking boiled\u00a0garlic.
