The petition sought equitable access to road space for them, and it was moved after a ban on cycle rickshaws in Delhi by the then MCD in another case called Hemraj & Ors. It challenged some of the obsolete and arbitrary by-laws of the MCD including one that required the owner of the cycle rickshaw to also be its plier and an arbitrary ceiling of 99,000 on the number of cycle rickshaws in Delhi.

The latter came to be known as the Chandni Chowk/ Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Plan.", "Alt News: What was the reason behind the delay in the removal of encroachment in Chandni Chowk?", "Unninayar: The North DMC contested its responsibility of encroachment removal in April 2015 claiming that it had handed over these roads to the PWD or Delhi Govt. It took the Supreme Court\u2019s confirmation of what the Delhi High Court had already clarified in its order that S 298 of the DMC Act vests streets in the municipality\u2019s care and therefore requires it to remove encroachments. The order clarified that it would, of course, require the cooperation of the Delhi government authorities (meaning the Delhi police). The North DMC continued to evade implementing the order until yet another order was passed by the Delhi High Court in 2019 which too was challenged before the Supreme Court. In October 2020, the Delhi High Court took suo moto case related to the tardiness in the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corpn/ Chandni Chowk Redevelopment. Thus, the delay was the sheer reluctance of the DMC in doing its job. The entire case has witnessed inordinate delays as the government authorities do not see cycle rickshaws, NMVs and equitable access to road space and rights of the poor to share road space equitably as a priority. Even though it is very much a priority in the NUTP (National Urban Transport Policy), Master Plan for Delhi 2021 and the SDG (Street Design Guidelines) 2010, the officials on the ground treat such ideas as unimportant.", "Alt News: Why were the religious committee\u2019s alternatives rejected?", "Unninayar: GNCTD, through its religious committee, suddenly after four years attempted to retain the Hanuman Temple. The temple had been identified as an encroachment by GNCTD and North DMC.
