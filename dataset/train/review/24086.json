["The day before voting in favor of raising taxes on higher-income Americans as part of a deal averting the so-called \"fiscal cliff,\" one North Jersey congressman argued that the amount of dollars reaching federal coffers has reached a historic low.\n\nAs the nation braced for a series of automatic spending cuts and tax increases, Rep. Bill Pascell (D-9th Dist.) claimed in a Dec. 31 radio interview that, as a share of the economy, federal revenues are at their lowest level in up to a half century.\n\n\"How much money the government is collecting from people...in terms of the gross domestic product\" is \"the lowest in 40, 50 years,\" Pascrell said on WOR-AM.\n\nIt\u2019s actually been even longer than Pascrell claimed.\n\nAs a share of the gross domestic product, or GDP, federal revenues in recent years have been at their lowest level in roughly 60 years, according to data from U.S. Department of the Treasury and the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget.\n\nIn fiscal year 2012, which ended in September, federal revenues were 15.7 percent of GDP, slightly higher than the 15.4 percent in fiscal year 2011 and the 15.1 percent in both fiscal years 2009 and 2010.\n\nThe last time when federal revenues were lower than those amounts occurred in fiscal year 1950, when revenues were 14.4 percent of GDP. Between fiscal years 1951 and 2008, the ratio of federal revenues to GDP ranged from 16.1 percent to 20.6 percent.\n\nAlan Auerbach, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told us the lower ratio in recent years is due, in part, to the fact that incomes and thus tax collections dropped during the recession.\n\nAnother contributing factor is the tax cuts provided over the last decade, including the lower income tax rates first approved by President George W. Bush, according to Auerbach.\n\n\"Taxes as a share of GDP tend to be \u2018procyclical,\u2019 meaning that the tax/GDP ratio rises during expansions and falls during recessions,\" Auerbach said in an e-mail. \"That\u2019s due to the progressivity of the income tax (increases in income are taxed at higher rates) and the volatility of corporate profits.\"\n\n\"In addition to the Bush tax cuts, which also reduced revenues, we had measures adopted during the recession, notably the payroll tax cut that just expired,\" Auerbach added.\n\nIn response to our findings, Pascrell spokesman Thomas Pietrykoski said in an e-mail:\n\n\"What is clear as day is that the Bush Tax cuts took a hatchet to government revenue, significantly contributing to our current debt problems. Congressman Pascrell is supportive of a balanced approach in resolving the current fiscal situation that both cuts spending and asks the wealthiest among us to pay their fair share to reduce our deficit.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a radio interview, Pascrell said \"how much money the government is collecting from people...in terms of the gross domestic product\" is \"the lowest in 40, 50 years.\"\n\nThe congressman\u2019s point is solid, but his timing is slightly off.\n\nAs a share of the economy, federal revenues in recent years have been at their lowest level in roughly 60 years. Starting in fiscal year 2009, revenues have remained below 16 percent of GDP, the lowest point since they hit 14.4 percent in fiscal year 1950.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "WOR-AM, Interview with Congressman Bill Pascrell, Dec. 31, 2012\n\nPolitiFact Oregon, Are tax revenues the lowest they've been since World War II?, Oct. 5, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, Jim DeMint says federal government has more revenue coming in \"than we ever have\", June 28, 2011\n\nTax Policy Center, Historical Source of Revenue as Share of GDP, April 13, 2012\n\nWhite House Office of Management and Budget, Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-) as Percentages of GDP: 1930\u20132017, accessed Dec. 31, 2012\n\nWhite House Office of Management and Budget, Receipts by Source as Percentages of GDP: 1934\u20132017, accessed Dec. 31, 2012\n\nE-mail interview with Thomas Pietrykoski, spokesman for Congressman Bill Pascrell, Dec. 31, 2012 and Jan. 2, 2013\n\nE-mail interview with Alan Auerbach,an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Jan. 2, 2013\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Monthly Budget Review: Fiscal Year 2012, Nov. 7, 2012\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury, Joint Statement of Secretary Geithner and OMB Deputy Director for Management Jeffrey Zients on Budget Results for Fiscal Year 2012, Oct. 12, 2012\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury, Combined Statement of Receipts, Outlays, and Balances for Fiscal Year 2012, accessed Jan. 8, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
