Will Hartnett of Dallas put forward an amendment to the state\u2019s Occupations Code prohibiting third-trimester abortions \"when the abortion is not necessary to prevent the death of the woman.\"", "Hartnett\u2019s move--which won legislative approval and the backing of Republicans including Branch--amounted to a tightening of the existing state law, which barred third-trimester abortions unless the physician performing the abortion found the action \"necessary to prevent the death or a substantial risk of serious impairment to the physical or mental health of the woman; or the fetus has a severe and irreversible abnormality, identified by reliable diagnostic procedures.\" (That law was left in place, however, though the new restrictions superseded the old language due to a long-time legal provision stating that when laws are irreconciliable with one another, the law of more recent enactment prevails.)", "During House consideration of his proposal, Hartnett amended it to bar third-trimester abortions if \"the viable unborn child does not have a severe, irreversible brain impairment.\" Branch then proposed adding \"or vital organ\" after \"brain:\"", "Recapping: Hartnett\u2019s amended amendment would allow late abortions if a \"viable unborn child\" had irreversible brain damage.

Branch campaign spokesman Enrique Marquez told us via email that Branch \"was concerned that, by focusing arbitrarily on the brain, to the exclusion of the heart or lungs, the Legislature might give a court an excuse to question the rational basis of the law.\"", "Branch didn\u2019t explicitly mention potential court concerns in the House floor debate, according to the House\u2019s archived online video (debate on Branch\u2019s amendment starts at the 2:08:11 mark). But he repeatedly said it was rational to roll in irreversible vital organ damage if Hartnett\u2019s amendment already specified irreversible brain damage as an exception. Branch said, \"What this is merely attempting to do is to be intellectually honest with the fact that there are other vital organs besides the brain in a third-trimester fetus.

If we\u2019re going to make this exception for the brain, then we ought to include absolutely essential organs.\"", "Hartnett, moving to table Branch\u2019s proposal, told House members that \"vital organ\" was too broad: \"I just think ... we\u2019re getting into the posture of trying to water it down by drip, drip, erosion,\" he said. \"You can live without a kidney is my understanding, you can live without a lung, you can live without just about anything except your brain, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re drawing the line at the brain.\"", "The House tabled Branch\u2019s amendment before voting to adopt the Hartnett amendment and another that Hartnett offered requiring girls under age 18 to have a parent's permission before getting an abortion.", "In the end, both Hartnett measures were regarded as tightening abortion restrictions. News stories from May 17, 2005, described the amendments as abortion limits, including a Fort Worth Star-Telegram story that quoted Hartnett as saying, \"It's important for our (abortion laws) to be drawn tighter, rather than broader, to protect the children and to give these children an opportunity to be born.\"", "So Hartnett\u2019s measure tightened abortion limits; Branch\u2019s amendment would have added a second exception to one of them.", "Groups diverge", "Returning to the present day: In the Texas Right to Life email, Texas Eagle Forum leader Cathie Adams and state Rep.
