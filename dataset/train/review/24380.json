["About this rating", "On Oct. 30, 2019, a Facebook user claiming to be a registered nurse at the \"Royal Children\u2019s Hospital, Brisbane\" posted an offer in the anti-vaccine Facebook group \u201cStop Mandatory Vaccination\u201d to send chicken pox-infected lollipops (courtesy of her son\u2019s recent infection with the virus) to other parents looking to impart \u201cnatural immunity\u201d on their children. The post went viral when a screenshot was shared by a pro-vaccine Facebook page named Light for Riley:", "It is unclear, however, if this purported nurse was making a genuine offer, or if the offer itself was a hoax designed to inspire internet outrage. For one thing, there is no actual \u201cRoyal Children\u2019s Hospital\u201d in the town of Brisbane, Australia, as reported by Australia\u2019s news.com.au:", "The woman\u2019s Facebook description [claims] she works as a staff nurse at the \u201cRoyal Children\u2019s Hospital, Brisbane\u201d.

The only children\u2019s hospital in Brisbane now is called the Queensland Children\u2019s Hospital, which was opened in 2014.", "For another thing, Queensland Health, the entity that oversees all the hospitals in that Australian state, says nobody bearing the name of the alleged nurse works at any of their hospitals:", "Commenting directly on the viral Facebook post, a spokesperson from Children\u2019s Health Queensland confirmed she was not a nurse \u2014 nor has she ever been. \u201cThere are no current or former employees by that name that have worked for Queensland Health as a registered nurse,\u201d a spokesperson from Children\u2019s Health Queensland said. \u201cThis is a serious issue and has been referred to police, who are investigating.\u201d", "We reached out to the Queensland Police Department to ask if its investigation had turned up any new information, and we will update our post if any such information is provided.
