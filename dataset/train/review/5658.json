Even the original was an outdated news item, however, as the event it referred to took place in 2013.", "The photograph included with this article (shown above) also does not show Mustafa Carroll.

According to the Texas Tribune, Carroll (during a Texas Muslim Capitol Day event in a 2013) was explaining how \"following the law of the land\" was an element  of Sharia law:", "A video taken of Carroll's statements at Texas Muslim Capitol Day in 2013 does show him saying, \"If we're practicing Muslims, we are above the law of the land.\"", "The quotation, however, comes at the end of a longer passage that places it in full context, and indicates that Carroll's intent was to express the opposite of what [was] alleged. Carroll was stressing that no one wanted to make Sharia \"the law of the land.\"", "\"Following the law of the land is part of Sharia,\" Carroll said, according to the video. \"And we follow the law of the land. In fact, Muslims, if we're practicing Muslims, we are above the law of the land. The law doesn't affect us at all.\"", "Carroll told the newspaper that he was aware of how his message was misunderstood, and added that he did not intend to imply that Muslims should ignore the laws of the United States:", "Carroll said he could understand why his words may have been misconstrued. But \"it's definitely not intended to mean we don't have to follow the law,\" he said. By saying Muslims were \"above the law,\" he said, he meant that true, practicing Muslims should behave in a way that would put them above any possibility of breaking the law. \"If you're a practicing Muslim, then you should be above all of that,\" he said.", "Satija, Neena. \u00a0 \"Rep.
