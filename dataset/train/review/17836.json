Probably. But experts said the country probably wouldn\u2019t dedicate resources to spying on ordinary Americans.", "Efforts to minimize the spread of the coronavirus through social distancing have brought video conferencing platforms more business and, with that, more scrutiny.", "Zoom and other providers have experienced breakneck growth as people around the world get used to working from home and communicating with family and friends online.", "For Zoom, that growth has also revealed security vulnerabilities and a relationship with China that had at least one conservative pundit calling for a boycott.", "\"Stop using Zoom immediately,\" said Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in a tweet. \"Any tech company that aligns with China must be ex-communicated from our country.

The FBI and Defense Department declined to comment.", "In their report, Marczak and co-author John Scott-Railton examined the encryption scheme protecting meetings hosted on Zoom.", "They found that Zoom \"uses non-industry-standard cryptographic techniques with identifiable weaknesses\" to safeguard its conferences. The app\u2019s encryption keys \u2014 long, random strings of characters used to protect encoded data \u2014 were sometimes routed through servers in China, even when all meeting participants are outside of China.", "They wrote that this flaw is \"potentially concerning, given that Zoom may be legally obligated to disclose these keys to authorities in China,\" where they said the company employs roughly 700 people. The company\u2019s website says it has more than 2,000 employees worldwide.", "A spokesperson for Kirk cited these findings, news reports about them and China\u2019s history of surveillance and of spying on U.S. companies as evidence in support of Kirk\u2019s claim.", "\"It\u2019s well established that China is engaged in massive amounts of domestic surveillance and has established massive controls on any data that is routed to servers hosted in China \u2014 which is exactly what Zoom has done,\" the spokesperson said.", "The Citizen Lab report did conclude that Zoom is \"not suited for secrets.\" It said governments, businesses concerned about cybercrime and espionage, health care providers, and activists, lawyers and journalists working on sensitive topics should all be especially careful.", "But Kirk\u2019s tweet missed another conclusion that Zoom users may find reassuring.", "\"For those using Zoom to keep in touch with friends, hold social events, or organize courses or lectures that they might otherwise hold in a public or semi-public venue, our findings should not necessarily be concerning,\" Marczak and Scott-Railton wrote.", "The Citizen Lab\u2019s findings amplified concerns that have dogged Zoom as it has gained popularity.", "Online trolls have learned to invade meetings and project graphic material using Zoom's\u00a0screen-sharing feature, for example.

In a response to the Citizen Lab\u2019s report, CEO Eric Yuan said the routing of encryption keys through China was a \"misstep\" that resulted from Zoom\u2019s \"urgency to come to the aid of people around the world\" as the coronavirus spread.", "The routing problem has since been corrected, Yuan said, adding that it was never an issue for the separate version of Zoom available to government customers.", "The company has also clarified its encryption practices, and Yuan said in another blog post that Zoom has paused extra features for 90 days so its engineers can focus on security fixes.", "\"Zoom has robust cybersecurity protection and a number of layered safeguards and built-in protections to help prevent unwanted meeting access,\" a company spokesperson told us.", "James Andrew Lewis, director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said concerns about Zoom strike him as \"overstated.\"", "\"Zoom has development offices in China,\" he said. \"But its backroom functions are performed by an American cloud service provider using a very secure service located here in the U.S.\"", "More people working from home is a \"goldmine for intel agencies\" that China will likely exploit, he said, but other technology companies may also face similar threats.

If they are doing it, ordinary people are unlikely to be targets.\"", "Other cybersecurity experts agreed that China would not likely target the average American.", "\"I would suspect that if Chinese intel agencies are taking advantage of Zoom vulnerabilities, and I assume they are, they are targeting government users and business users,\" said Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations.", "In past Chinese hacks involving information on ordinary American citizens \u2014 including attacks on Marriott and Equifax \u2014 the hackers were after big data sets that could be used to spot patterns in people who might be willing to spy on China\u2019s behalf, Segal said.", "\"You might be able to pull those things out of Zoom calls, but it would take much more work and be less reliable,\" he said.", "It\u2019s also unlikely that China would be monitoring every U.S.-based Zoom call because of the money and manpower needed to do so, experts told us.", "\"In practice, the cost to do this should be high enough that China wouldn't want to use this as a mass surveillance tool, but rather a tool for targeted surveillance,\" Marczak said.", "Kirk said, \"The Chinese Communist Party is using Zoom as a way to spy on our citizens.\"", "The claim is based on a report from researchers at the University of Toronto.
