These will make you a greater and happier people than you are.\"", "And in Washington's private writings, there's not one specific reference to Jesus, said Henriques, whose book includes a chapter devoted to Washington's religious views.", "Washington was fond of religion in general, saying in his farewell address to the nation in 1796 that of all the habits that lead to political prosperity, \"Religion and Morality are indispensable supports.\"", "But he was also wary of religious sectarianism. He wrote of how religious disputes are \"the most inveterate and distressing,\" how he feared they would \"endanger the peace of society,\" and how he believed the Constitution established \"effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny.\"", "Henriques said Washington was reluctant to spell out his own religious views, partly because he was \"trying to be a unifying symbol for everyone.\"", "He believes Washington was best described as a \"rational theist,\" meaning he believed in God and elements of Christianity, \"but with a very strong dose of rationalism and reason.\"", "Other scholars label Washington and most of the other founding fathers \"deists,\" meaning adherents of the 18th century movement that believed in God but emphasized morality.", "\"They were sort of products of the 18th century Enlightenment,\" said John Ferling, a retired professor at the University of West Georgia whose book,  The Ascent of George Washington: The Hidden Political Genius of an American Icon  , is due to be published in May. \"They thought in terms of there being a Supreme Creator who created life and the universe but then didn't intrude in things from that point on.\"", "So Washington wasn't nearly the devout Christian that Limbaugh suggested he was and he did not refer to God in all his speeches as the talk show host claimed.
