(AP)", "An out-of-context clip of Joe Biden speaking in New Hampshire is deceptively edited in a way that suggests he made a racist comment.", "\"The culture, our culture, our culture is not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation, it is our English jurisprudential culture \u2014 our European culture,\" Biden said in the video, which was first published on Twitter on Jan. 1.", "When heard in isolation, the video makes it sound like Biden is making a racist statement promoting America\u2019s European roots and dismissing minorities. But when we listened to his full statement, that wasn\u2019t the point of the quote at all.", "The clip was posted by the Twitter user @mooncult and has been viewed more than 1.4 million times. The edited clip was one in a thread of similar videos posted by @mooncult, who has more than 12,000 followers and frequently posts anti-Biden content.", "The 17-second clip comes from a 13-minute answer Biden gave to a woman who asked about his work on domestic assault and sexual violence. (Her question at the\u00a0Dec. 30 campaign event starts around minute 39.)", "Biden\u2019s lengthy answer started with him explaining lessons from his father who told him that \"the cardinal sin is a man raising his hand to a woman or a child.\"", "Biden then pivoted to talk about the phrase \"rule of thumb,\" which he said stemmed from a court ruling in England in the late 1300s that no man could beat a woman with a rod bigger than the circumference of his thumb. (There\u2019s ample reason to doubt that the ruling is the origin of the phrase.)", "Biden recounted his work while in the U.S. Senate holding hearings about violence against women.", "As a U.S. senator from Delaware, Biden championed the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The measure increased funding and provided more legal tools for combating violent crimes against women.", "In his comments in New Hampshire, Biden said as vice president he also worked to try to persuade university presidents to take action to combat sexual violence.", "About 11 minutes into his answer, Biden then said:", "\"Folks this is about changing the culture, our culture, our culture. It\u2019s not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation. It\u2019s our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture that says it\u2019s alright.\"", "Listened to in context, it appears that Biden was saying that the roots of violence against women are rooted in European culture and that the United States must change the culture of violence against women.", "The edited video on Twitter omits Biden saying \"this is about changing\u2026\" and just cuts right to", "\"The culture, our culture, our culture is not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation, it is our English jurisprudential culture \u2014 our European culture.\"", "In March, Biden made a similar statement when speaking about his role in the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas and his treatment of Anita Hill. Speaking about a culture that allows violence against women, he said: \"It\u2019s an English jurisprudential culture, a white man\u2019s culture.

He was responding to a woman\u2019s question about what he\u2019s done to address domestic assault and sexual violence. In that response, Biden said, \"this is about changing the culture, our culture.\" The tweeted clip does not include that context.", "More importantly, the video clip watched in isolation makes it falsely appear that Biden was making a racist comment dismissing minorities.
