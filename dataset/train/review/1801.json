["About this rating", "On 27\u00a0January\u00a02016, Newslo published an article about the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, claiming that blogger Bristol Palin said\u00a0that Oscar nominations excluded people of color because all black people look alike:", "Abstinence advocate and culture war blogger Bristol Palin recently lashed out at black actors who have complained that the slate of nominees for this year\u2019s Oscars were all white. In a blog post on Tuesday, Palin said she agreed with Fox News contributor Stacey Dash\u2019s opinion that both Black History Month and the BET network should not exist as special privileges for the black community.", "\u201cStacey Dash couldn\u2019t be more right,\u201d Palin commented on her post. \u201cWhat more do black people want? They complained about slavery \u2013 we abolished it. They complained about oppression in the 60\u2019s \u2013 we made sure there was no more of it. Then they started bitching about how America has never had a black president \u2013 we gave them Obama. Now they\u2019re trying to make it look like we\u2019re intentionally depriving them of money and fame. I mean, come on, people! You\u2019ve got drug dealers, you\u2019ve got rap and hip-hop singers, you\u2019ve got just as much money as white people, and not to mention, your numbers are growing. It seems to me like we ought to be complaining about you, not the other way around!\u00a0...\u00a0even if there were black actors who are good enough\u201d to be nominated for an Academy Award, \u201cit\u2019d be too difficult to choose one, since they all look alike.\u201d \u201cHow do you tell apart Lawrence Fishburne from Samuel L. Jackson? You don\u2019t! At least I can\u2019t. I mean, if I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think Sam Jackson played Morpheus in the Matrix Trilogy. So, don\u2019t be talking about the Oscars when you clearly don\u2019t deserve one.\u201d", "The material in the first paragraph referenced an actual post on Bristol Palin's Patheos blog\u00a0(titled \"Rappers Agree with Stacey Dash\").

I don\u2019t know how other people think about it, but I hope my son sees early on \u2013 that not everyone gets a trophy.", "The fact that the first part was real led\u00a0readers to believe that the subsequent content was also legitimate.
