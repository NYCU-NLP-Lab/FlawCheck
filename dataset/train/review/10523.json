["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on August 13, 2019 | Updated on August 19, 2019", "A\u00a0Facebook post from a user who appears to subscribe to QAnon conspiracies claims that Jeffrey Epstein is not dead. The theory is based solely on a news photo that shows an unresponsive Epstein being wheeled into a hospital on a gurney.", "The Federal Bureau of Prisons, in an\u00a0statement, said that \u201cinmate Jeffrey Edward Epstein\u201d was found unresponsive in his cell at approximately 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10 from \u201can apparent suicide.\u201d The staff at\u00a0the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York administered life-saving measures until the emergency medical services team could arrive and transport him to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead, the statement said.", "A\u00a0New York Post\u00a0photo of the former wealthy financier\u00a0being wheeled into New York Downtown Hospital shows the unresponsive Epstein.", "That photo is now being circulated by conspiracy theorists as evidence that Epstein is actually alive.", "\u201cNot a chance he is dead,\u201d reads a Facebook post by Erik Pearson, whose page features images of QAnon \u2014 a reference to anti-government conspiracy theorists who support President Donald Trump. \u201cSince when are DEAD bodies just wheeled out without being covered or in a body bag? And look at how pink he looks. That is not the face of a dead man.\u201d", "The Epstein-is-alive conspiracy is being spread by others on Facebook, generating thousands of shares.", "But the photo proves nothing.", "It\u2019s true that\u00a0pallor mortis, which refers to the paleness of the skin upon death, happens \u201coccurs within the first few hours after\u00a0death,\u201d according to a study published in the International Journal of Legal Medicine. But we don\u2019t know the estimated time of death. New York City Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson did not address that in a preliminary statement her office released on Aug. 11 after the autopsy was performed.", "\u201cToday, a medical examiner performed the autopsy of Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d Sampson said in the statement, which her office provided to us. \u201cThe ME\u2019s determination is pending further information at this time. At the request of those representing the decedent, and with the awareness of the federal prosecutor, I allowed a private pathologist (Dr. Michael Baden) to observe the autopsy examination. This is routine practice.\u201d", "We don\u2019t even know if he was still alive when prison staff discovered him in his cell or when photographer William Farrington snapped the photo at the hospital for the Post. As mentioned earlier, the BOP statement said prison staffers and EMT personnel administered life-saving efforts, and that Epstein was pronounced dead at the hospital. CBS News reported that prison guards were quick to act after they heard shrieking from Epstein\u2019s cell, although that has not been confirmed by prison officials.", "There are many questions about Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide \u2014 notably why he was taken off suicide watch just days after apparently attempting suicide. Attorney General William Barr said in an Aug. 10 statement that he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the death.", "\u201cMr. Epstein\u2019s death raises serious questions that must be answered,\u201d Barr said, a point he reiterated in an unrelated speech he made on Aug. 12.", "\u201cWe are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation,\u201d\u00a0Barr\u00a0said,\u00a0adding that the\u00a0FBI and the department\u2019s inspector general will investigate.", "But there is no question that Epstein is dead. The statements issued by Barr, the city\u2019s chief medical examiner, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman for the Southern District of New York, whose office had brought charges against Epstein, all said Epstein was dead. The autopsy has already been performed.", "Both Barr and Berman emphasized that federal prosecutors will continue to pursue the case.", "\u201cTo those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment \u2014 which included a conspiracy count \u2014 remains ongoing,\u201d Berman said in a statement.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "Update, Aug. 19: The New York City Chief Medical Examiner\u2019s Office on Aug. 16 publicly reported that, after a \u201ccareful review of all investigative information, including complete autopsy findings,\u201d the determined cause of death for Epstein was \u201changing\u201d and the manner of death was \u201csuicide.\u201d", "Press release. \u201cInmate Death at the MCC New York.\u201d\u00a0Federal Bureau of Prisons. 10 Aug 2019.", "Celona, Larry et al. \u201cPhotos show Jeffrey Epstein as he\u2019s wheeled into Downtown Hospital.\u201d New York Post. 10 Aug 2019.", "Sch\u00e4fer, Achim Th. \u201cColour measurements of pallor mortis.\u201d International Journal of Legal Medicine. 2000 Feb.", "Noor, Saliha, New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner.\u00a0Email sent to FactCheck.org. 12 Aug 2019.", "\u201cShrieking heard from Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s jail cell the morning he died.\u201d CBS News. 13 Aug 2019.", "Mallin, Alexander et al. \u201cAgents descend on Epstein\u2019s island home looking for evidence of inner circle: Sources.\u201d ABC News. 12 Aug 2019.", "Hartmann, Margaret. \u201cJeffrey Epstein Found Injured in Jail Cell After Possible Suicide Attempt.\u201d New York Magazine. 23 July 2019.", "U.S. Department of Justice. \u201cStatement from Attorney General William P.
