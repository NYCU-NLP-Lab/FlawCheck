One of the suspects is 16 years old and was listed on a court docket as Maya Elizabeth McKinney. But a lawyer for the suspect referred to McKinney as \"Alec McKinney,\" and the judge addressed the suspect as \"Mr. McKinney,\" Reuters reported on May 7.", "\"Denver\u2019s ABC television affiliate, citing an unidentified police source, has reported that the younger suspect identified as transgender and had been bullied for it,\" the wire service said in its dispatch the day after the shooting.", "Some stories, such as this one from the Washington Post, don\u2019t mention that McKinney is transgender.

They\u2019re both struggling with mental health issues and this is a time for awareness.\"", "About McKinney, the friend said: \"Had people supported him in the way that he needed and deserved, he would not have struggled so much that he got pushed over the edge.\"", "The Denver7 TV station reported on May 8 that Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said the incident was \"too new\" to establish a motive, though unnamed sources are cited as saying \"the motive went beyond bullying and involved revenge and anger towards others at the school.\"", "Our ruling", "A Facebook post claimed that a Colorado school shooter is a \"transsexual, Trump-hating, Christian-hating, leftist freak\" and that the media hasn\u2019t reported on those facts.
