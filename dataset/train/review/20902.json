["\u201cIf you have not been to kisii town this is what you are missing,\u201d reads a Facebook post shared more than 1,000 times since September 5, 2020.", "Kisii is a town located in south-western Kenya.", "The video is 38 seconds long and shows a busy street scene from overhead, with dozens of motorcycles and cars appearing to drive chaotically across a large intersection.", "Using the video verification tool InVID WeVerify, AFP Fact Check ran a reverse image search on multiple frames of the video and located the clip in YouTube videos here, here and here, which are described\u00a0 as showing traffic in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh city. These videos show traffic moving at a normal speed, as opposed to the sped-up\u00a0Facebook clip.", "A search with the keywords \u201cmotorcycle traffic in Vietnam\u201d on Google turned up a similar video which is much clearer and also filmed from the same elevated angle.\u00a0Visual cues like a petrol station, buildings and an electrical post are evident in both versions of the video.", "One of the standout features in both videos is a petrol station in the top right with blue and yellow corporate colours. A search of petrol stations in Vietnam revealed that Petrolimex, Vietnam\u2019s liquefied petroleum gas state company, has the exact features.", "On Google Maps, we examined the different locations of Petrolimex in Vietnam and spotted this one which resembles the petrol station in the videos and is found on Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o street.", "Meanwhile, another video shows the same junction where Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o street crosses Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n C\u1eeb street. Evident is a branch of Sacombank, a bank in Vietnam with blue and white branding and below it a restaurant called Jollibee. Both are situated opposite the petrol station and can be seen on Google Maps.", "Google Street View also reveals that the junction is controlled by traffic lights, meaning the traffic flow is controlled, contrary to the disorderly scene\u00a0the video on Facebook appears to show because it has been manipulated to increase the speed. This video also shows the same.", "In contrast,\u00a0we surveyed different junctions in Kisii town using Google Maps street views and there is no resemblance to the junction seen in the videos.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
