Marcia Ann Bosley, who was the head housekeeper at the Governor\u2019s Mansion before she was mysteriously let go in 1985, has been positively identified after spending more than 3 decades in the ground.", "Bosley, who had no family when she was let go, was assumed to have left the area for other opportunities. She was never reported missing. According to the Hamilton County Coroner:", "\u201cThe body was wrapped so well in plastic thast much of the tissue is still intact. We were able to extract 2 DNA samples. We\u2019ve determined that one was an unborn child. That could be huge in determining who else was a part of this young woman\u2019s life.\u201d", "None of this was true; it was just another riff on the decades-old \"Clinton Body Count\" political urban legend.
