["About this rating", "On 10 April 2018, the Facebook page \"Chiverhood of the Traveling Pants\" posted a video which purportedly showed a Vermont State Trooper pulling over a school bus only to be \"savagely attacked\" by \"hooligans.\" The same video was posted years earlier to YouTube along with the claim that it showed a \"cop pulling over a school bus\":", "Although this video was almost certainly posted in jest, some viewers were unaware of its origins. It actually shows a scene from the closing credits of the 2001 movie Super Troopers. It's revealed early in the movie that the character of Farva was suspended for an incident on a school bus with unruly children. The incident is not addressed in great detail during the film, but this \"dashcam footage\" was shown during the closing credits to give viewers a glimpse at the infamous incident.", "The \"Crazy Credits\" section for the movie's listing on IMBD explains:", "The credits are accompanied by: 1) various identifying shots of the actors; 2) scenes involving the stoners and a busted party; and 3) Farva's oft-joked-about \"bus incident\". Finally, all the way at the end of the credits, there is a little \"gag\" reel clip, concerning Farva's excessive drinking at the governor's party.", "Fans of Super Troopers may have been easily able to tell that this was a joke, but not everyone on the internet is as well versed in pop culture references. After all, this is not the first time that an out-of-context movie clips have been mistaken for a slice of reality. An image from the Ben Stiller movie Tropic Thunder, for instance, was shared as if it were a genuine photograph of Vietnam soldiers, and this clip of a man in a department store being crushed by an inflatable raft is actually from the movie Grown Ups 2.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
