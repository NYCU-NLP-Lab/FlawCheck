["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on June 20, 2019", "A bogus story fueling theories that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will be arrested has been shared over 100,000 times on Facebook, but it started out as satire.", "A completely fabricated story promoting the unfounded claim that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are soon to be arrested has been shared over 100,000 times on Facebook and other social media sites, according to data from CrowdTangle.", "The story was first posted on May 21 on a website called TatersGonnaTate.com with the headline: \u201cPanel of 16 Judges Agrees: Barr Has Enough to Indict Clinton and Obama.\u201d That site is part of a network called America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which we\u2019ve written about before. The ALLOD network says that its work is satire meant to provoke conservatives.", "It says on TatersGonnaTate.com\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d page: \u201c\u2018Taters\u2019 are the conservative fans of America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. They are fragile, frightened, mostly older caucasian Americans. They believe nearly anything. While we go out of our way to educate them that not everything they agree with is true, they are still old, typically ignorant, and again \u2014 very afraid of everything. Our mission is to do our best to show them the light\u2026\u201d", "But the story has been copied and posted on websites that have no such disclaimer and present the claim as though it\u2019s true.", "The link to the original story has also been shared as though it\u2019s true by some popular conservative Facebook pages, including one that belongs to the Texas agriculture commissioner, Sid Miller. His page posted a link to the story on June 15 with this exclamation: \u201cThen let\u2019s get after it!\u201d His post was shared 31,000 times. He did not return a call seeking comment.", "The story, though, is completely made up. Beyond the disclaimers from the original website, there are some red flags in the piece that suggest it\u2019s false. For example, the story never says what specific court it\u2019s referencing, and the picture it uses shows the New York State Court of Appeals, which has seven judges, not 16.", "It also quotes \u201cArt Tubolls,\u201d a fictitious character who often shows up in ALLOD stories. In this one, he is supposed to be the \u201cDirector of Information and Propaganda\u201d for the Trump administration (clearly a spoof title), but he also has been used as Michael Jordan\u2019s spokesman and the CEO of Comedy Central.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
