The photo was among several featured in a news story\u00a0about the incident in the Hamilton Spectator.", "The same erroneous claim about Kavanaugh\u2019s home \u2014 and the photo \u2014 was the focus of a\u00a0story\u00a0published Sept. 30 on a website belonging to a supposedly satirical publisher, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. That story also appeared on a website called\u00a0ABCNews.live \u2014 whose version, lacking any \u201csatire\u201d label,\u00a0accrued nearly\u00a013,000 engagements on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data.", "The story claimed the Kavanaughs\u2019 home was in Mayo Lake, Pennsylvania, though there is no such town in the state.", "Kavanaugh, who has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct that have challenged his nomination, has said he received \u201cvile threats of violence\u201d against his family.
