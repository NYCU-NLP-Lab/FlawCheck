["A new commercial from the conservative group Americans for Prosperity accuses Obama of breaking his promises on the national debt.\n\nThe ad notes, \"In 2009, Barack Obama said,\" then cuts to Obama: \"I\u2019m pledging to cut the deficit by half by the end of my first term in office.\" The words \"Feb. 2009, Debt: $10 trillion\" flash onscreen.\n\nA giant meter titled \"the national debt clock\" then appears on screen, reading $10.6 trillion. As talking heads recount the upward spiral of the nation\u2019s debt, the clock frantically spins above $15 trillion.\n\nObama is then heard saying, \"I will be held accountable\" before appearing in a video and continuing, \"If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition.\"\n\nThe debt clock returns, reading in excess of $15.9 trillion with the tagline, \"Let\u2019s make this a one-term proposition on November 6th.\" In a voice-over, the president is heard repeating, \"I will be held accountable.\"\n\nWell, time\u2019s up, Mr. President. Did Obama say he would be held accountable for not halving the deficit in three years? When we went to the tape, we found Americans for Prosperity was pulling together two different interviews, and on two different topics.\n\nThe deficit debate\n\nFirst off, it should be no secret Obama did, in fact, promise to cut the deficit in half during his first term. We\u2019ve confirmed that before, rating that very claim by Republican Party of Florida chairman Lenny Curry quite True.\n\nThat ruling pointed out the federal budget deficit -- the difference between what the government spends versus what it takes in -- was $1.4 trillion when Obama took office. It decreased each year, projected to reach $901 billion in the fiscal year 2013 budget, but that\u2019s still over the promised amount, which would have been in the neighborhood of $700 billion.\n\nWith the presence of the debt clock, Americans For Prosperity is confusing the deficit with the national debt, which is the aggregated total of the nation\u2019s public debt, not its annual budget deficits. AFP didn\u2019t return our request for clarification, so we can only guess if they know the difference. Most Americans don\u2019t seem to know the specifics, either.\n\nThe promise Obama made was from a White House meeting called the \"Fiscal Responsibility Summit\" on Feb. 23, 2009.\n\n\"Today I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office,\" Obama said. \"Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.\"\n\nNote the phrase \"we inherited\" was removed from the ad\u2019s version. That alone doesn\u2019t make AFP\u2019s usage of the sentence for the purposes of this attack ad untrue; Despite the president\u2019s reasoning that high unemployment, wartime costs and the Great Recession prevented deeper cuts, budget numbers are still budget numbers.\n\nStaying on message\n\nThe selective editing gets worse in the second half of the ad.\n\nObama\u2019s admission that the voters will likely break out the torches and pitchforks if he doesn\u2019t follow through in three years is from a 2009 interview with Matt Lauer on NBC\u2019s Today show.\n\nIt\u2019s from Feb. 2, however, almost three weeks before his pledge to cut the deficit.\n\nAnd the president is speaking about the Troubled Asset Relief Program, not halving the deficit.\n\nDuring the interview, Lauer asked Obama if the bank bailouts he inherited would be curtailed if spending appeared to be ineffective. (President George W. Bush signed TARP into law October 2008, before Obama was elected.)\n\n\"Look, I'm at the start of my administration,\" Obama said. \"One nice thing about the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable. You know, I've got four years, and --\"\n\n\"You're going to know quickly how people feel about what's happening,\" Lauer interjected.\n\n\"That's exactly right. And, you know, a year from now, I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress, but there's still going to be some pain out there. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition.\"\n\nFor the record, TARP officially expired in October 2010. The net cost of the program to U.S. taxpayers was reported earlier this year to be in the neighborhood of $34 billion, although questions remain as to exactly how some banks repaid the bulk of some $428 billion in disbursements and whether many banks in the program were going to survive. But no more money is being lent from the TARP fund.\n\nWe should note there\u2019s been a troubling trend this election season of campaigns splicing together unrelated or out-of-context video of a candidate\u2019s statements.\n\nMitt Romney\u2019s campaign used Obama\u2019s \"you didn\u2019t build that\" quote out of context, but Democrats have also deceptively quoted Romney\u2019s stance on his Massachusetts ban on assault weapons and dealing with foreclosures.\n\nEditing video to make a person say what you want is not a new tactic, nor is it that hard to do -- here\u2019s a video of Obama singing Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s Call Me Maybe.\n\nThe ruling\n\nClearly this commercial is edited to remove references to the Bush administration and muddy the context of the president\u2019s comments. Obama irrefutably made the promise in 2009 to slash the deficit in half by the time his first term expired, and that doesn\u2019t look at all possible.\n\nBut Americans For Prosperity overreaches, splicing together footage from two unrelated interviews to distort the message it wants to convey. Obama wasn\u2019t talking about the deficit or the debt when he said, \"If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition.\"\n\nIn this instance, the piling on is unnecessary to make the group\u2019s point, and it\u2019s intentionally misleading. The ad takes Obama\u2019s comments from an interview about bank bailouts and TARP and makes it look as if he\u2019s talking about the national debt. The use of the debt clock also purposely detracts from the president\u2019s initial statement about the federal deficit.\n\nWe rate this claim False.", "YouTube, \"President Obama: A One Term Proposition,\" posted Aug. 8, 2012\n\nWhite House, \"Fiscal Responsibility Summit remarks,\" Feb. 23, 2009\n\nC-SPAN Video Library, \"White House Fiscal Responsibility Summit,\" minute 24:36, Feb. 23, 2009\n\nYouTube via the Today show, \"Feb 2, Matt Lauer interview with President Barack Obama,\" minute 4:20, Feb. 2, 2009\n\nNexis\u00a0Federal News Service transcript, \"NBC \u2018Today\u2019 interview with President Barack Obama; Interviewer: Matt Lauer,\" Feb. 2, 2009\n\nCongressional Budget Office, \"Report on the Troubled Asset Relief Program,\" March 29, 2011\n\nWhite House, \"Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2013,\" accessed Aug. 9, 2012\n\nPew Research Center, \"Public Knows Basic Facts about Politics, Economics, But Struggles with Specifics,\" Nov. 18, 2010\n\nWall Street Journal, \"A Bailout Some Won\u2019t Exit,\" Sept. 30, 2010\n\nNational Review, \"The Real Cost of TARP,\" March 14, 2012\n\nGovernment Accountability Office, \"Report to Congressional Committees: Capital Purchase Program: Revenues Have Exceeded Investments, but Concerns about Outstanding Investments Remain,\" March 2012\n\nYouTube, \"Barack Obama Singing Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae\u00a0Jepsen,\" June 4, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, \"An ad claims Mitt Romney's housing policy is to let foreclosures \u2018hit the bottom\u2019,\" Nov. 1, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, \"DNC ad accuses Mitt Romney of flip-flopping on assault-weapons ban,\" Nov. 29, 2011\n\nPolitiFact\u00a0Florida, \"Obama promised to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term but didn't,\" March 8, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, \"Putting Mitt Romney's attacks on 'You didn't build that' to the Truth-O-Meter,\" July 26, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
