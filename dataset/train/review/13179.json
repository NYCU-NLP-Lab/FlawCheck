["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on January 26, 2021", "A highly viewed Facebook video distorts a CNN interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci to falsely suggest that a COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S doesn\u2019t \u201cprotect you from covid.\u201d The vaccine does protect against COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus; Fauci was simply cautioning that it may not prevent someone from contracting the virus.", "How effective are the COVID-19 vaccines?            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow effective are the COVID-19 vaccines?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the authorized and approved vaccines are effective at preventing severe COVID-19.\nAgainst earlier forms of the coronavirus, the vaccines were highly effective at preventing symptomatic illness.

In fact, as Fauci explained in the interview, the vaccine does protect against COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. It may not, however, protect against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which sometimes does not make people sick.", "The video, which has racked up more than 468,000 views and 14,000 shares, was posted by TAHO, a group that claims to be a non-governmental organization \u201cto encourage the youth in farming activities.\u201d The group\u2019s Facebook photo includes an image of a map of Africa, and the group is managed by individuals in Ghana and the United Kingdom. Many of its posts, including the Fauci video post, end with the phrase, \u201cAfrican Youth Reflect.\u201d", "The video runs about two minutes long and contains a segment of an interview CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo did with Fauci on Dec. 10. The interview followed news that an independent advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration had voted that the benefits of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine outweigh its risks \u2014 all but ensuring the agency would greenlight the vaccine. The next day, the FDA followed through and granted the vaccine an emergency use authorization, the first for any COVID-19 vaccine in America.", "Another vaccine from the biotech company Moderna went through the same process a week later. That vaccine also protects against disease, but it\u2019s not known yet if it prevents infection.", "The clip begins with Cuomo asking Fauci why it will still be necessary to wear a face mask even after a person is vaccinated. Fauci explains this is because while the vaccine does an excellent job at protecting people from falling ill, it might not prevent infection \u2014 and initially there will still be a lot of virus circulating in the population.", "\u201cYou could be prevented from getting clinical disease, and still have the virus that is in your nasopharynx because you could get infected,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure, at this point, that the vaccine protects you against getting infected.\u201d", "Here, a voiceover cuts in to repeat Fauci\u2019s last sentence in a suggestive tone, before allowing him to continue: \u201cWe know for sure it\u2019s very, very good, 94%, 95% in protecting you against clinically recognizable disease.\u201d", "At this point a voiceover interjects, \u201cClinically recognizable disease, but not COVID?\u201d The question insinuates that there is something suspicious about what Fauci said, but there isn\u2019t. He\u2019s only making a distinction between disease and infection.", "Specifically, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was tested in a phase 3 randomized trial in which people were counted as having COVID-19 if they developed at least one symptom of the disease, such as a fever, cough or shortness of breath, and tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus within four days.", "Using this definition, which is quite inclusive, the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease in adults.", "Moderna\u2019s vaccine, for which the general results were known at the time of the CNN interview, was similarly effective \u2014 94.1% \u2014 based on a COVID-19 case definition of at least two systemic symptoms, such as fever, chills or headache, and one respiratory symptom, along with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2.", "The trials, however, did not immediately evaluate how well the vaccines were able to prevent infection. This is particularly relevant for COVID-19, because while many people develop at least some symptoms, some proportion of people do not. It therefore remains possible the two-dose shot keeps people healthy \u2014 the primary goal for the vaccines \u2014 but that vaccinated people can still become infected and unwittingly transmit the virus. Hence, Fauci\u2019s advice, at least for now, to continue to wear a mask and follow public health precautions, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also endorsed.", "As we\u2019ve written before, there is a good chance that the authorized COVID-19 shots will help limit transmission to some degree, as that is still common with vaccines that cannot shield against infection but do defend against illness. But it nevertheless remains an open question for the COVID-19 vaccines.", "The video misleads again when the voiceover repeats Fauci\u2019s statement that the vaccine protected people against \u201csevere disease\u201d and then asks, \u201cWell, then, what does he call COVID, if that\u2019s not serious?\u201d", "That misunderstands COVID-19 and how differently it affects various people. As we\u2019ve already noted, infection with SARS-CoV-2 does not always produce symptoms in people. For most individuals, the symptoms are relatively mild. But in some patients, particularly those who are older or who have certain health conditions, COVID-19 can be deadly \u2014 and for others, symptoms can linger.", "Fauci was referring to the ability of the vaccine to prevent a severe case of COVID-19. In both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials, severe disease was defined as having confirmed COVID-19 and at least one sign of serious illness, such as a blood oxygen level below 93%, respiratory failure or admission to the intensive care unit.", "In the Moderna trial, all 30 cases of severe COVID-19 occurred in the placebo group at the time of the FDA\u2019s evaluation. One severe case was later identified in the vaccine group. Few volunteers in the Pfizer/BioNTech trial developed severe disease, making it difficult to come to firm conclusions, but as the FDA noted in its briefing, \u201cthe case split does suggest protection from severe COVID-19 disease.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
