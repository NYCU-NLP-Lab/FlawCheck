["By Robert Farley", "Posted on January 4, 2017", "In support of his argument that the Affordable Care Act \u201cdoesn\u2019t work\u201d and provides \u201clousy healthcare,\u201d President-elect Donald Trump quoted Bill Clinton as saying the law is \u201ccrazy\u201d and Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton as saying that the law \u201cis no longer affordable.\u201d\u00a0But both comments are lifted out of context.", "Trump has vowed to work with Congress to repeal and replace President Obama\u2019s signature legislation soon after taking office. Indeed, on Jan. 3, Congress took the first step toward repeal of the law.", "On the same day, Trump took to Twitter to argue that even Democrats who once supported the law now think it is bad. Trump began by referring to comments in October from former President Clinton, who at the time was campaigning for his wife, Hillary.", "People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work, and it is not affordable \u2013 116% increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it \"CRAZY\"", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017", "The second tweet five minutes later referenced comments made by Gov. Dayton in October.", "The Democrat Governor.of Minnesota said \"The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!\" \u2013 And, it is lousy healthcare.", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017", "In both cases, Clinton and Dayton made comments critical of the Affordable Care Act. But both said they remained supporters of the law and blamed Republicans for refusing to make changes to improve it. In both cases, Trump shortened the quotes to present them in a light less favorable than a fuller context reveals.", "We\u2019ve noted before that Trump\u2019s statistic on rate increases in Arizona\u2019s ACA exchange is accurate, but cherry-picked. Arizona has the highest average increase among all the states. In Indiana, the average change is a 3 percent decrease.", "But there is no question that rates are on the rise. The average increase\u00a0for the second-lowest cost silver plans from 2016 to 2017 in the 38 states that have ACA exchanges is 25 percent, as detailed in a report from the Department of Health and Human Services.", "That does not include subsidies. For those who are eligible to get them, the tax credits shelter consumers from premium increases, because they put a cap on the amount an individual must contribute toward benchmark premiums based on income. The HHS report notes that 77 percent of current enrollees can find plans for $100 or less per month, after factoring in tax credits.", "As for Clinton calling\u00a0the ACA \u201ccrazy,\u201d he made those comments while campaigning for his wife in Flint, Michigan, on Oct. 3. As the fuller context shows, Clinton was not referring to the entirety of the ACA as \u201cCRAZY,\u201d as Trump claimed.", "Clinton, Oct. 3: Now the next thing is, we got to figure out what to do now on health care. Her opponent said, \u201cOh, just repeal it all. The market will take care of it.\u201d That didn\u2019t work out very well for us, did it? We wound up with the most expensive system in the world and we insured the smallest percentage of people. On the other hand, the current system works fine if you\u2019re eligible for Medicaid, if you\u2019re a lower income working person, if you\u2019re already on Medicare, or if you get enough subsidies on a modest income that you can afford your health care.", "But the people that are getting killed in this deal are small business people and individuals who make just a little too much to get any of these subsidies. Why? Because they\u2019re not organized, they don\u2019t have any bargaining power with insurance companies, and they\u2019re getting whacked. So you\u2019ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden, 25 million more people have health care and then the people that are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It\u2019s the craziest thing in the world.", "So here\u2019s the simplest thing \u2015 you raise your hands and you think about it \u2015 here\u2019s the simplest thing: Figure out an affordable rate and let people use that \u2015 something that won\u2019t undermine your quality of life, won\u2019t interfere with your ability to make expenses, won\u2019t interfere with your ability to save money for your kid\u2019s college education. And let people buy in to Medicare or Medicaid.", "Here\u2019s why. You can let people buy in for just a little bit because unlike where you are now, if you were on the other side of this, if you were an insurer, you\u2019d say, \u201cGosh, I only got 2,000 people in this little pool. Eighty percent of the insurance costs every year come from 20 percent of the people. If I get unlucky in the pool, I\u2019ll lose money.\u201d So they overcharge you just to make sure, and on good years, they just make a whopping profit out of the people least able to pay it.", "It doesn\u2019t make any sense. The insurance model doesn\u2019t work here. It\u2019s not like life insurance, it\u2019s not like casualty, it\u2019s not like predicting flooding. It doesn\u2019t work. So Hillary believes we should simply let people who are above the line for getting these subsidies have access to affordable entry into the Medicare and Medicaid programs. They\u2019ll all be covered. It will not hurt the program. We will not lose a lot of money. And we ought to do it.", "The following day, at an event in Athens, Ohio, Clinton clarified that, on the whole, he supported the ACA, but felt that it could be improved by allowing those ineligible for insurance subsidies or Medicaid to buy into Medicare or Medicaid.", "\u201cLook, the Affordable Health Care Act did a world of good, and the 50-something efforts to repeal it that the Republicans have staged were a terrible mistake,\u201d Clinton said at the Athens event. \u201cWe for the first time in our history at least are providing insurance to more than 90 percent of our people.\u201d", "The comments from Minnesota Gov. Dayton were made on Oct. 12, a few\u00a0weeks after the state announced that insurance companies on the individual market \u2014 including MNsure, the state-run ACA exchange \u2014 were planning to increase premiums between 50 percent and 67 percent, on average.", "Asked about those hikes, Dayton called the proposed rate increases \u201csevere\u201d and said \u201cthe reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable to increasing numbers of people.\u201d (The emphasis on that last phrase is ours, because Trump left it off.)", "In the transcript of Dayton\u2019s fuller comments \u2014 provided to us by the governor\u2019s office \u2014 he blamed a \u201ctotally deadlocked\u201d Congress for failing to make \u201cnecessary changes or improvements\u201d to the law to make it more affordable for those unable to qualify for Medicaid or government subsidies.", "Dayton, Oct. 12: Well, it\u2019s a very serious problem, the escalation of the costs of insurance under the Affordable Care Act, for others besides individuals, but there it\u2019s most severe. But those are not MNsure\u2019s rates. Those are not rates that are the product of MNsure. They\u2019re the rates that the insurance companies have set in order to stay in, participating in, providing individual insurance, both through the MNsure exchange and also separately from that.", "And so the advantage for people of going through MNsure is that many will qualify for federal tax credits to reduce the gross increase in the rates. \u2026", "But ultimately, I\u2019m not trying to pass the buck here, but the reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable to increasing numbers of people. And Congress, which has been totally deadlocked in terms of making any necessary changes or improvements, is going to have to step into this in January with the next administration, and make the kind of changes such as, if \u2026 the federal government [provided] for catastrophic health care occurrences \u2013 you\u2019d bring the rates down very significantly. \u2026", "And the subsidies that the federal government provides, the tax credits, are going to need to be increased and expanded to, again, reduce the cost burden on those who are buying insurance under the Affordable Care Act.", "So I mean, there are a number of things that need to be done, federal, and there are some things we can do at the state. But the magnitude of this problem, Minnesota is not alone in this. There are many other states that have experienced significant increases, our increases are higher on a percentage basis because our base rates were lower, previously \u2013 but still very drastic increases and there are other states where providers, like in our case Blue Cross Blue Shield, have left the market entirely.", "So the Affordable Care Act has many good features to it, it\u2019s achieved great success in terms of insuring more people \u2013 20 million people across the country \u2013 and providing access for people who have preexisting conditions and the like. But it\u2019s got some serious blemishes and serious deficiencies. And we\u2019re going to need both state and federal governments to step in and do what they need to do to remedy these problems.", "Shortly after Dayton made the statement, Sam Fettig, a spokesman for the governor, clarified: \u201cThe Governor wants to make it clear that the Republicans in Congress are to blame for their unwillingness to make improvements necessary to make the Affordable Care Act more successful.\u201d", "Dayton reiterated that point on Jan. 3, when he\u00a0responded to Trump\u2019s tweet, also via Twitter.", "The ACA has provided quality healthcare to +20M Americans. Its problems could've been corrected if GOP had tried to improve, not destroy it. https://t.co/RRGzuoLUKR", "\u2014 Governor Mark Dayton (@GovMarkDayton) January 3, 2017", "Dayton released a proposed budget the same day calling for a 25 percent health insurance premium reduction \u201cfor the 125,000 Minnesotans expected to purchase health insurance on the individual market in 2017 who do not receive federal tax credits.\u201d", "In a press conference about the budget proposal, Dayton was asked about Trump\u2019s tweet (at the 22:50 mark).", "\u201cI don\u2019t have any control over what the president-elect tweets,\u201d Dayton said. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve stated my position. I never said it was lousy health care. That wasn\u2019t part of the quote, but he put that in. That\u2019s his view.\u201d", "Trump is, of course, entitled to his view that the ACA provides \u201clousy healthcare.\u201d And his tweet makes it clear that that is his assessment. But Trump leaves out key context from the quotes of Clinton and Dayton to make his point.", "Politifact Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
