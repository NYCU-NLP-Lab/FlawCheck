Source: Atlanta Regional Commission", "Even if Georgia were, ahem, flush with water, the number would have looked impressive.", "The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District recently celebrated its rebate program that has helped homeowners replace 100,000 older model toilets with water efficient models across the 15-county metro Atlanta region.", "The total savings: 2.4 million gallons of water every day.", "\"One of the beautiful things about changing out a toilet is you get a rebate, but you also permanently save on your water bill,\" said Katherine Zitsch, the water district\u2019s director. \"It\u2019s not behavior based. You do what you normally do and you get those savings for as long as the toilet lasts.\"", "And considering the water saved would fill the Georgia Aquarium 90 times a year \u2013 clearly nothing to poo poo \u2013 PolitiFact Georgia decided to dive in.", "Going with the flow", "Today\u2019s toilet regulations date back to the 1992 Energy Policy Act, which required toilets to use 1.6 gallons of water per flush, versus the then-common 3.5-gallon models (and even older models that used as much as 8-gallons for every push of the handle).", "Early savings didn\u2019t materialize because manufacturers did little more than halve the water used in a flush. Irate homeowners in news stories from the mid-Clinton years griped about having to flush multiple times to get the job done.", "\"Plumbers were installing and changing out toilets and handing people plungers,\" said Ellen Whitaker, executive director of the Plumbing and Mechanical Association of Georgia. \"It was as bad as it sounds. It just didn\u2019t work. We don\u2019t see those complaints anymore.\"", "Technology wiped out those early problems. High-pressure gadgets, and even vacuum toilets with suction that rivals airplane lavatories, have made it possible for high-efficiency models to use just 1.28 gallons per flush.", "That lower number qualifies commodes for the WaterSense designation. The privately verified seal, similar to Energy Star ratings for electrical appliances, confirms toilets, faucets and showerheads are the most water-efficient on the market.", "Exchange of Thrones", "The water planning district started its toilet rebate program in 2007, well into the era of high-tech toilets but also in the midst of back-to-back droughts in Georgia.", "Local water utilities fund and run the program, rebating $100 on water bills when homeowners show they have replaced an older toilet with a water-efficient model. Most utilities will offer rebates for up to two toilets, though some will rebate three.", "The planning district has kept track of the number of toilets \u2013 as well as whether the new models are the 1.28-gallon or 1.6-gallon model..", "But the district has been conservative in estimating the water saved, counting only one toilet per household, even in situations where records show more than one throne was exchanged.", "The district then multiplies the water saved per toilet by what its partner, the Atlanta Regional Commission, shows is the average household size in a community.", "Using a small jurisdiction like Bartow County, which exchanged WaterSense toilets in 49 homes, the math looks like this:", "Step 1: 3.5 gallon minus 1.28 gallon = 2.22 gallons per toilet.", "Step 2: 2.22 gallons times 49 households = 108.78 gallons", "Step 3: \u00a0108.78 gallons times 5 flushes = 543.9 gallons per day", "Step 4: 2.71 average home size times 543.9 gallons = 1,474 gallons per day", "Bartow also had one home that received a 1.6 gallon toilet. Using the same formula, that translates into 25 gallons a day.", "The water district rounded up, showing 1,500 gallons per day of savings in Bartow.", "Similar calculations were done across the region, to arrive at the 2.4 million gallons total, said Paul Donsky, spokesman for the ARC.", "Cobb and DeKalb counties, which account for 15 percent and 20 percent of the totals exchanged, run their own programs and calculate the totals slightly differently.", "DeKalb, for instance, assumes 10 flushes per day per toilet, not per person. That translates into more gallons but overall, fewer flushes.", "The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s WaterSense calculator uses yet another similar but not quite exact formula for its estimates.", "That calculator factors in 5.05 flushes per day, showing that a two-person home that switches to a WaterSense model, would save 8,200 gallons of water annually.", "The water planning district\u2019s math is more conservative. Using the formula, the district arrives an estimate of annual savings of 8,103 gallons.", "\"They are all estimates but show our effort to reduce water use,\" said Jennifer Colaizzi, the EPA\u2019s WaterSense spokeswoman. \"We want to encourage people to use water more efficiently.\"", "To that end, the water district notes there has not been a slowdown in the number of people seeking and getting the toilet rebate. The program is expected to continue until most homes use the newer, water-sipping flushes.", "Our ruling", "The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District recently touted that the region saves 2.4 million gallons of water every day, based on its toilet rebate that has replaced 100,000 commodes with more efficient models.", "That\u2019s enough to fill 1,363 Olympic-size swimming pools every year. But the district\u2019s own math backs it up.", "And a comparable federal calculator shows that the district is being conservative in estimating the region\u2019s move toward water efficiency.", "We rate the claim True.", "The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, \"Toilet Rebate Program Reaches Milestone: 100,000 Toilets Replaced with Water-Saving Models,\" June 16, 2015", "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Energy Policy Act of 1992, accessed June 25, 2015", "The Environmental Protection Agency, WaterSense program page, accessed June 24, 2015", "The Environmental Protection Agency, WaterSense calculator, accessed June 30, 2015", "Phone interview, Ellen Whitaker, executive director, Plumbing and Mechanical Association of Georgia, June 25, 2015", "Phone and email interviews, Paul Donskey, spokesman, Atlanta Regional Commission, June 24 to June 30, 2015", "Phone and email interviews, Jennifer Colaizzi, spokeswoman Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s WaterSense program, June 24 to June 30, 2015", "Phone interview, Katherine Zitsch, director, Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, July 1, 2015", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
