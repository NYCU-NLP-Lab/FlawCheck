The vote was a blow to a GOP-led threat to strike back at President Barack Obama for his executive action on immigration.", "All 10 Georgia Republicans voted \"No\" on the funding bill, which passed 257 to 167.", "Some Republicans wanted to add provisions to the bill to gut the legal protections that the president, by executive order, called to provide to as many as five million illegal immigrants.", "But after threat of a partial agency shutdown created a backlash, House Speaker John Boehner and the majority quietly capitulated Tuesday. They passed a ''clean'' funding bill with no immigration provisions.", "U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Gainesville, was among those who voiced frustration.", "\"It\u2019s not what I would like to see,\" Collins said.", "Why, Collins asked, was the president willing to jeopardize funding for the Department of Homeland Security for \"a proposal that frankly he himself has said 22 times he couldn\u2019t do?\"", "Sound familiar?", "It\u2019s a claim PolitiFact has checked more than once and one that Republicans have repeated multiple times. The 22 citations were included in a blog posted by Boehner\u2019s office in November and shared with us this week by Brendan Thomas, Collins\u2019 spokesman.", "On Nov. 20, Obama announced he would delay deportations of illegal immigrants who have lived in the country more than five years, have children who are citizens or who have green cards. This would allow more than 4 million people to qualify for work permits and avoid deportation for three years, provided they each pass a background check and pay a fee.", "The president\u2019s decision, which the GOP has denounced as an abuse of power, is on hold based on a temporary injunction from a federal judge in Texas.", "Our PolitiFact Texas colleagues checked the list for claims by politicians from that state.", "All of the citations in Boehner\u2019s post were compared by PolitiFact Texas to transcripts and news stories. The majority of the examples are of Obama saying he did not have power to do more on immigration without Congress. Others, as we\u2019ll explain in a moment, say something more nuanced or aren\u2019t specific to immigration.", "We won\u2019t go through every quote that supports Boehner\u2019s point here, but here are a few we culled from a document created by PolitiFact Texas:", "In September 2012, Obama was asked if he would follow up his recent protective move for students by doing something similar for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that \"as the head of the executive branch, there\u2019s a limit to what I can do\u2026 we\u2019re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally,\" as in parents deported. (No. 13 on Boehner\u2019s list.)", "At a presidential debate in October 2012, Obama and Mitt Romney were asked: \"What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society?\" Obama said: \"I've done everything that I can on my own.\" (No. 14 on Boehner\u2019s list.)", "In a January 2013 Telemundo interview, Obama was asked why he couldn\u2019t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had served law-abiding students. \"I\u2019m not a king,\" Obama replied, akin to his response the same month to a similar query from Univision. \"You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. And-- you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws-- we\u2019ve got some discretion. We can prioritize-- what we do. But we can\u2019t simply ignore the law.\" (No. 16 on Boehner\u2019s list.)", "So clearly there are examples of Obama saying he couldn\u2019t do more with executive action, then later doing exactly that. That\u2019s why PolitiFact previously rated Obama\u2019s claim that \"my position hasn\u2019t changed\" as False.", "What should not be counted", "Also included on the list of 22 are quotes where Obama was either suggesting his executive powers did not have hard limits or was silent on his executive power on immigration. Here are a few problems with quotes included on Boehner\u2019s list.", "In two instances during his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama criticized \"signing statements\" used by President George W. Bush that interpret laws, but he did not bring up immigration. Immigration was also not part of his reply to a question at a 2010 MTV/BET event when he said, \"I can\u2019t simply ignore laws that are out there,\" in response to a question about \"don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\" \u00a0(Nos. 1, 2 and 5.)", "In September 2011, with his deferred-action plan on the horizon, Obama reiterated that he cannot just change laws unilaterally in response to a question about possible administrative relief for students who don\u2019t have legal residency.
