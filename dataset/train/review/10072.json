["About this rating", "Planned Parenthood Votes is one member of a coalition of organizations which is planning to expend $30 million to mobilize \"infrequent voters\" in the 2018 midterm elections.", "Planned Parenthood Votes is a separate entity from the main Planned Parenthood organization, is funded by donations, may legally participate in such political activities, and is only one of several groups involved in the $30 million effort.", "On 18 April 2018 Facebook page The Newly Press shared a text-based meme asserting that taxpayer-subsidized Planned Parenthood was spending upwards of $30 million to influence the outcome of the upcoming midterm elections:", "A later similar meme claimed specifically that all $30 million was going to Democratic candidates:", "However, a 16 April 2018 Roll Call piece made clear a distinction absent from Internet memes, namely that the $30 million figure represented monies to be provided by a coalition of organizations, of which Planned Parenthood Votes was but one member:", "A coalition of liberal organizations that includes the political arm of Planned Parenthood rolled out a $30 million program to mobilize \u201cinfrequent voters\u201d to cast ballots for progressive candidates in the  midterm elections.", "Targeting [people of color, young people, and women] is a time-worn strategy, but it has not worked in the previous midterm cycles \u201cmostly because efforts often engage too close to election day and don\u2019t build real relationships,\u201d the coalition said in its release.", "The other organizations funneling money and resources to the initiative \u2014 which the coalition is calling \u201cWin Justice\u201d \u2014 are the Center for Community Change Action, Color Of Change PAC, and the Service Employees International Union.", "The organizations are targeting 1.25 million voters in Florida, a million in Michigan, and 250,000 in Nevada through door-knocking and text messaging with volunteers.", "Roll Call also noted that the multiple-group initiative included Planned Parenthood Votes, which is \"the political arm of Planned Parenthood\" (i.e., a super PAC branch), an entity separate from the main Planned Parenthood Federation of America organization:", "Memes such as the one referenced above suggest it should be \"highly illegal\" for Planned Parenthood to receive taxpayer subsidies yet expend monies on political activities.   According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations such as Planned Parenthood are indeed \"prohibited\" from funding such endeavors:", "Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity. Violating this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes.", "However, Planned Parenthood is affiliated with two offshoot political entities which are separate from the main organization and thus can be involved with funding midterm elections. Planned Parenthood Action Fund (PPAF) is a 501(c)(4), which the IRS stipulates \"may further its exempt purposes through lobbying as its primary activity without jeopardizing its exempt status.\"", "The second organization, Planned Parenthood Votes, is a Super PAC. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) defines Super PACs such as Planned Parenthood Votes as \"committees that may receive unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor unions and other political action committees for the purpose of financing independent expenditures and other independent political activity.\"", "In short, Planned Parenthood itself is not \"dishing out $30 million on midterm elections\" in violation of the law.  Rather, a separate political arm of Planned Parenthood (which is donor-funded and may legally engage is such activities) is one part of a coalition of several groups that is expending an aggregate of $30 million on mobilizing \u201cinfrequent voters\u201d for the 2018 midterm elections.", "Bois, Paul. \u00a0 \"Planned Parenthood Spending $30 Million on Midterm Elections.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Daily Wire. \u00a0 18 April 2018.", "Bradner, Eric. \u00a0 \"First on CNN: Planned Parenthood to Target 8 States, Spend $20 Million as Part of Midterm Battle Plan.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN. \u00a0 1 March 2018.", "Connolly, Griffin. \u00a0 \"Planned Parenthood, Other Groups to Spend $30 Million on Midterms.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Roll Call. \u00a0 16 April 2018.", "Federal Election Commission. \u00a0 \"Types of Nonconnected PACs.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 20 April 2018.", "IRS.gov. \u00a0 \"The Restriction of Political Campaign Intervention by Section 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Organizations.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 20 April 2018.", "IRS.gov. \u00a0 \"Social Welfare Organizations.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 20 April 2018.", "Ballotpedia. \u00a0 \"Planned Parenthood Votes.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 20 April 2018.", "Planned Parenthood. \u00a0 \"nformation For Attorneys And Other Professionals.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 20 April 2018.", "Planned Parenthood Action Fund. \u00a0 \"Planned Parenthood Votes, Planned Parenthood Action Fund Launch 2018 Electoral Program.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 1 March 2018.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
