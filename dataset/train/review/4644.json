THIS IS ISLAM.\u201d", "At the bottom of the image it says: \u201cDead Christians after Muslim riot in Nigeria.\u201d", "Here is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post. AFP has blacked out the section of the image showing\u00a0dead bodies:", "The photograph is actually of an oil tanker explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2010, which killed 235 people.", "The graphic image from the DRC has been misused repeatedly, for example here where a Spanish language story says it shows a Boko Haram massacre and here where an Arabic language story claims the victims are\u00a0Rohingya Muslims.", "The graphic image has previously been fact checked by AFP.
