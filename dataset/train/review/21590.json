["About this rating", "In May 2017, people on social media got wind of an article about a Colorado hunter who apparently claimed that a Sasquatch (a creature of legend also known as Bigfoot or, in some circles, the Yeti) sexually assaulted him:", "The article was published by World News Daily Report on 11 May 2017:", "The 57-year old man was walking to his hunting cabin on Sunday, to see if it had suffered any damage during the winter.", "All of a sudden, a large \u201cgorilla-like\u201d creature dropped from a tree in front of him punched him in the face ... While Mr. Whitaker was trying to recover from the attack, the large humanoid creature began to tear his clothes while letting out some terrifying howls.", "\u201cWhen I regained consciousness, he had already torn my pants and was tearing through my underwear. I stabbed him in the shoulder with my hunting knife, and that made him run away.\u201d", "The item included a photograph of large footprints, purportedly captured at the scene of the incident.
