["By Eugene Kiely and Lori Robertson", "Posted on September 28, 2020", "In remarks about President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made some questionable statements:", "The former vice president made a few short appearances during the weekend leading up to the first debate.", "On Sept. 26, Biden spoke to the United States Conference of Mayors for less than 16 minutes, and he delivered brief remarks at the virtual L\u2019Attitude conference. On the same day, MSNBC aired an interview with Biden as part of the San Diego-based Latino conference.", "On Sept. 27, Biden made remarks about Trump\u2019s selection of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, speaking for less than 14 minutes.", "By contrast, Trump made five appearances and spoke for about two hours and 15 minutes, including a campaign rally in the swing state of Pennsylvania. See our story, \u201cFactChecking Trump\u2019s Weekend Claims,\u201d for the many false and misleading claims that the president made over the weekend.", "In making his pitch for the Senate to delay action on Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Biden gave a misleading account of Supreme Court nominees in a presidential election year.", "Biden, Sept. 27: Never before in our nation\u2019s history has a Supreme Court justice been nominated and installed while a presidential election is already underway. It defies every precedent, every expectation of a nation where the people, the people, are sovereign and the rule of law reigns.", "Biden\u2019s campaign told us that Trump should not be allowed to appoint the next Supreme Court justice because voting has already begun \u2014 which is what Biden meant when he said \u201cwhile a presidential election is already underway.\u201d It is true that early voting has started in some states.", "But it is also true that five justices since 1900 were nominated and installed in an election year by four different presidents who were running for reelection. Two of them \u2014 William Taft and Herbert Hoover \u2014 lost their elections.", "Amy Howe, a lawyer, detailed all instances of Supreme Court vacancies in election years since the turn of the 20th century in an article for SCOTUS Blog.", "Here is the list of five justices who were nominated and installed in an election year by a president running for reelection, based on\u00a0Howe\u2019s story, as well as\u00a0White House,\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0and\u00a0Senate\u00a0records.", "In every instance, the nomination was made and confirmed by members of the same party \u2014 which is the current situation with Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate. The difference, of course, is that the date of the election is much closer this year than it was for any of the nominees who were nominated and approved in the above chart.", "Biden also made the curious argument that senators need to \u201cstand up for the Constitution,\u201d and let the next president fill the vacancy left by the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.", "Biden: And I urge every senator to take a step back from the brink, take off the blinders on politics for just one critical moment, and stand up for the Constitution you swore to uphold. \u2026 Just because you have the power to do something doesn\u2019t absolve you of your responsibility to do right by the American people. Uphold your constitutional duty.", "Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution says the president \u201cshall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint \u2026 Judges of the supreme Court.\u201d Voting for or against Trump\u2019s nominee \u2014 should Barrett clear the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation process \u2014 is upholding the Constitution.", "The Biden campaign told us that the vice president believes the senators have a duty to use their constitutional power of advice and consent to block the nomination, because Trump has\u00a0overreached his authority in seeking to fill a vacancy while the election is underway.", "Earlier this month, we asked constitutional scholars about Biden\u2019s claim at a speech in Philadelphia that it would be a \u201cconstitutional abuse\u201d for a nominee to be installed on the Supreme Court this close to an election. No one said it was.", "\u201cIt is not an abuse of power \u2013 the president and the Senate have that prerogative,\u201d Kimberly Wehle, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, told us.", "Biden, a former senator who served as vice president under President Barack Obama from January 2009 to January 2017, also repeated some claims that we have written about before.", "Aid to state/local governments. In his remarks to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Biden distorted comments made by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, claiming that McConnell said, \u201cLet the states go bankrupt.\u201d Biden said, correctly, that the Senate hasn\u2019t taken up a Democratic House-passed bill to provide additional relief from the coronavirus pandemic, including to state and local governments.", "As we\u2019ve explained before, McConnell said bankruptcy should be a legal option for states facing money woes unrelated to the coronavirus, such as debt due to pension programs. The Republican senator made those remarks in an\u00a0April 22 radio interview\u00a0on \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show,\u201d saying: \u201cI would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route,\u201d when asked about states with budgetary woes predating the pandemic. McConnell, who said he wanted any additional state/local funding tied to COVID-19, made clear in subsequent interviews that he was saying bankruptcy should be \u201can option\u201d and that he didn\u2019t want any future federal aid to \u201cfix age-old problems\u201d in states \u201cwholly unrelated\u201d to the coronavirus pandemic.", "Preexisting conditions. Biden misleadingly claimed that if a Trump-backed effort in court to abolish the Affordable Care Act were successful, \u201cmore than 100 million people with preexisting conditions like asthma, diabetes, and cancer could once again be denied coverage.\u201d The figure is an estimate for the number of all Americans, outside of Medicare and Medicaid, with preexisting conditions. Without the ACA, as we\u2019ve explained, they\u2019d lose the preexisting condition protections in that law, but\u00a0only those who seek coverage on the individual market \u2014 where those without employer or public insurance buy plans \u2013 would be at risk of being denied insurance.", "The Trump administration has indeed backed a lawsuit to nullify the ACA and once specifically argued, in a 2018 letter from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, that\u00a0two provisions of the law would need to be eliminated if the suit were successful: those guaranteeing that people can\u2019t be denied coverage by insurers or charged more based on certain factors, such as health status. But Trump signed an executive order on Sept. 24 that said \u201caccess to health insurance despite underlying health conditions should be maintained\u201d even if the ACA were struck down in court.", "He said in remarks that day he would insist that any new health care legislation from Congress \u201cmust protect the preexisting conditions or I won\u2019t sign it.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what specifically Trump means by preexisting condition protections. In 2017, he backed Republican bills that would have included some, but not all, of the ACA\u2019s protections, and he misleadingly tweeted that one of the bills covered preexisting conditions, despite the fact that insurers could have priced policies based on health status in states that allowed it under the legislation.", "But even if the ACA were eliminated and not replaced with something else, it\u2019s misleading for Biden to claim 100 million people \u201ccould once again be denied coverage.\u201d\u00a0Before the ACA, those buying plans on the individual market\u00a0could face denials or higher premiums\u00a0based on their health. Only 6% of the population gets coverage on the individual market.", "Employer-based coverage \u2014 where 49% of the population gets insurance \u2014 couldn\u2019t deny insurance, before the ACA. They could decline coverage for some preexisting conditions for a limited period, if a new employee had a lapse in coverage.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
