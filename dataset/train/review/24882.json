["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on April 17, 2019", "A website cites an erroneous tweet, innuendo and unrelated events to falsely suggest there were \u201cMuslim ties\u201d to the Notre Dame fire.", "The devastating fire that ravaged the famed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on April 15 prompted unsubstantiated rumors online about who or what was to blame.", "By Tuesday, for example, the website of\u00a0former Fox News commentator Kevin Jackson had zeroed in on a whole group of people, running a headline that reads: \u201cMuslim Ties to Notre Dame Fire.\u201d", "We could find no credible sources to support the incendiary suggestion that Muslims were responsible.", "The French government said in a press release Tuesday the cause of the fire remained unknown, and\u00a0Paris public prosecutor Remy Heitz told reporters that investigators were currently eyeing it as an accident.", "The article on Jackson\u2019s site, however, advances the unsupported idea of a \u201cMuslim attack\u201d through paragraphs of innuendo, not fact.", "\u201cWas this a true accident? Or is someone trying to send Christians a message?\u201d the article on theblacksphere.net reads. \u201cMany people speculate this is a Muslim attack on Christianity. In 2016, a car parked outside Notre Dame was discovered. It contained full gas tanks and documents written in Arabic. Therefore, authorities were well-aware of the threats posed against Notre Dame.\u201d", "But there is no evidence tying that 2016 episode with this week\u2019s fire, as some news outlets worked to make clear. The U.K.\u2019s\u00a0Telegraph, which covered the 2016 incident at the time, affixed an update to its story indicating: \u201cThis story is from 2016 and unrelated to the\u00a0fire at Notre-Dame on April 15 2019.\u201d", "Theblacksphere.net, which makes a passing reference to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S., further attempts to support its narrative by citing a\u00a0now-deleted tweet from\u00a0Christopher Hale, a self-described \u201cTennessee politico\u201d who unsuccessfully\u00a0ran\u00a0for Congress in the Democratic primary last year and who\u00a0worked\u00a0on faith outreach for former President Barack Obama.", "\u201cA Jesuit friend in Paris who works in #NotreDame told me cathedral staff said the fire was intentionally set,\u201d the tweet said. In a subsequent tweet \u2014 omitted by the story \u2014 Hale acknowledged that his friend had \u201czero evidence\u201d and that it was an \u201cunsubstantiated rumor.\u201d", "In a phone interview with FactCheck.org, Hale called the tweet \u201chearsay\u201d and \u201ca horrible mistake.\u201d He said he deleted it after about 10 minutes.", "\u201cIt became clear it was becoming weaponized by Islamophobic forces,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst parts of the internet were using it for nefarious means.\u201d", "Other websites, including InfoWars, also used the tweet to claim the fire was \u201cdeliberately\u201d set. They all referred to Hale as a \u201cTIME columnist,\u201d although Hale told us he writes occasional opinion pieces for the magazine and other outlets.", "And while theblacksphere.net story says that \u201cHale isn\u2019t the only one to believe this fire has Muslim ties,\u201d Hale pointed out that his tweets never made any mention of any supposed Muslim connection to the fire.", "Hale declined to discuss his friend who provided the initial, unsubstantiated rumor, but he said: \u201cNeither he or I think it was anything but an accident.\u201d", "Theblacksphere.net story also links to a grainy video\u00a0on Facebook purporting to show \u201cWHAT LOOKS LIKE A MUSLIM ON THE LEDGE,\u201d at the cathedral.
