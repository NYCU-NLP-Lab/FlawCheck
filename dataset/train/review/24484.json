["Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga., gets a hug from a supporter after he made a formal announcement to run to fill Saxby Chambliss' seat in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2013. Broun says he was the first member of congress to call President Obama a socialist.", "U.S. Rep. Paul Broun has never been known as a wilting flower. During his time in the U.S. House, the Georgia Republican has become known for his strong, conservative opinions and controversial statements involving evolution.\n\nThose strong positions were on full display in a recent fundraising letter to donors that surfaced this week. In soliciting funds for his run for the Senate seat being vacated by Saxby Chambliss, Broun criticized President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and alleged their policies are ruining the country.\n\n\"I was the first member of Congress to call him a socialist who embraces Marxist-Leninist policies like government control of health care and redistribution of wealth,\" Broun says of Obama in the letter.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia sets the bar high when someone says they\u2019re the \"first\" to make a particular statement, so we researched the claim to see if Broun\u2019s bar should be lowered. \u00a0\n\nStories about Broun\u2019s letter were published earlier this week by other news outlets and political pundits across the state.\n\nThe conservative political blog Georgia Tipsheet called the letter \"a predictably confrontational fundraising appeal\" and noted that Broun was among the earliest to attach the (socialist) barb to Obama. The liberal blog Daily Kos called Broun\u2019s letter \"crackpot haiku.\"\n\nIn August 2009, Broun told an audience at North Georgia Technical College that Obama -- along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Reid -- were members of a \"socialist elite,\" while deriding Obamacare (what critics call the national health care law). Then, in January 2011, after Obama delivered his State of the Union address, Broun said in a Twitter post that the president did not believe in the Constitution, and instead \"You believe in socialism.\"\n\nBroun compared Obama\u2019s policies to those of Hitler or a Marxist dictator in November 2008, but apologized a week later for making the statements. \"The point I tried to make is that he is extremely liberal, he has promoted a lot of socialistic ideas, and it just makes me concerned,\" Broun told an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter at the time.\n\nObama\u2019s socialist moniker doesn\u2019t stop with Broun.\n\nIn October 2008, then-Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain accused Obama of pursuing a \"socialist\" agenda for telling blue-collar worker Joe the Plumber during a campaign stop that spreading the wealth around is good for everybody. That same month, then-Ohio U.S. Sen. George Voinovich told a newspaper reporter, \"(Obama) is left of Teddy Kennedy. With all due respect, the man is a socialist.\"\n\nPolitiFact has examined before whether Obama is a socialist, a claim made by Texas Gov. Rick Perry. We ruled that claim Pants on Fire.\n\nBut we\u2019re ruling on a different claim here: whether Broun was the first to place the \"socialist\" label on the president. So was Broun\u2019s claim accurate?\n\nWe called and emailed questions about the letter to Broun\u2019s staff for comment, but received no response.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia found that Broun\u2019s socialist name-calling goes back to 2009 when he said the president was a member of the \"socialist elite,\" and in 2011 said the president believed in socialism. But one of Broun\u2019s congressional colleagues, Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio, called Obama a socialist in October 2008; and Sen. John McCain of Arizona criticized Obama\u2019s \"socialist\" agenda during that same month.\n\nBased on our research, Broun was not the first member of Congress to specifically call Obama a socialist. In November 2008, Broun did compare Obama\u2019s policies to those of Hitler or a Marxist dictator. Philosopher Karl Marx is described historically as a revolutionary socialist, and Hitler was head of the National Socialist German Workers Party.\n\nBut even that criticism was made a month after other congressional members lobbed their socialist charges.\n\nCongress consists of both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, and Obama was called a \"socialist\" by an Ohio senator a year before Broun actually used the term \"socialist.\"\n\nWe rated Broun\u2019s claim False.", "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Political Insider, \"Paul Broun: \u2018I was the first to call Obama a socialist,\u2019\" Jim Galloway, Feb. 13, 2013\n\nGeorgia Tipsheet, \"Socialist hunting: Broun donor letter talks of Obama barbs, West support,\" James Richardson, Feb. 13, 2013\n\nDaily Kos, \"Paul Broun wants to be a senator because Obama\u2019s a \u2018Marxist-Leninist\u2019 who rules with \u2018iron fist,\u2019\" Feb. 14, 2013\n\nPolitiFact, \"Rick Perry says Barack Obama \u2018is a socialist,\u2019\" Bill Adair, Jan. 8, 2012\n\nThe Huffington Post, \"GOP Congressman Paul Broun to Obama during SOTU address: \u2018You believe in socialism,\u2019\" Nick Wing, Jan. 26, 2011\n\nThe Athens Banner-Herald, \"Obamacare a \u2018rotten fish,\u2019 says Broun at town hall,\" Blake Aued, Aug. 12, 2009\n\nThe Toledo Blade, \"Voinovich: Obama a \u2018socialist,\u2019\" Oct. 17, 2008\n\nThe Washington Post, \"The \u2018Socialist\u2019 scare,\" Ruth Marcus, Oct. 28, 2008\n\nThe New Yorker, \"Like, socialism,\" Hendrik Hertzberg, Nov. 3, 2008\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"Lawmaker sorry about Obama slam,\" Julia Malone, Nov. 12, 2008\n\nPhone interview, Kerwin Swint, political science professor, Kennesaw State University, Feb. 14, 2013", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
