Of these victims, 160,000 die, making stroke the third leading cause of death in the U.S. Those persons this dread killer does not immediately send to the grave are often left with lifelong debilitating infirmities of speech, movement, and even thought.", "A stroke is a serious medical event, both because it can (and does) kill, and because it can inflict long-term harm on those lucky enough to survive it. There are two types of acute stroke: ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes account for 80 percent of all such \"brain attacks\" and occur when a blood clot lodges in a vessel responsible for supplying blood to the brain, killing off part of that organ. Hemorrhagic strokes occur when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, resulting in bleeding which causes swelling and hematoma and ultimately impairs brain function.

It was drawn from a report presented in February 2003 at the American Stroke Association's (ASA) 28th International Stroke Conference, and news of it can be found on the American Heart Association's (AHA) web site. However, as the ASA says in its official statement about the report, though the research was funded by a grant from the ASA, that body has not taken a position on the topic nor endorsed the test because the results, though positive, arose from a very small study.", "If the study's findings hold up, it would mean that recognizing a stroke has taken place would be something just about anyone could do and would be a skill worth mastering in light of the importance of getting medical attention for stroke victims at the earliest possible moment.", "Focal neurological signs such as slurred speech, unilateral facial droop, blurred vision, discoordination, and partial or total paralysis are often indicative of some sort of brain dysfunction and would be recognized as important markers by those in the medical profession.

Better to discard this fourth suggested 'test' in favor of remembering the first three.", "By distilling the assessment process down to three simple tests (smile, raise both arms, speak a simple sentence), anyone is likely to remember what to ask of someone they suspect has just undergone a stroke and to correctly interpret the information so gleaned. (The tests are pass/fail, after all, so if the person they were administered to couldn't smile, couldn't raise her arms, and was incoherent, the party observing all this wouldn't be at a loss for what to make of the results \u2014 she'd conclude her friend had undergone a stroke.)", "And it is important laypeople learn to recognize such events, because a new drug has been shown to limit disability from strokes caused by clots (ischemic) provided victims receive it within three hours of the onset of stroke symptoms. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a clot-busting drug administered intravenously in cases of ischemic stroke; however, only one in fifty stroke patients has a chance of this drug helping them because currently only 2 percent of them reach an emergency room in time for tPA to be given.", "(It's possible tPA's effectiveness can be boosted by simultaneous massaging of the clot with ultrasound.

Because, if moved, the capillaries will burst.", "Help the victim to sit up where he is to prevent him from falling over. Again, and then the bloodletting can begin. If you have in your home an injection syringe, that would be the best, otherwise, a sewing needle or a straight pin will do. Place the needle/pin over fire to sterilize it, and then use it to prick the tip of all 10 fingers. There are no specific acupuncture points, just prick about a mm from the fingernail. Prick till blood comes out. If blood does not start to drip, then squeeze with your fingers. When all 10 digits is bleeding, wait a few minutes then the victim\nwill regain consciousness.", "If the victim's mouth is crooked, then pull on his ears until they are red. Then prick each ear lobe twice until two drops of blood comes from each ear lobe.", "After a few minutes the victim should regain consciousness. Wait till the victim regain his normal state without any abnormal symptoms then take him to the hospital, otherwise, if he was taken in the ambulance in a hurry to the hospital, the bumpy trip will cause all the capillaries in his brain to burst.", "If he could save his life, barely managing to walk, then it is by the grace of his ancestors.", "I learned about letting blood to save life from Chinese traditional doctor Ha Bu-Ting who lives in Sun-Juke. Furthermore, I had practical experience with it. Therefore I can say this method is 100% effective.", "In 1979, I was teaching in Fung-Gaap College in Tai-Chung.

So I pulled on his ears to fill them with blood. When his ears became red, I pricked his right earlobe twice to let out 2 drops of blood. When both earlobes had two drops of blood each, a miracle happened. Within 3-5 minutes the shape of his mouth returned to normal and his speech became clear.", "We let him rest for a while and have a cup of hot tea, then we helped him go down the stairs, drove him to Wei-Wah Hospital. He rested one night and was released the next day to return to school to teach. Everything worked normally.

By doing so, stroke may be removed from the list of major causes of death. Forward this after reading. It will be a good deed indeed.", "As mentioned earlier in this article, there are two types of acute stroke: ischemic and hemorrhagic. However, there are also two kinds of strokes: acute and transient ischemic attack (TIA). The former is the sort that takes lives or leaves those it strikes with permanent and all too often heartbreakingly serious disabilities. With the latter, the focal symptoms resolve within 24 hours, leaving no permanent neurological deficit. With that in mind, the \"miraculous recovery\" described in the e-mail above would have been due to the patient having weathered a TIA episode, not to having had his blood drained from his fingers and ear lobes.", "Because the underlying patholophysiology is the same between acute stroke and TIA, it's important to seek immediate medical attention for all stroke victims. TIA is also often a warning sign heralding increased risk of stroke. (In high risk demographics, the risk of stroke goes up ten-fold after a TIA.)", "As for not moving a stroke victim because so doing might cause \"irreparable bursting of the brain capillaries,\" the initial insult (stroke) has already occurred, so transport is unlikely to cause further harm.", "With regard to pricking fingers to get them bleeding as a possible counter to strokes, according to Dr. Rupinder S. Sahsi of Guelph, Ontario, a medical doctor of our acquaintance, \"I see no physiological reason why minute amounts of peripheral blood loss would have any effect on cerebral blood flow.\" In other words, pricking a stroke victim's fingers to get each of them to drip blood isn't going to do anything to aid that person.", "However, taking the time to stab the victim's fingers before bothering to transport him to a hospital, with even that done at a low speed, will cause harm, because when it comes to obtaining proper treatment for stroke victims, time lost is brain lost.
