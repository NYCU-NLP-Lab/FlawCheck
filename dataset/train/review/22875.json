["By Robert Farley", "Posted on October 8, 2018 | Updated on October 10, 2018", "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Marine Corps reservist during the Vietnam War, wrongly claimed years ago that he \u201cserved in Vietnam\u201d and once spoke of the mistreatment of Vietnam veterans \u201cwhen we returned.\u201d Those misstatements are fair game for his political opponents to criticize.", "But President Donald Trump has stretched the facts about Blumenthal\u2019s misstatements to absurd lengths.", "Most recently, amid Blumenthal\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the president falsely claimed Blumenthal \u201cwent around telling war stories,\u201d claimed he \u201cfought in Da Nang Province\u201d and talked of \u201csoldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill.\u201d Blumenthal never said any of those things.", "We generally let politicians fend for themselves when they are attacked for misstatements. When Trump\u00a0tweeted\u00a0in February 2017 that Blumenthal told a \u201cmajor lie,\u201d because he \u201cnever fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had,\u201d we did not weigh in.", "But like a snowball rolling downhill, Trump\u2019s account of Blumenthal\u2019s misstatements has grown more exaggerated over time \u2013 particularly during Kavanaugh\u2019s contentious confirmation hearings.", "So, here we will lay out the facts about Blumenthal\u2019s time as a Marine reservist during \u2013 not in \u2013 the Vietnam War, and how those facts have been distorted.", "Blumenthal\u2019s misleading statements about his military service during Vietnam first surfaced while he was running for the Senate in 2010 when the New York Times ran a story headlined \u201cRichard Blumenthal\u2019s Words on Vietnam Service Differ From History.\u201d", "The story, which was published\u00a0May 17, 2010, noted that during a rally in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 2003 in support of the military, Blumenthal talked about Vietnam War veterans and stated, \u201cWhen we returned, we saw nothing like this. Let us do better by this generation of men and women.\u201d And in 2008, the paper noted, Blumenthal told a group in Norwalk, \u201cWe have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.\u201d", "But, as the newspaper documented, Blumenthal did not serve as a Marine in Vietnam. Blumenthal\u2019s Selective Service record, published by the New York Times, showed that Blumenthal got at least five educational and occupational deferments from 1965 to 1970. He then enlisted in the Marine Reserve and served for six years stateside. The Marine Reserve was never deployed in Vietnam. (We should note that Trump also got five deferments, including a final one for bone spurs in his heels, during the Vietnam War.)", "The New York Times\u00a0also found: \u201cIn at least eight newspaper articles published in Connecticut from 2003 to 2009, he is described as having served in Vietnam.\u201d And yet, the paper wrote, \u201cIt does not appear that Mr. Blumenthal ever sought to correct those mistakes.\u201d", "When the story came out, Blumenthal, then serving as Connecticut\u2019s attorney general, told reporters, \u201cOn a few occasions I have misspoken about my service and I regret that, and I will take full responsibility. But I will not allow anyone to take a few misplaced words and impugn my record of service to this country.\u201d", "Blumenthal added that any claims he made to have served in Vietnam were \u201cabsolutely unintentional \u2014 a few misplaced words.\u201d He said that he usually tries to be more precise in saying that he served in the Marine Reserve \u201cduring\u201d Vietnam rather than \u201cin\u201d Vietnam.", "Indeed, in the same 2008 speech in which he said he served \u201cin Vietnam,\u201d Blumenthal initially said he was \u201csomeone who served in the military during the Vietnam-era in the Marine Corps.\u201d And during a debate in March 2010, the Times noted, Blumenthal responded to a question about Iran by saying, \u201cAlthough I did not serve in Vietnam, I have seen firsthand the effects of military action, and no one wants it to be the first resort, nor do we want to mortgage the country\u2019s future with a deficit that is ballooning out of control.\u201d", "A week after publication of the Times story and his explanation that he had \u201cmisspoken,\u201d Blumenthal offered a more full-throated apology, saying in a statement, \u201cI have made mistakes and I am sorry. I truly regret offending anyone.\u201d And he acknowledged, \u201cAt times when I have sought to honor veterans, I have not been as clear or precise as I should have been about my service in the Marine Corps Reserves.\u201d", "As we said, Trump has on several occasions over the years ridiculed Blumenthal for his misstatements when talking about his service during Vietnam.", "The president ramped up those attacks after Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u00a0questioned Kavanaugh\u2019s credibility during the committee\u2019s review of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assault her in the summer of 1982.", "During a rally in Tennessee on Oct. 1, Trump unveiled a new nickname for Blumenthal, dubbing him \u201cDa Nang Blumenthal.\u201d", "Trump, Oct. 1: How about Blumenthal? Da Nang Blumenthal, we call him Da Nang Blumenthal. For 15 years, as the attorney general of Connecticut, he went around telling war stories. People dying left and right, but my platoon marched forward. He was never in Vietnam. It was a lie. And then he\u2019s up there \u2014 then he\u2019s up there saying, \u201cWe want the truth from Judge Kavanaugh.\u201d", "The same day, during remarks on the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Trump continued the attack.", "Trump, Oct. 1: Look at some of these people asking the questions, OK. Look at Blumenthal, he lied about Vietnam. He didn\u2019t just say, \u201cHey, I went to Vietnam.\u201d No, no. For 15 years, he said he was a war hero. He fought in Da Nang Province. We call him \u201cDa Nang Richard.\u201d \u201cDa Nang,\u201d that\u2019s his nickname, \u201cDa Nang.\u201d He never went to Vietnam. And he\u2019s up there saying, \u201cWe need honesty, and we need integrity.\u201d This guy lied when he was the attorney general of Connecticut. He lied. I don\u2019t mean a little bit. And then when he got out \u2014 he actually dropped out the race and he won anyway, because Democrats always win in Connecticut. He won very close, probably the closest ever. \u2026 And when he got out and when he apologized, he was crying, the tears were all over the place, and now he acts like, \u201cHow dare you.\u201d", "The following day, at a rally in Mississippi, Trump added a couple new wrinkles.", "Trump, Oct. 2: This guy lied about his service. He didn\u2019t just say, \u201cGee, I was in the service.\u201d No. He said, \u201cI was in the Marines. Da Nang Province. Soldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill.\u201d This went on for 15 years when he was the attorney general of Connecticut. I thought he was a great war hero. And then it turned out he was never in Vietnam. He was in the Reserves. And I watched him two days ago. I watched him saying, \u201cWe need the truth. If we don\u2019t have\u201d \u2014 and here\u2019s a guy who was saying people were dying all around him and he was never there. And then he cried. When they caught him, he cried like a baby. \u2026 And the reason he got elected is because in Connecticut it\u2019s impossible for a Republican to get elected. And I did well there. But you can\u2019t. He actually gave up the race. You\u2019d thought he lost. You remember that? He, sort of, gave \u2014 he stopped campaigning. It was over. And then he won by three points.", "Again, Blumenthal in 2008 said, \u201cWe have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.\u201d And he said in 2003, \u201cWhen we returned [from Vietnam], we saw nothing like this.\u201d (Emphasis is ours.)", "But Blumenthal never said he fought in Da Nang Province. He never \u201cwent around telling war stories. \u2018People dying left and right, but my platoon marched forward.'\u201d He never talked about, \u201cSoldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill.\u201d", "It\u2019s also untrue that \u201cwhen [Blumenthal] apologized, he was crying, the tears were all over the place,\u201d or that, \u201cWhen they caught him, he cried like a baby.\u201d", "Here\u2019s a video of Blumenthal\u2019s initial response on May 18, 2010, to the New York Times story, in which he said, \u201cI misspoke about my service.\u201d No tears. And here\u2019s a video of Blumenthal\u2019s speech at the\u00a02010 Connecticut State Democratic Convention on May 21, 2010. No crying. And here\u2019s a video of Blumenthal talking to the media on May 24, 2010, after he released a statement apologizing for his \u201cmistakes.\u201d Again, no crying, no tears.", "Nor is it true that in 2010, Blumental \u201cactually dropped out the race and he won anyway, because Democrats always win in Connecticut. He won very close, probably the closest ever.\u201d Or, as Trump put it on Oct. 2, \u201cHe actually gave up the race. You\u2019d thought he lost. You remember that? He, sort of, gave \u2014 he stopped campaigning. It was over. And then he won by three points.\u201d", "Blumenthal never dropped out of the 2010 Senate race. And while a poll taken immediately after the Times story broke in 2010 showed that Blumenthal\u2019s sizable lead had dwindled to just 3 percentage points, he actually won the general election by a dozen percentage points over his opponent, Republican Linda McMahon. That was by no means the \u201cclosest ever\u201d Senate race in Connecticut history. As the Washington Post Fact Checker pointed out, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman won by a smaller margin in 1988 and 2006,\u00a0as did Sen. Lowell Weicker in 1982.", "Blumental was reelected in 2016 by a nearly 29-point margin.", "In a tweet on Oct. 1, Blumenthal said Trump\u2019s \u201cridiculous personal attacks are total nonsense \u2014 simply untrue.\u201d", "A spokesman for Blumenthal also said there is a misperception that Blumenthal frequently mischaracterized his service record, though the New York Times article cited just one instance of Blumenthal saying he served \u201cin Vietnam.\u201d As we said, Blumenthal in the same speech more accurately stated he was \u201csomeone who served in the military during the Vietnam-era in the Marine Corps.\u201d", "So to recap, based on what we know from the public record: Blumenthal did not say he was a \u201cwar hero.\u201d He did not say he fought in Da Nang Province. He never bragged about battles. He never talked about \u201csoldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill.\u201d He never said \u201cpeople were dying all around him.\u201d He never \u201cwent around telling war stories.\u201d He apologized and said he \u201cshould have been more precise\u201d in his language, but he didn\u2019t \u201ccry like a baby.\u201d He never \u201cdropped out of the race,\u201d or \u201cstopped campaigning.\u201d He didn\u2019t eke out a win \u201cby three points\u201d; he won by a dozen points. And that wasn\u2019t nearly the \u201cclosest ever\u201d Connecticut Senate race.", "Update, Oct. 10, 2018: Trump added even more preposterous exaggerations onto his claims about Blumenthal during a rally in Kansas on Oct. 6. In his latest remarks, Trump described Blumenthal as saying he tried twice to make heroic rescues as comrades were being shot all around him. Said Trump: \u201cHe talked about, when I was in Da Nang province in Vietnam and I was fighting up the hill and men are going left and right of me, they\u2019re dying. They\u2019re being struck by bullets, but I went back to their rescue. I went back and I got them, and then I made a second attempt, and bullets are going left and right and over my shoulders and they\u2019re hitting my men.\u201d Again, there is no public record of Blumenthal saying any of that.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
