["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 22, 2019", "A viral meme attempts to undercut the evidence of climate change by using an edited cover of Time magazine \u2014 and regurgitating a misleading claim about \u201cglobal cooling.\u201d", "A doctored cover of Time\u00a0magazine casting doubt on climate change has circulated for years \u2014 at one point, according to Politico, even reaching the desk of President Donald Trump.", "That supposed cover, warning of an \u201cIce Age,\u201d appeared again in recent weeks on Facebook, where thousands of users \u2014 including the musician Ted Nugent \u2014 shared it through a meme.", "\u201cWhen the exact same group of \u2018experts\u2019 who claimed it was global cooling in 1977 now claim it\u2019s global warming you can easily see why I am skeptical,\u201d\u00a0the meme reads.", "It includes two Time\u00a0magazine covers \u2014 one manipulated and one legitimate. The first, on the left, is falsely identified as being from 1977 and includes a doctored headline reading, \u201cHow to Survive the Coming Ice Age.\u201d The cover on the right, which is\u00a0real, is from 2008 and has a headline that reads: \u201cHow to Win the War on Global Warming.\u201d", "The cover falsely purported to be from 1977 was actually published April 9, 2007, and is\u00a0available on the magazine\u2019s website. Its real headline? \u201cThe Global Warming Survival Guide.\u201d", "Time itself attempted to set the record straight in a\u00a02013 post that debunked the fictitious version, but the false cover has persisted online nonetheless.", "The meme\u2019s overarching claim about \u201cexperts\u201d warning of a \u201cglobal cooling in 1977\u201d also isn\u2019t new. We addressed a similar claim\u00a0advanced\u00a0by Trump last year, and by Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz before him.", "As we\u2019ve written before, there were indeed articles (including in Time) in the 1970s that warned of cooling world temperatures. A 1975 Newsweek story\u00a0has received considerable attention. But the journalist who wrote that piece criticized it himself in 2014, taking aim at parts that were not fully supported by the research.", "Moreover, the notion of global cooling was not widely accepted among climate scientists \u2014 as global warming is today. (NASA\u00a0notes\u00a0that studies show that \u201c97 percent or more\u201d of active climate scientists believe human-caused warming is occurring.)", "We\u2019ll again refer to the 2008 study\u00a0published in the\u00a0Bulletin of the American\u00a0Meteorological Society\u00a0that found there was not a scientific consensus in the 1970s on the cooling idea. The authors, by surveying the peer-reviewed literature between 1965 and 1979, found quite the opposite.", "\u201cA review of the literature suggests that, on the contrary, greenhouse warming even then dominated scientists\u2019 thinking as being one of the most important forces shaping Earth\u2019s climate on human time scales,\u201d they\u00a0found.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
