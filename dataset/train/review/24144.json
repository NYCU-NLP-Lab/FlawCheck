New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was one of 25 men arrested in February 2019, accused of soliciting sex there in a sweeping, human-trafficking sting that targeted that site and others.", "Kraft, a self-described friend of Trump, faces two counts of misdemeanor solicitation, to which he has pleaded not guilty.", "Yang no longer owns the establishment in which police say Kraft was caught on camera paying for sex. She has not been charged with a crime.", "Nevertheless, the images of Yang, Trump and members of his family were picked up and used to create an inaccurate meme claiming she is the spa's owner, which was shared with the nearly 8 million followers on the Facebook page belonging to Occupy Democrats on 8 March 2019.\nAlthough the Occupy Democrats Facebook page sarcastically discourages followers to share the meme, its administrators also added a \"correction\" in the post above the image:", "Yang was swept into the lurid story after images of her with Trump and his family members surfaced on her Facebook page, which, as the Miami Herald reported, \"raised questions about who can gain access to the president at his resorts and other private businesses, as well at official venues like fundraisers.\"", "Some news stories linked Yang to the day spa raided by police by describing her as the \"founder,\" although when the site changed ownership in 2012, its name also changed.", "Yang sold the business, which at the time was called the Tokyo Day Spa, to Hua Zhang, who changed the name of the establishment to Orchids of Asia upon incorporation in 2012, according to Florida state business records.
