["About this rating", "On 25 May 2006, the U.S. Senate, by a 62-36 bipartisan vote, passed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (CIRA) \u2014 a controversial bill which proponents touted as providing comprehensive and humane immigration reform, and which opponents criticized as unfairly rewarding \"illegal aliens\" by allowing them to obtain legal status.", "On 18 May 2006, while the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act was still under consideration, Senator John Ensign of Nevada proposed an amendment to the bill to \"ensure that persons who receive an adjustment of status under [the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act] are not able to receive Social Security benefits as a result of unlawful activity.\" The crux of Senator Ensign's argument was that immigrants who had entered and worked in the U.S. \"illegally\" and paid into the Social Security system using fraudulently-obtained Social Security numbers should not be allowed to receive credit for those payments:", "[Illegal immigrants] paid into the system simply because that was the price to pay to get a job in the United States. The immigrant knew they were using an illegal Social Security number but without regards of the impact of the victim. I have reviewed case after case related to identity theft and Social Security fraud. These cases are occurring all over the United States. In every case, in every State, where someone's Social Security number was stolen by an illegal immigrant to use to find work, the victim's credit history is destroyed. Sometimes their work history is too. Earlier I talked about Caleb, a gentleman in Nevada. The illegal immigrant who used Caleb's Social Security number was not trying to harm that person but he did. Caleb applied for unemployment but couldn't get it because the agency said he was working when, in fact, he wasn't. He lives in Reno. They said he was working in Las Vegas. It was an illegal immigrant using his Social Security number in Las Vegas.", "I never said this amendment is going to prevent identity theft. What I have said is that it is not right for somebody to steal somebody else's identity \u2014 granted for the noble purpose of getting a job \u2014 and reward the theft by giving work credit that counts towards Social Security. We should consider the victims who are forced to deal with the terrible consequences of the crime.", "The Senate vote on this amendment is what is reproduced in this email:", "THESE ARE THE SENATORS WHO VOTED TO GIVE ILLEGAL ALIENS SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. REGARDLESS OF POLITICAL PARTY, THESE POLITICIANS NEED TO BE DEFEATED IN 2006, 2008 OR 2010 WHENEVER THEY COME UP FOR OFFICE. SEND THIS TO ANYONE YOU KNOW IN ANY OF THE STATES LISTED. THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES NEED TO KNOW THIS INFORMATION. THAT IS UNLESS THEY DO NOT MIND SHARING THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY WITH FOREIGN WORKERS WHEN AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE BEING LEFT OUT.", "Grouped by Home State:", "Alabama:\nAlaska: Stevens (R-AK), Yea\nArizona: McCain (R-AZ), Yea\nArkansas: Lincoln (D-AR), Yea Pryor (D-AR), Yea\nCalifornia: Boxer (D-CA), Yea Feinstein (D-CA), Yea\nColorado: Salazar (D-CO), Yea\nConnecticut: Dodd (D-CT), Yea Lieberman (D-CT), Yea\nDelaware: Biden (D-DE), Yea Carper (D-DE), Yea\nFlorida: Martinez (R-FL), Yea\nGeorgia:\nHawaii: Akaka (D-HI), Yea Inouye (D-HI), Yea\nIdaho:\nIllinois: Durbin (D-IL), Yea Obama (D-IL), Yea\nIndiana: Bayh (D-IN), Yea Lugar (R-IN), Yea\nIowa: Harkin (D-IA), Yea\nKansas: Brownback (R-KS), Yea\nKentucky:\nLouisiana: Landrieu (D-LA), Yea\nMaine:\nMaryland: Mikulski (D-MD), Yea Sarbanes (D-MD), Yea\nMassachusetts: Kennedy (D-MA), Yea Kerry (D-MA), Yea\nMichigan: Levin (D-MI), Yea Stabenow (D-MI), Yea\nMinnesota:\nMississippi:\nMissouri:\nMontana: Baucus (D-MT), Yea\nNebraska: Hagel (R-NE), Yea\nNevada: Reid (D-NV), Yea\nNew Hampshire:\nNew Jersey: Lautenberg (D-NJ), Yea Menendez (D-NJ), Yea\nNew Mexico: Bingaman (D-NM), Yea\nNew York: Clinton (D-NY), Yea Schumer (D-NY), Yea\nNorth Carolina:\nNorth Dakota: Dorgan (D-ND), Yea\nOhio: DeWine (R-OH), Yea Voinovich (R-OH), Yea\nOklahoma:\nOregon: Wyden (D-OR), Yea\nPennsylvania: Specter (R-PA), Yea\nRhode Island: Chafee (R-RI), Yea Reed (D-RI), Yea\nSouth Carolina: Graham (R-SC), Yea\nSouth Dakota: Johnson (D-SD), Yea\nTennessee:\nTexas:\nUtah:\nVermont: Jeffords (I-VT), Yea Leahy (D-VT), Yea\nVirginia:\nWashington: Cantwell (D-WA), Yea Murray (D-WA), Yea\nWest Virginia: Rockefeller (D-WV), Not Voting\nWisconsin: Feingold (D-WI), Yea Kohl (D-WI), Yea\nWyoming:", "Although the message's text accurately reflects the roll call vote that took place, the accuracy of its characterization of those senators who voted \"Yea\" as voting \"to give 'illegal aliens' Social Security benefits\" is not accurate for a number of reasons:", "In a nutshell, the amendment referenced above wasn't about \"giving 'illegal aliens' Social Security benefits\"; it was about whether formerly \"illegal aliens\" (who had since become legal) should be credited for monies they themselves had paid into the Social Security fund while they were in the U.S. \"illegally.\" The senators listed above did not vote in favor of this proposition; they voted to withdraw the amendment from consideration.", "109th Congress. \"S.2611 - Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Congress.gov. 2005-2006.", "109th Congress. \"Roll Call Vote 109th Congress - 2nd Session.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Senate.gov. 2006.", "C-SPAN. \"C-SPAN Congressional Glossary.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0C-SPAN.org.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
