["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on May 17, 2018", "Q: Did House Speaker Paul Ryan break campaign finance laws in a meeting with donor Sheldon Adelson?", "A: He met with Adelson (which is legal), but there\u2019s no evidence he solicited a $30 million donation for a Republican super PAC (which would be illegal).", "House Speaker Paul Ryan was at a recent meeting where casino mogul and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson agreed to give $30 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a conservative super PAC.", "Ryan didn\u2019t ask for the donation \u2014 he actually left the room while someone else made the request \u2014 a spokeswoman for the CLF confirmed. If that\u2019s what happened, it\u2019s not a violation of campaign finance laws.", "But a left-leaning website called Opposition Report\u00a0posted an item that is circulating on Facebook with the headline: \u201cBREAKING: Paul Ryan BUSTED In Corruption Scheme With Top Donor.\u201d It was copied and posted by at least two other sites the next day.", "The story, which Facebook users flagged as potentially false, says: \u201cSpeaker of the House, Paul Ryan, broke campaign finance laws.\u201d But it offers no evidence to support that claim.", "The Congressional Leadership Fund is a so-called \u201cnonconnected PAC,\u201d which means it is not a party committee. It may receive\u00a0unlimited contributions, while national party committees are limited to accepting $33,900 per year from individual contributors. The official House Republican committee is called the National Republican Congressional Committee.", "It\u2019s not unusual for high-ranking federal officeholders, such as Ryan, to meet with big donors to friendly super PACs.\u00a0That\u2019s legal as long as they don\u2019t actually solicit contributions over the thresholds set in\u00a0the federal election law\u00a0for individual contributions to traditional PACs \u2014 which currently is $5,000 from individuals, as explained on the Federal Election Commission website.", "\u201cThe classic example is a fundraiser,\u201d said Lawrence Noble, former general counsel to the FEC and senior director of The Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan organization that deals with election law and campaign finance issues.", "Noble said federal lawmakers can attend super PAC events that raise donations far beyond those caps, as long as they aren\u2019t the ones who actually ask for the money. That\u2019s when those who aren\u2019t in office step in and request the donations.", "Other experts agreed.", "They all pointed to a 2011 FEC advisory opinion\u00a0that said officeholders cannot solicit unlimited funds, but they can \u201cattend, speak at, or be featured guests at fundraisers for the Committees, at which unlimited individual, corporate, and labor organization contributions will be solicited.\u201d", "The Opposition Report describes that kind of situation with Ryan being present for the meeting and then leaving when the donation is requested. But it concludes, \u201cThis is disgusting, and \u2014 once again \u2014 not legal.\u201d But it is legal.", "We asked Ryan\u2019s office for comment, and it referred us to his fundraising committee, Team Ryan, which provided us with his recent answer to a reporter about the incident. Here\u2019s the exchange:", "Bill Glauber, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Congressman Sensenbrenner discussed how good a fundraiser you are. You took that trip to Nevada to meet with Adelson when there was a $30 million ask, not made by you, what do you tell people about the ethics of the fundraising and how it works, because it has gotten some criticism.", "Ryan:\u00a0Look, we follow the rules extremely carefully, and in that case we did. And I think a lot of Americans realize that our majority is at stake. The midterm elections are not good for majority parties, historically speaking. On average, the president\u2019s party in the first midterm loses about 32 seats, we have a 24-seat majority. So I think people understand that the historic trend does not (inaudible) the majority party, and what we\u2019re trying to do is make the case to people around the country that this is a majority worth supporting. With respect to the campaign finance issues, we do it by the book, always have, always will.", "Ryan and the Republicans are counting on the Congressional Leadership Fund to help the party retain its majority in the House.\u00a0In 2016, the super PAC\u00a0raised almost $51.1 million\u00a0and\u00a0made more than $40 million\u00a0in independent expenditures \u2013 such as TV ads that advocate for the defeat or election of particular candidates. Its\u00a0largest individual donors in 2016\u00a0were Adelson and his wife, Miriam, who contributed $20 million to the group.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Clarification, June 6: We changed the headline and clarified the short answer and one line in this story to make it clear that there\u2019s no evidence that Ryan violated campaign finance laws.", "Sherman, Jake and Alex Isenstadt. \u201cSheldon Adelson kicks in $30M to stop Democratic House takeover.\u201d Politico. 10 May 2018.", "Alexander, Courtney.
