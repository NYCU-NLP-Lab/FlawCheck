["An article on the site Best Folk Medicine, posted on Facebook on 3 April 2019, claims bits of raw onion worn in socks while you sleep will \u201ccure your diseases overnight\u201d.", "It says putting slices of onion on your feet is one of \u201cthe most popular ancient remedies\u201d.", "\u201cAccording to folk medicine proponents, attaching a slice of onion onto the feet and leaving it overnight may be effective in reducing the symptoms of fever and cold. Also, it may encourage the removal of toxins from the body.\u201d", "The article claims \u201cthe foot has more than 7,000 nerve endings\u201d that are \u201cassociated with other body areas like the heart, sinuses, and brain\u201d. Putting onions on the feet means \u201ctheir health benefits are quickly dispersed throughout important organs in a short amount of time\u201d.", "A 2013 report on Best Food Facts asked Dr Ruth MacDonald, the chair and professor of the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at Iowa State University in the US, if onions cured illness.", "\u201cOnions... are slightly acidic, which could have antibacterial effects,\u201d she said. \u201cBut these are much less effective than bleach or chemical antibiotics. Eating these vegetables provides antioxidants that can have health benefits, but they are unlikely to prevent or cure disease.\u201d", "In 2018 Liveaboutdotcom reported that \u201cthe claim that onions are \u2018toxin absorbers\u2019 is pseudo-scientific nonsense\u201d.", "\u201cWe have not found a single scientific source stating that onions absorb \u2018toxins\u2019 of any kind, much less those specifically related to diseases,\u201d the report said.", "US fact-checking site Snopes has also researched the claim, and rated it false. \u201cThe topical application of some chemicals in onions could kill bacteria externally,\u201d Snopes says. But sticking onions on your feet will not create \u201cany change to the internal systems of one\u2019s body, as claimed\u201d.", "Snopes concludes: \u201cThe evidence presented to support this fairly outlandish notion is either false or misleading, and we cannot find any plausible mechanism for a raw cut onion stuffed in your sock to reduce any disease.\u201d", "And a 2017 Medical News Today report says the claim is \u201cbased on anecdote rather than research\u201d.", "Another common claim is that a cut raw onion left in a room will remove toxins from the air.", "But the US National Onion Association says this is a folk tale \u201cthat dates back as far as 1500s\u201d. The thinking was that \u201cplacing a cut raw onion in rooms throughout a residence could protect its occupants from getting the bubonic plague\u201d.", "Before germs were discovered, \u201cthe dominant belief was that contagious diseases were spread by \u2018noxious\u2019 air. While false, this belief maintained part of folk medicine,\u201d the association says.", "Onions do have health benefits, the NOA says. \u201cOnions are high in vitamin C and are a good source of fibre and other key nutrients. Onions are fat free and low in calories, yet add abundant flavour to a wide variety of foods.\u201d", "Hoax-Slayer also advises that \u201cstrapping an onion to your foot certainly will not take away your illness\u201d and \u201cleaving cut onion around the room won\u2019t do the trick\u201d either.", "\u201cOnions may indeed have some properties beneficial to your health, but to reap such benefits, you actually have to eat them.\u201d - Taryn Willows (04/06/19)", "Please complete this form to receive the HTML sharing code.", "A fact-checker has rated your Facebook or Instagram post as \u201cfalse\u201d, \u201caltered\u201d, \u201cpartly false\u201d or \u201cmissing context\u201d.
