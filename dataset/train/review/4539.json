Two other speeches are also rumored to be in circulation. This is the full transcript. Secretary Clinton received $225,000 for this speech.", "HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Lloyd [Blankfein], and thanks to everyone at Goldman Sachs for welcoming me today. I\u2019m delighted to be back among friends, colleagues, collaborators, supporters, kindred spirits\u2026", "Let me jump right in.

It\u2019s not \u201cdelivering\u201d the way that they feel it should, that they feel entitled to. Most Americans that you speak to, speak a populist rhetoric that claims it is stacked for those at the top, that those of you here have it too good.", "(Laughter)", "But we know the hopes that the little people have for their future \u2014 things like school, job, food, clothing on their backs\u2013 all of those little things would not be possible without your leadership and innovation.", "Several publications,\u00a0such as\u00a0BSNews, CounterPunch,\u00a0and\u00a0Dissident Voice, lent credence to the\u00a0transcripts when they published them in full.\u00a0These web sites all attributed its\u00a0text to author K.J.

We pride ourselves on covering the news stories the corporate media won\u2019t dare touch.
