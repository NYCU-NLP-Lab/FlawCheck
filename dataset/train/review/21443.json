["About this rating", "In a May 2017 interview, President Trump hypothesized that President Andrew Jackson (1829-37) could have prevented the Civil War if he had been President at the time the war broke out (1861), and Trump went on to wonder aloud why the issues leading up to the war could not have been \"worked out.\" Those comments led to renewed interest in a 2015 news item about an historically inaccurate Civil War monument put up on a Trump-owned golf course:", "You can't make this stuff up: Trump commemorated at his Virginia golf course a Civil War battle that never happened https://t.co/Wzfz7REjK8 pic.twitter.com/KelWs1Q71t", "\u2014 Justin Miller (@justinjm1) May 2, 2017", "On 2 May 2017, \u00a0Golf Digest republished a 2015 article on this subject drawn largely from a New York Times article reporting that after Trump bought the Lowes Island golf course in Virginia in 2009, he installed a plaque commemorating a Civil War \"River of Blood\" slaughter on the banks of the Potomac River, a battle that historians said never took place:", "Mr. Trump also upgraded [the golf course's] place in history.", "Between the 14th hole and the 15th tee of one of the club\u2019s two courses, Mr. Trump installed a flagpole on a stone pedestal overlooking the Potomac, to which he affixed a plaque purportedly designating \u201cThe River of Blood.\u201d", "\u201cMany great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot,\u201d the inscription reads. \u201cThe casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as \u2018The River of Blood.\u2019 \u201d", "The inscription, beneath his family crest and above Mr. Trump\u2019s full name, concludes: \u201cIt is my great honor to have preserved this important section of the Potomac River!\u201d", "Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s claims, the inscription was evidently not fact-checked.", "\u201cNo. Uh-uh. No way. Nothing like that ever happened there,\u201d said Richard Gillespie, the executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association, a historical preservation and education group devoted to an 1,800-square-mile section of the Northern Virginia Piedmont, including the Lowes Island site.", "\u201cThe only thing that was remotely close to that,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said, was 11 miles up the river at the Battle of Ball\u2019s Bluff in 1861, a rout of Union forces in which several hundred were killed. \u201cThe River of Blood?\u201d he added. \u201cNope, not there.\u201d", "Mr. Gillespie\u2019s contradiction of the plaque\u2019s account was seconded by Alana Blumenthal, the curator of the Loudoun Museum in nearby Leesburg. (A third local expert, who said he had written to Mr. Trump\u2019s company about the inscription\u2019s falsehoods and offered to provide historically valid replacement text, insisted on anonymity because he did not want to cross the Trump Organization by disclosing a private exchange.)", "When the Times contacted Trump for a response, he was typically defensive while providing no useful information to back up what was stated on the Civil War plaque:", "\u201cHow would they know that?\u201d Mr. Trump asked when told that local historians had called his plaque a fiction. \u201cWere they there?\u201d", "Mr. Trump repeatedly said that \u201cnumerous historians\u201d had told him that the golf club site was known as the River of Blood. But he said he did not remember their names.", "Then he said the historians had spoken not to him but to \u201cmy people.\u201d But he refused to identify any [employees] who might still possess the historians\u2019 names.", "\u201cWrite your story the way you want to write it,\u201d Mr. Trump said finally, when pressed unsuccessfully for anything that could corroborate his claim. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk to anybody. It doesn\u2019t make any difference. But many people were shot.
