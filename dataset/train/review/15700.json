["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on April 6, 2017 | Updated on April 7, 2017", "Supporters of Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination describe him as a \u201cmainstream judge.\u201d Their evidence: He has sided nearly 99 percent of the time with the majority on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and 97 percent of the court\u2019s rulings were unanimous.", "But those statistics are not unusual and provide no insight into how Gorsuch may rule as a justice on the high court.", "The \u201cvast majority\u201d of federal appeals court cases are \u201cdecided without dissent,\u201d and the 10th Circuit \u201cis no exception to this general trend,\u201d the\u00a0nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in an analysis of Gorsuch\u2019s record.", "The CRS report\u00a0said 2.54 percent of the opinions issued by the 10th Circuit from 1998 to 2009 included a written dissent, citing a\u00a02010 paper in the Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review that reviewed the opinions of six\u00a0circuit courts. That paper found the 3rd Circuit (2.33 percent) and the 5th Circuit (1.14 percent) had lower dissent rates than the 10th Circuit.", "As for Gorsuch, the CRS calculated the percentage of written dissents among seven judges on the 10th Circuit, and found that Gorsuch \u201cdisplayed relatively more willingness to dissent from others\u2019 majority opinions\u00a0than some colleagues.\u201d Gorsuch\u2019s rate of dissent of 1.6 percent \u201cplaces him in the middle\u201d among his colleagues.", "Christopher A. Cotropia, who authored the 2010 paper cited by the CRS, told us that the dissent rates for Gorsuch and his court say more about how federal appeals courts work than how Gorsuch may rule on the Supreme Court.", "\u201cHe\u2019s doing what most appellate court judges do,\u201d Cotropia, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not instructive as to what he will do when he is one of nine [on the Supreme Court].\u201d", "Cotropia illustrated his point by determining the dissent rates for two associate justices,\u00a0Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Sonia Sotomayor, who previously had served on circuit courts. Alito had a 1.6 percent dissent rate on the 3rd Circuit Court and Sotomayor had a 0.69 percent dissent rate on the 2nd Circuit. Nevertheless, the judges are on opposite extremes of the court. By one measure,\u00a0Sotomayor is the most liberal of the Supreme Court justices and Alito is the second most conservative.", "President Donald Trump\u2019s selection of Gorsuch\u00a0in late January to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u00a0has set off a historic partisan battle in the Senate. That battle came to a head on April 6, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell invoked the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d to advance Gorsuch\u2019s nomination.", "Unable to muster the 60 votes needed to end a Democratic filibuster, McConnell changed the Senate rules to allow a simple majority of 51 votes to end the filibuster. The Senate is now expected to confirm Gorsuch\u2019s nomination April 7 by a simple majority. The Republicans control 52 Senate seats.", "Throughout the contentious confirmation process, the White House and Republicans\u00a0described Gorsuch as \u201cmainstream,\u201d while Democrats have\u00a0criticized him\u00a0as \u201cextreme.\u201d Those are subjective terms, and each side is entitled to its opinion.", "What caught our attention is Republicans\u2019 repeated use of the same statistics as evidence of Gorsuch\u2019s \u201cmainstream\u201d judicial record.", "When the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Gorsuch\u2019s nomination on April 3 along party lines, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said that Gorsuch\u2019s record on the federal appeals court \u201cfalls well within the mainstream.\u201d", "Grassley, April 3:\u00a0In the 10 years since, his record on the bench has proved that the judge falls well within the mainstream. He\u2019s participated in 2,700 cases. He\u2019s voted with a majority 99 percent of the time, and roughly 97 percent of those 2,700 cases were decided unanimously.", "In a blog item posted April 4, the White House used the same statistics to describe Gorsuch as \u201cthe ultimate example of a mainstream judge.\u201d The blog item said, \u201cIn the more than 2,700 cases he has participated in on the 10th Circuit, 97 percent of them have been unanimously decided and he was in the majority 99 percent of the time.\u201d", "Two days earlier on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Senate Majority Leader McConnell\u00a0gave\u00a0a truncated version of the GOP talking point: \u201cIn the majority, 99 percent of the time. Ninety-seven percent of his rulings were unanimous.\u201d", "Gorsuch himself repeatedly cited the statistics during his confirmation hearings. On March 22, Gorsuch described the 10th Circuit Court\u2019s low dissent rate as \u201can amazing accomplishment.\u201d", "Gorsuch, March 22: And even then of those over the last 10 years we\u2019ve been unanimous 97 percent of the time in the cases I\u2019ve participated in. That\u2019s a wonder. That\u2019s an amazing accomplishment.", "But such high rates of unanimity are not unusual for the federal courts of appeals, as the Congressional Research Service explained in its report\u00a0on Gorsuch\u2019s record.", "CRS, March 8: Federal appellate judges are bound by Supreme Court and circuit precedent and, therefore, are not normally in a position to espouse freely their views on particular legal issues in the context of their judicial opinions. Moreover, unlike the Supreme Court, which enjoys \u201calmost complete discretion\u201d in selecting its cases, the federal courts of appeals are required to hear many cases as a matter of law. As a result, the appellate courts consider \u201cmany routine cases in which the legal rules are uncontroverted.\u201d Perhaps indicative of the nature of federal appellate work, the vast majority of cases decided by three-judge panels of federal courts of appeals are decided without dissent. The Tenth Circuit, where Judge Gorsuch serves, is no exception to this general trend, with the overwhelming majority of opinions issued by that court being unanimous.", "In footnotes, the CRS cites a book by law professor Frank B. Cross of the University of Texas Law School, \u201cDecision Making in the U.S. Courts of Appeals,\u201d which notes the \u201crelative paucity of circuit court panel dissents.\u201d The CRS also cited Cotropia\u2019s paper, \u201cDetermining Uniformity Within the Federal Circuit by Measuring Dissent and En Banc Review,\u201d noting that it found \u201cfrom 1998 to 2009, 2.54% of the opinions issued by the Tenth Circuit included a dissent.\u201d As we said, two of the six courts that Cotropia reviewed had lower percentages than the 10th Circuit.", "Cotropia said the nature of how federal appeals courts work explains the lack of dissents. Unlike the Supreme Court, which can pick and choose its cases, the appeals court must take all appeals and \u201ca lot of cases are just slam dunks,\u201d he said. Because it must take all cases, the appeals court also has a heavy workload and part of the job is \u201cjust keeping the trains running.\u201d Also, he said, appeals court dissents are not cited often, but \u201ca Supreme Court dissent carries a lot more weight.\u201d", "In fact,\u00a0Gorsuch himself in delivering the Thirteenth Annual Barbara K. Olson Memorial Lecture at the Federalist Society said the 10th Circuit\u2019s high percentage of unanimous rulings is \u201cpretty typical.\u201d", "\u201cOver 90 percent of the decisions issued by my court are unanimous; that\u2019s pretty typical of the federal appellate courts,\u201d Gorsuch said in his speech, which was reprinted in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy.", "As for Gorsuch, this is what the CRS reported:", "\u201cJudge Gorsuch\u2019s rate of dissent is pretty much on the mean with other circuits and judges I have looked at,\u201d Cotropia told us. \u201cHe is certainly not the lowest, but he does not reach the higher end as well. I don\u2019t know that it tells us much at all.\u201d", "CRS also provides this word of caution about appeals court judges who join in majority opinions.", "CRS, March 8:\u00a0The act of joining an opinion authored by another judge does not necessarily reflect full agreement with the underlying opinion. For example, in an effort to promote consensus on a court, some judges will decline to dissent unless the underlying issue is particularly contentious. As one commentator notes, \u201c[T]he fact that a judge joins in a majority opinion may not be taken as indicating complete agreement. Rather, silent acquiescence may be understood to mean something more like \u2018I accept the outcome in this case, and I accept that the reasoning in the majority opinion reflects what a majority of my colleagues has agreed on.\u2019\u201d", "Despite these caveats about the relative meaning of dissent rates, we have found that senators on both sides of the aisle have cited such statistics over the years when supporting their party\u2019s Supreme Court nominees.", "During the 2006 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Samuel A. Alito Jr., Grassley and Sen. Orrin Hatch told Alito that he had a dissent rate of 1.6 percent of cases that he decided on the 3rd Circuit.", "Grassley, Jan. 11, 2006: I recall from reading a synopsis of your opinions, and the reality is, as I see it, you don\u2019t disagree with majority opinions more frequently than most Federal appeals judges do in similar cases. And of more than 4,800 cases\u2014and that we got from the Washington Post. But of more than 4,800 cases that you decided during your tenure on the Third Circuit, you dissented only in 79 cases, which would be only 1.6 percent of all those cases.", "Hatch, Jan. 11, 2006:\u00a0Well, would it surprise you to know that you have dissented only 79 times in nearly 5,000 cases in which you have participated? That comes to about 1.6 percent, which is considerably lower than most others who have been on the appellate courts.", "Cotropia, the University of Richmond law professor, confirmed Alito\u2019s 1.6 percent dissent rate\u00a0for us using the same method that the CRS used to calculate the rate for Gorsuch. Cotropia found that Alito had authored 82 dissents on 5,192 majority opinions.", "(Technical note: Unlike the CRS, Cotropia did not exclude recusals by Alito. But he said that would be such a small number as to have zero effect on Alito\u2019s dissent rate.)", "During the confirmation hearings for Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer also touted Sotomayor\u2019s low dissent rate, except he focused on the few times that Sotomayor disagreed with Republican-appointed judges.", "Schumer said Sotomayor\u2019s \u201crecord shows that she is in the mainstream\u201d because she \u201chas agreed with Republican colleagues 95 percent of the time\u201d on the 2nd Circuit.", "Republican Sen. Hatch acknowledged the Democratic talking point on her agreement with Republican-appointed judges \u2014 \u201cfor which I congratulate her,\u201d he said. But Hatch added that many of the Democrats who cited that statistic in praise of Sotomayor\u2019s \u201cmainstream\u201d record also opposed Alito \u201ceven though he had voted with his Democrat-appointed Third Circuit colleagues 99 percent of the time during a more longer appeals court career.\u201d", "Cotropia told us that actually Sotomayor had a lower overall dissent rate than either Alito or Gorsuch. He found she issued 25 written dissents out of 3,641 opinions for a rate of just 0.69 percent.", "Sotomayor and Alito are good examples of how federal appeals judges \u201cdissent more as justices on the Supreme Court,\u201d he said.", "Using the Supreme Court database\u00a0maintained by the Washington University School of Law, Cotropia found that Alito\u00a0has a Supreme Court dissent rate of 17.25 percent (124 dissents in 719 rulings) and Sotomayor has a 17.95 percent rate (84 dissents out of 468 rulings).", "We also note that, as of the 2015 term, Sotomayor is the most liberal of the Supreme Court justices and Alito is the second most conservative, according to a 2016 study co-authored by Lee Epstein, the co-director of the Center for Empirical Research in the Law\u00a0at the Washington University School of Law. Her study, \u201cPresident-Elect Trump and his Possible Justices,\u201d compared the judges on Trump\u2019s list of Supreme Court candidates to sitting justices. For current justices, Epstein\u2019s study used Martin-Quinn scores, which measure the relative location of current U.S. Supreme Court justices on an ideological scale based on their voting patterns.", "\u201cThese judges, even with low dissent when judging on the appeals court, show their ideology when they go to the Supreme Court,\u201d Cotropia said.", "That same study projects\u00a0Gorsuch \u2014 once confirmed to the Supreme Court, as expected \u2014 would fall \u201cwithin the Alito-Scalia ideological range\u201d and to the right of Alito.", "We take no position on Gorsuch\u2019s nomination or whether he is \u201cmainstream\u201d or not. What we have found, though, is that a circuit court judge\u2019s overall dissent rate isn\u2019t useful in determining a nominee\u2019s ideology.", "Updated, April 7: The Senate confirmed Gorsuch,\u00a054 to 45, on April 7. Three Democratic senators \u2014 Joe Manchin, Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly \u2014 joined the GOP majority to approve the nomination.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
