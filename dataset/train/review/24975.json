In fact, the system is purged of test results once the testing phase is finished, complete with a \"zero report\" to confirm purging, according to instruction No. 10\u00a0in Logic & Accuracy Testing.\u00a0Per instruction\u00a0No. 12, the tested equipment then should be secured until Election Day.

The claim does not address a litany of debunked accusations against the company or a caution from the original\u00a0social media post that a Dominion Voting machine manual is not evidence of fraud. It is true that Dominion Voting machines create ballots, for testing, audits and after a voter has voted and approves the ballot creation. But assertions that machines can be hacked, votes were dumped and test ballots can be counted\u00a0are false. The federal government and election experts discovered no election fraud on the part of Dominion Voting Systems or its voting machines.", "Contributing: The Associated Press", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
