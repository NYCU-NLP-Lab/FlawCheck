However, he cautioned, this approach should be considered \"an absolute last strategy.\"", "Tom Discenna, a professor of communication and president of the faculty union, noted that the idea was based on just \"having something, a reminder that you\u2019re not powerless and you\u2019re not helpless in the classroom.\"", "The pucks distributed on campus also bore numbers that allowed users to contribute to a separate fundraising campaign for the purchase of interior locks for Oakland classrooms.", "We contacted the university seeking an update on the campaign without response, but at least some students expressed skepticism about using pucks against prospective shooters.", "\"If I was to give you a puck, and I had a gun, would I be able to take you out? Easily, yeah,\" said Jacob Gora, a senior. \"I mean, a puck is not going to distract me or stop me from shooting someone.\"", "Zaniewski, Ann. \u00a0 \"Oakland University Using Hockey Pucks to Protect Against Active Shooters.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Detroit Free Press. \u00a0 27 November 2018.", "\"OU Professors Trained to Fight Active Shooters Using Hockey Pucks.\" \u00a0 YouTube (uploaded by WXYZ-TV).  \r\n\u00a0  \u00a0  27 November 2018. \u00a0 https://youtu.be/-Wqv28HhUug", "Arturo Garcia is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
