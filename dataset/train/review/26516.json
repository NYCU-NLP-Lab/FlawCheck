["About this rating", "On Sept. 15, 2020, a message claiming that the restaurant chain McDonald's had removed American flags from its premises nationwide in order to support antifa and the Black Lives Matter movement started to circulate on Twitter.\u00a0 The message appears to have been made up out of whole cloth by the Twitter account @Ron4Trump38 before it was copy and pasted by a variety of pages across Facebook:", "This is a baseless and false claim.", "For starters, it is simply nonsensical. Removing an American flag would not \"support\" the Black Lives Matter movement or antifa as neither of these groups are anti-America. The Black Lives Matter movement is primarily fighting against racism and police brutality, and those who identify with the antifa ideology (antifa is short for anti-fascism) are primarily fighting against a rise in white supremacy and Nazi ideologies.", "Furthermore, this claim is completely evidence free. There have been no recent news reports about McDonald's locations removing their American flags in order to show support for Black Lives Matter or antifa. When we reached out to McDonald's, the company told us simply that \"these rumors are not true.\"", "McDonald's has previously shown support for equality and social justice. In June, McDonald's tweeted a message naming several Black people who had been victims of police violence along with the message, \"They were all one of us\":", "While McDonald's has expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement, they have not removed American flags from their stores nationwide in order to do so.", "The company said in a statement: \"McDonald\u2019s unequivocally stands behind the need for equality and social justice, and these rumors are not true.\u201d", "Zhang, Jenny. \u00a0 \"In This Time of Social Change, Can a Brand Also Be an Ally?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Eater. \u00a0 12 June 2020.", "Porterfield, Carlie. \u00a0 \"White Supremacist Terrorism \u2018On The Rise And Spreading\u2019.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Forbes. \u00a0 4 July 2020.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
