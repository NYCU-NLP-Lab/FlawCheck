Within a day of the initial message, the Edinburgh zoo commented directly on the tweet, confirming certain users\u2019 doubts that the information was in fact false.", "We're sure this will come as a disappointment to many but there is no such position here at Edinburgh Zoo ?", "The Edinburgh zoo is also home to more than 130 penguins, not 38, as the tweet suggest. They can be seen at all times via the Edinburgh zoo\u2019s live penguin cam, available here.", "The Edinburgh zoo also addressed the more general myth that penguins in Antarctica topple upon watching airplanes, sometimes causing their death.", "It's a very popular rumour, but penguins do not track planes as they fly overhead.
