["On April 28, conservative commentator and political activist Candace Owens accused the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of\u00a0misreporting flu deaths.", "\u201cAccording to CDC reports \u2013 2020 is working out to be the lowest flu death season of the decade,\u201d she posted on\u00a0Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle!\u201d", "Owens posted a photo of a tweet she\u2019d written the same day alongside her comment.", "\u201cPossibly the greatest trade deal ever inked was between the flu virus and #coronavirus,\u201d\u00a0she tweeted. \u201cSo glad nobody is dying of the flu anymore, and therefore the CDC has abruptly decided to stop calculating flu deaths altogether.\u201d", "Some Facebook and Twitter users questioned the validity of Owens' statistics. Others read between the lines of her sarcasm to comment on what she may be implying.", "\u201cNot just lowest flu death, but also cancer deaths, diabetes deaths, heart disease deaths, and many other know(n) diseases,\u201d one Facebook user wrote. \u201cWhen hospitals are guaranteed payment from the federal government if it is classified as covid19 hospitalization, it becomes a business plan.\u201d", "According to\u00a0CDC\u00a0data, none of Owens\u2019 statistics is\u00a0correct.", "Owens did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.", "The CDC uses mathematical estimates to retroactively measure the burden of each flu season.\u00a0\u201cThe model uses a ratio of deaths-to-hospitalizations in order to estimate the total influenza-associated deaths from the estimated number of influenza-associated hospitalizations,\u201d the CDC states, describing\u00a0its methodology.", "This in-hospital mortality FluSurv-NET data is the basis from which larger, annual estimates are made. This data excludes all influenza-associated deaths that are\u00a0misdiagnosed or occur outside a hospital.", "After each flu season, the CDC considers in-hospital death data\u00a0and investigates death certificates to account for the total flu deaths. \u201c(B)ecause not all deaths related to influenza occur in the hospital, we use death certificate data to estimate how likely deaths are to occur outside the hospital,\u201d the CDC website explains.", "Flu seasons vary from year to year and don't have a strict timeline. Last year, flu season was the longest in a decade, lasting 21 weeks.", "\u201cIn the United States, flu season occurs in the fall and winter. While influenza viruses circulate year-round, most of the time flu activity\u00a0peaks\u00a0between December and February, but activity can last as late as May,\" the CDC website\u00a0explains.", "To account for this ambiguous period the CDC releases weekly U.S. influenza summary updates from October through May.", "According to the CDC\u2019s 2018-2019 estimates, there were 34,200 influenza-associated deaths from October 2018 to May 2019 \u2013 not 80,000 as Owens claimed on Facebook.", "The CDC estimated 61,000 influenza-associated deaths in the 2017-2018 season.", "So where did Owens\u2019 80,000 statistic come from?", "For the\u00a0preliminary 2017-2018 season estimates the CDC approximated 79,400 influenza-associated deaths, which it later updated to 61,000 deaths and\u00a0archived for historical purposes.", "\"All estimates from the 2017-2018 influenza season are preliminary and may change as data from the season are cleaned and finalized,\" the CDC estimated disclosed.", "The National Foundation for Infectious Diseases estimated\u00a080,000 deaths for the same season. This NFID\u2019s estimate came from unpublished CDC data and used estimation methodology that the CDC has since altered for better accuracy.", "The NFID is a nonprofit \"dedicated to educating the public and healthcare professionals about the burden, causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases across the lifespan,\" its website states.", "The FluSurv-NET data for 2020 has not dipped after January as Owens claimed. It increased in February.", "The CDC reported fewer than 2,000\u00a0influenza-associated deaths in January \u2013 not 20,000 as Owens claimed. Since January, the CDC\u00a0reported more than 5,000 influenza-associated deaths \u2013 not 4,000, as claimed.", "Keep in mind, this data only accounts for the patients who died in a hospital from diagnosed influenza. The CDC\u2019s anticipated\u00a0estimates for the season will be much larger than the 7,000 documented cases so far.", "From October 2018 to May 2019 the FluSurv-NET data accounted for about 7,000 influenza-associated deaths, which CDC ultimately used to estimate 34,200 total deaths for the 2018-2019 flu season.", "FluSurv-NET data shows there have\u00a0been nearly as many influenza-associated deaths to date in 2020\u00a0as there were in all of 2019.", "This year\u2019s total will continue to rise as the U.S. enters the 2020-2021 flu season in October, but it\u2019s unlikely that increase will be significant\u00a0since the majority of annual flu seasons decrease\u00a0at the beginning of each year.", "The 2017-2018 flu season was the most deadly in the past decade with a CDC estimate of 61,000 deaths. The\u00a0FluSurv-NET data\u00a0for 2018 totaled\u00a0nearly 15,000 in-hospital\u00a0influenza-associated deaths.", "In the last decade, 2011-2012 was the least deadly, with 12,000 deaths, according to CDC data.", "The early FluSurv-NET data indicates that this 2019-2020 flu season\u00a0isn\u2019t shaping up to be the decade\u2019s most or least deadly.", "We rate the claim that the CDC has stopped reporting flu deaths because the death rates are so low as FALSE because it is not supported by our research. The CDC continues to report weekly on the 2020 influenza season. Its data\u00a0shows this season's rates are similar to rates of past years. Further, the rate of flu deaths\u00a0did not decrease in January, as stated, nor was the total number of deaths in 2018-19 as high as claimed."]
