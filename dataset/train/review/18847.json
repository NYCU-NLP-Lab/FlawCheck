Control of the Senate, where Republicans currently have a 50-48 edge, won\u2019t be known until after two Georgia runoff elections Jan. 5. Runoffs are being held because no candidate in either race on Nov. 3 captured more than 50% of the vote.", "Loeffler was appointed on an interim basis in December to replace GOP Sen.
