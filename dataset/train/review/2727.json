["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on October 10, 2017", "Q: Did a Teamsters strike hinder aid efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria?", "A: No. Stories claiming so misrepresented an actual quote from an Air Force colonel.", "Did the Teamsters strike in Puerto Rico hinder the supplies getting to those in need?", "Distribution of aid in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria wasn\u2019t delayed by a Teamsters strike, as has been widely circulated online.", "There was, in fact, no strike.", "The International Brotherhood of Teamsters issued a statement on Oct. 2 denouncing the claim.", "\u201cLet me be clear \u2013 Teamsters in Puerto Rico have been working on the relief efforts since day one,\u201d Alexis Rodriguez, the secretary-treasurer of the Teamsters in Puerto Rico, said in the statement. \u201cAnyone that has reported anything different is lying. Our only agenda is to help bring Puerto Rico back better and stronger.\u201d", "Half a dozen stories became popular on Facebook \u2014 and were flagged as suspicious by our readers and Facebook users \u2014 that claimed food, water and medicine had piled up at the ports instead of getting to victims of the hurricane because members of the Teamsters union hadn\u2019t been showing up to work.", "Several sites ran very similar stories, including the popular conservative outlet infowars.com, which used the headline: \u201cBOMBSHELL: DEMS/TEAMSTERS ORDER PUERTO RICAN STAND-DOWN TO EMBARRASS TRUMP.\u201d", "The stories were largely based on a HuffPost article that had quoted Col. Michael Valle, who is handling relief efforts on the island for the U.S. Air Force. The bogus stories, though, misrepresent what he said by using only partial quotes.", "For example, the stories correctly paraphrase Valle as saying that plenty of supplies \u2014 including generators, water, food, medicine, and fuel \u2014 had been sent to Puerto Rico and then they accurately cite his quote that says:", "\u201cIt\u2019s a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers. Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20% of the truck drivers show up to work.\u201d", "What the stories don\u2019t include, though, is what Valle said immediately after that, which is: \u201cThere should be zero blame on the drivers. They can\u2019t get to work, the infrastructure is destroyed, they can\u2019t get fuel themselves, and they can\u2019t call us for help because there\u2019s no communication. The will of the people of Puerto Rico is off the charts. The truck drivers have families to take care of, many of them have no food or water. They have to take care of their family\u2019s needs before they go off to work, and once they do go, they can\u2019t call home.\u201d", "That sentiment \u2014 that the condition of the roads and lack of fuel has hindered the relief effort \u2014 is backed up by statements from Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t just bring the commodities in, you have to be able to pump them down the roadway systems that we have been working desperately to get open,\u201d he said on Fox News on Oct. 1.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve opened up 11 major highways, but this morning there are over 3,200 different problems reported with the roadway systems \u2014 from bridges missing, to roads being blocked by flood waters, to roads just disappeared because of landslides,\u201d he said.", "Long emphasized later that day on ABC News that local support efforts in Puerto Rico have been slowed by the sheer magnitude of the disaster. \u201cThey got a hard hit,\u201d he said, explaining that the island was struck by not one, but two hurricanes in less than two weeks.", "Hurricane Irma tore through Puerto Rico on Sept. 6, and then Hurricane Maria followed on Sept. 20.", "\u201cA lot of the infrastructure was damaged by Irma,\u201d Long said on Fox News, \u201cthen Maria comes in and finishes it off completely.\u201d", "A website called The Conservative Treehouse\u00a0included the clip in its story with a caption that says, in English: \u201cPuerto Rican union leader won\u2019t let drivers go to work.\u201d", "But the clip\u2019s original caption\u00a0actually says: \u201cVictor Rodriguez of the Broad Front of Truck Drivers blames the governor that there is no diesel gas in the stations.\u201d We used Google Translate to get the English version of the original Spanish caption.", "In the days after Maria hit, there were major fuel shortages across the island. As of Oct. 10, 860 of the island\u2019s 1,100 gas stations were open, according to a website maintained by the Puerto Rican government.", "At no point in the video does Rodriguez say that there is a strike.", "And, according to Lauren Hartnett, a spokeswoman for Oxfam America, an aid agency that has been participating in Hurricane Maria relief in Puerto Rico, staff on the ground confirm that there is no truck drivers\u2019 strike. Rather, relief efforts have been stymied by a lack of local infrastructure and leadership from the top.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label viral\u00a0fake news\u00a0stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Teamsters Union.
