We have got to look at how we\u2019re doing our school finance system so that we can do right by the people in this state and have a fair and equitable system.\"", "We asked Watson\u2019s office how he arrived at his figure for how much average Austin homeowners are paying to schools elsewhere. By email, Kate Alexander said Watson relied on September 2016 testimony by the Austin school district\u2019s chief financial officer.", "According to Nicole Conley's prepared remarks for a Sept. 28, 2016, appearance at a joint hearing of the Texas House committees on appropriations and public education, Conley described the Austin school district as the state\u2019s largest single payer of recapture.", "\"Our payment alone comprises 13 percent of all state collections,\" Conley\u2019s testimony says. \"During the next five years\u2014between fiscal years 2016 and 2020\u2014Austin ISD is projected to pay almost $2.6 billion in recapture payments to the state. By 2019, more than half of every tax dollar collected in Austin will go to the state.\"", "Later in her testimony: Conley said: \"So to put it in perspective, we could lower our tax rate by 35 cents if we weren\u2019t sending $406 million to the state under the recapture system. For the average homeowner in Austin, that would amount to about $1,400 in lower taxes. That\u2019s fairly substantial; that\u2019s pretty significant tax relief. That would certainly make Austin more affordable for some of our taxpayers.\"", "To our inquiry, district spokesman Jacob Barrett told us Conley reached her savings figure for the average homeowner starting from the district\u2019s 2016-17 budget indicating it expects to pay $406 million in recapture to the state in accord with the school funding system. That payment amounts to 38 percent of the district\u2019s $1.061 billion in budgeted property taxes, Barrett noted.", "Barrett said the district got to the average homeowner\u2019s share of the budgeted recapture payment starting from its average taxable value of a home in the district of $328,844 (as of June 2016) on which such an owner expected to pay $3,548 in school maintenance and operations property taxes at the M&O tax rate of $1.079 per $100 valuation. Finally, Barrett said, multiplying the 38 percent by that $3,548 delivers the portion of taxes on an average-value residence that goes to recapture of $1,355.", "Barrett also emailed us a December 2012 district document showing that by amount, the Austin district's 2015 recapture payment was followed by what was paid by the Highland Park (Dallas); Eanes; Cotulla; and Karnes City districts, respectively. Also, the document says, the Austin district\u2019s annual recapture payment is projected to exceed $630 million in 2019 when \"more than half of every school property tax dollar collected locally will be \u2018recaptured\u2019 by the state.\"", "Next, we asked non-district experts--Joe Wisnoski, a former Texas Education Agency official; Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials; and Christy Rome, who advocates for districts required to make recapture payments--to evaluate how the Austin district determined the average Austin homeowner will pay $1,355 in school property taxes toward the district\u2019s 2016-17 recapture total.", "Solid, each expert said.", "By email, Wisnoski cautioned though: \"The average doesn\u2019t really describe much about the distribution of payment amounts, so you don\u2019t really know how many taxpayers are clustered close to that amount, and how many are really far away (high or low) compared to the average.\"", "Finally, we looked into how much a district resident with the median value home might be paying toward its recapture total. For that, we ran the median value of homes in the Austin district as of Aug. 8, 2016--$261,487--through the district\u2019s equation. Result: The median-value homeowner will be expected to pay $2,821 in M&O school taxes, of which $1,078 would be her or his share of the district\u2019s recapture payment.", "Barrett, the district spokesman, didn\u2019t question our math. He noted, though, that Watson referred to \"the average homeowner.\" It\u2019s fair, Barrett said by email, \"to use the variable that we do.\"", "Our ruling", "Watson said the average Austin homeowner pays about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture, as in funds ultimately spent in other districts.", "By the Austin district\u2019s analysis, the owners of a home at the district\u2019s average taxable value for 2016-17 stands to pay $1,355 in school property taxes toward the district\u2019s more than $400 million recapture payment for the year.", "We rate this claim True.", "TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.
