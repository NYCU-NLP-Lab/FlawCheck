["\u201cObama Foundation Tweeted About George Floyd on May 17th, A Week Before His Murder,\u201d reads the headline of an article shared on Facebook and Twitter.", "Floyd, 46, died on May 25 when a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Weeks of demonstrations against police brutality toward black Americans have followed.", "The misleading article concluded that \u201cthe whole thing was planned in advance.\u201d This is false; AFP on June 5 debunked the claim that George Floyd\u2019s death was staged.", "More misleading articles are available here and here, and articles making similar false claims but citing a May 16 Obama Foundation tweet are available here and here.\u00a0Facebook posts with the claim can be seen\u00a0here and here, and an Instagram post is available here. The claim was also shared in Spanish and German.", "Neither the May 16 nor May 17 tweet originally featured the image of Floyd, because the photo was not taken until May 30.", "\u201cWebsites can choose a preview image (Twitter card), that shows up when the site is linked to in tweets. So older tweets may have the card change when the website updates the card,\u201d a Twitter spokesman told AFP in an email.", "More information on Twitter cards is available here.", "The Obama Foundation told AFP by email: \u201cThere is no truth to this internet rumor. The preview image for Obama.org updates dynamically on social media sites, based on the information set. The photo with the George Floyd protest sign that previewed for Obama.org was taken on May 30, 2020 and first used on our site on May 31, 2020.\u201d", "The foundation also said: \u201cTwitter\u2019s web crawlers re-index the preview information on pages, roughly every week and it subsequently dynamically updated the preview images for older posts with the Obama.org URL.\u201d", "The May 17 tweet from the Obama Foundation contains a link to the organization\u2019s home page. Checked on June 18, neither the tweet nor the webpage show the image of Floyd any longer.", "This webpage within the Obama.org site, however, still features the Floyd image.", "A Google reverse image search of the Floyd picture with results limited to the first week of June 2020 leads to an article crediting the photo to \u201cCNS photo/Christopher Dilts, Sipa USA via Reuters.\u201d", "A new search in Sipa USA\u2019s online archive for the name of the photographer, \u201cChristopher Dilts,\u201d with results limited to May 30, yields the original image, captioned: \u201cDemonstrators protest in response to the police killing of George Floyd on Saturday March 30, 2020 in Chicago, IL.\u201d", "To clarify whether the photo was taken in March or May, AFP reached out to Dilts, who explained that the March date in the caption is incorrect due to an error on his part while sending in the demonstration photos.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a caption typo that I caught after filing (I was in the middle of the protest and honestly have no idea how I made an error like that). I caught it and re-uploaded, but apparently the new images didn\u2019t swap,\u201d Dilts told AFP.", "AFP obtained the original image from the photographer and pulled the metadata, which shows the photo was indeed taken Saturday, May 30 at 2:39 pm US Central Time.", "AFP Fact Check has debunked 35 false and misleading claims about Floyd and protests following his death.
