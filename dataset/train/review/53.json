["Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis gestures as he speaks during a news conference in front of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers mobile command center at the Miami Beach Convention Center on April 8, 2020. (Associated Press)", "Data compiled by the CDC, multiple states and news organizations all show COVID-19 deaths among young people in the United States.", "DeSantis\u2019 office did not respond to a request for comment.", "Health officials have long said that the novel coronavirus is particularly dangerous for older individuals and people with underlying health conditions.", "But Florida Gov. Ron Desantis made an even more staggering claim, that the virus hasn\u2019t killed anyone under 25 in the United States.", "\"This particular pandemic is one where I don\u2019t think nationwide, there\u2019s been a single fatality under 25,\" DeSantis said during an April 9 meeting to discuss reopening Florida schools. \"For whatever reason, it just doesn\u2019t seem to threaten kids.", "\"And we lose in Florida between five and 10 kids a year for the flu. This one (coronavirus), for whatever reason, much more dangerous if you're 65 and plus than the flu, no doubt about that, if you're younger it just hasn't had an impact. So that should factor into how we're viewing this. I think the data on that has been 100% consistent. I have not seen any deviation on that.\"", "This is inaccurate. Florida hasn\u2019t yet reported any deaths of COVID-19 patients under the age of 25, but several Americans in that age group have been killed by the virus.", "PolitiFact reached out to Desantis\u2019 office for comment but did not hear back.", "So far, the federal government\u2019s count shows that four people between 15 and 24, and one child between the ages of 1 and 4, have died from the virus.", "This is an undercount, because it takes \"several weeks\" for death records to be processed. Reports by news organizations and various state health departments show more fatalities among younger Americans, though it\u2019s hard to say with precision.", "New York state reported that 42 people who were 29 years or younger have died from the virus, as of April 10. Of those, six were 19 or younger and 36 deaths were people between 20 and 29 years old.", "A Washington Post investigation identified nine people under 20 who died from COVID-19. The newspaper found 45 deaths of people in their 20s.", "All told, death remains rare for young, otherwise healthy people, but these numbers show it can and has happened. Relatively few children with COVID-19 are hospitalized, and they often exhibit milder symptoms, health experts say. Like adults, they can unknowingly spread the disease to others.", "DeSantis claimed that the novel coronavirus hasn\u2019t killed anyone under the age of 25 in the United States.", "That\u2019s wrong, according to the CDC, contemporaneous news reports and the counts of state health officials in places like New York. While we don\u2019t have precise numbers, we can say with certainty that deaths in people 25 and under do exist.", "We rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "Twitter, DeSantis video, April 9, 2020", "Tampa Bay Times, Even two weeks back in school would have value, Gov. Ron DeSantis says, April 9, 2020", "Florida Department of Health, Coronavirus: summary of persons being monitored, persons under investigation, and cases, Updated April 10, 2020", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), Accessed April 10, 2020", "Kaiser Health News, Millennial Zeitgeist: Attitudes About COVID-19 Shift As Cases Among Young Adults Rise, April 10, 2020", "Washington Post, Hundreds of young Americans have now been killed by the coronavirus, data shows, April 8, 2020", "NY Health.gov, New York Department of Health Covid-19 fatalities tracker, Accessed April 10, 2020", "CNN, Florida governor falsely claims the coronavirus hasn't killed anyone under 25, April 9, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
