["About this rating", "In February 2020, as fears of a world-wide COVID-19 pandemic caused by a new coronavirus from China spread across the globe, many Western news outlets began running stories suggesting that consumers were shunning the popular Mexican brand of beer called Corona due to their mistakenly connecting it with the coronavirus.", "Take, for example, the following article, whose headline and subhead misleadingly implied that the Corona brand had experienced a steep drop-off in sales because potential buyers were being scared off by its putative link to the coronavirus:", "https://metro.co.uk/2020/02/27/makers-corona-report-132000000-loss-result-coronavirus-12312964/", "However, what the text of the article actually reported was not that consumers had suddenly become \"afraid\" of Corona beer, but that multiple brands of beer (not just Corona) were experiencing relative sales slumps in China because the spread of the coronavirus had generally dampened public activities there, at a time of year (i.e., during Chinese New Year celebrations) when sales were typically high:", "The world\u2019s biggest brewing giant, which is behind the Corona, Budweiser and Stella Artois brands, forecast first quarter earnings will tumble by about 10% after the virus outbreak saw demand slump in China as it also coincided with the Chinese New Year, sending its shares 8% lower.", "AB InBev estimates the earnings hit across China after seeing around \u00a3221 million of lost sales in the first two months of 2020 alone due to coronavirus \u2013 also known as Covid-19. The Belgium-based group said: \"The impact of the Covid-19 virus outbreak on our business continues to evolve.", "\"The outbreak has led to a significant decline in demand in China in both on-premise and in-home channels. Additionally, demand during the Chinese New Year was lower than in previous years as it coincided with the beginning of this outbreak.\"", "But the trope that \"people are so dumb they're shunning Corona beer because they think it's connected to the coronavirus\" was too tempting for many news outlets to eschew, even though little or no evidence backed it up. Many of them based their articles on a survey that supposedly documented that \"38% of Beer-Drinking Americans Wouldn't Buy Corona Now,\" again suggesting people were being scared off the brand due to mistaken associations between the name of the brand and a virus.", "However, that poll was conducted and published by the 5W public relations firm, and it did not find what many news reports gleefully claimed it did. The PR piece stated that a phone survey of 737 American beer drinkers had determined that \"38% of Americans would not buy Corona under any circumstances now,\" and by offering that statistic in conjunction with other information about the coronavirus, the piece again misleadingly suggested that consumers were being frightened away from Corona beer merely because of its name. But it didn't provide readers with the questions that the poll's subjects were asked, nor did it offer any context explaining why respondents answered the way they did. Or, as The Atlantic noted of the issue:", "By presenting this finding in the context of other questions that are explicitly about the coronavirus, the press release creates the impression that Americans\u2019 reluctance to drink the beer is due to the coronavirus. \u201cThere is no question that Corona beer is suffering because of the coronavirus,\u201d Ronn Torossian, the CEO of 5WPR, says in the press release. \u201cCould one imagine walking into a bar and saying \u2018Hey, can I have a Corona?\u2019 or \u2018Pass me a Corona.\u2019\u201d", "But this connection is manufactured, and Torossian is ignoring far more mundane reasons Americans might not buy a Corona, including that they don\u2019t like the taste. Of those Americans who did report regularly drinking Corona, only 4 percent said they would now stop drinking the beer.", "A number of major news outlets appear to have walked right into the trap. Because they did not understand that the original press release was walking a fine line between deeply misleading claims and outright lies, their articles have inadvertently fallen on the side of the lie. As a viral tweet by CNN put it, the survey supposedly found that 38 percent of Americans would not drink Corona, \u201cbecause of the coronavirus.\u201d", "Huffington Post did obtain a list of the questions that were put to the poll's respondents and observed how the results could be used to create misleading impressions:", "Here are the questions that were asked, according to The Dispatch\u2019s Declan Garvey, combined with the results 5WPR chose to include in its press release:", "Are you a beer drinker?", "Are you a Corona drinker?", "Is Corona related to the coronavirus? (16% of beer-drinkers were \u201cconfused\u201d about this.)", "In light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona? (4% who \u201cusually drink Corona\u201d said they planned to stop.)", "Would you buy Corona in a store?", "Would you order a Corona in a restaurant/bar/public venue? (14% who \u201cusually drink Corona\u201d said they would not.)", "Would you buy Corona under any circumstances now? (38% of \u201cbeer-drinking Americans\u201d said they would not.)", "There are any number of ways a careful market researcher might attempt to tease out how, if at all, coronavirus has affected perceptions of the beer. This isn\u2019t one of them. Instead, these questions manage to fail simultaneously in two different directions. On one hand, some of the phrasing (\u201cIn light of the coronavirus ...\u201d) implies a queasy connection between the virus and the beer that people might not have considered until they were polled.", "On the other hand, the final three questions \u2015 including the one responsible for that startling 38% statistic \u2015 don\u2019t explicitly mention coronavirus as a motivation at all. In other words, drinkers who said they wouldn\u2019t buy Corona might simply have meant that they prefer to order a different brand of beer.", "The much less eye-catching but entirely more plausible statistic is that, even \u201cin light of the coronavirus,\u201d just 4% of Americans who \u201cusually drink Corona\u201d say they \u201cplan to stop\u201d drinking it. Even here, the framing of the question is sloppy: If respondents \u201cplan to stop,\u201d doesn\u2019t that imply they haven\u2019t given it up yet?", "A different poll by YouGov reported that \"Corona\u2019s Buzz score \u2014 a net score based on whether US adults have heard anything negative or positive about the brand\" had decreased sharply since the beginning of January 2020, and that \"purchase intent for the brand is at the lowest it\u2019s been in two years.\" But again, the poll didn't document any actual decrease in Corona sales due to consumer confusion over a supposed link between the beer and the virus.", "In fact, CNN reported that Constellation Brands, Corona's producer, had reported an uptick in sales of the Corona Extra brand in the U.S.:", "Constellation Brands (STZ), which brews several variations of the popular lager, said in a statement that its customers \"understand there is no link between the virus and our business.\"", "\"Sales of Corona remain very strong and we appreciate the continued support from our fans,\" Constellation Brands spokesperson Stephanie McGuane told CNN Business. \"Our advertising with Corona is consistent with the campaign we have been running for the last 30 years and is based off strong consumer sentiment.\"", "Constellation said Corona Extra sales grew 5% in the United States in the four weeks that ended February 16. That's nearly double the trend of the past 52 weeks. Corona's sales are heavily dependent on the US market, unlike some of its far-more-international rivals.", "Reuters similarly reported Constellation Brands as declaring that \"all units supporting its beer business are seeing positive sales trends for the brand thus far in 2020 despite claims about the impact of the coronavirus on its business.\"", "Nonetheless, the trope that \"people are dumb enough to believe you can get the coronavirus by drinking Corona beer\" caught on with the press because, as legends often do, it validated something many readers were willing to believe, according to the Atlantic:", "The real question is why this obscure poll would, even if it had been true, be able to capture the imagination of so many people. And the answer is as obvious as it is saddening: Clearly, a lot of Americans already think that their fellow citizens are stupid. The real reason a fake finding could have spread so far so quickly is that it confirmed prejudices about the world that many have held all along.", "Edwards-Levy, Ariel. \u00a0 \"No, 38% of Americans Probably Didn\u2019t Stop Drinking Corona Because of Coronavirus.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 HuffPost. \u00a0 28 February 2020.", "Reuters. \u00a0 \"Corona Beer Maker: U.S. Sales Remain Strong Despite Virus Outbreak.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 1 March 2020.", "5W Public Relations. \u00a0 \"5WPR Survey Reveals 38% of Beer-Drinking Americans Wouldn't Buy Corona Now.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 27 February 2020.", "Hartley-Parkinson, Richard. \u00a0 \"Makers of Corona Report \u00a3132,000,000 Loss as a Result of Coronavirus.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Metro. \u00a0 27 February 2020.", "YouGov. \u00a0 \"Corona Beer Brand Is Impacted by the Coronavirus News.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 26 February 2020.", "Valinsky, Jordan. \u00a0 \"The Spread of the Coronavirus Couldn't Have Come at a Worse Time for Corona Beer.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN Business. \u00a0 28 February 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
