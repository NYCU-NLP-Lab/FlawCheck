["About this rating", "On 6 December 2015 the web site\u00a0Revive America published an article titled \"\u2018A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS\u2019 AIRS WITH TRIGGER WARNINGS,\" which held:", "A Charlie Brown Christmas, a recent holiday tradition with strong Christian undertones, celebrated its 50th Anniversary on ABC Family last night\u00a0...\u00a0Before the opening scene and after every commercial break, ABC Family used a disclaimer warning audiences of potentially \u201coffensive and dangerous\u201d religious content found in the dialogue of the program, similar to the disclaimers seen on adult shows that warn viewers of graphic content or strong language. The disclaimer in question for Charlie Brown read: \u201cWARNING: This program contains strong Christian messages and may be offensive to some viewers. Viewer discretion advised.\u201d", "The disclaimer was admittedly a compromise solution by ABC Family, who in the past had openly objected to the Christian messages in the program, but was forced nonetheless to air the program uncensored under the pressure from its audiences. Thus, the \u2018trigger warning\u2019 was added allegedly out of fear of offending or upsetting those audiences who did not demand to see the show\u2026", "Although the article was published on 6 December 2015, it claimed the purported \"Christian content\" trigger warnings had aired the previous day.\u00a0That was false, as\u00a0A Charlie Brown Christmas\u00a0aired on 30 November 2015. A retrospective and the original animated classic were widely watched, but no one mentioned the undoubtedly notable use of the warnings cited in the claim.", "Quite clearly, at the lower left-hand corner of the appended image shared by Revive America, appears the logo of a disreputable fake news site;\u00a0Revive America\u00a0either overlooked the attribution or didn't vet its source. In any event, no such warning appeared during the 30 November 2015 airing of\u00a0A Charlie Brown Christmas\u00a0(nor at any other point in its broadcast history.)", "In 2015,\u00a0A Charlie Brown Christmas sparked a number of false claims and controversies regarding its Christian content. According to one rumor,\u00a0President Obama and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined ABC for airing it. Another took umbrage with\u00a0President Obama's broadcast commentary during the 2015 retrospective.", "[article-meta]", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
