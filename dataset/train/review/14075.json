["There has not been a dearth of\u00a0incendiary\u00a0remarks from\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.,\u00a0who completed her first month in Congress on Feb. 3.", "On Feb. 4, the\u00a0House voted 210-199\u00a0to remove Greene\u00a0from her appointments\u00a0on the Education & Labor\u00a0Committee and Budget\u00a0Committee\u00a0in response to\u00a0an array of remarks that surfaced\u00a0from before her time in office, showing\u00a0a\u00a0video of Greene\u00a0harassing Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivor David Hogg and her engagement on Facebook\u00a0with\u00a0conspiracy theories\u00a0and\u00a0threats\u00a0of violence\u00a0against Democratic officials.", "However, one controversial remark\u00a0that\u00a0many\u00a0Facebook users have quoted Greene as\u00a0saying\u00a0is false.", "A\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0from\u00a0Jan. 31, which has now been shared over 750 times, reads:\u00a0\u201c\u2018If English was good enough for Jesus, it\u2019s good enough for us.\u2019 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on why Spanish should not be spoken in a Christian nation like America.\u201d", "In other viral posts,\u00a0the statement is juxtaposed with a photo of Greene holding a rifle, a frame from a controversial campaign ad\u00a0that Facebook removed.", "These users did not respond to requests for comment.", "More:Steny Hoyer blasts Marjorie Taylor Greene over AR-15 post targeting Democratic 'Squad'", "Searches of Greene\u2019s social media and Google showed she\u00a0has never made this statement publicly. In addition, Greene has never commented on the speaking of the Spanish language in the U.S. or in U.S. schools.", "Though the original poster of the meme could not be determined, the first mention of it in relation to Greene may have\u00a0occurred on Twitter on Jan. 9, when a user compared the phrase to one of her tweets, which falsely stated\u00a0that \u201cThe American People invented electricity, automobiles, airplanes, televisions, cellphones, and virtually every other incredible invention before social media.\u201d", "Variations of the statement have been misattributed to government officials for over half a century, but its origins have never been verified, as linguist Benjamin Zimmer detailed in a University of Pennsylvania blog post in 2006.", "Because Jesus did not speak English, the quote is typically used to paint those officials as having a provincial or backward\u00a0attitude, such as in this Los Angeles Times article from 1970. In the article, a member of the Mexican-American community implored social services employees to be more open-minded to the cultures of minority groups. \"Montez ... illustrated the frequently-insensitive attitude in officials by recalling one public servant who told the group, 'If English was good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for us,'\" says the article.", "Fact check:Old claim linking politicians' sons to Ukraine is partly false", "A version of the quote first appeared in an 1881 New York Times article,\u00a0and since then,\u00a0the statement has been most commonly attributed to Miriam Amanda \u201cMa\u201d Ferguson, who served as the first female governor of Texas, from 1925-1927.\u00a0\"If the King's English was good enough for Jesus Christ, it's good enough for the children of Texas!\" she is reported to have said, as relayed\u00a0in a\u00a02001 speech by former President Jimmy Carter.", "In 2014, PolitiFact debunked Facebook users\u2019 attribution of the quote to former Rep. Michelle Bachmann, R-Minn.", "Based on our research, the claim that Rep. Marjorie Taylor\u00a0Greene said, \"If English was good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for us\" is FALSE. Searches of Greene\u2019s social media and Google showed she\u00a0has never made this statement publicly.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
