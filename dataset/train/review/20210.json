That\u2019s not rhetoric. That is what communities in the United States want to see from the people who protect and serve them. And so quite frankly, we can, at the same time as we grieve the loss of life of several officers who were killed last night, we can also push to demand that there be accountable, responsive, transparent policing that has oversight form communities and that is accountable to the communities they are supposed to protect and serve.\u201d", "Garza added that Black Lives Matter isn\u2019t concerned with inciting more violence \u2014 in fact, the movement condemns it \u2014 but with tearing down the assumption that black people are criminals.", "\u201cWe are not anti-police,\u201d she declared. \u201cWe are anti our people being murdered in the streets.
