["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on July 16, 2020", "Deflecting attention from the rise in COVID-19 cases, President Donald Trump has repeatedly said the Obama administration \u201cstopped testing\u201d during the H1N1 pandemic. He\u2019s correct that individual reporting was halted after a few months, but some testing did continue \u2014 and the two viruses are very different, making the comparison misleading.", "Whereas pandemic H1N1 influenza was no worse than the seasonal flu, and testing did not play much of a role in controlling the spread of the virus, COVID-19 is far more deadly, and testing is critical for contact tracing and isolation.", "Trump first mentioned the Obama administration\u2019s decision to halt reporting of individual H1N1 influenza cases at a July 13 roundtable on law enforcement, when the president was asked by a reporter whether he would acknowledge that coronavirus cases were rising because of increased spread of the virus, and not just because of testing, as Trump has frequently claimed.", "In response, Trump falsely said that the U.S. has one of the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates \u2014 it does not \u2014 and then proceeded to say that President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden \u201cstopped testing\u201d during the 2009 pandemic.", "Trump, July 13: If you know, Biden and Obama stopped their testing; they just stopped it. You probably know that. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to report it. But they stopped testing. Right in the middle, they just went, \u201cNo more testing,\u201d and on a much lesser problem than the problem that we have, obviously with respect to \u2014 this is the worst thing that\u2019s happened since probably 1917. This is a very bad \u2014 all over the world. It\u2019s 188 countries right now.", "The next day at a press conference in the Rose Garden, Trump brought it up again, this time specifying that he was talking about H1N1.", "Trump, July 14: And if you look at the job [Joe Biden] did on swine flu \u2014 I looked at a poll \u2014 they have polls on everything nowadays \u2014 and he \u2014 they got very bad marks on the job they did on the swine flu, H1N1. He calls it \u201cN1H1.\u201d H1N1. He got very poor marks from Gallup on the job they did on swine flu. And they stopped, very early on, testing. They totally stopped it. They just said, \u201cStop.\u201d", "As we have written, the president has made inapt comparisons between COVID-19 and H1N1 before, and the polling claim is trumped up. No polls specifically evaluated Biden\u2019s performance in the 2009 pandemic, but the Obama administration received moderately good marks at the time.", "Trump\u2019s latest H1N1 claim appears to stem from a Fox News article that Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany shared in a July 11 tweet.", "\u201cUnder Obama/Biden, \u2018the CDC abruptly advised states to stop testing for H1N1 flu, and stopped counting individual cases,\u2019 she said, quoting the news story. \u201cMeanwhile, @realDonaldTrump\u2069 has tested 40 million+, leading the world in testing!\u201d", "The White House did not respond to our inquiry for more information.", "It\u2019s true that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped having states report H1N1 cases in late July 2009, a little more than three months after the first U.S. pandemic influenza virus cases were identified in April.", "But the CDC did not \u201ctotally\u201d stop testing, since some testing continued for surveillance purposes and for select patients. And Trump is omitting relevant context as to why the CDC made that decision \u2014 and how the circumstances are different this time around with COVID-19.", "The CDC explains in an archived webpage that individual cases of H1N1 pandemic influenza were monitored early on to track the spread of the disease, but as the virus became widespread, the case counts \u201cbecame an increasingly inaccurate representation of the true burden of disease\u201d as many people were mildly ill and did not seek treatment and the vast majority were not tested.", "\u201cCDC recognized early in the outbreak that once disease was widespread,\u201d the website continues, \u201cit would be more valuable to transition to standard surveillance systems to monitor illness, hospitalizations and deaths.\u201d", "On another webpage, the CDC says that individual case counts became \u201cincreasingly impractical and not representative of the true extent of the outbreak\u201d because only a small proportion of patients were tested for influenza, \u201cso the true benefit of keeping track of these numbers is questionable.\u201d", "The webpage added that the \u201cextensive spread\u201d of the virus made it \u201cextremely resource-intensive for states to count individual cases,\u201d and that the agency would continue to track H1N1 hospitalizations and deaths.", "Dr. Anne Schuchat, then-director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and now principal deputy director of the CDC, also explained the change in a July 24, 2009, press call, noting that at that point in the pandemic there had been 43,771 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza and 302 deaths in the U.S.", "\u201cBut as we\u2019ve been saying, that\u2019s really just the tip of the iceberg, so we\u2019re no longer going to expect the states will continue this individual reporting and we\u2019re going to transition to other ways of describing the illness and the pattern,\u201d she said. \u201cWe believe there have been well over a million cases of the new H1N1 virus so far in the United States.\u201d", "The decision followed the World Health Organization\u2019s July 16\u00a0announcement\u00a0that it would\u00a0no longer issue\u00a0global reports on the number of confirmed H1N1 cases, given the difficulty of testing such a large number of cases, and the fact that such counts were \u201cno longer essential in such countries for monitoring either the level or nature of the risk posed by the pandemic virus or to guide implementation of the most appropriate response measures.\u201d", "The CDC would go on to report estimates of the number of H1N1 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. throughout the pandemic, specifically trying to use statistical methods to account for underreporting.", "Dr. Nicole Lurie, a physician and assistant secretary for preparedness and response during the H1N1 pandemic, told us the comparison to COVID-19 is \u201creally misleading.\u201d", "\u201cThe role of testing in those two diseases is terribly different,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cIn flu, the major reason that they tested people at the beginning of the epidemic was so that you would know when influenza arrived in different communities.\u201d", "But once the virus had arrived and established itself, she said, doctors could \u201cmake a pretty good presumption\u201d that people with flu-like symptoms had flu.", "\u201cIndividual testing was no longer needed because it was just wasteful and provided no additional information,\u201d said Lurie, who is now a strategic advisor to the CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a nongovernmental organization dedicated to developing vaccines to stop epidemics, including COVID-19.", "Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, also told us that testing for H1N1 was not particularly valuable because the virus was so prevalent, and there was a readily available therapy \u2014 Tamiflu and other similar antivirals, which also work on seasonal flu.", "\u201cThe testing was onerous,\u201d he said, noting that a confirmatory diagnostic test could take days to come back with results. \u201cThe rapid tests were not very accurate, and we had an antiviral, and we didn\u2019t want people to refrain from giving them an antiviral because they were waiting for a test or the test result was negative.\u201d", "There are no FDA-approved drugs to treat or prevent COVID-19, although research suggests the investigational drug remdesivir may shorten the time to recovery and the steroid medication dexamethasone may improve survival of critically ill patients.", "The situation with COVID-19, Lurie said, is very different, because testing is still critical for understanding where the coronavirus is spreading and because it\u2019s an essential public health tool for controlling the virus.", "\u201cTesting triggers isolation and contact tracing,\u201d Lurie said of the COVID-19 situation. \u201cSo for disease control, it\u2019s really important to test. That was not the case with flu.\u201d", "Critically, too, is the fact that pandemic H1N1 influenza wasn\u2019t nearly as dangerous as COVID-19. While there is still debate about exactly how deadly the novel coronavirus is, most experts peg the infection fatality rate at around 0.6% to 1%.", "According to CDC estimates, the H1N1 pandemic infected 60.8 million Americans over a year, but led to just 12,469 deaths. That puts the infection fatality rate at 0.02%, or some 30 to 50 times less deadly than COVID-19.", "\u201cThe mortality rate of H1N1 pandemic virus was lower than seasonal influenza,\u201d Adalja said. \u201cWe found that out very quickly, and that also influenced how we dealt with it.\u201d", "As of July 16, there have been nearly 3.5 million COVID-19 cases and more than 137,000 deaths in the U.S., per the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 tracker \u2014 although both numbers are likely underestimates.", "Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of the global health initiative Resolve to Save Lives and head of the CDC during the H1N1 pandemic, also noted these differences in a statement given to FactCheck.org.", "\u201cTesting data are only as useful as the actions they inform \u2014 and in the case of the 2009 H1N1 and current COVID-19 pandemics, they have very different roles,\u201d he said.", "Because the 2009 H1N1 strain was not more dangerous than a typical seasonal influenza, which has led to between 12,000 and 61,000 deaths annually since 2010, most people did not seek care or get diagnosed. As a result, he said, for every laboratory confirmed case from April to October 2009, there were around 79 cases that went undiagnosed.", "\u201cSo it was never practical to identify cases, trace their contacts, and ask exposed people to quarantine,\u201d Frieden said, adding that by July, collecting national data was no longer important because the data \u201cwere not a good measure of the scale of the epidemic, nor actionable for contact tracing.\u201d", "COVID-19, on the other hand, is \u201cqualitatively different,\u201d he said, since it does lead to severe disease in many cases. \u201cAlthough not everyone who contracts the virus seeks and receives testing, a higher share do, so testing data is a more useful indicator of the direction of the epidemic,\u201d Frieden said.", "\u201cWhen someone compares these two pandemics and says \u2013 correctly \u2013 that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was \u2018a much lesser problem than the problem that we have,\u2019 they are inadvertently explaining exactly why reporting of testing data is so much important now than it was then,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current pandemic is much more severe, which is why we have used public health and social measures to box in the virus, and testing is a key component of that.\u201d", "Adalja said he thought the CDC\u2019s decision to stop individual reporting for H1N1 was reasonable. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have molecular diagnostic testing as widespread in 2009 as it was in 2020, and the rapid tests just weren\u2019t accurate enough,\u201d he said, \u201cso we knew we were undercounting.\u201d", "Lurie said anyone who makes the H1N1 comparison to the coronavirus doesn\u2019t understand very much about COVID-19. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like comparing oranges and basketballs,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re both orange, but that\u2019s about as far as you get.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
