["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on November 21, 2017", "Nonpartisan congressional analysts say eliminating the penalty for not buying health insurance would increase average premiums on the individual market by 10 percent. That, in turn, would result in some people deciding not to buy health coverage for financial reasons.", "Yet Republican Sen. Tom Cotton claimed that the amended Senate tax bill revoking the penalty\u00a0would have \u201cno impact on anyone\u201d who wants to buy insurance through the exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act.", "Cotton made that statement during a Nov. 19 interview on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Host John Dickerson asked Cotton about the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation\u2019s estimate that, starting in 2025, 13 million fewer people would have health insurance if the penalty for failing to comply with the Obama-era health care law\u2019s individual mandate is repealed.", "Dickerson, Nov. 19: Okay. Let\u2019s move on to tax reform. Thirteen million people will be without coverage if the individual mandate is removed as you\u2019d like to see in this tax cut plan. What happens to those 13 million?", "Cotton: Well, John, remember what the hated Obamacare mandate is. It fines an American family. They can\u2019t afford their insurance \u2014 insurance that Obamacare made unaffordable in the first place. So this bill doesn\u2019t cut a single dime from Medicaid, it doesn\u2019t cut a single dime from the insurance subsidies, it doesn\u2019t change a single regulation in Obamacare. It simply says the IRS cannot fine you if you cannot afford health insurance. So this has no impact on anyone who wants to get health insurance under Obamacare\u2019s individual exchanges or under the Medicaid expansion under their employer\u2019s plan.", "Cotton\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to our request for an explanation.", "However, the CBO and JCT estimate that\u00a0the bill would have an impact on some Americans who want to buy insurance on their own, on or off the exchanges.", "Eliminating the penalty would produce results \u201cvery similar\u201d to repealing the individual mandate, CBO and JCT say. The latter would result in, among other outcomes, 13 million fewer Americans having health insurance as early as 2025, and average premiums in the nongroup market increasing by 10 percent in most years through 2027.", "\u201cThose effects would occur mainly because healthier people would be less likely to obtain insurance and because, especially in the nongroup market, the resulting increases in premiums would cause more people to not purchase insurance,\u201d the analysis says.", "Christine Eibner, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation, also contradicted Cotton.", "\u201cI disagree with the statement,\u201d Eibner wrote in an email to FactCheck.org. \u201cEliminating the mandate would have spillover effects for the individual market, which includes the ACA\u2019s marketplaces and other individual market plans.\u201d", "She added: \u201cSpecifically, it\u2019s likely that the people who would drop individual market coverage if the mandate were eliminated would be healthy, low-cost people, who have relatively low health care utilization. If these folks drop out, those remaining on the market will be costlier, leading premiums to rise. Insurance will then become more expensive.\u201d", "By 2025, about 5 million of the projected 13 million fewer Americans with health insurance would come from the nongroup or individual insurance market, CBO and JCT say. In addition, 5 million fewer people would be enrolled in Medicaid; another 3 million fewer people would get insurance through their employer; and as many as 500,000 fewer would no longer have some other form of health insurance.", "In some cases, higher premiums would be offset by higher government subsidies in the form of premium tax credits. But not everyone qualifies for them.", "As of February 2017, 84 percent of the 10.3 million people purchasing health insurance through federal and state exchanges, received premium tax credits, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Naturally, that means 16 percent of those on the exchanges, plus the roughly 5.4 million buying off-exchange plans, don\u2019t get those tax credits.", "CBO and JCT do not specify how many would leave the nongroup market because health insurance became too expensive. At least some of them would, though.", "Therefore, it\u2019s inaccurate to claim that the proposal from Senate Republicans to stop the penalty payment would not affect anyone buying on the Obamacare exchanges, or who want to buy insurance.", "We previously wrote about an inaccurate claim\u00a0made by Democrats that all 13 million people would be kicked off their health insurance if the Senate bill became law.", "As we said, some are expected to stop purchasing insurance for financial reasons, but many would voluntarily give up their health coverage because they would no longer be penalized. CBO\u2019s joint analysis doesn\u2019t say how many would willingly give up insurance and how many would find it too pricey to buy.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
