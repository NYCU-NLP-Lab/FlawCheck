["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 25, 2018", "Q: \u00a0Is CNN going to shut down because of poor TV ratings?", "A:\u00a0No. There is no evidence to support that headline from a known purveyor of viral deceptions.", "CNN is not preparing to shutter, despite what an online headline claims.", "\u201cCNN To Permanently Close Its Doors As Ratings Plunge 30 Percent,\u201d reads the May 18 headline on Your News Wire, a routine publisher of fabricated news  stories. The story was posted elsewhere online, and shared on Facebook, where users rightfully flagged it as potentially false.", "It presents no actual evidence of CNN\u2019s closing, and instead cherry-picked ratings data to show that the network is having a \u201cratings crisis.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that CNN \u201cposted double-digit audience losses\u201d during a week earlier this month, according to an Adweek article to which Your News Wire linked. CNN experienced a 29 percent decline in prime-time viewers during the week of May 7, compared to the same time last year, according to data from  the analytics company Nielsen.", "But neither Your News Wire, nor the conservative website Breitbart, which wrote a sizable portion of the text used in the story about CNN\u2019s alleged demise, provided additional information that would paint a less dire picture of the network\u2019s viewership.", "For example, during the month of April, CNN saw a 4 percent year-over-year increase\u00a0in prime-time viewers. And two of its programs, \u201cNew Day\u201d and \u201cCNN Tonight,\u201d saw their largest average April audience ever.", "Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television & Popular Culture at Syracuse University, told us that ratings can be \u201ccomplicated.\u201d", "\u201cEspecially when you start cherry-picking individual ratings for a certain month or a certain week,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhoever\u2019s trying to make the argument that X show is doing horribly can usually find \u2026 data to support one argument or another.\u201d", "For instance, when comparing the first quarter of 2018 with the first quarter of 2017, Fox News was down both in total day viewers, by 16 percent, and in prime-time viewers, by 13 percent. And, among Fox News, MSNBC and CNN, MSNBC was the only cable network whose ratings rose for the first quarter, year-over-year, with a 30 percent increase in both total day and prime-time viewers. Even so, Fox News remained the top cable news network, by ratings standards.", "Generally, it\u2019s best to examine data over longer periods of time to address trends \u2014 a year is better than, say, a week \u2014 and consider things \u201cacross the board,\u201d Thompson said. In the case of CNN, that would include considering other factors, such as CNN\u2019s performance internationally. (Nielsen ratings are specific to the U.S.)", "\u201cThere are so many different numbers that are relevant,\u201d Thompson said, \u201cand so many different ways one can try to make sense of those numbers.\u201d", "He added: \u201cI think CNN is looking at a whole bunch of their data when they decide to stay in business.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Adl-Tabatabai, Sean. \u201cCNN To Permanently Close Its Doors As Ratings Plunge 30 Percent.\u201d Yournewswire.com. 18 May 2018.", "\u201cFox News Channel Continues to Top Cable News Landscape in Both Total Day and Primetime for 65 Consecutive Quarters.\u201d Press Release.
