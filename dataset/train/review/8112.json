But that guidance changed on April 3, after studies found that the virus can be spread by asymptomatic individuals, or before symptoms start to show.

It\u2019s how you put together these different tools to meet the task at hand. Wearing any mask is a very, very small price to pay to be safe and return to society.\"", "Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne disease transmission at Virginia Tech, told PolitiFact that masks provide some protection but the amount can vary widely depending on the type and how it's worn. Masks reduce the amount of virus spread and also the amount one might inhale, she said.", "It\u2019s not true, she said, that cloth masks provide 0% protection.", "\"There have been measurements showing that homemade mask materials offer up to 80% protection,\" Marr said, \"which is much better than 0%, although not as good as an N95. Still, reducing the amount of virus that we inhale by 80% is better than nothing.\"", "A smattering of studies have looked at the efficacy of different masks in different ways.", "One experiment from researchers at the National Institutes of Health used lasers to illuminate and measure how many droplets of saliva were released into the air by a person talking with and without a cloth facial covering.", "As can be seen in a video of the experiment, a cluster of droplets appear in the air when the researcher speaks without a mask, but nearly all the particles are blocked when he does the same with a mask.

Higher quality, more tightly woven fabrics are better, and multiple layers improves protection.\"", "Jeremy Howard, a data scientist at the University of San Francisco, wrote an article in the Conversation in favor of universal mask wearing.", "Howard says that researchers were looking at the wrong question at first \u2013 how well a mask protects the wearer from infection \u2013 and not how well a mask prevents an infected person from spreading the virus. He said masks function very differently as personal protective equipment versus \"source control.\"", "\"Masks are very good at blocking larger droplets and not nearly as good at blocking tiny particles,\" he wrote. \"When a person expels droplets into the air, they quickly evaporate and shrink to become tiny airborne particles called droplet nuclei. These are extremely hard to remove from the air. However, in the moist atmosphere between a person\u2019s mouth and their mask, it takes nearly a hundred times as long for a droplet to evaporate and shrink into a droplet nuclei.\"", "He continued: \"This means that nearly any kind of simple cloth mask is great for source control. The mask creates humidity, this humidity prevents virus-containing droplets from turning into droplet nuclei, and this allows the fabric of the mask to block the droplets.\"", "Social media posts claim that certain face masks are ineffective and provide \"0% protection.\"", "More research needs to be done but we found that medical experts widely refute the claim. Higher medical-grade masks offer the most protection, but homemade masks are also effective, particularly when they fit snuggly and are made of multiple layers.", "No mask is 100% effective, but health care officials stress that face masks increase their effectiveness when combined with other measures, such as social distancing and regular hand washing.", "We rate this False.", "Facebook post, April, 2, 2020", "New York Times, Coronavirus: Which Mask Should You Wear?, April 17, 2020", "US News and World Report, Do Face Masks Work?
