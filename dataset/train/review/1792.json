["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on December 18, 2020", "A hand count of paper ballots in Antrim County, Michigan, has verified the election results there, refuting a \u201cforensics report\u201d promoted by President Donald Trump that baselessly claimed the election equipment in the county was \u201cdesigned\u201d to create \u201csystemic fraud and influence election results.\u201d Experts said the faulty report showed a misunderstanding of voting system technology.", "A Dec. 17 audit of ballots cast in Antrim County, Michigan, affirmed the outcome of the presidential election there \u2014 refuting viral claims that the election software used by the county, and elsewhere, had facilitated massive fraud.", "The audit, conducted by state and local officials and representatives of both political parties, involved a hand tally of all the votes cast for president in the county. The findings verified the county\u2019s outcome, in which President Donald Trump beat President-elect Joe Biden by nearly 3,800 votes. (Biden ultimately beat Trump in the state by more than 154,000 votes.)", "In a county with more than 15,700 votes cast for president, the audit showed a gain of 11 votes for Trump and a loss of one vote for Biden. Small variances are expected in a machine versus hand count.", "The audit came days after the release of a report purporting that Dominion Voting Systems software used in Antrim County was \u201cintentionally and purposefully designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and influence election results.\u201d", "Though state officials disputed the report as lacking credibility, its claims traveled far on social media.", "A Dec. 14 Facebook video, viewed more than 23,000 times, claimed in its caption that \u201cTrump WON The Election NEW Evidence Shows\u201d because \u201ca forensics report done on Dominion voting machines determined that the \u2018Dominion Software Was Intentionally Designed To Influence Election Results.'\u201d The conservative media outlet Newsmax ran a headline claiming, \u201cAudit Finds Mich. County\u2019s Dominion Voting Was Rigged to Create Fraud.\u201d It was shared more than 20,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.", "Behind the dubious report was Russell Ramsland Jr., a Republican who ran for Congress in Texas in 2016 but lost in the primary to Rep. Pete Sessions.", "Ramsland \u2014 who has in recent years spoken about a purported effort by the \u201cdeep state,\u201d including U.S. intelligence agencies, to undermine Trump \u2014 is founder of a group called Allied Security Operations Group.", "The company\u2019s website doesn\u2019t list its staff and the report doesn\u2019t identify the names or specific credentials of those who helped prepare the report. The group was permitted to access and examine county election equipment as part of a lawsuit filed by a local resident.", "Ramsland\u2019s faulty findings have previously been cited by the Trump campaign. One affidavit in another case\u00a0alleged that a slew of precincts in Michigan were found to have more votes than voters \u2014 findings repeated by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. But as PolitiFact noted, the precincts cited were actually in Minnesota \u2014 not Michigan \u2014 so the claims didn\u2019t hold up.", "We reached out to Ramsland and requested an interview, and asked for his response to the Antrim County audit results, but didn\u2019t hear back.", "His 23-page report on Antrim claimed that \u201cDominion Voting System is intentionally and purposefully designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and influence election results.\u201d", "But state officials and Dominion \u2014 which has been the subject of conspiracy theories following the election \u2014 said the report was flawed and spreading misinformation. They\u00a0noted that the county does not digitally conduct\u00a0adjudication \u2014 when election workers need to review a ballot to determine its intent \u2014 as the report alleges. It\u2019s done manually by reviewing the paper ballots.", "Several experts on voting systems also told us the report betrayed a misunderstanding of election technology and process, and that it jumped to conclusions to proclaim fraud and make legal judgments.", "A core issue driving the allegations in Antrim County was an error that occurred in the reporting of the immediate, unofficial election results \u2014 which we\u2019ve explained before.", "A day after the election, the county\u00a0reported\u00a0that Biden was ahead of Trump by about 3,000 votes, with 98% of votes counted \u2014 results that surprised many, since the county is reliably Republican.", "But election officials soon found the suspicious results were the result of a\u00a0human error \u2014 and that Trump was actually leading in the vote count. Dominion Voting Systems has also said the \u201cissue with election results reporting in Antrim County was due to user-error.\u201d", "The matter came down to the fact that the county clerk \u201caccidentally did not update the software used to collect voting machine data,\u201d the Michigan Department of State, which oversees the state\u2019s elections, said in a Nov. 6 statement.", "Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy,\u00a0a Republican who has been with the office for 41 years, said in a phone interview with us that the error was her own.", "More specifically, the error occurred because the county had to\u00a0change\u00a0some ballots to update some local races \u2014 such as a missing candidate in Mancelona Township. The county then reprogrammed some, but not all, of the cards that are used in the tabulators that count the ballots across the county.", "When the county\u2019s unofficial results were compiled, some of the precincts\u2019 data was incorrectly added because of the difference in programming.", "A correction to the unofficial vote totals was\u00a0made Nov. 5.", "\u201cI must emphasize that the human error did not in any way, shape or form affect the official election results of Antrim County,\u201d Guy\u00a0said\u00a0at a state legislative hearing. Guy also pointed out that, if the elections officials didn\u2019t catch the error when they did, it would have been caught during the county canvass process\u00a0because the tabulator machines provided receipts that recorded the votes correctly.", "The Ramsland report said it didn\u2019t accept the explanation for the error, writing: \u201cWe disagree and conclude that the vote flip occurred because of machine error built into the voting software designed to create error.\u201d", "In a rebuttal to the report he submitted to Michigan and federal legislators, Ryan Macias, former acting director of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission\u2019s Voting System Testing and Certification Program, noted that the ballot definition files (used in the tabulator cards) \u201care not part of the certified voting system software, are unique to every election, and are regularly updated in advance of the election.\u201d", "Macias said the report showed \u201cASOG has a grave misunderstanding of the DVS DSuite 5.5 voting system, a lack of knowledge of election technology and process, and therefore, has come to a preposterous conclusion.\u201d", "Other experts also said the report doesn\u2019t back up its claims that Dominion\u2019s software had been designed to allow election fraud.", "\u201cIn Antrim County, some elections office staff made an error in data handling\u2026 and they caught the mistake, and fixed it,\u201d John Sebes, the co-founder and chief technology officer of the nonpartisan Open Source Elections Technology Institute, said in a phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s making mistakes and catching mistakes, it\u2019s not committing fraud.\u201d", "There are other issues with the report, too.", "One of the specific claims made in the report \u2014 which was turned into a Twitter talking point by Trump \u2014 was that a \u201ctabulation log for the forensic examination of the server for Antrim County from December 6, 2020 consists of 15,676 individual events, of which 10,667 or 68.05% of the events were recorded errors. These errors resulted in overall tabulation errors or ballots being sent to adjudication.\u201d", "But that \u201cis based on a lack of understanding of the voting system,\u201d Macias wrote.", "Macias told us in a phone interview that the \u201cerrors\u201d described in the report are, essentially, entries of alerts from tabulation event logs \u2014 and that they don\u2019t mean that something went wrong.", "The terms referenced in the report \u2014 \u201cdivert,\u201d \u201creversed\u201d and \u201coverride\u201d \u2014 refer to standard, expected responses as the tabulators process the paper ballots, he wrote in his rebuttal.", "For example, diverted ballots could be a ballot that is \u201cmarked by the voter with specific conditions (i.e., voter voted for a write-in or overvoted a contest),\u201d so it is separated from the other ballots to be counted by elections officials. A reversed ballot, meanwhile, is a ballot being returned to the voter for some reason (it could be damaged, or be a ballot for the wrong precinct).", "\u201cTo draw an analogy, calling these an error would be synonymous with stating that you reviewed a car\u2019s logs and for each instance that the gas light turned on we will call it an error,\u201d he wrote.", "Ramsland\u2019s report also claims that \u201c[i]n the logs we identified that the RCV or Ranked Choice Voting Algorithm was enabled\u2026 This allows the user to apply a weighted numerical value to candidates and change the overall result.\u201d", "Macias said the Dominion product used in Antrim County \u201cdoes not have the capability to run the RCV algorithm.\u201d", "Dan Wallach, a computer science professor at Rice University who researches voting security, further said\u00a0\u201cjust because the [RCV] feature is enabled doesn\u2019t mean you have any races that use it.\u201d", "\u201cRanked choice voting necessarily implies that there is a way for voters to specify a ranking\u201d on the ballot, he said.\u00a0But there wasn\u2019t in Antrim County.", "Michigan Director of Elections Jonathan Brater noted in a Dec. 13 affidavit, \u201cRanked Choice Voting is not authorized by the Michigan Election Law for use in federal or state-level elections.\u201d", "Duncan Buell, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of South Carolina, said the report seemed eager to conclude fraud. He said Dominion\u2019s software isn\u2019t perfect, but that isn\u2019t the same as a company creating software to commit fraud.", "\u201cWhen I read this report what I see \u2026 is that every time there is a problem referenced in the software, the report instantly jumps to malice and intent,\u201d Buell said.", "He said that the existence of the hand-marked, paper ballots allowed for confidence in the results.", "\u201cThe audit of the human-marked paper is going to be the best record we have of what the voters intended,\u201d he said.", "And, as we said, the audit has now affirmed that the systems used didn\u2019t change the outcome.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
