Does that not really matter? Stopping Poll Watchers, voting for unsuspecting people, fake ballots and so much more. Such egregious conduct. We will win!", "There is no reading of this claim that makes it accurate.", "Trump might be recycling the inaccurate claim that in pivotal states, there were more votes than registered voters. Charges of that sort circulated quickly right after Election Day, and they were simply wrong.", "Trump didn\u2019t specify which states he had in mind \u2014 and our request for details from the White House and the Trump campaign went unanswered.

The same voter database process works that direction, too. The voter\u2019s appearance at the polling station is recorded and if a mailed ballot appears, it is saved, but not counted.", "Trump said that in key swing states, there were more votes than people voting, \"in big numbers.\"", "There is zero proof. If he meant there were more votes cast than registered voters, election data show the opposite. In the six key states we examined, there were between several hundred thousand and 2 million more registered voters than votes cast.", "If he meant that there was a lot of double voting, his lawyers have provided no evidence to back that up.
