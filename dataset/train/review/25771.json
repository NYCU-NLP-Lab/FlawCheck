["Someone pointedly pranked Carly Fiorina with this website around the time she announced her presidential bid.", "Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, announced on May 4, 2015, that she\u2019d be running for president as a Republican. But a cyber-squatter had moved fast to grab the Web address carlyfiorina.org and flame her.", "Using a simple gray-and-white color scheme and uninspired fonts, the domain owner recalled Fiorina\u2019s controversial six-year tenure as CEO of the computer maker by addressing visitors to the page this way:", "\"Carly Fiorina failed to register this domain.", "\"So I'm using it to tell you how many people she laid off at Hewlett-Packard.", "\"It was this many:\"", "At that point, a very long list of frowny-face icons begins.", "After much scrolling, the page concludes:", "\"That's 30,000 people she laid off. People with families. And what does she say she would have done differently?", "\" \u2018I would have done them all faster.\u2019", "\"\u2014Carly Fiorina\"", "Is the cyber-squatter -- who didn\u2019t identify themselves on the site -- correct? The 30,000 number is largely accurate (we fact-checked it back in 2010), but we wondered whether it\u2019s correct that Fiorina actually said she would have rather laid off people faster.", "First, some background. Fiorina was named CEO of Hewlett-Packard in July 1999, becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 100 company. She reorganized the company's structure and pushed for a controversial 2002 merger with Compaq Computer Corp. in an attempt to get a greater share of the personal computer market. The merger succeeded, but HP's board fired her anyway in February 2005 (with a $21 million severance package), primarily due to the company's sluggish stock price and missed earnings targets. Her actions at HP spawned detractors as well as defenders.", "We looked at the numerical part of the claim in 2010, the year Fiorina ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. The charge was made in an attack ad by Boxer.", "We found that Fiorina herself cited the 30,000-layoff figure in an interview with InformationWeek on Oct. 16, 2006. \"When we combined the R&D budgets of HP and Compaq, we didn't have to have two R&D teams working on industry standard servers, for instance. We could have one. That's why the merger was such a great idea. We could decrease the cost structure by billions and billions of dollars. In the course of my time there, we laid off over 30,000 people. That's why I understand where the anger came from.\"", "Fiorina\u2019s staff did not respond to an inquiry. Their official website, by the way, is www.carlyforpresident.com.", "But did Fiorina say that she wishes she\u2019d done those 30,000 layoffs \"faster\"? This is more problematic.", "It stems from a 2005 article in Fortune magazine (reprinted here in 2011). The comment came in a section devoted to the departure of some of the company\u2019s senior executives after the merger. Here\u2019s an excerpt:", "\"Fiorina summarily fired \u2014 within hours \u2014 the head of enterprise sales, Peter Blackmore, and two of his senior executives. The speed and visibility of the move caused the tech industry to view the firings as an unnecessarily cruel public hanging, and criticism of Fiorina flared. She argues back, saying that a hanging it wasn\u2019t and that in truth these people were treated, in the usual HP manner, with \u2018respect, candor, and compassion.\u2019 But she also says that some of the European problems had been ripening for a time and that these three very senior executives clearly \u2018dropped the ball.\u2019 She believes in accountability, she says, so the men are gone. \u2026", "\"Under Fiorina (HP) has lost \u2014 via firings, resignations, and retirements \u2014 a noticeable number of its top people. Here\u2019s one indicator of what some people call the \u2018brain drain\u2019: Of the 11 \u2018direct reports\u2019 that Fiorina had in October 2003, one died and five others are gone. Michael Capellas, CEO of Compaq when the merger was done, left early. Former HP employees can also, without much effort, list another 20 well-placed executives who have departed, a few of them going to competitors Dell and storage company EMC.", "\"Fiorina does not agree, naturally, that there\u2019s been a brain drain. In fact, she believes that one lesson she\u2019s learned while running HP is that she should have moved more quickly in ejecting certain people. Smartened up now, she says, \u2018I would have done them all faster. Every person that I\u2019ve asked to leave, whether it\u2019s been clear publicly or not, I would have done faster.\u2019 \"", "This puts Fiorina\u2019s comment in a somewhat different light. Rather than musing that she should have laid off 30,000 people faster, the full article suggests she\u2019s referring to a select group of high-ranking executives.", "Our ruling", "The cyber-squatter site claims that after laying off \"30,000 people,\" Carly Fiorina said that in retrospect, \"I would have done them all faster.\"", "While the number is accurate -- acknowledged in a 2006 interview by Fiorina -- the comment that \"I would have done them all faster\" is pulled out of context. In fact, Fiorina was more specifically referring to her decisions to force out a small number of top-level executives, not tens of thousands of rank-and-file employees.
