["Republicans are once again attacking Congressional Democrats on Medicare spending cuts, using a line of attack that has been roundly discredited.\n\nIn a series of news releases dealing with the national health care reform law, the National Republican Congressional Committee on Aug. 14 claimed 37 House Democrats are \"willing to jeopardize seniors\u2019 access to coverage by gutting $741 billion from Medicare\" to pay for a \"big-government healthcare takeover.\"\n\nThose Democrats include New Jersey Reps. Rush Holt, Frank Pallone and Bill Pascrell, all of whom voted for the reform in March 2010. They\u2019re also up for reelection this November against GOP challengers.\n\nPolitiFact National recently issued a Mostly False to presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney for claiming President Barack Obama \"robbed\" Medicare of $716 billion to pay for the reform.\n\nBy attacking the congressmen, the committee makes the same mistake as Romney, but then goes one step further in rehashing that myth about the reform being a government takeover.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll talk about the reduction in Medicare spending.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Republicans have frequently criticized the reform for cutting $500 billion from Medicare. U.S. Reps. Jon Runyan and Scott Garrett have each received Mostly False rulings for repeating that claim.\n\nBut the reform does not cut $500 billion from the current Medicare budget. Instead, the reform aims to slow the program\u2019s future spending growth.\n\nSo, that $500 billion has represented the reduction in spending increases during the 2012-2021 period, according to a 2011 estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nIn its latest estimate released last month, the budget office said the reform would reduce future Medicare spending by $716 billion between 2013 and 2022. The $741 billion figure cited by the committee includes that Medicare spending and money for other federal programs.\n\nMost of those Medicare savings come from reducing annual increases in payments to certain health care providers. The reduction in Medicare spending helps offset other costs created by the reform.\n\nBut the committee is wrong to claim Democrats support \"gutting\" Medicare. Program spending will still increase under the reform, but just at a slower pace.\n\nNow, we\u2019ll address whether the reform represents a \"big-government healthcare takeover.\"\n\nThat claim has been debunked numerous times and was ultimately named PolitiFact\u2019s 2010 Lie of the Year. PolitiFact New Jersey issued a Pants on Fire to Gov. Chris Christie for repeating the line in October 2011.\n\nThe reform does impose more government regulations on individuals, employers and private insurance companies. For instance, people must purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty, with some exemptions. Also, insurers can sell coverage through new insurance exchanges as long as they meet certain federal standards.\n\nBut the reform does not create a new public health insurance plan, and it doesn\u2019t eliminate the private health insurance industry. In fact, more people will become enrolled in private insurance plans under the reform, according to budget office projections.\n\nIn response to our findings, the committee didn\u2019t back down from its original claims.\n\n\"Democrats stole from seniors\u2019 Medicare benefits to pay for their government takeover of healthcare,\" NRCC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek said in an e-mail. \"Their addiction to government spending sprees has crossed the line by threatening seniors\u2019 access to healthcare, and New Jersey families will stop this reckless behavior this November.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn news releases, the committee claimed Holt, Pallone and Pascrell are \"willing to jeopardize seniors\u2019 access to coverage by gutting $741 billion from Medicare\" to pay for a \"big-government healthcare takeover.\"\n\nThe health care reform is projected to reduce future Medicare spending by more than $700 billion between 2013 and 2022, but program spending will still increase. That increase will just be smaller than without the reform.\n\nThe \"healthcare takeover\" claim remains bogus, because the private health insurance industry remains intact under the reform and stands to gain more enrollees.\n\nThere\u2019s only one ruling for such heated and misleading claims: Pants on Fire!", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "National Republican Congressional Committee, #IWANTREPEAL: If Dems Have Their Way, Medicare Will Be Broke in 12 Years, Aug. 14, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, Mitt Romney said Barack Obama robs Medicare of more than $700 billion to pay for Obamacare, Aug. 15, 2012\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Letter to the Honorable John Boehner providing an estimate for H.R. 6079, the Repeal of Obamacare Act, July 24, 2012\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey, Scott Garrett claims Affordable Care Act cuts Medicare funding, creates \"rationing board\", Aug. 3, 2012\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey, Jon Runyan claims Affordable Care Act cuts Medicare program by $500 billion, June 29, 2012\n\nCongressional Budget Office, CBO\u2019s Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010, March 30, 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, The 2012 Long-Term Budget Outlook, June 2012\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Medicare -- March 2012 Baseline, March 13, 2012\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, Health Reform and Medicare: Overview of Key Provisions, July 2010\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, March 20, 2010\n\nMinnesota Public Radio, PoliGraph: GOP claim on Obama Medicare cuts misleads, Aug. 15, 2012\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey, Chris Christie slams health care reform as \"a government takeover of health care\", Oct. 23, 2011\n\nKaiser Health News, FAQ: How Paul Ryan Proposes To Change Medicare, Aug. 13, 2012\n\nPhone and e-mail interview with Andrea Bozek, spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, Aug. 16, 2012\n\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2011 Medicare Trustees Report, May 13, 2011\n\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2012 Medicare Trustees Report, April 23, 2012", "FactCheck.org, Romney, Obama Uphold Health Care Falsehoods, June 28, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
