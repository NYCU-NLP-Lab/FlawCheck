Cuomo wants state lawmakers to pass a bill he believes would prevent more women from being murdered by people close to them.", "The bill would remove guns from people convicted on misdemeanor domestic violence charges.

New York state already has one of the lowest rates of gun-caused death in the country, but Cuomo believes the proposal could drive that number lower.", "Is he right that half of women murdered in the U.S. are killed by their intimate partners?", "The data", "Cuomo\u2019s claim comes from data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2017.", "The agency looked at the homicides of 10,018 adult women in 18\u00a0states from 2003 to 2014.", "The circumstances of the homicide were\u00a0known in 8,028 of the cases.", "Of those, 4,442 homicides, or 55.3 percent, were related to intimate partner violence.
