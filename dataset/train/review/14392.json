Tom Tiffany, a Republican who won an open seat in Congress in a May 11, 2020 special election, is off to Washington -- but still has his sights set on state government and how it is handling the coronavirus crisis.", "Tiffany, who spent nearly seven years as a state Senator before winning the seat, tweeted this on May 26, 2020:", "\"First the health secretary says don't go to hospitals or clinics, now the tourism secretary says don't recreate. What next, the education governor saying no school this fall?\"", "The tweet linked to an online article from a Madison-based TV station. It came on the day Democrat Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 stay-at-home order originally was going to expire.
