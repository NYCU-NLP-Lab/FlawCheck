Bernie Sanders at the University of New Hampshire. She says she now opposes it.", "MSNBC debate moderator Chuck Todd pointed out that Clinton supported the deal while secretary of state, then asked her whether she might support such agreements again if she were elected.", "Clinton said she had voted against a previous trade deal as a U.S. senator and, regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership, \"I said that I was holding out the hope that (TPP) would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.", "\"I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the (Obama) administration,\" she said. \"Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.\"", "Did Clinton really withhold her support until the terms of the proposal had been finalized?", "PolitiFact has looked at the issue before. We found Clinton made plenty of strongly supportive comments about the deal while negotiations were still ongoing.", "Speaking in Australia in 2012, Clinton hailed the deal as \"setting the gold standard.\"", "\"This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field,\" Clinton said. \"And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.\"", "Strong words for a deal that hadn't been completed yet.
