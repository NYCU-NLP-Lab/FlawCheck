(AP)", "Two weeks until Election Day, social media is rife with attacks on Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden.", "A New York Post story about a recovered computer hard drive led to attacks about the Biden son\u2019s business dealings. Facebook and cable news have gone further to suggest new and unsupported theories about what\u2019s on the hard drive.", "One text post says, \"Hunter Biden had 25,000 pics of him torturing and raping children under age 10 in China on his laptop!\"", "Claims like this were amplified by websites like Natural News and InfoWars. Facebook has long banned the sites for posting anti-vaccine misinformation and hate speech, but we found one InfoWars video on Facebook with more than 173,000 views. It claims Trump \"has footage of Hunter Biden raping and torturing little girls.\"", "These posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

One user posing as Rion affirmed that speculation, saying the hard drive contained child pornography.", "The real Rion tweeted Oct. 16 that she did not write the posts.", "\"For the record: I do not post on chat forums,\" she wrote. \"I understand there are hoaxers posing as me.\"", "But it was too late. Social media users dedicated to QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that claims Trump is secretly fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic, left-leaning pedophiles, took the 4chan posts as evidence that the FBI was investigating Hunter Biden for potentially possessing child pornography.", "By Sunday, the conspiracy theory had made its way to Fox News. \"Sunday Morning Futures\" host Maria Bartiromo noted that a name written on the back of a federal subpoena included in the Post\u2019s story appears to belong to Joshua Wilson, an FBI agent who has worked on child pornography cases.", "\"Connect the dots: If an FBI agent is working on child pornography issues for five years, why is he subpoenaing the laptop of Hunter Biden?

The computer was supposedly left unclaimed at a Delaware computer shop, the owner of which called the FBI and a Giuliani associate after noticing a sticker for the Beau Biden Foundation on the laptop.
