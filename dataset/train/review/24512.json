A Village Voice profile described Zakaria (a naturalized citizen of the United States) thusly:", "Although he was a rising star in the serious foreign-policy world of the '90s (The Nation once described him as a \"junior Kissinger\"), it was his post-9/11 Newsweek cover story \"Why They Hate Us\" that put him on the mainstream map as someone who could make sense of the now threatening outside world. And he has continued to win himself a substantial following with his thoughtful critiques of the Bush administration's activities in Iraq. He is America's go-to man for global chaos, providing some urgently needed outside perspective on our never ending war on terror.His own upbringing was open-minded and secular; he sang Christian hymns at school and celebrated Hindu as well as his own Muslim holidays. \"I do know a lot about the world of Islam in an instinctive way that you can't get through book learning,\" he says thoughtfully, but admits he finds the role of token Muslim explainer in the American media slightly uncomfortable. \"I occasionally find myself reluctant to be pulled into a world that's not mine, in the sense that I'm not a religious guy.\"", "The following review (from Publishers Weekly) summarizes the thesis of The Post-American World", "When a book proclaims that it is not about the decline of America but the rise of everyone else, readers might expect another diatribe about our dismal post-9/11 world. They are in for a pleasant surprise as Newsweek editor and popular pundit Zakaria (The Future of Freedom) delivers a stimulating, largely optimistic forecast of where the 21st century is heading. We are living in a peaceful era, he maintains; world violence peaked around 1990 and has plummeted to a record low. Burgeoning prosperity has spread to the developing world, raising standards of living in Brazil, India, China andIndonesia. Twenty years ago China discarded Soviet economics but not its politics, leading to a wildly effective, top-down, scorched-earth boom. Its political antithesis, India, also prospers while remaining a chaotic, inefficient democracy, as Indian elected officials are (generally) loathe to use the brutally efficient tactics that are the staple of Chinese governance. Paradoxically, India's greatest asset is its relative stability in the region; its officials take an unruly population for granted, while dissent produces paranoia in Chinese leaders. Zakaria predicts that despite its record of recent blunders at home and abroad, America will stay strong, buoyed by a stellar educational system and the influx of young immigrants, who give the U.S. a more youthful demographic than Europe and much of Asia whose workers support an increasing population of unproductive elderly. A lucid, thought-provoking appraisal of world affairs, this book will engage readers on both sides of the political spectrum.", "As for what the chief executive reads in his spare time, according to deputy press secretary Bill Burton, President Obama brought the following books with him to his August 2009 vacation at Martha's Vineyard:", "In 2015, President Obama's summer reading list, as announced by the White House, included the following books:", "arner, Dwight. \u00a0 \"What Obama Is Reading.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 21 May 2008.", "Joffe, Josef. \u00a0 \"The New New World.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 11 May 2008.", "Press, Joy. \u00a0 \"The Interpreter.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Village Voice. \u00a0 9 August 2005.", "Wolf, Richard. \u00a0 \"President's Reading List a Hefty One.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 USA Today. \u00a0 24 August 2009.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
