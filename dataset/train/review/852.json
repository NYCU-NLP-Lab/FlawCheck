["The president made misleading boasts about his record on the economy and foreign issues.", "By Robert Farley, Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on September 19, 2017", "In his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly, President Donald Trump reprised misleading talking points on everything from job growth to defense spending.", "We\u2019ve written about variations of some of these claims numerous times, but since these comments were made to a world audience, we are revisiting some of them.\u00a0We also cover new claims the president made on foreign issues.", "The president addressed the U.N. on Sept. 19 in New York.", "Trump boasted that \u201cunemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years.\u201d", "The unemployment rate in August was 4.4 percent, up a tick from 4.3 percent in July, but down from the 4.7 percent rate Trump inherited in January. The unemployment rate briefly hit the same 4.4 percent in 2006 and 2007, but to find a rate lower than that, as Trump says, you\u2019d need to go 16 years back, to early 2001. But as with several other statistics, Trump is taking credit for a trend that long predates his presidency.", "As this chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows, the unemployment rate has steadily declined since its peak at 10 percent in October 2009 during the Great Recession.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Trump claimed that \u201cbecause of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before.\u201d In raw numbers, total nonfarm employment hit a record high in August at 146,730,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But there\u2019s less there than meets the eye.", "The U.S. population is also constantly on the rise. There have been \u201cmore people working\u201d in the U.S. than ever before many, many times since BLS started tracking the data in 1939. Obama could have made that claim every month from mid-2014 on.", "By another measure, the employment-population ratio of people in the U.S. age 16 and over was 60.1 percent in August, slightly higher than nearly every month under Obama, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But it\u2019s not the highest ratio \u201cever.\u201d It was higher in the first two months of Obama\u2019s presidency, and higher every month prior to Obama\u2019s presidency going all the way back to September 1985.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Trump wrongly claimed companies are \u201cmoving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.\u201d In fact, the job gains have been fewer under Trump than they were during the same time frame in each of the previous four years.", "The U.S. has been steadily adding jobs every month since early 2010, according to the BLS.", "\u201cThe job market is great and getting better,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told us back in June when Trump similarly boasted about job growth as a result of his election. \u201cBut it is unfair to say the good economic news began with Trump\u2019s election. The economy has been consistently creating jobs for about 7 years \u2013 a record length of time. And the pace of job growth has been very consistent; the same before and after the President\u2019s inauguration. The economy was on fundamentally solid ground when Trump took office, and that hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d", "The\u00a0nation has now experienced positive job growth for 83 straight months, with 76 of those under Trump\u2019s predecessor.", "Indeed, the job gains under Trump, although similar to those during Obama\u2019s last few years in office, have been slightly lower. The economy added 1,189,000 net new jobs since Trump took office in January. That\u2019s slightly fewer than the 1,375,000 jobs added in the preceding seven months.", "It\u2019s also fewer jobs than were added during the same time period of 2016 (1,422,000), 2015 (1,547,000), 2014 (1,734,000) and 2013 (1,384,000).", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Trump also touted the rise of the stock market since his election victory in November. \u201cThe stock market is at an all-time high, a record,\u201d he said.", "That\u2019s true, but it has reached new heights regularly in recent years after recovering from the Great Recession, which plunged the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a 12-year low in 2009.", "The Dow Jones closed at 6,547.05 on March 9, 2009 \u2014 its lowest point since April 15, 1997. It has been climbing back ever since and reached a new high on March 5, 2013, when it \u201cclosed at 14,253.77, topping the previous record of 14,164.53 on Oct. 9, 2007, by 89.24 points,\u201d as the Associated Press reported at the time.

In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined. We seek the deescalation of the Syrian conflict and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people.", "We asked the White House press office about this claim, and a similar boast Trump made in late August, when he claimed \u201crecord-breaking success\u201d against ISIS since his inauguration. But we haven\u2019t received an on-the-record response.", "However, an Aug. 4\u00a0Washington Post story quoted an administration official saying military gains against ISIS have \u201cdramatically accelerated\u201d under Trump\u2019s presidency. But that article included some statistics that contradict Trump\u2019s claim that there has been more achievement in eight months than in \u201cmany, many years combined.\u201d", "The Post quoted Brett McGurk, the State Department\u2019s special presidential envoy for the\u00a0Global Coalition to Counter ISIS. McGurk credited moves by Trump, such as giving more decision-making authority to on-the-ground commanders rather than the White House, for increasing success against ISIS. He said, according to the Post, that ISIS had lost about 27,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria since a peak for the group in early 2015. And nearly a third of that \u2014 about 8,000 square miles of territory \u2014 had been regained during Trump\u2019s time in office.", "That certainly shows an \u201caccelerated\u201d gain, as McGurk said. But there would have been more achievement \u2013 more than two-thirds of the territory reclaimed \u2013 from early 2015 to early 2017. That\u2019s the opposite of what Trump claimed in his U.N. speech.", "The president could have instead said that the rate at which ISIS had lost territory had increased under his presidency. Other data lend support to that as well.", "The analytics and consulting firm IHS Markit released an analysis in late June that said ISIS had lost 30,400 square kilometers from January 2015 to January 2017, and another 24,200 square kilometers from the beginning of January through June. The terrorist group\u2019s territory totaled 90,800 square kilometers in January 2015, IHS Markit\u2019s first estimate.", "Those numbers show a 33.5 percent drop in Islamic State territory from 2015 to 2017, but a 40 percent drop since January, which of course would include nearly three weeks of the Obama administration.", "IHS Markit also released figures on the decline in the average monthly revenue for ISIS, though the time periods don\u2019t allow for a comparison of the drop under Obama and Trump. The figures show a 62 percent decline in average monthly revenue from the second quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016, and another 48 percent drop from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2017.", "The analysis said the Islamic State was \u201cunlikely to survive\u201d in 2018.", "Columb Strack, senior Middle East analyst at IHS Markit, said in the group\u2019s press release that ISIS\u2019 \u201crise and fall has been characterized by rapid inflation, followed by steady decline.\u201d", "Strack said: \u201cThe Islamic State\u2019s remaining caliphate is likely to break up before the end of the year, reducing its governance project to a string of isolated urban areas that will eventually be retaken over the course of 2018.\u201d", "Michael E. O\u2019Hanlon, a foreign policy senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told us that the president\u2019s time frame is off. \u201cISIS only seized its holdings in 2013/2014 so it\u2019s not an issue of many many years. And the tide really started to turn in 2016 with Obama,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon said in an email. \u201cThere is credit (and blame) to go around, and lots more work to do.\u201d", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Trump said the United States \u201ccontinues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance.\u201d That\u2019s true by volume, but not as a percentage of gross national income, or GNI, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

In 2014, the United States ranked at the bottom among major donors at 0.19% of GNI, tied with Japan (0.19%).
