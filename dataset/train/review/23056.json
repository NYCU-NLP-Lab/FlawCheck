["Citizen TV, Kenya\u2019s largest station by viewership, reported the forecasts in a story noting \u201cKenya\u2019s last recession was recorded in 1992.\u201d", "In a report on a recent World Bank review of Africa\u2019s economic prospects, the Citizen TV website claimed that Kenya\u2019s last recession was in 1992.", "A recession is defined as an economic contraction over six months, or two consecutive quarters of the year. Kenya only started reporting quarterly fluctuations in its economy in the year 2000.", "According to the country\u2019s statistics bureau, Kenya\u2019s most recent recession was in 2002, when GDP fell in both the second and third quarters.", "Kenya was one of a clutch of African countries whose 2020 economic growth could \u201cremain positive\u201d even as it slowed substantially, the World Bank said in its biannual review of the continent\u2019s prospects.", "This was because their economies were \u201cmore diversified\u201d and less reliant on natural resources, the development lender said in its October 2020 edition of Africa Pulse.", "Citizen TV, Kenya\u2019s largest station by viewership, reported on the forecasts in a website story headlined \u201cKenya tipped to escape recession on economic diversity\u201d.", "It noted: \u201cKenya\u2019s last recession was recorded in 1992.\u201d Is this accurate?", "When Africa Check asked the station for the source of its claim, Citizen TV directed us to a World Bank chart plotting changes in Kenya\u2019s gross domestic product, or GDP, since 1961. GDP measures the size of a country\u2019s economy. It is the market value of all goods and services produced in a given period, usually a year.", "The bank\u2019s data shows that in 1992, GDP contracted by -0.8%. But the chart does not not give GDP figures for each quarter \u2013 three months \u2013 of the year. Africa Check has previously looked into the definition of a recession and most experts we spoke to agreed it was two or more consecutive quarters of negative growth.", "The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) also defines a recession as \u201ctwo consecutive quarters\u201d of negative GDP growth, Benjamin Muchiri, the bureau\u2019s senior manager of national accounts, told Africa Check.", "Kwame Owino, chief executive of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a Kenyan think tank, said the best data on historical economic growth would be in the statistics bureau\u2019s annual economic surveys.", "According to the bureau's 1993 economic survey, Kenya\u2019s economy grew by 0.4% in 1992 \u2013 better than the World Bank\u2019s -08% contraction. But the survey also does not break this growth down by quarters.", "Muchiri explained why. \u201cThe earliest quarterly GDP available for Kenya is around 2000 and therefore we cannot tell from KNBS quarterly statistics if there were any two consecutive quarterly GDP contractions in 1992,\u201d he said.", "\u201cHowever, the year's real GDP growth rate was 0.4%, raising the possibility that there were contractions in more than one quarter.\u201d But more research would be required to establish if this was indeed the case, he said.", "Annual KNBS data shows that since 1990, Kenya\u2019s economy has contracted in only one year \u2013 in 2000, when it shrank by -0.3%. In 2002 this was revised to -0.2%. (Note: GDP figures are routinely restated as new economic data becomes available.)", "But the bureau\u2019s quarterly data, from 2000 on, reveals that Kenya last recorded a recession in 2002. \u201cWe had two consecutive contractions in 2002, of -1.2% in the second quarter and -2.5% for the third quarter,\u201d Muchiri said.", "This data appears in the bureau\u2019s first quarterly GDP report for 2007. But the contractions were for GDP at market prices. When inflation is taken into account, giving real GDP, the contractions were -1.7% and -2% respectively.", "Because both seasonally adjusted and non-adjusted figures were \u201cshowing a recession, there is no contradiction\u201d, Muchiri told Africa Check.", "While we have not seen data that proves or disproves that Kenya\u2019s last recession was in 1992, official data does show there was one 10 years later. We therefore rate Citizen TV\u2019s claim as incorrect.", "Reporting on a World Bank economic forecast for Africa, Kenya's largest TV station claimed on its website that the country last posted a recession, or two consecutive quarters of negative growth, in 1992.", "While a recession may or may not have been recorded in 1992, the country\u2019s national data agency told Africa Check it did not have quarterly data for the years before 2000.", "Its earliest available official quarterly data shows Kenya\u2019s most recent recession was in 2002.", "Further reading:", "https://africacheck.org/2018/09/21/analysis-when-is-a-recession-not-a-recession/", "Please complete this form to receive the HTML sharing code.", "Africa Check values your trust and is committed to the responsible management, use and protection of personal information.
