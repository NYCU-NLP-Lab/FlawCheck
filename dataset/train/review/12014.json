And while I believe we need a country that is welcoming of all Americans, regardless of who they are, everybody and their dog knows that evangelicals, babies, and nuns don't count.\"", "The article concluded, referencing a portion of Scripture that holds nothing shall be added to the Bible:", "\"Finally, I can stop spending time ignoring the parts of the Bible I hate and instead start rewriting the parts of the Bible I hate. After all, love wins!\"", "While Obama wanted merely to remove the thousands of references to men and women from the sacred text, Bell has already added a few of his own ideas for the new edition. These include:", "-- Editing out every reference to the term \"Christian,\" as Jesus would be mortified about the idea that the word in question was being used. At all. In any circumstance.", "-- Omitting all references to eternal punishment or damnation, especially Jesus' parable about the Rich Man and Lazarus. After all, Jesus would be mortified about that being there also.", "-- Removing all verses that refer to homosexuality and extramarital sex as sinful and replacing them with the phrase \"Love Wins!\"", "Christian Post isn't a satirical web site and typically delivers straight news from an Evangelical perspective.
