["By Robert Farley", "Posted on November 24, 2020", "Provided President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s Electoral College margin of victory holds \u2014 and we have seen no reason so far to believe it will not \u2014 it will be the same margin won by Donald Trump in 2016.", "That would leave Biden (as it did Trump) in the bottom third when ranking presidents by the percentage of Electoral College votes.", "Back in 2016, Trump wrongly called his victory a \u201clandslide.\u201d Now, some are taking a page out of Trump\u2019s book to claim Biden won in a landslide. But it wasn\u2019t accurate for Trump then, and it\u2019s not accurate for Biden now.", "Here\u2019s how Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, who will be Biden\u2019s director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, put it on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Nov. 22:", "Richmond, Nov. 22: This was a fair election. Joe Biden won by over 6 million votes in the popular vote. 306 electoral votes, which is the exact same number that Donald Trump had that he called a landslide. So, Joe Biden won with a mandate and a landslide and now it\u2019s time to transition.", "The problem, of course, is that Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral margin of victory \u2014 while convincing \u2014 was not a landslide by historical standards, as we wrote on Nov. 29, 2016.", "The same is true of Biden\u2019s Electoral College margin of victory. According to the media\u2019s projected winner of every state, Biden captured 306 electoral votes, compared to 232 for Trump. That\u2019s the same margin won by Trump in 2016 (though he ultimately lost a couple faithless electors). And as we said back in 2016, that only put Trump in 46th place out of 58 U.S. presidential elections.", "\u201cThat total was not a landslide then, and it still isn\u2019t,\u201d John Pitney, a professor of American Politics at Claremont McKenna College, told us via email. \u201cIt is a clear, significant, legitimate victory, but is toward the lower end for electoral vote shares of winning candidates.\u201d", "Democrats still have plenty to be happy about, Pitney said, noting that:", "When we wrote about the historical margin of Trump\u2019s victory back in 2016, all of the state results had been certified, and at this point less than half of the states have certified their election results. And as we did in 2016, we again add the disclaimer that these calculations assume Electoral College electors will vote according to who won a plurality of votes in their state, and that recounts will not overturn any of the state results. (Oddly, the Republican National Committee on Nov. 19 tweeted a video of attorney Sidney Powell making the baseless claim that, \u201cPresident Trump won by a landslide,\u201d and promising to \u201cprove it.\u201d The Trump campaign since has said that Powell is not a member of the Trump legal team.)", "But provided the numbers hold up, as we said, it would be a relatively close win for Biden by historical comparison of Electoral College margins of victory.", "According to current vote tallies, Biden leads Trump in the popular vote count by just over 6 million votes. By comparison, Trump lost the popular vote in 2016 to Hillary Clinton by nearly 2.9 million votes, making Trump one of five U.S. presidents to have lost the popular vote.", "FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver notes that Biden\u2019s current 4 percentage point lead in the popular vote \u2014 which Silver projects could grow to about 5 percentage points once all the votes are counted \u2014 is already a wider margin than Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 win against Mitt Romney, though not as large as Obama\u2019s 2008 win over John McCain, making Biden\u2019s the second-largest popular vote margin since 2000.", "\u201cFor the popular vote, an old rule of thumb is that a \u2018landslide\u2019 is 55 percent or greater,\u201d Pitney told us. \u201cBiden will get 51 percent, maybe a little more, but no \u2018landslide\u2019 by customary standards.\u201d", "Biden has avoided calling his victory a landslide, or anything like that, though he did claim via Twitter on Nov. 6 that the record number of votes for him in an American election gave him a \u201cmandate for action.\u201d", "What is becoming clearer each hour is that record numbers of Americans \u2014 from all races, faiths, regions \u2014 chose change over more of the same.", "They have given us a mandate for action on COVID and the economy and climate change and systemic racism.", "\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) November 7, 2020", "It\u2019s not unusual for presidents to claim an electoral \u201cmandate,\u201d even when the margin of victory is razor thin.", "Two days after George W. Bush won reelection in 2004 with an Electoral College victory of 286 to 251, one of the closest in modern history, he told reporters that, \u201cwhen you win, there is a feeling that the people have spoken and embraced your point of view.\u201d", "\u201cI earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it,\u201d Bush said.", "But Trump embellished well beyond that in 2016, calling his win \u201ca massive landslide victory.\u201d", "Biden campaign officials have been quick to pick up on that, as Biden-Harris Transition Senior Adviser Kate Bedingfield did in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Nov. 22.", "\u201cHe won 306 Electoral College votes, which is \u2026 the same outcome from 2016 that Donald Trump called a landslide when he won 306 Electoral College votes,\u201d Bedingfield said.", "That\u2019s true. It\u2019s also true that neither Trump nor Biden won in a \u201clandslide.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
