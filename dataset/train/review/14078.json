["A Twitter user Shekhar Chahal shared a WhatsApp chat with an alleged Pakistani, who is a resident of Balakot, to claim that the Indian air force\u2019s recent air strike killed 292 terrorists of JeM. Chahal is followed by prime minister Narendra Modi on Twitter.", "In the chat, Chahal\u2019s \u2018friend\u2019 said that his mother is the dean of Balakot medical university and was responsible for examining the dead bodies of the slain terrorists.", "Chahal has also shared the alleged conversation on his Facebook profile.", "Exclusive #PROOF of #AirStrikes One of My Friend\u2019s Known From PAKISTAN Claimed That Around 292 Terrorists Killed in\u2026", "Posted by Shekhar Chahal on Monday, 4 March 2019", "Alt News looked up \u2018Balakot medical university\u2019 on Google but the search engine threw up no results. Chahal, however, tweeted a link, claiming that it pertains to the said university. But the link has no mention of the medical college. A few users called out his chicanery.", "Alt News also looked up existing medical universities in Balakot on Google Maps. However, as there seem to be no medical colleges in Balakot, Google maps threw up universities in nearby areas. One of the closest universities, Azad Jammu & Kashmir medical college, is situated at a distance of about 40 km from Balakot.", "The airforce is yet to provide any details on the number of casualties in the airstrike. In a recent press briefing, Air vice-marshal RGK Kapoor stated it is premature to ascertain the number of casualties. Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa on March 4 said that it is not for the air force to count the number of casualties and the government provides such details. The only detail that the government has, however, provided is union minister SS Ahluwalia\u2019s statement that the Indian air force strike in Balakot did not intend to inflict \u201cany human casualty\u201d but was to send out the message that India is capable of hitting deep inside enemy lines.", "Despite BJP president Amit Shah\u2019s claims that 250 terrorists were killed in the Balakot airstrike, there is no evidence to back the statement. In fact, the Defence minister herself said that there are \u201cno numbers\u201d to give out.", "The WhatsApp chat uploaded Chahal was clearly manufactured, the poor attempt at Urdu giving away its fallacy. Several basic Urdu words were misspelt in the conversation.", "For instance, \u2018nazdiki\u2019 was spelt was \u2018najdiki\u2019; \u2018pareshan\u2019 was written as \u2018paresan\u2019; \u2018Alhamdulillah\u2019 was spelt as \u2018Allamuddiah\u2019; \u2018tashreef\u2019 was written as \u2018tasreef\u2019.", "A few other words like \u2018ghayalo\u2019 and \u2018aantankvaad\u2019 are Hindi words. A person living in Pakistan, fluent in Urdu, is most likely to use \u2018zakhmi\u2019 for the former and \u2018dehshat gardi\u2019 for the latter.", "Furthermore, a few sentences in the chat do not make any sense and it appears that Urdu words were forcefully added mid-sentence. \u201cPar ye galat hai na loc cross krna..khair allah fitrat kre\u201d \u2013 was one of the messages sent by Chahal\u2019s \u2018friend\u2019 from across the border. However, the word \u2018fitrat\u2019, which means \u2018character\u2019 or \u2018habit\u2019, is not applicable here. What the \u2018friend\u2019 perhaps meant was \u2018allah khair/hifazat kare\u2019, which basically means \u2018May God bless you\u2019.", "Another sentence, \u201caur allamuddiah media bhi imran ke ishare pe chalti hai\u201d, makes no sense as the word \u2018Alhamdulillah\u2019 means \u2018praise the God\u2019 and is used while thanking for blessings.", "The aftermath of the Balakot air strike has seen a massive amount of misinformation circulating online, with several users posting fake videos and images to prove that the air strike caused severe damage in Pakistan.", "Donate Now", "Pooja Chaudhuri is a senior editor at Alt News.", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
