Philip Pizzo of St. Benedict Joseph Labre Roman Catholic Church in Richmond Hill, a neighborhood in Queens. The meme he posted depicted a man falling from a skyscraper accompanied by the words, \"Show your hate for Trump. Do it for social justice. #JumpAgainstTrump.\"", "Although it's unclear why, news stories about the resulting controversy re-circulated in February 2020, prompting some Snopes readers to ask whether the stories were true.", "The meme, posted to Pizzo's personal Facebook page, upset parishioners, some of whom told the New York Post at the time that they planned to seek a different place to worship.
