["The claim was posted on Advance New Zealand\u2019s Facebook page here on December 1, 2020. The post has been shared more than 260 times.", "The post claims that \u201cmRNA vaccines intervene directly in the genetic material of the patient and therefore alter the individual genetic material, which represents the [sic] genetic manipulation\u201d.", "It adds that\u00a0\u201cintervention can be compared to genetically manipulated food\u201d and that \u201cafter an unprecedented mRNA vaccine, you will no longer be able to treat the vaccine symptoms in a complementary way\u201d.", "The post goes on to state\u00a0that if an inoculated patient develops Covid-19 symptoms, they will not be able to be treated \u201cbecause the damage caused by the vaccination will be genetically irreversible\u201d.", "The Advance New Zealand post claims that the author of the text is\u00a0Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nephew of US President John F. Kennedy. AFP found no evidence that Kennedy was the source of the misinformation, but he has promoted falsehoods about vaccines in the past, as explained in this article by UK-based media site\u00a0Tortoise.", "The text in the post has also been shared hundreds of times on Facebook here, here and here.", "The posts' claims are false, according to experts.", "A Covid-19 mRNA vaccine, which is the basis for two of the leading vaccine candidates, instructs human cells to make a protein found in the Covid-19 virus, rather than using a weakened version of the virus.", "After the immune system recognises the foreign protein, it begins \u201cbuilding an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19,\u201d according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "The notion that mRNA vaccines can manipulate a patient's genome is a \u201cbiological impossibility,\u201d Associate Professor\u00a0Helen Petousis-Harris,\u00a0vaccinologist\u00a0at the University of Auckland, told AFP in a December 7 email.", "\u201cRNA vaccines cannot alter or in any way interact with a person\u2019s genome,\u201d she said.", "Petousis said\u00a0the claim in the Facebook posts is false because \u201cour genes are contained in the nucleus of our cells and RNA has no access to this area\u201d and \u201cthere are no instructions in the vaccine that make it possible.\u201d", "\u201cThe RNA in the vaccine is taken up by cells at the injection site and the instructions for the production of the vaccine antigen/the antibody generator executed. At that point the RNA is broken down into its basic building blocks to be recycled,\u201d she said.", "University of Canterbury epidemiologist Associate Professor Arindam Basu told AFP in an email that mRNA vaccines and genetically modified foods are \u201ctwo completely different concepts.\u201d", "\u201cGenetically modified foods are produced by manipulating the \u2018genetic code\u2019 or DNA of the organisms,\u201d he said, adding that it is impossible for RNA to be incorporated into human DNA.", "\u201cThis vaccine will enter a cell, the cell will use the information contained in mRNA to assemble a spike protein like molecule and the immune system will generate antibodies that will circulate in the bloodstream and will neutralize if and when an active infection is encountered,\u201d Basu explained.", "In response to the misleading Facebook posts, Petousis-Harris and Basu both told AFP that it is false to suggest patients will not\u00a0be treated if they develop Covid-19 symptoms after being inoculated.", "\u201cThere will be no difference in the way someone\u2019s disease is managed. For the majority for whom the vaccine fails, they are more likely to have mild symptoms. So far only one person in the mRNA trials who got a vaccine has had serious disease - out of tens of thousands,\u201d Petousis-Harris said.", "Basu said:\u00a0\u201cIf someone ends up with COVID19 symptoms [after being vaccinated], it means that the vaccine did not produce antibodies that were aimed at neutralizing the virus, so it is treated as a \u2018new\u2019 viral infection, no different from if the person were unvaccinated.\u201d", "Current reports on the leading mRNA Covid-19 vaccines show that they have between 90-95% efficacy.", "Advance New Zealand, which failed to gain any seats in the country's 2020 election, has a history of publishing false and misleading content.", "The party\u2019s page was removed by Facebook in the days before the 2020 election after it violated the platform\u2019s terms of service. \"We don't allow anyone to share misinformation on our platforms about Covid-19 that could lead to imminent physical harm,\" a spokesperson for Facebook told AFP.", "AFP has reported on multiple other misleading claims published by the party; for example here and here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
