(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "The story said: \"Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department gifted an \u2018unknown number\u2019 of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called \u2018caregivers,\u2019 according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media.\"", "This statement is wrong or misleading in several ways \u2014 starting with its attempt to frame a Senate report from 2016 as a new and shocking release that the media ignored. Casual readers could have thought the Your News Wire story related to the recent FBI Inspector General\u2019s report, which concerned Clinton\u2019s use of personal emails and was released Thursday, June 14, 2018.", "In reality, the Senate\u2019s findings were widely reported in 2016, and the many contemporary news stories \u2014 including an Associated Press investigation that overlapped with the Senate report \u2014 made our fact-checking job easy.", "The Senate report said that HHS placed more than a dozen migrant children in homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced into labor.", "The report did not say anything about Clinton playing a role in that process.", "Both the Senate report and AP investigation discovered that HHS, which is responsible for finding adult sponsors to temporarily house and care for unaccompanied immigrant children pending the resolution of their immigration proceedings, neglected to comply with federal law requiring that the children be protected from human trafficking and other forms of abuse.", "As unaccompanied children surged across the southern border toward the beginning of the decade, the department slashed several safety standards in order to quickly transfer the new arrivals from government shelters to sponsors\u2019 homes.", "Caseworkers who had previously followed strict guidelines for placing children with sponsors \u2014 guidelines that required background checks, fingerprints, home studies and signed agreements to bring the children to\u00a0immigration court \u2014 were instructed by agency officials in November 2013 to stop fingerprinting. Shortly after that, they were also instructed to stop requesting original copies of birth certificates, seeking personal and identifying information, or checking criminal history.", "The hastened process saw several children placed in households with sponsors who forced them into labor or otherwise abused them, according to the Senate and AP reports. It is unknown exactly how many of the approximately 90,000 migrant children placed into sponsor custody between 2013 and 2015 experienced trafficking or other abuse.", "But neither report mentioned Clinton or used the term \"gift\" in reference to the placement of children with human traffickers.", "We could not find any evidence that Clinton, who led the Department of State during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term in office, played a\u00a0part in the rollback of the safety standards governing the protection of migrant children. Not only are the State Department and HHS separate executive agencies, but Clinton also stepped down as secretary of state in February 2013, months before HHS decided to stop fingerprinting in the first of many decisions that led to the children\u2019s mistreatment.", "Your News Wire tried implicating Clinton in an old but otherwise real Senate report.
