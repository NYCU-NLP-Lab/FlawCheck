["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on January 21, 2021", "A viral meme presents quotes from some Democratic lawmakers to misleadingly suggest they were advocating violence. They were supporting protests over various issues.", "Days after a mob of President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, a meme featuring some out-of-context quotes from Democratic lawmakers started spreading widely on social media.", "The meme featured four quotes paired with pictures of four lawmakers looking angry.", "One version includes text that says, \u201cDEMOCRATS NOT IMPEACHED FOR INCITING VIOLENCE.\u201d Others were\u00a0shared with text such as, \u201cNEVER FORGET: Democrats have been stoking public unrest and violence for years!\u201d", "While it\u2019s true that the lawmakers made the statements, the quotes are presented without any information about when they were made, the topics they addressed or the actions that followed.", "With context stripped away for some of those quotes and suggestive text added, the meme has garnered thousands of comments expressing outrage.", "\u201cThese are wicked vile soulless monsters. They must pay for their hateful crimes,\u201d said one Facebook user.", "\u201cAnd these people should be in prison for inciting to harm others,\u201d said another.", "The meme surfaced at a time when the Democratic-controlled House was preparing to\u00a0impeach Trump for \u201cinciting violence against the Government of the United States\u201d at a rally on Jan. 6 \u2014 the day Congress met to verify Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election. Biden won both the Electoral College and the popular vote in an election federal, state and local election officials\u00a0called \u201cthe most secure in American history.\u201d Then-Attorney General William Barr said there were no signs of fraud on a scale that would have changed the results.", "Trump, who had been making false claims that the election had been stolen from him for two months, delivered a\u00a0speech at a \u201cSave America\u201d rally outside the White House prior to the assault on the Capitol. Trump spoke for more than an hour,\u00a0saying\u00a0at one point, \u201cWe fight like hell and if you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\u201d Some of his supporters then marched to the Capitol, fought police and overran the building. Five people\u00a0died.", "Jennifer Ryan, a Texas woman who is facing\u00a0federal charges\u00a0for entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds,\u00a0told\u00a0a local CBS affiliate after her arrest that she thought Trump should pardon her.\u00a0\u201cI thought I was following my president. I thought I was following what we were called to do,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked us to fly there. He asked us to be there. So I was doing what he asked us to do.\u201d", "Whether or not\u00a0Trump\u2019s remarks are similar to the Democratic statements featured in the meme is a matter of opinion.\u00a0Some Republican members of Congress thought they were. In the debate before the\u00a0impeachment\u00a0vote, two congresswomen \u2014\u00a0Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona and Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan \u2014 read some of the quotes included in the meme.", "Below we\u2019ll present the facts about the four Democratic quotes included in the meme, explaining the context in which they were made and what, if any, violence followed.", "In August, the U.S. Postal Service was expecting a surge in mail-in ballots for the Nov. 3 election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A coronavirus relief bill under consideration at the time had included funds to cover associated costs, a move that Trump opposed.", "During an Aug. 15 interview on MSNBC, host Tiffany Cross asked Rep. Ayanna Pressley, \u201cWill the Post Office get funded?\u201d", "Pressley answered, \u201cThey need to be. \u2026 Listen, I\u2019m looking to the public. You know, this is as much about public outcry and organizing, and mobilizing, and applying pressure so that this GOP-led Senate and that these governors that continue to carry water for this administration, putting the American people in harm\u2019s way, turning a deaf ear to the needs of our families and our communities \u2014 hold them accountable. Make the phone calls, send the emails, show up. You know, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there\u2019s unrest in our lives and, unfortunately, there\u2019s plenty to go around.\u201d", "Only the words in bold were included in the meme.", "We could find no evidence that there has been violence related to the debate about postal funding following Pressley\u2019s interview.", "That partial quote, though, was picked up and highlighted by right-wing media outlets at the time.", "The same outlets were giving significant attention to riots that were going on in Portland, Oregon.", "The riots had grown out of the nationwide demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism, sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd.", "In a June 1 radio interview, Pressley had expressed her support for the peaceful demonstrations and condemned the destruction and looting that followed some of them.", "\u201cCommunity organizers are community builders. They are not destroyers,\u201d Pressley said in that interview. \u201cAnd it is deeply painful that there are forces at work to infiltrate and to undermine the good work, the vigilant work, of people who are committed to peace and justice in earnest, despite how slow coming that has been.\u201d", "\u201cWe can\u2019t allow those destroyers, who seek to distract, to derail, to undermine, to co-opt this movement,\u201d she said, contrasting them with the demonstrators she supported, whom she likened to the Freedom Riders of the 1960s.", "Despite her previously stated position on the type of protest she supported, the social media posts over the summer included only her partial statement about unrest, as does the currently circulating meme.", "Most of the protests following Floyd\u2019s death were peaceful; research published in June found that about 80% of protests were peaceful, and a study published in September found that 93% were peaceful.", "In a June 18 interview with talk show host Stephen Colbert, then-Sen. Kamala Harris, who hadn\u2019t yet joined the Democrats\u2019 presidential ticket, was asked about her participation in the demonstrations and her opinions about related issues.", "That discussion lasted for about six minutes and Harris described a protest that she had attended this way:", "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one of the things, Stephen, that I saw that gives me such hope \u2014 people who seemingly have nothing in common, who know they have everything in common. It was really, it\u2019s a beautiful sight \u2014 people of every race, age, gender together, seeing the commonality and it was then the commonality of spirit and it was something that was so very powerful and I think we all have to recognize it for what it is. \u2026 We have arrived at a point in our country that we should recognize, this is not just a moment, it is a movement. It is a movement that is fueled by the diversity, the beautiful diversity, of who we are, coming together as a unified body demanding, in this case, change and justice for everyone.\u201d", "Later in the segment, after Colbert expressed concern about waning coverage of the protests, Harris said:", "\u201cRight, that\u2019s right. But they\u2019re not going to stop. They\u2019re not going to stop. This is a movement \u2014 I\u2019m telling you. They\u2019re not going to stop. And everyone beware because they\u2019re not going to stop \u2026 they\u2019re not going to stop before Election Day in November and they\u2019re not going to stop after Election Day. \u2026 Everyone should take note of that on both levels \u2026 that they\u2019re not going to let up and they should not and we should not.\u201d", "The meme appears to have paraphrased the section in bold this way: \u201cProtesters should not let up.\u201d", "While Harris has voiced support for peaceful protests beyond this interview, we could find no\u00a0instance in which she advocated violence.", "She attended a demonstration sparked by Floyd\u2019s death in Washington, D.C., as she discussed with Colbert, and posted a video of it to Twitter. The demonstration in the video shows no violence.", "She also said in a speech on Aug. 27: \u201cWe must always defend peaceful protest and peaceful protesters. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence.\u201d", "Two members of the Trump administration had highly publicized encounters with critics at Washington, D.C., area restaurants in June 2018.", "On June 19, a group confronted then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen while she dined at a Mexican restaurant. They criticized her participation in implementing a policy that separated children from their parents at the border (we\u2019ll explain more on that next) and chanted \u201cshame\u201d at her.", "On June 22, the owner of a Lexington, Virginia, restaurant asked then-Press Secretary Sarah Sanders to leave. The owner, Stephanie Wilkinson, said at the time, \u201cI explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion, and cooperation. I said, \u2018I\u2019d like to ask you to leave.'\u201d", "Two days after that, on June 24, a video surfaced showing Rep. Maxine Waters of California speaking to a group of supporters in Los Angeles.", "\u201cYou have members of your cabinet that have been booed out of restaurants. Who have protesters taking up at their house, who sang \u2014 \u2018no peace, no sleep; no peace, no sleep.\u2019 And guess what \u2014 we\u2019re going to win this battle, because while you try and quote the Bible, Jeff Sessions and others, you really don\u2019t know the Bible. God is on our side. On the side of the children. On the side of what\u2019s right. On the side of what\u2019s honorable. On the side of understanding that if we can\u2019t protect the children, we can\u2019t protect anybody. And so, let\u2019s stay the course. Let\u2019s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they\u2019re not welcome anymore, anywhere.\u201d", "The portion in bold is what appears in the meme.", "Of the four quotes included in the meme, this one is the most accurately portrayed. Waters\u00a0did encourage her supporters to confront members of the Trump administration\u00a0in public places.\u00a0But there is no evidence that her remarks resulted in any violence.", "In April 2018 then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d for immigrants caught crossing the border illegally.", "That policy had the effect of separating children from their parents, since adults were detained by the U.S. Marshals Service and sent to federal court while children (who can\u2019t be held in adult detention facilities) were referred to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement.", "During then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s weekly press conference on June 14, 2018, a reporter asked\u00a0about the new policy.", "Pelosi spoke for about five minutes on the issue and cited a statement from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that called the policy \u201cimmoral.\u201d She also cited a 2017 statement from the National Association of Evangelicals that had praised the U.S. asylum system.", "Toward the end of her answer, Pelosi said:", "\u201cWhen we had a hearing on a subject related to this \u2014 asylum seekers, refugees, etc. \u2014 the Association of Evangelicals, the Evangelicals, testified \u2026 they called it the crown jewel of America\u2019s humanitarianism. Crown jewel of American humanitarianism. And, in order to do away with that crown jewel, they\u2019re doing away with children being with their moms. \u2026 I just don\u2019t even know why there aren\u2019t uprisings all over the country and maybe there will be when people realize that this is a policy that they defend. It\u2019s a horrible thing.\u201d", "The meme took only the portion in bold, slightly edited to say: \u201cI just don\u2019t know why there aren\u2019t uprisings all over the country. Maybe there will be.\u201d", "Some demonstrations against the policy had happened before Pelosi\u2019s statement on June 14, 2018, but most of them took place after that, according to press reports. It\u2019s unclear whether or not any of the participants were motivated by Pelosi\u2019s statement, but it\u2019s worth noting that the family separation policy had received widespread attention at the time and at least 49 Republican lawmakers had criticized the policy.", "The protests against the policy appear to have been peaceful.
