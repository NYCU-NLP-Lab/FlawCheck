Some will like the Massachusetts approach, and some won\u2019t, he said.", "The Massachusetts approach \"teaches some important lessons some states are not going to want to follow,\" Romney said. \"One lesson is health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country. Now, that\u2019s something that Texas and Minnesota and Montana are not going to necessarily want to adopt.\"", "Is it true that health insurance is \"more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country\"?", "There are a number of ways to measure the cost of what Romney termed \"health insurance.\" For answers, we turned to research by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

Whenever residents of a state make a lot of income and pay a lot for consumer goods generally, it\u2019s likely to follow that health care will be relatively expensive as well.", "In addition, Massachusetts ranks first among states in health care expenditures per capita, and most of the rest of the top 10 consists of other relatively affluent, northeastern and mid-Atlantic states: Connecticut, Maine, Delaware, New York, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania.
