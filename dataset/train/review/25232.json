The decision was made after the article\u2019s author incorrectly claimed that there was \u201cno evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths\u201d and that total death numbers were \u201cnot above normal death numbers.\u201d", "However, in a Nov. 27 update, an editor\u2019s note with a link to the original article in PDF form was published online in accordance with the newspaper\u2019s standards for transparency.", "Snopes is still fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

(For reference, a PDF of the article can be viewed here, and a web version has been archived here.)", "The article in question was written by science and technology writer Yanni Gu, who was a research assistant at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine at the time. Gu interviewed Genevieve Briand, assistant program director of the Applied Economics master\u2019s degree program, who was said to have \u201ccritically analyzed\u201d the effect of COVID-19 on U.S. death using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a webinar given the same title of the article, \"COVID-19 Deaths: A Look at U.S. Data.\"", "According to Gu\u2019s article, Briand sourced data from mid-March to mid-September that reported a total of 1.7 million deaths, about 200,000 of which were related to COVID-19. A link to this data was not made available in the article, but data published by the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Research Center showed that at least 200,000 people had reportedly died from the virus as of Sept. 21 (for comparison, total deaths had reached over 268,000 people at the time of this writing, Dec. 2). The article went on to push a narrative that has circulated since the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic that argues the CDC has falsely classified any death that could be related to COVID-19 simply as COVID-19 deaths, rather than accounting for other potential causes or underlying conditions. (See other examples of similar falsities here, here, here, and here.)", "\u201cEven patients dying from underlying diseases but are infected with COVID-19 count as COVID-19 deaths,\u201d wrote Gu. \u201cThis is likely the main explanation as to why COVID-19 deaths drastically increased while deaths by all other diseases experienced a significant decrease.", "Briand said in an interview with The News-Letter that her findings point \u201cto no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths,\u201d and that \u201ctotal death numbers are not above normal death numbers. When asked whether COVID-19 deaths can be called misleading by this presumed inflation, Briand responded by saying that the way in which the data was reported \u201cdoesn\u2019t give us a choice but to point to some misclassification.\u201d", "\u201cIn other words, the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the U.S. is considered problematic only when it increases the total number of deaths or the true death burden by a significant amount in addition to the expected deaths by other causes,\u201d wrote Gu.", "Editors at The News-Letter wrote in a Nov. 27 note that Genevieve Briand\u2019s presentation had been \u201cused to support dangerous inaccuracies that minimize the impact of the pandemic. In response to criticism following the editorial staff\u2019s decision to retract the article, the paper issued the following statement:", "In accordance with our standards for transparency, we are sharing with our readers how we came to this decision. The News-Letter is an editorially and financially independent, student-run publication. Our articles and content are not endorsed by the University or the School of Medicine, and our decision to retract this article was made independently.", "Briand\u2019s study should not be used exclusively in understanding the impact of COVID-19, but should be taken in context with the countless other data published by Hopkins, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).", "As assistant director for the Master\u2019s in Applied Economics program at Hopkins, Briand is neither a medical professional nor a disease researcher. At her talk, she herself stated that more research and data are needed to understand the effects of COVID-19 in the U.S.", "The staff noted other inaccuracies in Briand\u2019s claims that have been debunked and refuted by the broader medical community. For one, her claim that there is no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths did not take into account the spike in raw death count from all causes when compared to previous years. Furthermore, the CDC reported on Oct. 23 that an estimated 299,028 excess U.S. COVID-19 deaths occurred between late January through Oct. 3.", "\u201cAdditionally, Briand presented data of total U.S. deaths in comparison to COVID-19-related deaths as a proportion percentage, which trivializes the repercussions of the pandemic,\u201d continued The News-Letter in its editor\u2019s note. \u201cThis evidence does not disprove the severity of COVID-19; an increase in excess deaths is not represented in these proportionalities because they are offered as percentages, not raw numbers.\u201d", "Removing misreported content has been a source of controversy in the journalism world, with groups like the Society of Professional Journalism and The Pointer Institute arguing that such actions reduce the transparency and credibility of a publication that does so.", "Media publications will typically set forth its editorial policies for retractions and updates.
