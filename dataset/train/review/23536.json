Some posited that Trump had paid people to dress up as nuns and act as if they supported the president.", "These images, however, truly show a group of nuns who attended Trump's rally in Centreville, Ohio. They are from \"Children of Mary,\" a community that was founded circa 1989 in Newport, Ohio.", "The Children of Mary confirmed to the Washington Examiner that these people were truly nuns and that they were supporting Trump because of his anti-abortion policies:", "There are indeed many issues concerning the quality of life that need to be addressed.
