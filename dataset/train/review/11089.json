["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 28, 2020", "Politically charged social media posts have wrongly identified pictures as showing the Minneapolis police officer who was seen kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, who died shortly after. The two photos circulating do not show the officer, Derek Chauvin.", "The death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, following his arrest on May 25 has prompted uproar and protests in the city\u2019s streets.", "Floyd, a black man, died shortly after he was detained by officers. A video of the arrest emerged in which Floyd can be heard repeatedly saying, \u201cI cannot breathe,\u201d as an officer kneels on his neck for several minutes. The Minneapolis Police Department has confirmed in a statement that the FBI will investigate, and the city\u2019s mayor said that the \u201cfour responding MPD officers involved in the death of George Floyd have been terminated.\u201d", "But the furor online has at times been accompanied by politically charged misinformation about the officer at the center of the case, Derek Chauvin \u2014 who was identified in news reports as the officer seen kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck.", "Viral posts on Facebook and Twitter have falsely claimed that two different photos, of two different men, show Chauvin. They don\u2019t.", "In one case, a photo of a man whom social media users purported to be Chauvin is seen wearing a red hat reading, \u201cMake Whites Great Again.\u201d", "\u201cDoes this surprise any of you?\u201d reads one Facebook\u00a0meme\u00a0showing the picture alongside a screenshot of Chauvin from the video of Floyd\u2019s arrest. The rapper Ice Cube also\u00a0shared\u00a0the two photos side by side on Twitter, writing: \u201cA wolf in wolves clothing. The demons are among us.\u00a0#Fightthecowards.\u201d His tweet was shared more than 50,000 times.", "The man in the hat, however, is not Chauvin. The man was later identified by HuffPost reporter Luke O\u2019Brien as Jonathan Lee Riches, who is\u00a0known\u00a0for his penchant for filing lawsuits. O\u2019Brien profiled Riches in a 2019\u00a0story.", "Riches has \u201cfiled thousands of actions in federal courts throughout the country, most of which have been dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,\u201d a Montana federal judge\u00a0wrote\u00a0while dismissing a 2016 complaint he filed against then-candidate Donald Trump. In that\u00a0complaint, Riches said he supported Trump \u201c100%\u201d and \u201cI love Donald Trump like a brother/father,\u201d but sought an order to stop him from running for president because he feared for Trump\u2019s safety.", "The HuffPost\u00a0story\u00a0on Riches detailed his \u201ctrolling\u201d practices, including setting up fake social media accounts.", "The photo of Riches was\u00a0posted\u00a0on a since-deactivated Facebook account under the name \u201cDerek Chauvin\u201d on May 26, one day after Floyd\u2019s death, with a caption \u201cBetter times.\u201d That profile is no longer active.", "We reached out through Riches\u2019 Facebook profile directly for comment and didn\u2019t hear back. But an account connected to his \u2014 one for \u201cJoseph A Camp\u201d \u2014 which spent the day May 27 posting about the viral photo and the news coverage it spawned did get back to us. (The Camp and Riches profiles list one another as a domestic partner on Facebook, though Camp said they are not actually in a domestic partnership.)", "Camp said in a message: \u201cJLR(c) and I are political satirical artist who are both well known for massive controversial satire\u201d and that \u201cJLR(c) is the individual in the image.\u201d He claimed the hat in the viral image had been photoshopped \u2014 though he couldn\u2019t provide an original photo to support that claim.", "We asked whether Riches created the \u201cDerek Chauvin\u201d account that posted the photo, and Camp said: \u201cI can\u2019t confirm or deny if JLR(c) created the account in question, but I will confirm that Mr. Riches has been accused or assumed to have created massive social media profiles, groups, and pages in an attempt to use satire to prove a point.\u201d", "Separately, another viral photo shows an arrow pointing at a man at a Trump rally, and appeared with captions identifying the man as Chauvin. The\u00a0rally photo\u00a0was taken at an October 2019 campaign rally in Minneapolis and shows attendees wearing shirts reading, \u201cCops for Trump.\u201d", "But Minneapolis Police Lt. Bob Kroll, president of the\u00a0Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis who is also seen in the photo, told the Associated Press that \u201cnone of the officers in the [George Floyd] incident were near the Trump rally.\u201d He said the individual in the rally photo is actually Michael Gallagher, president of the Bloomington Police Officers Federation.", "Kroll and Gallagher didn\u2019t return our requests for comment.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
