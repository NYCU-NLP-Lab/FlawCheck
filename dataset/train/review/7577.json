["About this rating", "Given the amount of study devoted to the Holocaust over the last 70 years, it's highly unlikely a memorable and striking photograph such as one of a mother giving her child one last hug before both were shot to death by Nazis would have remained obscure until now. \u00a0So when one such image began to circulate in 2015, many people were skeptical of its authenticity.", "That didn't stop the various versions of the image from\u00a0being\u00a0used either in remembrance of the Holocaust or (in some cases) as a political talking point:", "<", "The fact that the photograph was so powerful made it even more difficult to believe\u00a0that it would have remained obscure.", "The earliest versions\u00a0we were able to find were\u00a0dated\u00a0May 2014, despite years of historians extensively cataloging of the Holocaust's horrors on the web.

The footage appeared at approximately the 9:40 mark:", "https://youtu.be/G7aq7QjHNFc\n\nIn its original form, the footage was in color, not black and white.

Unlike the \"Jewish mother\" photograph, however, information uncovered just a few years before\u00a0that\u00a0rumor substantiated claims that Otto Frank (Anne's father) tried several times to secure safe passage to the U.S. before his family was imprisoned and killed.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
