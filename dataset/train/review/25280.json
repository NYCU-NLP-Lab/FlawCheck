The post has been shared more than 21,000 times since it was published on September 27, 2020.", "\u201cEarth, Venus and Jupiter as seen from Mars,\u201d reads the caption on the post featuring an image that appears to be cropped out from a similar but larger version.", "The same claim also circulated on social media in Spanish (here and here), Portuguese, Arabic and German.", "False and misleading posts claiming to show Mars have proliferated on social media since NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover landed on the Red Planet on February 18, 2021. AFP reported on the historic mission.", "However, AFP Fact Check found that the image claiming to show the trio of planets visible from Mars is computer-generated and has been shared out of context.", "A search of NASA\u2019s website failed to turn up the image. Instead, AFP Fact Check traced the photo to a July 2010 post on Riofrio Spacetime, a blog owned by scientist Louise Riofrio.", "She told AFP Fact Check that she had published the image in a blog post as an illustration.", "\u201cI am the sole creator of the Mars illustrations first posted on my blog in June 2010,\u201d Riofrio wrote in an emailed response. \u201cI calculated and created them with the Apple iBook computer in my home.\u201d", "While the original 2010 post did not carry a caption, Riofrio republished the image on her blog on July 15, 2020, explaining: \u201cThis is the view you would see looking East from Gusev Crater at local sunrise, 1:14 PM Universal Time.\u201d", "Gusev Crater is a 144 kilometre-wide (90 miles) depression created on the surface of Mars billions of years ago when an asteroid crashed into the planet.", "Riofrio is currently a Crew Candidate for the #DearMoon mission to travel around the Moon on a SpaceX Starship in 2023. But at the time her 2010 blog post was published, she was working as a scientist at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston.", "\u201cI worked with the researchers who in 1996 discovered signs of fossil life on Martian Meteorite ALH84001,\u201d she said.", "Multiple reverse image searches found that the photo has been circulating alongside the claim since at least 2012 when\u00a0American astronomer Phil Plait reviewed the image and confirmed it was computer-generated.", "In an article for Discovery Magazine, Plait explained that the symbol for northeast (NE) visible in the lower left-hand corner of the viral image matches with photos digitally produced with planetarium computer software such as Starry Night and SkySafari to display the sky.", "The symbol indicates the cardinal direction the viewer of the generated image is facing, according to Plait.", "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that\u2019s what we have here: a rendered view from Mars using planetarium software,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMind you, the picture itself isn\u2019t a hoax! It\u2019s just a computer-generated image probably meant to represent a real scene. But it got spread around the net, and before you know it people think it\u2019s real.\u201d", "He added that his simulation on the positions of the planetary bodies in mid-2010 using the planetarium software found that the view from Mars right after sunset would show Venus, Earth, and Jupiter lined up in a similar way to the viral photo.", "While the image does not show a true picture of Earth, Venus and Jupiter from Mars, NASA has previously documented similar views of some planets from Mars.", "NASA\u2019s Mars Exploration Rover Spirit captured the first image ever taken of Earth in 2004 on the website of its Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
