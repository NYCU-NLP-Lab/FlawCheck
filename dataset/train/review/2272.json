["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 21, 2020", "A viral post claims, falsely, that Sen. Bernie Sanders at a recent debate called for a tax rate of 52% on incomes of $29,000 or more to pay for his Medicare for All plan. He didn\u2019t. That figure was floated as a potential marginal tax rate for income above $10 million.", "A viral post on social media falsely claims that presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders recently proposed a 52% tax rate for those making $29,000 annually.", "The post, titled \u201cBernie Sanders Insane Policies,\u201d correctly notes that Sanders said \u201cat the debate last night\u201d \u2014 presumably the Feb. 19 Democratic debate in Las Vegas \u2014 that he wants the minimum wage to rise to $15 per hour (a position he\u2019s long held). But it invents a supposed \u201canswer\u201d that Sanders provided in response to a question about how he would pay for Medicare for All, his proposal for a universal government-run health insurance system.", "The claim spread rapidly on Facebook and Twitter after the most recent debate and was propelled by the well-followed Twitter account of the actor James Woods, a supporter of President Donald Trump.", "\u201cHis answer was raise taxes to 52% on anybody making over $29,000 per year,\u201d the post erroneously says, before diving into a math equation intended to show that such an exorbitant tax rate would render a higher minimum wage ineffective.", "But Sanders didn\u2019t call for a 52% income tax rate for those making $29,000 at the debate, the transcript\u00a0shows, or elsewhere that we could find.", "Sanders has put forth several ways to raise revenue to pay for Medicare for All. In one\u00a0document posted by Sanders, he suggested a potential\u00a0marginal tax rate\u00a0of 52% on income above $10 million \u2014 meaning taxable income earned\u00a0after the first $10 million would be taxed at that rate.", "Another Sanders document on financing the plan, from last year, suggests that the rate could be higher for income above $10 million. It suggests \u201c[m]aking the federal income tax more progressive, including a marginal tax rate of up to 70 percent on those making above $10 million, taxing earned and unearned income at the same rates, and limiting tax deductions for filers in the top tax bracket.\u201d", "As for the $29,000 figure, the same financing proposal calls for a potential \u201c4 percent income-based premium paid by employees, exempting the first $29,000 in income for a family of four.\u201d Under a Medicare for All system, health care costs currently paid by individuals, employers, private insurers, and state and local governments would shift to the federal government.", "Sanders has come under\u00a0criticism from some of his Democratic competitors over the costs of his universal health care plan and how to pay for it. As we\u2019ve\u00a0explained before, there have been various estimates \u2014 including one study\u00a0published by his 2016 presidential campaign that said the plan would reduce national health spending by $6.3 trillion over 10 years. Others have found national spending would increase by $6.6 trillion over 10 years.", "A recent Yale\u00a0study \u2014 the lead author of which disclosed that she was an \u201cinformal unpaid adviser\u201d to Sanders\u2019 office for his 2019 Medicare for All Act \u2014 concluded the plan could reduce national health care spending by more than $450 billion annually.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
