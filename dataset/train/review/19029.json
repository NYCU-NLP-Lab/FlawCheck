She was 49.", "Her major breakthrough came in 2011, when she starred in in the Civil Rights drama The Help, for which she won the Academy Award, Golden Globe, SAG, BAFTA, and Critics\u2019 Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress. She would follow up her work in the help with a critically acclaimed performance in Ryan Coogler\u2019s drama Fruitvale Station for which she received the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Paramedics removed her from the flight and rushed her to a nearby hospital, where she was treated for a heart attack. She later died in the hospital.", "Virtually every detail of the post is incorrect. Sherri Shepherd is not dead, nor was she hospitalized for a heart attack. She did not play the movie roles named above (it appears that the author confused Shepherd for another actress, Octavia Spencer, whose photo adorns the article and who did appear in all the listed films). Adding bad taste to injury, the final two paragraphs were copied and pasted, verbatim, from a People magazine article about the death of Carrie Fisher, who actually did suffer from cardiac arrest on a flight from London to Los Angeles on 23 December 2016.", "The web site carries a disclaimer characterizing its content as \"satire\" and \"funny,\" though in doing so it abuses the definitions of both terms:", "Headlinen [sic] News is a satire site.
