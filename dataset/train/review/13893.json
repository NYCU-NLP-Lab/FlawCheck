Look at him with Cuba. He supported Obama when he negotiated with the other terrorists, the Castro brothers. When Nelson supports the Castros, that only reinforces and encourages others, like it did with Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s and now with Maduro. In 2005, Bill Nelson even visited Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela.
