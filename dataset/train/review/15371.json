["Correction: When we originally reported this fact-check on Sept. 1, we were unable to determine how the Senate Leadership Fund arrived at its figure of \"over $1 million,\" and the group didn\u2019t respond to our query. The evidence seemed to show a total of under $1 million for salary and other benefits. After publication, a spokesman for the group provided additional evidence showing Moore received compensation as a consultant and through an amended filing, bringing the total to more than $1 million. We have corrected our report, and we have changed the rating from Mostly False to Mostly True.", "An attack ad targeting Roy Moore, a Republican candidate in the Alabama Senate special election, claims that he and his wife Kayla Moore paid themselves $1 million from a nonprofit organization they ran.", "The ad, funded by the Senate Leadership Fund, also creates the impression Moore drew compensation from the organization, The Foundation for Moral Law, while sitting on the Alabama Supreme Court.", "\"Despite being one of the highest paid judges in the nation (...)

Moore was elected again to the Alabama Supreme Court in 2013 and was suspended in 2016 after he directed Alabama\u2019s probate judges to defy federal court orders on same-sex marriage.
