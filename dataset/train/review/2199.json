["By Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley, Brooks Jackson and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on January 9, 2019 | Updated on January 10, 2019", "In a national address, President Donald Trump called on Congress to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall to address what he called a \u201ccrisis\u201d on the border. The president made some false and misleading claims, and provided some facts without context:", "Trump, who campaigned on a promise to build a wall along the Southwest border, delivered a nationally televised address to urge Congress to end the budget stalemate and provide his administration with $5.7 billion in border security funds.", "The president, who spoke as the partial government shutdown entered its 18th day, repeatedly used the word \u201ccrisis\u201d to describe the border situation. What are the facts?", "It\u2019s true that in recent months the number of people caught trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally has risen, and was actually higher in November (the most recent month for which the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has published figures) than it was when Trump was sworn in.", "But the total remains far below what it was several years ago, before President George W. Bush doubled the number of Border Patrol agents.", "During the first 11 months of last year, the average monthly number of apprehensions was not much above what it was in Barack Obama\u2019s last year in office, and it was less than one-third of what it had been in 2000, before the big surge in the number of agents at the border. (Our apprehension numbers come from U.S. Border Patrol historical figures, updated with the most recent figures from the website of its parent,\u00a0U.S. Customs and Border Protection.)", "Trump made the misleading claim that: \u201cEvery day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country.\u201d", "In October and November, Border Patrol made 102,857 apprehensions at the Southwest border, according to data from Customs and Border Protection. That works out to roughly 1,700 apprehensions each day.", "Trump may get to \u201cthousands\u201d per day by including 20,371 additional people who presented themselves at ports of entry on the Southwest border but were deemed \u201cinadmissible\u201d to the U.S. Those individuals, however, sought to enter the country legally, not illegally.", "Furthermore, in fiscal year 2018, Border Patrol made 396,579 apprehensions at the Southwest border, or just under 1,100 each day. Including inadmissible individuals who lawfully tried to enter through a port of entry only increases the figure to over 1,400 per day.", "Trump suggested that 20,000 children were illegally brought into the country last month by \u201cvicious coyotes and ruthless gangs,\u201d but there\u2019s no evidence of that in the available statistics.", "Trump, Jan. 8: Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.", "The data from Customs and Border Protection show that 25,172 family units were apprehended by the Border Patrol in November. \u201cFamily units\u201d are individuals, including children and parents or legal guardians, that were caught with a family member.", "We wrote about the issue of adults trafficking children to the border in June, when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen claimed there had been a \u201c314 percent increase\u201d in such fraudulent cases over the previous five months. That sounded like a large increase, but not so much when the raw numbers were revealed.", "DHS confirmed to us that there were 191 suspected fraudulent cases in the first five months of fiscal 2018. That was 0.61 percent of the total family unit apprehensions in that time period.", "Similarly, the Washington Post reported in November that CBP had\u00a0separated 170 such fraudulent \u201cfamilies\u201d between April 19 and Sept. 30 last year. In September alone, there were 16,658 family units apprehended, so the 170 figure is a small fraction of the families stopped trying to illegally cross the border.", "As for parents traveling with children overall, those numbers have increased in recent years. We only have data going back to fiscal 2013, when 14,855 people apprehended on the Southwest border were part of a \u201cfamily unit.\u201d The number jumped significantly in fiscal 2014 to 68,445. For fiscal 2018, 107,212 family units were apprehended.", "Update, Jan. 10: DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman told the Washington Post Fact Checker that 19,313 children were apprehended on the Southwest border in December, a number that includes both those traveling in a family unit and unaccompanied children. So, if that\u2019s the number the president is using, it refers to all children, not only those the administration suspects aren\u2019t traveling with a legitimate parent or guardian. But, as we explained, the suspected cases of fraudulent child-parent relationships have been a tiny fraction of all family unit apprehensions.", "Trump said \u201cthe border wall would very quickly pay for itself\u201d by stopping the flow of illegal drugs. \u201cThe cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year \u2014 vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress,\u201d Trump said.", "The president overstated the economic cost of illegal drugs.", "In a 2017 report, the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated \u201cthe economic cost of the opioid crisis was $504.0 billion\u201d in 2015 \u2014 but it is not all \u201cillegal drugs,\u201d as the president said. That figure\u00a0\u201cincludes individuals who abuse prescription painkillers such as OxyContin and Vicodin and individuals who abuse heroin or other illicit opioids,\u201d the report said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said\u00a0that prescription drugs were involved in more than 35 percent of all opioid overdose deaths in 2017.", "More to the point, Trump falsely claims that the wall would pay for itself by stopping the flow of illegal drugs.\u00a0As we have written more than once, the majority of illicit drugs is smuggled through legal ports of entry.", "In its most recent National Drug Threat Assessment, the Drug Enforcement Administration said the Southwest border \u201cremains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States,\u201d and \u201cthe majority of the flow\u201d enters through private vehicles and tractor-trailers at legal ports of entry.", "Stephen D. Morris, a Middle Tennessee State University political science professor whose research has largely focused on Mexico, told us for a story last year that \u201cthe wall will not do very much to stop drugs.\u201d", "Trump continued to claim that he is staying true to his campaign pledge that Mexico would pay for the border wall, insisting that Mexico will pay \u201cindirectly\u201d through a new international trade agreement. But that\u2019s spin.", "Trump, Jan. 8: The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.", "The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement was signed on Nov. 30 by the leaders of all three countries, but it still must be ratified by Congress.\u00a0Even if it is, though, there is nothing in it specifying that Mexico will pay for any border wall.", "The president\u2019s argument is that Mexico will pay \u201cindirectly\u201d because of benefits that accrue to the U.S. through the new trade agreement. But economists told us that while the trade agreement is arguably a slightly more advantageous deal for the U.S. than its predecessor, the\u00a0North American Free Trade Agreement, it won\u2019t generate enough additional federal revenues to pay for the border wall, and shouldn\u2019t be construed as Mexican payments, anyway.", "\u201cEven if we accept conceptually the argument that government revenue attributable to the revised trade agreement constitutes \u2018Mexico paying for the wall,\u2019 there are no plausible assumptions of USMCA\u2019s impact that would see government revenue increase by $25 billion,\u201d said Geoffrey Gertz, a fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution and a research associate at the Global Economic Governance Programme at the University of Oxford.", "Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, agreed.", "\u201cRelative to NAFTA, the Mexican government would not nearly lose enough tariff revenue that could be constituted as paying for the wall, at least the wall as previously envisioned by the Administration; nor would the U.S. government revenue increase enough based on a dynamic score,\u201d said Smetters, who was an economist at the Congressional Budget Office in the 1990s. \u201cIn fact, the additional revenue to U.S. relative to NAFTA would, optimistically, not cover annual maintenance and improvements of the wall much less the original build.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
