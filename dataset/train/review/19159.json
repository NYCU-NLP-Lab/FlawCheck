["According to a meme shared more than a thousand times in Canadian Facebook groups, \u201cThe \u2018safe\u2019 limit for injected mercury is zero.\u201d The problem, the post adds, is that, \u201cThe flu shot contains 25mcg of mercury. #HelloDementia.\u201d", "The meme\u2019s conclusion that flu shots are harmful to the human body is wrong.", "Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative that prevents bacterial and fungal contamination of vaccines, and other consumer products such as cosmetics.", "According to the US Food and Drug Administration, \"Thimerosal is a preservative that has been used in some vaccines since the 1930's, when it was first introduced by Eli Lilly Company.\"", "Dr. Ian Gemmill, former chair of Immunize Canada, a coalition of non-governmental health organizations, told AFP that thimerosal is important because vaccine \u201ccontamination is possible and it is a very significant risk to health. So the last thing we want to do is to give an influenza vaccine that can pose a risk.\u201d", "The Health Canada web page on thimerosal points to the important difference between the ethylmercury contained in thimerosal, and the methylmercury present in fish, which is a known to be dangerous if consumed in large amounts.", "In an interview with AFP, Dr Bryna Warshawsky, a public health physician at Public Health Ontario stressed that as a mercury-based substance, thimerosal \u201cis not the kind of mercury that you find in fish and accumulates in the body.\u201d", "Thimerosal contains 49.6 percent of mercury by weight, and is measured in vaccines in micrograms, or one millionth of a gram. As the meme states, the quantity of mercury in a dose is around 25 micrograms.", "\u201cThe amount of thimerosal in the multi-dose vials is infinitesimal. It\u2019s been in use for decades and we do not have any evidence that any of those vaccines caused harm to anybody, because the dose is so small.\u201d Gemmill said to AFP.", "Several academic, government, and non-governmental sources confirmed Gemmill\u2019s conclusion.", "Health Canada states,\u00a0\u201cThe amount of thimerosal in vaccines is small, and no studies have documented any associated adverse effects.\u201d", "The World Health Organization also states on its website, \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that the amount of thimerosal used in vaccines poses a health risk.\u201d", "In particular, a theory linking Alzheimer\u2019s disease or dementia to flu shots, which was\u00a0popularized by a US doctor whose license was suspended, is disputed by Alzheimer's societies in Canada and the US.", "One Canadian study, found, \u201cPast exposure to vaccines against diphtheria or tetanus, poliomyelitis and influenza may protect against subsequent development of Alzheimer's disease.\u201d", "Another review by researchers from the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia examined seven academic studies looking at a possible\u00a0association between thimerosal in vaccines and autism,\u00a0all of which failed to support the link.", "Each year, Health Canada releases the list of authorized vaccines for the upcoming influenza season and their ingredients. For the 2019-2020 season, nine vaccines have been authorized, five of which contain thimerosal.", "The five thimerosal-containing vaccines this season, Agriflu Seqirus, Fluviral, Afluria Tetra, Flulaval, and Fluzone Quadrivalent, only contain thimerosal when they are dispensed from multi-dose vials, as the larger quantity makes preservation more difficult.", "Gemmill said\u00a0if people are uncomfortable with thimerosal in flu shots, they may ask their doctor for a pre-filled, single-dose vaccine, which does not contain any.", "The flu shot is a regular source of misinformation.
