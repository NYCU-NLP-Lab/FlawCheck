They criticized the government officials who made the decision as well as the residents and visitors who went to the beach.", "Others spoke out in support of the beach reopenings, some of them saying Floridians need fresh air and exercise, and others stating that grocery store shoppers are closer to each other than the beachgoers have been so far.", "The news reporting on that controversy caused a controversy of its own, however. Some social media users asserted that photographs showing crowds of beach-goers in Jacksonville that were used to illustrate news articles were simply stock photos or unrelated pictures that did not reflect the reality of the situation:", "Although it's possible a photograph of Jacksonville beaches from the weekend of April 17-19, 2020, might have been inappropriately used somewhere to illustrate a story about a different part of the U.S. (such as California), the pictures seen here are correctly represented as to time and place (i.e., taken in Jacksonville in mid-April 2020). Here are those photographs and their accompanying captions, as stored in the database of the Getty Images visual media company:", "JACKSONVILLE BEACH, FLORIDA - APRIL 17: People are seen at the beach on April 17, 2020 in Jacksonville Beach, Florida.
