["By Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on December 5, 2019", "As the House Judiciary Committee began public hearings on whether to draft and approve articles of impeachment, Republicans presented a set of facts that they claimed cleared President Donald Trump of any wrongdoing.", "The Republican National Committee on Dec. 4 selectively highlighted several facts from the investigation, providing an incomplete picture on what the congressional testimony has revealed.", "The same day, Rep. Jim Jordan repeated some of those talking points in the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s hearing. \u201cThe facts are on the president\u2019s side,\u201d Jordan declared.", "Here we review the Republican statements in the context of documents and testimony that House investigators have gathered since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24.", "RNC: \u201cAs the transcript of the [July 25] call between President Trump and Ukrainian President [Volodymyr] Zelensky, as well as the testimony before the House Intel committee have both revealed, there was no quid pro quo.\u201d", "Jordan: \u201cWe have the transcript. There was no quid pro quo in the transcript.\u201d", "This is a familiar Republican talking point, repeated by the president and printed on T-shirts of his supporters: \u201cRead the Transcript.\u201d", "The fact is, Trump asked Zelensky for \u201ca favor\u201d in the July 25 phone call that could have benefited the president\u2019s reelection in 2020, and witnesses testified that there was an elaborate effort by some within the administration to carry out what Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council\u00a0aide, called Trump\u2019s \u201cdomestic political errand.\u201d", "Trump, according to the White House memo on the call, asked Zelensky to look into CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee after its computer network was hacked by Russian intelligence officers during the 2016 election. (Trump repeatedly has advanced the debunked conspiracy theory that CrowdStrike hacked the DNC and blamed the Russians.)", "Trump also asked Zelensky in the phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\u00a0As we\u2019ve written, Trump has\u00a0distorted the facts when he has claimed\u00a0that Joe Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold \u201cbillions of dollars to Ukraine\u201d unless it removed the prosecutor general who \u201cwas prosecuting\u201d Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and\u00a0Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had served. There\u2019s no evidence Hunter Biden was ever being investigated or prosecuted.", "In addition, since the release of the transcript, the House impeachment probe has uncovered evidence that the White House sought Ukraine\u2019s public announcement of the investigations in exchange for three things: a phone call between Zelensky and Trump, a White House visit for Zelensky, and the release of nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine.", "Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified that there was a quid pro quo, at least on two of the three things that Ukraine was seeking.", "\u201cI know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes,\u201d Sondland testified on Nov. 20.", "As for security aid, Sondland said he presumed that a promise of investigations \u201cmight have to be done in order to get the aid released.\u201d", "Sondland\u2019s conclusions were supported by testimony from other witnesses, as well as text messages, emails and WhatsApp messages that were provided to the committee.", "On July 19, Sondland sent an email to several top Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney that said: \u201cI Talked to Zelensky just now\u2026 He is prepared to receive Potus\u2019 call. Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will \u2018turn over every stone\u2019. He would greatly appreciate a call prior to Sunday so that he can put out some media about a \u2018friendly and productive call\u2019 (no details) prior to Ukraine election on Sunday.\u201d Sondland\u00a0released this email\u00a0at a public hearing on Nov. 20, and he testified that he was referring to the investigations of the 2016 elections and Burisma.", "Also on July 19, Sondland sent a WhatsApp message to Kurt Volker, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, and William Taylor, the charge d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, that said a phone call between Trump and Zelensky would soon take place. Volker\u2019s message said what is \u201c[m]ost impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation \u2014 and address any specific personnel issues \u2014 if there are any,\u201d according to Sondland\u2019s Nov. 20 testimony. Taylor also discussed the messages in the opening statement at his closed-door Oct. 22 deposition.", "A week earlier, on July 12, Robert Blair, an assistant to the president and senior adviser to Mulvaney, sent an email to Michael Duffey, the associate director of the Resource Management Organization at the Office of Management and Budget, that said the president is directing a hold on security aid for Ukraine. Mark Sandy, the deputy associate director for national security at OMB, testified at his Nov. 16 deposition that Duffey forwarded him a copy of the email.", "Sandy testified that he signed a document that officially placed the first hold on the security aid to Ukraine on July 25 \u2014 the same day as the phone call between the two leaders.", "Sondland and Taylor both testified that they came to believe that the security aid, too, was linked to the investigations.", "Taylor testified that on Sept. 7 National Security Council aide\u00a0Tim Morrison\u00a0told him about a phone call earlier that day between Sondland and Trump. \u201cAccording to Mr. Morrison, President Trump told Ambassador Sondland that he was not asking for a \u2018quid pro quo.\u2019 But President Trump did insist that President Zelenskyy go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference, and that President Zelenskyy should want to do this himself,\u201d Taylor told\u00a0Congress.", "RNC: \u201cZelensky has said multiple times that there was no quid pro quo, \u2018no blackmail,\u2019 and that no one \u2018pushed\u2019 him.\u201d", "Jordan: \u201cThe two guys on the [July 25] call, President Trump and President Zelensky, both said no pressure, no pushing, no quid pro quo.\u201d", "It is true that Zelensky told reporters on Oct. 10 that there was \u201cno blackmail\u201d on the phone call and that no one \u201cpushed\u201d or pressured him on that call, as he told reporters during a joint appearance with Trump at the United Nations on Sept. 25. Zelensky said he only learned about the blocked aid after the phone call.", "More recently, Zelensky said he \u201cnever talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo,\u201d but he also took issue with Trump\u2019s hold on military aid to his country.", "\u201cWe\u2019re at war,\u201d Zelensky said in an interview published Dec. 2. \u201cIf you\u2019re our strategic partner, then you can\u2019t go blocking anything for us. I think that\u2019s just about fairness. It\u2019s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.\u201d", "But the RNC\u2019s focus on Zelensky\u2019s response to the July 25 phone call and Jordan\u2019s description of there being \u201ctwo guys on the call\u201d ignore others who were listening in on that conversation and were concerned by Trump\u2019s request that Zelensky undertake investigations into the Bidens and the Democrats.", "Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the White House\u2019s National Security Council who listened in on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky, told House investigators that the call was \u201ctroubling and disturbing\u201d and reported his concerns to the NSC\u2019s legal counsel.", "\u201cI was concerned by the call,\u201d Vindman said in his Oct. 29 deposition. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications to the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine. \u2026 I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d", "Tim Morrison, the outgoing senior director of European affairs at the National Security Council and a deputy assistant to the president, also listened in on the call and later told House investigators that he reported the call to the lawyers, worrying that the political nature of call would be \u201cdamaging\u201d to U.S. interests if leaked to the public.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily fully understand how everybody could use it, but I was concerned that it would wind up politicizing Ukraine. I was concerned that that would, in turn, cost bipartisan support [in Congress],\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was concerned about how the Ukrainians would internalize that.\u201d", "Jennifer Williams, a special adviser for Europe and Russia for Vice President Mike Pence, also listened to the call, which she described as \u201cunusual.\u201d", "\u201cI certainly noted that the mention of those specific investigations seemed unusual as compared to other discussions with foreign leaders,\u201d Williams said when asked in her Nov. 7 deposition if she had \u201cany concerns\u201d about the conversation. \u201cI believed those references to be more political in nature and so that struck me as unusual.\u201d", "RNC: \u201cGordon Sondland testified multiple times that President Trump \u2018said I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.\u2019\u201d", "Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, did tell the House intelligence committee Trump told him that in a Sept. 9 phone call. But when he was asked, Sondland declined to say whether he believed the president.", "\u201cI\u2019m not going to characterize whether I believed or didn\u2019t believe. I was just trying to convey what he said on the phone,\u201d Sondland told Republican counsel Steve Castor.", "Furthermore, as we\u2019ve written before, Sondland also testified that \u201cyes\u201d there was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d when it came to granting Zelensky a White House visit, claiming that the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was acting on Trump\u2019s behalf.", "\u201c[A]s I testified previously, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky,\u201d Sondland said in his opening statement. \u201cMr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election/DNC server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the President.\u201d", "Sondland said such a visit was \u201cvital to cementing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, demonstrating support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, and advancing broader U.S. foreign policy interests.\u201d And, Sondland said, it was openly communicated among numerous officials in the leadership of the State Department and National Security Council that there were efforts to get Zelensky to make a public statement about the investigations to \u201csatisfy President Trump\u2019s concerns\u201d and as a condition for a White House call and visit.", "Also, while Sondland testified that he \u201cnever heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement\u201d from Ukraine, Sondland said he later \u201ccame to the conclusion that the aid, like the White House visit, was jeopardized\u201d unless Zelensky made a public statement about the investigations.", "That was \u201cmy own presumption,\u201d Sondland told the committee.", "And, again, we\u2019d note that Sept. 9 \u2014 when Trump and Sondland spoke by phone \u2014 is the same day that the inspector general of the intelligence community notified the House intelligence committee that he received a whistleblower\u2019s complaint relating to an \u201curgent concern,\u201d and the same day three House committees announced they would investigate whether Trump and Giuliani tried to pressure Ukraine into conducting \u201cpolitically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity.\u201d", "It was also several days after Trump was first briefed by White House lawyers on the whistleblower complaint, as the New York Times first reported.", "\u201cLawyers from the White House counsel\u2019s office told Mr. Trump in late August about the complaint, explaining that they were trying to determine whether they were legally required to give it to Congress,\u201d the Times said, citing \u201ctwo people familiar with the matter.\u201d", "RNC: \u201cAnd David Hale also confirmed that he was not aware of any connection between the pause in aid to Ukraine and investigations.\u201d", "Hale, the under secretary of state for political affairs, testified on Nov. 20 that he wasn\u2019t aware of such a connection, but the RNC leaves out the fact that several other officials testified they believed there was a connection between the freeze on security aid to Ukraine and the investigations Trump asked for in his July 25 phone call with Zelensky.", "For instance, Sondland said that\u00a0\u201cin the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement,\u201d and he communicated that to Andrey Yermak, a close aide to Zelensky, on Sept. 1, telling him that \u201cresumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.\u201d", "Sondland also testified in his Nov. 20 public hearing that he mentioned his concerns that the freeze on the aid was tied to investigations to Vice President Pence, before Sept. 1 meetings with Ukrainian officials and that Pence had nodded, in a \u201csort of duly noted\u201d way. (Pence\u2019s chief of staff later denied\u00a0Sondland\u2019s account.)", "Also, Taylor, the charge d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, told congressional investigators that by mid-July it was clear to him \u201cthat the meeting President Zelensky wanted [with Trump] was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.\u201d And in a Sept. 1 phone call with Sondland, Taylor learned the security aid was also tied to those investigations.", "\u201cDuring that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelenskyy to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election,\u201d Taylor said in his prepared statement. \u201cAmbassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of investigations \u2014 in fact, Ambassador Sondland said, \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance. He said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.\u201d", "David Holmes, a political counselor for the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, testified that \u201cwith no explanation\u201d given for the hold on security aid, the logical conclusion was that there was a link between the hold and the investigations. He said he would be \u201csurprised\u201d if the Ukrainians \u201cwouldn\u2019t have drawn that conclusion\u201d as well.", "RNC: \u201cSondland also testified that America\u2019s aid was released to Ukraine without an investigation and a meeting between President Trump and Ukraine President Zelensky was held without an announcement of investigations.\u201d", "Jordan: \u201cThe Ukrainians never started, never promised to start and never announced an investigation in the time that the aid was paused. Never once.\u201d", "This is a familiar Republican talking point that Ukraine got what it wanted \u2014 a phone call, a meeting with Trump and U.S. security aid \u2014 without having to publicly announce that it would investigate the Bidens and the allegations of Ukraine inference in the 2016 election. But this is misleading.", "Let\u2019s take them one at a time, beginning with the phone call.", "Jordan is wrong to claim that the Ukrainians \u201cnever promised to start\u201d an investigation. The July 25 phone call happened after Trump\u2019s top aides secured a promise that Zelensky would agree to the investigations.", "As we mentioned earlier, Sondland exchanged WhatsApp messages on July 19 with Volker, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, and Taylor, the charge d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine,\u00a0that said a phone call between the two leaders would soon take place. Volker said it is \u201c[m]ost impt \u2026 for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation \u2014 and address any specific personnel issues \u2014 if there are any.\u201d", "Zelensky did exactly that, promising Trump that his next prosecutor general would investigate Burisma.", "\u201cSince we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue,\u201d Zelensky told Trump in the July 25 phone call.", "As for meeting Trump, Zelensky did meet with the president at the United Nations on Sept. 25 \u2014 but it came after the House intelligence committee learned about the whistleblower complaint alleging Trump\u2019s misuse of power and after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry.", "Also, their meeting was not the White House meeting that Trump\u2019s top aides had been offering to Zelensky.", "In his\u00a0prepared remarks at an Oct. 22 closed-door hearing, Taylor recalled how Sondland told him on Sept. 1 that a White House meeting and U.S. security aid were both conditioned on Ukraine\u2019s announcement of the investigations sought by Trump.", "But soon the White House\u2019s hand would be forced by events.", "On Sept. 9, the House intelligence committee learned about the whistleblower complaint and House committees\u00a0announced\u00a0investigations into whether Trump and Giuliani tried to pressure Ukraine into conducting \u201cpolitically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity.\u201d", "Two days later, the White House suddenly released the aid. \u201cIt really came quite out of the blue,\u201d Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, testified about the administration\u2019s decision to lift the hold on the aid. \u201cIt was quite abrupt.\u201d", "So, while it\u2019s true that the aid was released, it came abruptly and under duress.", "RNC: \u201cKurt Volker and Tim Morrison both testified that there was no quid pro quo, no bribery, and no extortion.\u201d", "This claim refers to answers provided by Morrison, a National Security Council aide, and Volker, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, to questions posed by Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik during the Nov. 19 public impeachment inquiry hearings.", "Morrison, who was listening in on the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, and Volker, who later got a readout of the call, testified that on the call there was no mention of withholding aid, no quid pro quo, bribery or extortion.", "In a deposition to House committees on Oct. 31, Morrison said he was \u201cnot concerned that anything illegal was discussed\u201d but later declined to offer an opinion about whether Trump did anything illegal on the call. In his public testimony on Nov. 19, Morrison reiterated that point, stating, \u201cI made no judgment about any illegal conduct occurring.\u201d", "But, as we noted earlier, Morrison was concerned that the contents of the phone call would be \u201cdamaging\u201d to U.S. interests if leaked to the public.", "Stefanik later asked both Morrison and Volker whether they had \u201cany evidence of a quid pro quo \u2026 any evidence of bribery \u2026 any evidence of treason.\u201d Both said they did not.", "But Morrison also testified that he was concerned about what Sondland was asking of the Ukrainians. That concern was piqued by two conversations he had with Sondland.", "The first time came after Sondland privately spoke with Yermak, Zelensky\u2019s aide, on Sept. 1, after the Ukrainian president had met in Poland with Pence. According to Morrison, Sondland told Yermak \u201cwhat could help them move the aid was if the prosecutor general would go to the mic and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation.\u201d Morrison said he was concerned enough about Sondland\u2019s conversation with Yermak that he reported it to then-National Security Adviser John Bolton and NSC lawyers.", "Morrison also described a conversation he had with Sondland regarding a Sept. 7 conversation between Sondland and Trump.", "\u201cIf I recall this conversation correctly, this was where Ambassador Sondland related that there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky had to make the statement and that he had to want to do it,\u201d Morrison said, noting that he understood the \u201cstatement\u201d was about an investigation into the Bidens and the 2016 election.", "Morrison said Sondland believed, after speaking with Trump, that the statement was a condition for the security aid to be released. \u201cI was concerned about what Ambassador Sondland was\u2013was saying were requirements,\u201d Morrison said.", "Morrison said he again provided this information to Bolton, who recommended he again relay the information to NSC attorneys, which Morrison did.", "Jordan: \u201cThe Ukrainians, third, didn\u2019t know the aid was held up at the time of the phone call.\u201d", "This was one of \u201cfour key facts\u201d that the\u00a0Ohio Republican\u00a0said \u201cwill not change, have not changed, will never change.\u201d", "But his claim that the Ukrainians \u201cdidn\u2019t know the aid was held up at the time of the phone call\u201d isn\u2019t an established fact. Jordan\u2019s statement also ignores actions taken by some in the Trump administration after July 25 and into early September to get Ukraine to publicly announce the investigations that were sought by the president.", "The first hold on the Ukraine aid formally occurred on July 25 \u2014 the same day as the Trump-Zelensky phone call.", "Mark Sandy, the deputy associate director for national security at the White House Office of Management and Budget, testified that\u00a0Robert Blair, an assistant to the president and senior adviser to acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, sent an email to Michael Duffey, the associate director of the OMB\u2019s Resource Management Organization, that said the president was directing a hold on security aid for Ukraine. No explanation was given, but it was up to OMB\u2019s legal department to come up with a rationale for the hold.", "The issue, Sandy explained, was \u201chow could we institute a temporary hold consistent with the\u00a0Impoundment Control Act,\u201d which prevents a president from unilaterally changing how to spend congressionally appropriated funds. Sandy testified that he signed a document that officially placed the first hold on the security aid to Ukraine on July 25.", "\u201cAmounts apportioned but not obligated as of the date of this reapportionment for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative are not available for obligation until August 5th, 2019, to allow for an interagency process to determine the best use of such funds,\u201d according to the document Sandy signed on July 25. There were \u201cat least a half-dozen\u201d holds put in place in August and September, he said.", "On the same day as the Trump-Zelensky phone call and the official hold on the security funds, some Ukrainian government officials began to question the delay in funding.", "Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia,\u00a0said this in her\u00a0Nov. 20 testimony: \u201cOn July 25th, a member of my staff got a question from a Ukraine Embassy contact asking what was going on with Ukraine security assistance.\u201d", "At the time, Cooper said, her staff did not know that OMB had placed a hold on the Defense Department funds for Ukraine.", "\u201cThe OMB notice of apportionment arrived that day, but this staff member did not find out about it until later,\u201d she said. \u201cI was informed that the staff member told the Ukrainian official that we were moving forward on USAI [the Defense Department\u2019s\u00a0Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative], but recommended that the Ukraine Embassy check in with State regarding the FMF [State Department-administered funds].\u201d", "Catherine Croft, who served as a special adviser for Ukraine under Volker, told a similar story in her\u00a0Oct. 30 deposition.", "Croft\u00a0said she attended a July 18 meeting where an OMB representative disclosed that Mulvaney \u201chad placed an informal hold on security assistance to Ukraine \u2026 at the direction of the president.\u201d She also said the Ukrainians \u201cfound out very early on\u201d that the U.S. was withholding the funds, but she could not recall the date \u2014 except to say it was before it became publicly known on Aug. 28, when Politico first wrote about the hold in a\u00a0story\u00a0headlined \u201cTrump holds up Ukraine military aid meant to confront Russia.\u201d", "\u201cTwo individuals from the Ukrainian Embassy approached me quietly and in confidence to ask me about an OMB hold on Ukraine security assistance,\u201d she recalled. The Ukrainians wanted to keep word about the hold quiet, she said, because it would signal \u201can expression of declining U.S. support for Ukraine.\u201d", "\u201cI remember being very surprised at the effectiveness of my Ukrainian counterparts\u2019 diplomatic tradecraft, as in to say they found out very early on or much earlier than I expected them to,\u201d Croft said.", "We don\u2019t know exactly when the Ukrainians first learned about the hold.\u00a0As we said earlier, Zelensky has told reporters that he learned about the blocked aid after the phone call. However, other Ukrainian officials were aware of it on the same day as Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky.", "Also, as we document elsewhere, the campaign to get Ukraine to publicly announce the investigations sought by Trump continued long after the July 25 call and into September, when it had become public knowledge that the U.S. had placed a hold on Ukraine security funds.", "As for the next step in the impeachment process, Pelosi announced on Dec. 5 that she has directed the Judiciary Committee chairman to draft articles of impeachment.", "The committee is scheduled to meet next on\u00a0Dec. 9.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
