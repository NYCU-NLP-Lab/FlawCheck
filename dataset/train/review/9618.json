However, the video published along with the article, as well as on the official Facebook page of the conservation and ecotourism brand Singita, was different.", "According to our research, the viral video was shot at Singita\u2019s Boulder lodge which is less than a kilometre away from Singita Ebony Lodge.", "We will now explain how we reached this conclusion. First, we found videos of the Boulders lodge posted on YouTube. A video posted by YouTube channel Celestielle accurately matches with the visuals seen in the viral video. \u201cCelestielle #248 Singita Boulders Lodge, Sabi Sand Private Reserve, South Africa,\u201d reads the title of the video posted on June 13, 2017.", "Then, we compared multiple frames from the viral video and the one posted by Celestielle.

Watch the 3 videos and then the final picture was taken at my place yesterday \u2013 @umganulodge. I\u2019m really hoping a nasty accident doesn\u2019t happen soon. But, the good news though, is that we humans are not a predators prey. We also know that these animals are treated with utmost respect so they do live very well alongside humans in the Sabi Sands area. It\u2019s fascination to see though that coming out of a full lockdown in SA, these animals are being seen by the public a lot closer to rooms/reception areas. Possibly due to their territories shifting without humans being around or they just feel less pressure being in those areas cos they\u2019ve been doing it for the last 6 months with no one around. We have to protect these beautiful creatures. We have to respect their space. Never get over familiar cos that\u2019s when an accident could happen & the human won\u2019t win! Anyway, enjoy these videos!
