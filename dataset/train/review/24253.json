["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "A group known as American Principles in Action is running an ad targeting Hispanic voters in Nevada, trying to weaken their support for President Barack Obama.\n\n\"Don\u2019t be fooled by President Obama\u2019s words,\" the narrator says. \"He\u2019s not committed to immigrants. He only wants our vote. With the election on the line, he offers our undocumented youth a temporary solution that cheats them of legal status. Why didn\u2019t he keep his promise to push immigration reform? Instead, Obama has deported more people than any other president in this country's history. With friends like these, who needs enemies?\"\n\nThe group behind the ad, American Principles in Action is an affiliate of the American Principles Project, a group founded by conservative scholar Robert George of Princeton University. The group\u2019s staff member responsible for Latino issues is Alfonso Aguilar, the former chief of the U.S. Office of Citizenship under President George W. Bush.\n\nBut while the group is independent of the campaign, the ad\u2019s message helps Romney.\n\nNevada is a key battleground state that Obama won in 2008 and which he\u2019s eager to win again. Latinos are a significant voting bloc there and in other swing states that Obama won in 2008, such as Colorado and New Mexico. Polls this year have shown that Latinos heavily support Obama over Mitt Romney, in part because Romney took a tough line against illegal immigration during the GOP primaries.\n\nSo Obama\u2019s critics would like to shrink his lead among Latino voters, particularly in key states, either by bringing them over to Romney\u2019s side or at least by making them less enthusiastic about Obama.\n\nThe ad first dismisses Obama\u2019s proposal in June to temporarily halt deportations of young people, saying it \"cheats them of legal status.\" It then says Obama \"has deported more people than any other president in this country's history.\"\n\nGiven the rhetoric that sometimes criticizes Obama for being weak on illegal immigration, we wondered if that was true. We found it was, for the most part.\n\nAccording to current figures from Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- the federal agency responsible for deportations -- Obama has removed 1.4 million people during his 42 months in office so far. Technically, that's fewer than under George W. Bush, whose cumulative total was 2 million. But Bush\u2019s number covers eight full years, which doesn\u2019t allow an apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nIf you instead compare the two presidents\u2019 monthly averages, it works out to 32,886 for Obama and 20,964 for Bush, putting Obama clearly in the lead. Bill Clinton is far behind with 869,676 total and 9,059 per month. All previous occupants of the White House going back to 1892 fell well short of the level of the three most recent presidents.\n\nWe wondered whether there might have been a surge of undocumented immigrants that explained the increase, but there wasn\u2019t. During the first two years of Obama\u2019s tenure, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated the illegal immigrant population nationwide at 11.2 million, compared to an average during Bush\u2019s eight-year tenure of 10.6 million. And illegal immigration actually peaked late in Bush\u2019s second term, at which point the recession hit and the numbers declined under Obama. Such patterns do not explain the 57 percent bump in monthly deportations that we found under Obama.", "We should also note that if Obama doesn't win a second term, he will almost certainly finish his term trailing George W.\u00a0 Bush in deportations, which would make inaccurate the claim that Obama has \"deported more people than any other president in this country's history.\"", "Still, the ad has a point in noting a significant uptick in deportations under Obama. We asked five immigration specialists -- Columbia University historian Mae M. Ngai, University of Albany historian Carl Bon Tempo, Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian, University of California (Davis) law school dean Kevin R. Johnson and University of San Francisco law professor Bill Hing -- whether they thought the ad\u2019s numerical claim was basically accurate, and they all agreed.\n\nBon Tempo cautioned that some variations in data quality make long-term comparisons somewhat dicey. Still, he added that \"it does seem that deportations are on the rise, and markedly so.\"\n\nBoosting the number of deportations in recent years are a program dating to the Bush years that targets \"fugitive\" aliens, as well as a program known as Secure Communities, under which federal immigration authorities are kept apprised of people who are fingerprinted at the state and local level. Hing, a critic of the program, says it has \"gone way too far, sweeping up many crime victims, witnesses, arrestees whose charges are later dropped, and minor offenders.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has gone even further, with legislative counsel Joanne Lin saying that Obama\u2019s enforcement policies overall have left a \"wake of devastation in Latino communities across the nation,\" according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nObama has not been shy about touting his immigration-enforcement credentials, though he\u2019s usually careful to say he\u2019s prioritizing resources by focusing on deporting criminals rather than law-abiding people.\n\nFor instance, during the speech in which he offered the youth non-deportation proposal, Obama said, \"In the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system, what we\u2019ve tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places. \u2026 We focused and used discretion about whom to prosecute, focusing on criminals who endanger our communities rather than students who are earning their education. And today, deportation of criminals is up 80 percent. We've improved on that discretion carefully and thoughtfully.\"\n\nNgai, the Columbia historian, perceives Obama\u2019s tough enforcement policy as a tactical move.\n\n\"My interpretation is that the Obama administration decided to be tough on \u2018criminal\u2019 aliens in order to get support for legalization of undocumented immigrants with no criminal record,\" Ngai said.\n\nOf course, Romney is widely considered to be taking a harder line on illegal immigration than Obama. According to his website\u2019s statement on immigration policy, Romney opposes both \"amnesty\" and \"all \u2018magnets\u2019 that entice illegal immigrants to come to our country. As governor, he vetoed in-state tuition benefits for illegal immigrants and opposed driver\u2019s licenses for illegal immigrants.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nTechnically, the ad isn\u2019t correct to say that Barack Obama \"has deported more people than any other president in this country's history,\" since George W. Bush cumulatively deported more over his full eight-year term -- and since Bush would remain ahead of Obama if Mitt Romney wins the presidency in November.", "However, we -- and the experts we interviewed -- agree that the ad is right to note a significant jump in deportations under Obama. Measured by the monthly frequency of deportation, Obama\u2019s numbers are significantly higher than Bush\u2019s were, even as the estimated population of illegal immigrants was falling.
