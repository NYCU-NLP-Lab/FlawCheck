["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on April 3, 2020", "More than once, President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that the federal stockpile of emergency medicine and supplies he inherited from his predecessor was an \u201cempty shelf.\u201d", "While the government does not publicize all of the contents of the repository, at the time Trump took office, the Strategic National Stockpile, as it is formally known, reportedly contained vast amounts of materials that state and local health officials could use during an emergency,\u00a0including vaccines, antiviral drugs, ventilators and protective gear for doctors and nurses.", "\u201cThe SNS was definitely not an empty shell,\u201d Dr. Tara O\u2019Toole, a former homeland security official during the Obama administration who is now executive vice president at the nonprofit strategic investment firm In-Q-Tel, told us in an email.", "At least three times in the past week, however, Trump has sought to blame former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration for the current state of the stockpile, which has been unable to meet the demand for additional supplies expected to be needed to treat people with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, or to protect the doctors and nurses caring for those patients.", "During a White House coronavirus task force briefing on March 26, in which Trump mentioned the number of respirators, face shields and ventilators that had so far been distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the president said: \u201cWe took over an empty shelf. We took over a very depleted place, in a lot of ways.\u201d", "When a reporter asked him about that claim during another briefing the following day, Trump again said he inherited \u201can empty shelf\u201d that he had to refill.", "And he continued to use that inaccurate description on March 30, during an interview with the hosts of \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cWe started off with an empty shelf,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have very much in terms of medical product \u2026 and we built something really good.\u201d", "The Strategic National Stockpile was created in 1999, and, as of April 2, was described on a Department of Health and Human Services website as \u201cthe nation\u2019s largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out.\u201d", "(That description was later altered to say, \u201cThe Strategic National Stockpile\u2019s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies.\u201d The change was made after Trump\u2019s son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, said on April 2: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d Some interpreted Kushner\u2019s remarks to mean the federal stockpile was not meant to be used by states, which would be false. But, in context, Kushner said the federal government is trying to \u201cmake informed data-driven decisions, both on ventilators, masks, any other supply we can get, to make sure it\u2019s going to the people who need them.\u201d)", "Most of the materials in the stockpile are stored in large warehouses around the country, and where those warehouses are located, and exactly what\u2019s in them, is not publicly disclosed.", "But NPR science correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce was allowed to visit one facility in June 2016 \u2014 only months before Trump was inaugurated in January 2017. In her article about the warehouse she toured, she described the shelves as being the opposite of bare.", "\u201cA big American flag hangs from the ceiling, and shelves packed with stuff stand so tall that looking up makes me dizzy,\u201d Greenfieldboyce wrote.", "She continued:", "Greenfieldboyce, for NPR, June 26, 2016: The Strategic National Stockpile got its start back in 1999, with a budget of about $50 million. Since then, even though the details aren\u2019t public, it\u2019s clear that it has amassed an incredible array of countermeasures against possible security threats.", "The inventory includes millions of doses of vaccines against bioterrorism agents like smallpox, antivirals in case of a deadly flu pandemic, medicines used to treat radiation sickness and burns, chemical agent antidotes, wound care supplies, IV fluids and antibiotics.", "I notice that one section of the warehouse is caged off and locked. Shirley Mabry, the logistics chief for the stockpile, says that\u2019s for medicines like painkillers that could be addictive, \u201cso that there\u2019s no pilferage of those items.\u201d", "As we walk, I hear a loud hum. It\u2019s a giant freezer packed with products that have to be kept cold.", "Just outside it, there are rows upon rows of ventilators that could keep sick or injured people breathing. Mabry explains that they\u2019re kept in a constant state of readiness. \u201cIf you look down to the side you\u2019ll see there\u2019s electrical outlets so they can be charged once a month,\u201d she says. Not only that\u2014the ventilators get sent out for yearly maintenance.", "In fact, everything here has to be inventoried once a year, and expiration dates have to be checked. Just tending to this vast stash costs a bundle \u2014 the stockpile program\u2019s budget is more than half a billion dollars a year.", "And that was the scene at just one of the repositories where the medicine and supplies are housed. As of 2016, there were at least six warehouses holding \u201capproximately $7 billion in products across more than 900 separate line items,\u201d according to a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.", "VICE News reported on March 17 that its film crew was also allowed inside one of the facilities for an episode of \u201cVICE News Tonight\u201d that aired in December 2016.", "\u201c[A]lthough we couldn\u2019t reveal where it was or what exactly it had inside. It looked like a prepper\u2019s Ikea, with row after row of containers filled with mystery medications and equipment \u2014 including that one item everyone\u2019s been talking about lately, ventilators,\u201d Vice News said.", "In her story, Greenfieldboyce also quoted an official with a consulting firm the government had recently hired to analyze how well the stockpile could respond to a range of threats.", "Rocco Casagrande, the managing director of Gryphon Scientific, told her that he couldn\u2019t publicly discuss the results of the analysis. But, she wrote, he did say \u201cthat across the variety of threats that we examined, the Strategic National Stockpile has the adequate amount of materials in it and by and large the right type of thing.\u201d", "That doesn\u2019t sound to us like empty shelves, either.", "O\u2019Toole, who also chaired an advisory committee on the stockpile for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, did tell us in an interview that \u201cthe SNS mission has expanded\u201d over the years and \u201cone could argue resources did not expand commensurately.\u201d", "But the idea that the stockpile should be able to provide all of the supplies needed during a pandemic is misguided, she said.", "\u201cIt was never, never, never intended to be the full answer to any disaster,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt was intended to bridge from the moment of crisis until a little while after when the private sector would be able to gear up and use the whole global supply chain to deliver what was needed.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that some of the supplies in the stockpile that governors are currently asking the government to send to states were not completely restocked during Obama\u2019s presidency.", "For example, the Washington Post reported on March 10 that the reserves of the N95 respirator masks were not \u201csignificantly restored\u201d after tens of millions of the devices were distributed from the stockpile during the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009. Medical personnel wear the respirators because they can \u201cfilter out at least 95% of airborne particles,\u201d according to the Food and Drug Administration.", "Greg Burel, who was the director of the Strategic National Stockpile for more than 12 years until he retired in January, recently told CBS News: \u201cWe didn\u2019t receive funds to replace those masks, protective gear and the anti-virals that we used for H1N1.\u201d", "He told Vice News that he decided to use the program\u2019s limited funding to instead purchase vaccines, flu medications and other pharmaceuticals.", "\u201cWe had to trade off those funds that we had, and we chose to invest in those lifesaving drugs that would not be available from any other source, in the quantity needed, and in time. I definitely want to see my healthcare workers protected; that\u2019s very important. But if I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Do I buy this many masks to protect this many workers, or do I buy this many medicines to keep people safe that we can\u2019t get elsewhere?\u2019 there\u2019s no easy answer here,\u201d Burel said.", "In other cases, the Obama administration\u2019s attempts to add more equipment, such as ventilators, to the stockpile were not successful.", "As the New York Times reported earlier this week:", "New York Times, March 29: Thirteen years ago, a group of U.S. public health officials came up with a plan to address what they regarded as one of the medical system\u2019s crucial vulnerabilities: a shortage of ventilators.", "The breathing-assistance machines tended to be bulky, expensive and limited in number. The plan was to build a large fleet of inexpensive portable devices to deploy in a flu pandemic or another crisis.", "Money was budgeted. A federal contract was signed. Work got underway.", "And then things suddenly veered off course. A multibillion-dollar maker of medical devices bought the small California company that had been hired to design the new machines. The project ultimately produced zero ventilators.", "That failure delayed the development of an affordable ventilator by at least half a decade, depriving hospitals, states and the federal government of the ability to stock up. The federal government started over with another company in 2014, whose ventilator was approved only last year and whose products have not yet been delivered.", "On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on March 15, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that there were 12,700 ventilators in the stockpile. At the time, there were 3,487 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "As of April 2, there were 239,279 reported cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. In a task force press briefing that same day, Rear Adm. John Polowczyk said that the U.S. has delivered more than 7,600 ventilators to the states, and still has some in reserve.", "Still, O\u2019Toole said she wishes there was less of a focus on expanding the stockpile because it will never be enough and will always lack something that is needed.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t stockpile your way out of a pandemic like this,\u201d she emphasized.", "One of the reasons for the current supply shortage, she said: \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed our own national capacity to manufacture things to degrade and in some places go away. And we\u2019ve done that for cost-efficiency sake.\u201d", "She later added: \u201cWhat we need is not a big stockpile. We need a new strategy. We need to use the technologies we have now to create the capacity to respond to something in close to real-time.\u201d", "That means being able to \u201crapidly design and manufacture what we need, when we need it, and the quantities demanded,\u201d she said.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
