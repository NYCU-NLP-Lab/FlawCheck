Text above the image says:", "\"Aaron Hernandez committed suicide because under the state of Massachussetts law, if you die during a appeal of conviction, the original conviction becomes null & void. This means he technically never violated the New England Patriots contract, thus his daughter is now entitled to the remainder of the guaranteed $15 million the Patriots owe him.\"", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
