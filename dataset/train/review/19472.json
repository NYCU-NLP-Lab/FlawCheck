For example: workers adjusting knobs on a device that was soiled with a brown substance; pouring hot water into a pitcher without first washing hands; touching a drawer handle soiled with grease to remove a clean utensil from the drawer; and donning a pair of gloves and opening a drawer to get a clean utensil and, without hand washing, cutting open two bags of gravy mix.", "What does the state say about all this?", "State inspectors didn\u2019t declare in their reports that nursing home staff needed to wash hands a particular number of times during food preparation.", "And the Department of Health Services wouldn\u2019t comment to us on Outagamie County\u2019s claim that, according to the state\u2019s interpretation of federal rules, 28 hand washes are necessary during sandwich making.", "It seems likely, though, based on the violation notices the state issued, that the state believes the hand washing should have occurred more than nine times.", "Our rating", "Wagner said \"the State of Wisconsin thinks you should have to\" wash your hands \"at least 28 times to make one peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\"", "Wagner later made it clear he was referring to food preparation in a county-owned nursing home.
