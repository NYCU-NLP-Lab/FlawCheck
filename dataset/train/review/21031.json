["About this rating", "A photograph of a king penguin captured by nature photographer Yves Adams in February 2021 showed what appeared to be a brightly hued, lemon-colored penguin.", "In a post published to Facebook on Feb. 18, Adams said he was unpacking gear from boats that had just landed on a remote beach on the island of South Georgia, a British territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean just north of Antarctica. The nearly 1,400-square-mile island is home to the world\u2019s second-largest penguin, the king penguin.", "In his post, Adams said that the penguin \u201cwalked up straight to our direction\u201d in the middle of a chaotic scene filled with sea elephants, Antarctic fur seals, and thousands of other king penguins.", "And the bird\u2019s unforgettable plumage is likely the result of a rare condition known as leucism, according to Vikki McCloskey, curator of the Steinhart Aquarium at the California Academy of Science.", "\u201cIt\u2019s rare, but not unheard of,\u201d McCloskey told Snopes.", "Like albinism, leucism is a condition that affects an animal\u2019s ability to produce pigment in the skin and hair. In particular, it prevents pigments from reaching some of the bird\u2019s feathers while the eyes and skin retain their normal pigmentation, according to Audubon. While the bird\u2019s unique coloration may be pleasing to the photographer\u2019s eye, it could come at a cost in terms of the animal\u2019s safety.", "\u201cBirds with leucism may have weaker feathers that wear out more quickly-not good if you rely on them to thermoregulate,\u201d said McCloskey. \u201cAlso, animals that are not naturally camouflaged have more probability of being targeted by predators. This would explain why they are rarely seen in-situ, as they are probably picked off at a young age. Being part of such a large colony was an advantage for this bird.\u201d", "As far as the yellow coloration, McCloskey said that the king penguin\u2019s chest feathers are an \u201cadvertisement of access to resources \u2014 an essential part of attracting a mate.\u201d Brightly colored feathers are generally the result of a bird\u2019s diet, but a 2013 study found that the yellow pigmentation in a king penguin\u2019s feathers are genetically distinct from other molecules that color feathers and are made internally, which suggested that their unique coloration is likely an evolutionary trait to spur reproduction.", "But sometimes, a little goes a long way. McCloskey said that there may be no evolutionary advantage to this photographed penguin\u2019s brightly colored feathers.", "\u201cI can't think of an evolutionary advantage to 'sticking out like a sore thumb' in regards to predation, but I also can't claim to know what a preferred penguin aesthetic may be,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it's all about the attitude.\u201d", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
