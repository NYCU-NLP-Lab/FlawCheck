He\u2019s also a supporter of Rick Santorum and donated over $13,000 to him. He\u2019s against gay marriage and abortion,\" says the post, with an attached photo.\n\n\"His company pulled a pro-gay shirt back in \u201808, they also blatantly ripped off an Etsy designers work, featured a T-shirt for women that said \u2018eat less\u2019 and most recently had a card with a \u2018tranny\u2019 slur on (it).\n\n\"He also owns Anthropologie and Free People.\"\n\nHayne, 64, is indeed the chairman and CEO of Urban Outfitters Inc., a company that owns Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People -- popular stores with locations across the country. Hayne is worth $1.1 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nFriends here in Florida who saw the Facebook post asked us to look into the connection between Hayne and Santorum, the former Republican U.S. senator who is running for president.\n\nHayne is from Philadelphia and attended Lehigh University near Allentown.\n\nSantorum was elected to the U.S. House to represent a western Pennsylvania district in 1990, then was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994, where he served two terms.\n\nThe campaign donations\n\nHayne has not contributed to Santorum\u2019s presidential campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tabulates campaign contributions.\n\nBut Hayne and his wife Margaret have contributed to Santorum and his political action committee in the past.\n\nFrom 1994-2005 the Haynes contributed $13,900 to Santorum or a PAC he started, Fight-PAC, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.", "The donations ended when Santorum lost his Senate seat in 2006 to Democrat Bob Casey Jr.", "The Haynes, over time, also have contributed to former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican political committee and more recently to Joseph Torsella, a Democrat who briefly ran for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, and Republican Rep. Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania.\n\nHayne\u2019s political stances\n\nThe record on Hayne\u2019s personal and political beliefs is less clear. For his part, Hayne has tried to avoid the topic. (Santorum is a known opponent of abortion and gay marriage.)\n\nIn a profile in Philadelphia Weekly from 2003, Hayne was asked about his support for Santorum. He at first denied contributing to Santorum, according to the article.\n\nAsked to clarify after being shown proof of his contributions, Hayne said: \"I don't want to mislead you. Like many people, I have some affinity for Rick Santorum, and I have problems with some of his positions.\"\n\nThe author of the article, Jonathan Valania, then asked where does Santorum's position on homosexuality (Santorum opposes same-sex marriage and has suggested homosexual sex should be illegal) fit in Hayne\u2019s comfort zone?\n\n\"I'm not going to comment on it,\" the magazine quoted Hayne as saying. \"I have my own opinion, but I am not going to share it. Our job as a business is not to promote a political agenda. That's not what we do. There are all kinds of political views held by my employees. Some would be horrified to learn that we contributed to Santorum's campaign, and others would be fine with it. We openly discuss and joke about our political differences.\"\n\nIn a 2007 interview with Philadelphia Magazine, Hayne explained the contributions and support of Santorum this way: \"I don't like paying taxes -- is that a sin?\" he asks.\n\n\"I like small government,\" Hayne said, explaining a libertarian streak.\n\nThe company, for the record, has not commented on this latest kerfuffle or a similar uproar started in 2011 by a tweet from pop-star Miley Cyrus. Snopes.com failed to turn up anything additional on Hayne\u2019s political positions, though they do a fine job in explaining the rest of the Facebook post if you\u2019re looking to read more.\n\nOur ruling\n\nWe\u2019re focusing here on the Facebook claim that Urban Outfitters CEO Richard Hayne is a supporter of Rick Santorum and donated over $13,000 to him.\n\nWhat we know is that Hayne was at one time a supporter of Santorum, who donated -- between him and his wife -- more than $13,000 to Santorum and one of his political action committees.\n\nHayne has not contributed to Santorum\u2019s run for president, and we do not know if Hayne is supporting Santorum this time around. That, combined with the fact that the donations are nearly 7-18 years old, is enough for us to rate this claim Half True.", "Facebook post about Richard Hayne, accessed April 3, 2012\n\nUrban Outfitters Inc., corporate Website, accessed April 3, 2012\n\n2012 \u00a0Forbes profile of Richard Hayne, updated March 2012\n\nCenter for Responsive Politics, donor look-up, accessed April 3, 2012\n\nPhiladelphia Weekly, \"Clothes Make the Man,\" June 11, 2003\n\nPhiladelphia Magazine, \"Shop Talk,\" April 2007, accessed via Nexis\n\nSnopes.com, Richard Hayne, March 27, 2012\n\nGawker, \"Miley Cyrus Hates Urban Outfitters, Rick Santorum,\" March 28, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
