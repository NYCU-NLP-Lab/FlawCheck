Chris Christie returned to a familiar rallying cry: job growth in New Jersey is among the highest in the nation.\n\n\"We\u2019ve added nearly 85,000 private-sector jobs since February of 2010, seeing the best year of private-sector job growth in 2011 in over a decade and with 2012 already on pace to be even stronger,\" Christie said in a speech during the special session of the state Legislature.\n\n\"Our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation and we\u2019re seeing housing sales, car sales and personal income increasing at higher rates than the nation.\"\n\nBut in claiming \"our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation,\" the Republican governor also was making a familiar mistake, PolitiFact New Jersey found.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted in previous fact-checks, job growth can be measured in two ways -- the net increase in jobs and the percentage increase. Looking at percentage increases accounts for states\u2019 different population sizes.\n\nChristie\u2019s claim is right in terms of the net increase, but wrong in regard to the percentage increase, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBetween May 2011 and May 2012, New Jersey gained 59,800 total nonfarm jobs -- including private- and public-sector employment -- for an increase of nearly 1.6 percent, according to the bureau. The May 2012 figures are preliminary.\n\nThat net increase places the Garden State in sixth place among the 50 states, just as Christie said.\n\nBut the percentage increase leaves the state in 13th place.\n\nThe governor made the same mistake in February, when he said private-sector job growth in 2011 \"places New Jersey in the top third among all of the states.\" He received a Half True, because his claim was right for the net increase, but wrong for the percentage increase.", "The governor's office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a speech Monday during the special session of the state Legislature, Christie claimed \"our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a very specific claim, but it\u2019s only true when you look at New Jersey\u2019s net increase of 59,800 total nonfarm jobs between May 2011 and May 2012. The percentage increase of nearly 1.6 percent leaves the state in 13th place.\n\nWe rate the statement Half True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "New Jersey Governor\u2019s Office, Governor Chris Christie Calls On State Legislature To Act On Tax Relief At Special Session, July 2, 2012\n\nChris Christie - Address to Special Session of Legislature, a video posted on YouTube on July 2, 2012\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey, Chris Christie claims private-sector job growth in 2011 places New Jersey in the top third among the states, Feb. 27, 2012\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Regional and State Employment and Unemployment -- May 2012, June 15, 2012\n\nNew Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, New Jersey Sees Largest Monthly Job Gain in More than Seven Years, Employers add 17,600 jobs in May, June 14, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
