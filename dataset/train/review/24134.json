The official website of Honda is honda.com and the portal specifically dedicated to Honda two-wheelers in India is honda2wheelersindia.com.", "Second, the website\u2019s interface is poor. It is basically an amalgamation of Honda logo with a generic picture lifted from the internet showcasing different colour variants of Honda Activa. The design of the website is optimised for mobile users and one cannot access it from a desktop. A shoddy website \u2018go6.co\u2019 opens up if one tries to access the portal using a desktop.", "Third, the number of \u2018remaining scooters\u2019 always remains the same.", "Lastly, the site asks a couple of generic questions and \u2018gives away\u2019 scooters to everyone who answers them. However, the site says that scooter will only be delivered if one forwards the link to at least 20 WhatsApp friends or groups. This is typical modus operandi of fake websites to dupe people online.", "In conclusion, the message about Honda distributing 300 free Activa scooters is false. A shoddy website is masquearading as the company\u2019s authentic portal.", "Donate Now", "Jignesh is a writer and researcher at Alt News.
