["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on July 16, 2019", "Another fake quote attributed to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is circulating online. She didn\u2019t say that \u201ctruck drivers are destroying America\u201d; that quote came from a website that describes its content as satire.", "Since Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez entered the political scene, she has been the target of many fake quotes.", "Recently, a bogus quote circulating on social media claimed\u00a0that she said: \u201cPrivate truck drivers are destroying America. They get like 4 miles to the gallon, they think they own the road and they throw bottles of pee out their windows so they can keep driving. It\u2019s a barbaric industry. Trucks should all be government regulated and drivers should be on full-time camera until we can figure out how to automate our shipping and do away with them altogether.\u201d", "She didn\u2019t say that.", "That quote came from a story posted on a website called BustaTroll.org, which is part of a network of sites that describe their content as satire. BustaTroll.org\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d page has this disclaimer: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.\u201d", "But the memes that copied the quote from the made-up story do not have any such disclaimer, and the Facebook pages that are sharing them don\u2019t, either. Instead, they share the meme with statements such as, \u201cNot getting political on this page but you ALL SHOULD KNOW this is what AOC thinks of ALL OF US,,,,,she needs to go.\u201d And readers of those pages have responded with comments\u00a0such as: \u201cHard to believe what kind of voters voted for this imbecile.\u201d", "But, of course, the quote is completely fabricated.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
