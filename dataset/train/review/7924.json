(AP)", "\u2022 Biden said during the presidential debate that he does not support the Green New Deal, and that it\u2019s not his plan.", "\u2022 His climate plan shares some of the goals of the Green New Deal, like net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but leaves out other agenda items such as universal health care and affordable housing.", "Former Vice President Joe Biden is being challenged on social media over his muddled messaging on the Green New Deal during the first presidential debate.", "A TikTok post plays a clip of the presidential debate in which Biden said he doesn\u2019t support the Green New Deal. The video then shows a screenshot of Biden\u2019s climate action plan, which calls the deal a \"crucial framework\" for acting on climate challenges. The TikTok user holds up a sign calling Biden a \"liar.\"", "Interrupted repeatedly by President Donald Trump, Biden struggled during the debate to explain where he stood on the Green New Deal.", "\"The Green New Deal is not my plan,\" he said. Shortly after that, he said the Green New Deal would \"pay for itself as we move forward.\"", "When pressed by moderator Chris Wallace, Biden responded, \"No, I don\u2019t support the Green New Deal.\" Biden went on to say that he supports \"the Biden plan that I put forward \u2026 which is different.\"", "In the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate, Biden\u2019s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, was also pressed on the issue, with Vice President Mike Pence calling the Biden plan a \"$2 trillion version of the Green New Deal\" and noting that Harris cosponsored a Green New Deal resolution in the Senate.

Let\u2019s start by looking at the Green New Deal.", "The Green New Deal was a 2019 House resolution sponsored by Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. On its own, it would not have changed any laws. Rather, it listed a variety of climate change and environmental justice goals \u2014 such as universal access to clean water, resiliencies against extreme weather, and pollution and carbon emission reductions \"as much as technologically feasible.\"", "It called on federal lawmakers to enact a 10-year \"national mobilization\" plan to achieve those goals, and said the world needs net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 to prevent severe impacts of climate change.", "Biden\u2019s climate plan echoes some of that language, but differs significantly in scope. For example, it also calls for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But it\u2019s missing some of the environmental justice goals the Green New Deal included. While Biden may share these goals, his climate plan doesn\u2019t specifically include calls for universal access to high-quality health care and affordable housing.", "Biden\u2019s climate action plan gives a nod to the Green New Deal as \"a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.\" According to his website, the plan borrows \"two basic truths\" from the Green New Deal: that the U.S. needs to be more ambitious, and that the environment and economy are connected.", "The TikTok post claimed that text on Joe Biden\u2019s campaign website proves that he supports the Green New Deal, despite his denials in the first presidential debate.", "Biden\u2019s plan shares some of the Green New Deal\u2019s goals, and he has acknowledged that his plan was inspired by it.
