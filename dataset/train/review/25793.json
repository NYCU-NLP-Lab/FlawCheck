No,\u201d the caption on the photo reads.

But those ballots had not yet been cast.", "Katie Conner, a spokesperson for the office, told USA TODAY that the ballots were in their original envelopes and were removed from voters\u2019 mailboxes before they had the chance to fill them out. The ballots were sealed, according to the release.", "The ballots were found by a man named Brayan Ruiz, who was working in the area on Oct. 30, according to a video on the Glendale Police Department\u2019s Facebook.
