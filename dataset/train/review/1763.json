["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on October 11, 2019", "In this week\u2019s fact-checking video, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper debunks two claims made by President Donald Trump about the U.S. military involvement in Syria.", "Trump falsely claimed on Twitter, \u201cThe United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago.\u201d He then repeated the claim both in remarks at the White House and in a campaign rally. But several experts told FactCheck.org and CNN that they never heard of such a 30-day timeline.", "In fact, when the Obama White House first announced the deployment of special operations troops in October 2015, then-Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t have a specific date to give you when they will come out.\u201d", "Earnest said that \u201cwe\u2019ve been quite candid about the fact that this is not a short-term proposition in terms of our counter-ISIL strategy,\u201d referring to the terrorist organization known as the Islamic State.", "Trump also wrongly claimed that thousands of captured Islamic State fighters in Syria were \u201cmostly from Europe,\u201d when in fact they are overwhelmingly from Iraq and Syria.", "The most recent report from the inspectors general of the Department of Defense, the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development says that of the 10,000 Islamic State fighters being detained by the Syrian Democratic Forces across northeastern Syria, 8,000 were nationals of Iraq and Syria. The rest were \u201cforeign fighters\u201d from other countries, including \u201cabout 800 \u2026 believed to be from European nations.\u201d", "For more on these claims, see our story \u201cTrump\u2019s False Tweets on Syria.\u201d Our previous fact-checking video collaborations with CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d are posted on our website.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
