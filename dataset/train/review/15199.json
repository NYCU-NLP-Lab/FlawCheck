["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on March 27, 2019", "In an interview about the special counsel\u2019s report, Rep. John Ratcliffe said that what \u201cstarted all of this\u201d was \u201ca fake, phony dossier.\u201d But a House Republican intelligence committee memo said\u00a0it was information about a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser that sparked the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the election.", "Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican who is a member of the House intelligence committee, said in the interview on Fox Business Network that \u201cI had seen every classified document that any member of Congress was allowed to see. So I wasn\u2019t surprised at all at the findings\u201d of the special counsel investigation, as revealed in a four-page memo on March 24 by Attorney General William P. Barr. He then turned to the dossier.", "Ratcliffe, March 25:\u00a0That this was a fake, phony dossier that started all of this, funded by the Democrats. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t real and now Bob Mueller says it wasn\u2019t real.", "The \u201cdossier\u201d is a series of memos compiled by former British intelligence officer\u00a0Christopher Steele on supposed contacts between Russian officials and members of the Trump campaign. It alleged the Russian government had compromising information on then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Steele was hired by the research firm Fusion GPS, which had been hired by\u00a0a law firm representing Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. (See \u201cQ&A on the Nunes Memo\u201d for more information.)", "We don\u2019t know what special counsel Robert S. Mueller III said, or didn\u2019t say, about the dossier in his report to Barr. For now, Mueller\u2019s report remains confidential. But we do know, according to Barr\u2019s summary of it, that Mueller\u2019s report said:\u00a0\u201c[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u201d", "Barr wrote in his memo that \u201cthe Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.\u201d", "But Ratcliffe is wrong to say the dossier \u201cstarted all of this.\u201d Competing memos from the Republicans and the Democrats on the House intelligence committee both say that information about George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, had prompted the FBI investigation in July 2016.", "Papadopoulos had contacts with Russian intermediaries during the campaign, according to the Justice Department, and later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about those contacts. While he was a Trump campaign adviser, Papadopoulos met with a professor with connections to Russian government officials who told him \u201cabout the Russians possessing \u2018dirt\u2019 on then-candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of \u2018thousands of emails,'\u201d and he tried to arrange a meeting between the Russian government and the campaign, the DOJ\u2019s statement of the offense said.", "A memo released Feb. 2, 2018, by the Republicans on the House intelligence committee raised concerns about the use of the dossier in an application from the DOJ and FBI\u00a0under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to conduct electronic surveillance on\u00a0Carter Page, another Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. But it said the\u00a0\u201cPapadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016.\u201d", "The Democrats on the House intelligence committee agreed with that, saying in a memo released Feb. 24, 2018, that the FBI investigation started \u201cmore than seven weeks\u201d before the FBI received Steele\u2019s intelligence reporting in mid-September of that year.", "The two sides disagree about how essential the dossier was to the FISA court application to monitor Page. But one of the few points of agreement is that the FBI investigation began with information on Papadopoulos.", "After the GOP memo was released, Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, also a member of the intelligence committee, said the dossier didn\u2019t have any effect on the Russia investigation.\u00a0\u201cI actually don\u2019t think it has any impact on the Russia probe,\u201d\u00a0Gowdy said on Feb. 4, 2018, on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d", "Gowdy mentioned other incidents that had nothing to do with the dossier, including Papadopoulos\u2019 contacts with the professor and the\u00a0June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting Donald Trump Jr. arranged with what he was told was a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d offering incriminating information on Hillary Clinton. \u201cSo there\u2019s going to be a Russia probe, even without a dossier.\u201d", "We asked Ratcliffe\u2019s office how he could claim that \u201ca fake, phony dossier \u2026 started all of this.\u201d His office responded: \u201cVery easily. Both statements are true. The Papadopoulos information is the stated basis for FBI Agent Peter Strzok\u2019s opening of the FBI\u2019s Crossfire Hurricane counterintelligence investigation on Sunday July 31, 2016. The Steele dossier, funded by the Democrats, started many months before that date. Further to that point, the sworn testimony of then DOJ ADAG Bruce Ohr is that he met directly with and was personally briefed on the dossier by Christopher Steele at the Mayflower Hotel on Saturday July 30, 2016, the day before the FBI officially opened its investigation.\u201d", "Ratcliffe\u2019s office added: \u201cThe \u2018Trump-Russia collusion\u2019 narrative (which Mueller\u2019s findings conclude is false) was started by and through the Steele dossier months and months before the FBI investigation was opened.\u201d But that\u2019s not correct.", "The Steele dossier didn\u2019t start \u201cmany months\u201d before the FBI launched its counterintelligence investigation. Glenn R. Simpson of Fusion GPS testified to Congress that he hired Steele in May or June 2016, asking Steele to \u201cfind\u00a0out about Donald Trump\u2019s business activities in Russia.\u201d The first of a series of memos from Steele was dated June 20, 2016, and Simpson said he would have received it \u201cwithin a couple days\u201d of that date. That\u2019s one month before the FBI counterintelligence investigation began.", "There\u2019s also no evidence\u00a0that Ohr\u2019s late July 2016 meeting with Steele precipitated the FBI investigation. Ohr,\u00a0a former associate deputy attorney general with the Department of Justice, testified to Congress that he didn\u2019t know about the FBI investigation at the time. Ohr said he reached out to then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and met with McCabe in August 2016 to provide the information Steele had given him. \u201cI don\u2019t recall the exact date.\u00a0I\u2019m guessing it would have been in August since I met with Chris Steele at the end of July, and I\u2019m pretty sure I would have reached out to Andrew McCabe soon afterwards,\u201d Ohr said in his August 2018 testimony.", "Ratcliffe wasn\u2019t the only Republican to bring up the dossier after Barr released his memo summarizing the special counsel\u2019s report.", "Jay Sekulow, an attorney for the president, said in a March 25 interview on Fox News: \u201cThe whole impetus upon which this inquiry engaged, where it came out of, was this dossier, this counterintelligence investigation regarding collusion.\u201d And Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, said the same day on the cable network: \u201cAnd it\u2019s really shameful that for two years this cloud has been upon his presidency and it was precipitated by this fake dossier\u00a0paid for by the Hillary Clinton and the DNC that the Justice Department ran with, that Democrats for two years have accused our president of being an agent for a foreign country.\u201d", "As we explained, dueling House intelligence committee memos agree it was the Papadopoulos information that triggered the FBI investigation.", "Also on Fox News, Rep. Matt Gaetz claimed that \u201ceven [former FBI Deputy Director] Andrew McCabe indicated that in the absence of the\u00a0dossier, the Papadopoulos meeting would not have been enough to continue the investigation.\u201d", "Gaetz is referring to the February 2018 Republican memo, which claimed that\u00a0McCabe had\u00a0testified in December \u201cthat no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.\u201d But that has been disputed, including by McCabe.", "Democrats said at the time that the memo\u2019s description of McCabe\u2019s closed-door testimony was incorrect. In an interview with CNN, McCabe said his testimony had been \u201cselectively quoted\u201d and \u201cmischaracterized\u201d in the GOP memo.", "\u201cWe started the investigations without the dossier. We were proceeding with the investigations before we ever received that information,\u201d McCabe told CNN. \u201cWas the dossier material important to the [FISA] package? Of course, it was. As was every fact included in that package. Was it the majority of what was in the package? Absolutely not.\u201d", "As for the special counsel\u2019s investigation, Mueller was appointed by Rod Rosenstein, in his capacity as acting attorney general, on May 17, 2017, eight days after President Donald Trump had fired then-FBI Director James Comey. Rosenstein said in a statement that \u201cthe public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command.\u201d", "\u201cI determined that a Special Counsel is necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome\u201d of the Russia investigation, he said. \u201cOur nation is grounded on the rule of law, and the public must be assured that government officials administer the law fairly.\u201d", "For more on key moments in the Russia probe, see our story \u201cTimeline of Russia Investigation.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
