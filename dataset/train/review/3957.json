The U.K. recently became the first country to approve the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for distribution.", "The U.K. and other countries remain a long way from achieving herd immunity without a vaccine, experts said. It\u2019s wrong to say there\u2019s \u201cno need for vaccines.\u201d", "As Pfizer landed approval to begin distributing its COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom, a former company employee\u2019s wrong claims downplaying the pandemic recirculated online.", "The social media posts rely on statements made by Michael Yeadon, who argued in an Oct. 16 blog post that the coronavirus pandemic is \"effectively over\" in the U.K., and that \"there is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic.\"", "The posts suggest that Yeadon\u2019s connection to Pfizer makes his views on the pandemic and vaccines credible.", "\"This is a factual article from a factual publication by a factual doctor who happens to be one of the utmost leading expert(s) on vaccines in the world,\" one Instagram post said.", "\"Here we have it,\" another post on Facebook said. \"The company making the vaccine saying the pandemic is over and healthy people do not need a vaccine.\"", "But Yeadon hasn\u2019t worked for Pfizer in nine years, according to the Associated Press and his LinkedIn profile. He was formerly the chief scientific officer of allergy and respiratory research, his profile says.", "And his claims are wrong, experts told PolitiFact. So are the social media posts that spread them. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

A widespread vaccine could prevent future waves, experts said.", "The Associated Press also debunked Yeadon\u2019s statements. Fact-checkers with Lead Stories and Health Feedback previously addressed similarly inaccurate claims he made in a separate blog post and in an interview with a talk radio host in the U.K.", "PolitiFact\u2019s efforts to contact Yeadon were unsuccessful.", "Yeadon\u2019s claim that the pandemic is \"effectively over\" is at odds with data showing that the U.K. was among the many countries where cases rose over the last several months.", "The U.K. saw a sharp surge in daily confirmed cases between September and mid-November, when the numbers began to fall again as stricter restrictions were introduced. The country is still reporting tens of thousands of new cases each day, along with hundreds of deaths daily.", "In total, the coronavirus has infected more than 1.6 million people in the U.K. to date, according to Johns Hopkins University data. It has killed nearly 60,000.", "\"If Dr. Yeadon\u2019s claim were true that the pandemic is effectively over, then the number of cases in various countries should be leveling off or dropping,\" said Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California.", "Days before Yeadon published his blog post on Oct. 16, the U.K.\u2019s deputy chief medical officer warned in an op-ed that the nation was \"at a tipping point similar to where we were in March.\"", "Indeed, confirmed cases in the U.K. were already \"on the upswing\" in mid-October, said Emily Bruce, a faculty scientist in medicine at the University of Vermont\u2019s Larner College of Medicine. They have increased substantially in the roughly six weeks since, Bruce said.", "Many other countries have experienced similar trends as colder weather has sent more people indoors. The U.S. reported over 1 million new cases in the first 10 days of November.", "Yeadon\u2019s claim about vaccines is also wrong. \"There is definitely still a need for vaccines,\" said Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University.", "In his blog post, Yeadon argued that more people are immune to COVID-19 than the U.K.\u2019s scientists recognize, because many were previously infected with other coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.", "That, he insisted, meant both the U.K. and the world are close to achieving herd immunity. Herd immunity occurs when enough people are immune to a virus to limit new infections and spread.", "But experts told PolitiFact that Yeadon was leaping to conclusions.", "\"Whether prior infection with a seasonal coronavirus confers protection from SARS-CoV-2 is still not a settled question,\" Bruce said. \"While recent work indicates that it is possible that some cross protection (particularly from T cells) exists, this is not yet fully understood.\"", "\"The immune system tends to be very specific, so exposure to related viruses does not necessarily result in protection from all of those related viruses,\" Watanabe added.", "Herd immunity generally requires greater than 70% of a population to be immune, Watanabe said. But experts agreed that\u2019s a long way away without a vaccine.", "What we know about current case trends and the number of people who have been infected suggests that \"vaccination would be required to prevent future waves,\" Nichols said.", "Even if herd immunity were reached without widespread vaccination, she said, anyone who has not been infected would remain susceptible to the virus unless they got a vaccine.", "RELATED: What we know about COVID-19 and immunity", "In a blog post that has sparked several widespread social media posts, Yeadon claimed the pandemic is \"effectively over\" in the U.K. and \"there is absolutely no need for vaccines.\"", "Both points are inaccurate and at odds with the realities of the pandemic, which has upended lives and killed over 1.4 million people globally. Confirmed daily case counts were rising in the U.K. at the time of Yeadon\u2019s claim and remain in the tens of thousands.
