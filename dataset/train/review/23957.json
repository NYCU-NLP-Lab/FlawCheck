The topic was a hearing he would lead the next day as chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.", "Asked by a listener if it's possible to secure the border and \"negotiate\" undocumented immigrants, Johnson replied:", "\"Of course, that is the first step. We have to secure the border, we have to give the American public confidence that we're going to actually secure the border.", "\"And then, we're a compassionate nation. We're going to deal with that reality of 11 to 12 million people. By the way, in our hearings, (we were told) 8.1 million of those people in this country illegally are working, and most of them are working hard, contributing to their communities. This is an untenable situation, we need to bring those people out of the shadows, but first we need to secure the border.\"", "If Johnson\u2019s statistical claim is accurate, two-thirds or more of undocumented immigrants are employed.", "But his description of the 8 million as workers overstates the situation a bit.", "The figures", "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not attempt to count the number of unauthorized immigrants who are working.", "But we found estimates, based on census data, that were made by the the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.

Half are Mexican.", "Regarding work, Pew estimated that in 2012 there were 8.1 million unauthorized immigrants who were either working or looking for work -- that is, they were in the labor force -- people ages 16 and older who are employed or looking for work.", "Pew told us it does not have a breakdown on how many were working and how many were looking for work.", "When we asked Johnson\u2019s office for information to back his statement, the office cited verbal testimony from Pew senior demographer Jeffrey Passel, the author of the research we've cited.
