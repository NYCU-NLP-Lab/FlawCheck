["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos said increased revenues are needed to deal with the national debt, but the path to that goal isn\u2019t paved with tax hikes.\n\nRather, Kyrillos said, he wants to lower taxes to stimulate growth.\n\n\"Well, we're going to have to raise revenue and I want to do it through growth. I want to lower tax rates. I want to make sure that America doesn't have the highest corporate tax rate in the world, which is what we have now, and lower the rates for everybody,\" Kyrillos said during a debate tonight with his Democratic rival, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, that aired on NJTV.\n\nAre corporations in the United States subject to the highest tax rate in the world?\n\nThe statutory rate for businesses is the highest among industrialized nations. But for the rate businesses actually pay -- what\u2019s called the effective tax rate -- the United States ranks among the highest, but not at the very top, according to studies.\n\nWe checked a nearly identical claim that Kyrillos made during an Aug. 20 interview on WOR-AM. Then he said, \"we've got the highest corporate tax rate in the world.\" We rated that statement Mostly True.\n\nAt that time, a spokeswoman for Kyrillos cited the nation\u2019s top statutory corporate tax rate of 39.2 percent. That rate is a combination of federal, state and local tax rates before any tax breaks are factored in.\n\nJapan used to have a higher statutory rate than the United States. But in April, Japan reduced its rate and the U.S. took first place among industrialized nations, according to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group.\n\nSo on that point, Kyrillos is right.\n\nSince businesses receive a number of tax breaks, the effective tax rate for corporations in the U.S. isn\u2019t the world\u2019s highest, but it\u2019s still up there.\n\nMore than a dozen of the most recent studies on effective corporate tax rates across the world found businesses in the U.S. paid an effective rate between 23 percent and 34.9 percent, according to a September 2011 report from the Tax Foundation.\n\nThe effective rate varied between the studies the Tax Foundation looked at because of different methodologies.\n\nIn those studies, the U.S. never ranked first in the world. But in 10 of the studies, the nation\u2019s effective corporate tax rate ranked among the top five highest.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that an analysis by the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice along with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, found that 30 Fortune 500 companies, including General Electric, didn\u2019t pay any federal corporate income taxes over the 2008-2010 period.\n\nAs for what is the better measure -- statutory rates or effective rates -- we found mixed views.\n\nScott Hodge, the president of the Tax Foundation, told PolitiFact New Jersey in August that because statutory rates are fixed they make for better comparisons, whereas effective rates are unpredictable and vary across different industries.\n\nBut Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said \"effective tax rates provide the best measure of comparison for overall tax burdens.\"\n\nThen Aparna Mathur, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said in an e-mail that \"both are equally valid measures of looking at the burden of the corporate income tax.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nKyrillos repeated a claim he made before that the United States has the \"highest corporate tax rate in the world.\"\n\nThat\u2019s true for the nation\u2019s statutory corporate tax rate among industrialized nations. When Japan lowered its statutory rate, the United States moved into first place.\n\nEven when accounting for various tax breaks, the effective rate is still among the highest.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate this statement Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "YouTube, NJ Senate debate, Menendez, Kyrillos at MSU, Oct. 4, 2012\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey, U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos claims United States has the \"highest corporate tax rate in the world,\" Aug. 27, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
