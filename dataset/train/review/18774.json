["The two images in the\u00a0post\u00a0purportedly show the southern city of Davao, where Duterte served as mayor for over two decades before he was elected president in May 2016.", "Below is a screenshot of the post:", "The text above the photos in the post, when translated to English, says: \u201cHere is how disciplined the people of Davao city are. The surroundings are so clean and there is no garbage\u201d.", "The top photo shows a yellow bridge with a man on a bike, while the photo below it shows a building with a logo above the entrance.", "Using reverse search, AFP traced the top photo to this 2014 blog\u00a0about bikeways in Marikina city. Marikina city is part of Metro Manila, about 1,500\u00a0kilometres (950\u00a0miles) from Davao. Here is the city\u2019s official website.", "Below is a screenshot of that blog.", "This search using Google maps in street view further proves that bikeway existed in Marikina city in 2014.", "The image from the Google maps and the false Facebook post contains these three same indicators:", "1- a yellow bridge", "2 - a building with striped painting of white and brown", "3- a tree at the end of the bridge", "A reverse search of the second photo also traces it back to the about page of the official website of Marikina city. The photo in the website contains the address and contact details of the Marikina city hall.", "Below is a screenshot of the Marikina page that\u00a0shows\u00a0the same image as in the misleading post.", "The misleading post was shared more than 1,500 times in less than four days by a Facebook group that promotes senatorial candidate Ronald \u201cBato\u201d dela Rosa, an ally of Duterte.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
