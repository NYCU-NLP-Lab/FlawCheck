Skeptical Facebook users flagged the story posted on several websites as potentially fake news.", "The original post was published Aug. 16 on asamericanasapplepie.org.

In other words, it\u2019s a satirical website.", "But there are tip-offs that the story is a fake.", "\u201cToday, President Trump very quietly ended the tenure of the Moslem 14 \u2014 as they have named their little group of Allah worshippers \u2014 with an executive order eliminating their benches altogether,\u201d the story says. \u201cWhite House Propaganda Director Emmanuel Goldstein told Fox News: President Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to remove a federal judge appointed and confirmed by the Senate, but he does have the authority to determine the number of benches in the judiciary per the Evacuation Clause. He reduced that number today by 14.\u201d", "There is no \u201cWhite House Propaganda Director.\u201d And the link on \u201cFox News\u201d doesn\u2019t lead to an interview with someone from the cable news organization. Instead, the link sends readers to a webpage that sings, \u201cYou are an idiot.\u201d", "There aren\u2019t even 14 Muslim federal judges to fire. In September 2016, former President Barack Obama nominated attorney Abid Riaz Qureshi to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. He reportedly would have been the first American Muslim\u00a0to become a federal judge, but his nomination was never confirmed by the Senate.", "The bogus story also says: \u201cPresident Trump had no choice but to fire one of [the judges] last month when he ruled that Sharia Law was OK if the defendant is Moslem and reasonably expected to follow his faith or face eternity in hell.\u201d", "That\u2019s a reference to another satirical story that we wrote about. It said Trump fired a federal judge by the (fake) name of Mahal al Alallaha-Smith, who ruled that \u201ctwo \u2018critical issues for Muslims\u2019 in Sharia Law had to be abided by in the United States court system because of the systematic infusion clause and because the 14th Amendment guarantees them the rights guaranteed by other states.\u201d", "If one story cites another fake story as fact, then there\u2019s a good chance it is also fake.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "\u201cPresident Trump Fires All 14 Muslim Federal Judges.\u201d Americanprides.com. 22 Aug 2017.", "\u201cPresident Trump Fires All 14 Muslim Federal Judges.\u201d Thefreedomsfinalstand.com. 25 Aug 2017.", "Eagleton, Flagg. \u201cPresident Trump Fires All 14 Muslim Federal Judges.\u201d Asamericanasapplepie.org. 16 Aug 2017.", "Schaedel, Sydney. \u201cNo Legalization of Sharia Law.\u201d FactCheck.org. 28 Jul 2017.", "White House. \u201cPresident Obama Nominates Abid Riaz Qureshi to Serve on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\u201d Press release. 6 Sep 2016.", "Johnson, Carrie. \u201cLawyer Nominated By Obama Would Be First Muslim Federal Judge.\u201d NPR. 7 Sep 2016.", "Khan, Fatima. \u201cMuslim Advocates Heralds President Obama\u2019s Historic Judicial Nomination.\u201d MuslimAdvocates.org. 6 Sep 2016.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
