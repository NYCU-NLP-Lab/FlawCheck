["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on January 15, 2019", "A satirical story about President Donald Trump\u2019s family donating $1 billion for his proposed border wall has spread to other sites that fail to label the work satire.", "Whether President Donald Trump will be able to secure funding from Congress to build his proposed wall at the southern border isn\u2019t clear.", "Democrats have so far rebuffed Trump\u2019s request to provide\u00a0$5.7 billion\u00a0for the project \u2014 an appropriations stalemate that has prompted what is now the longest-running government shutdown. His administration has reportedly eyed other sources of funding.", "We do know, however, that Trump\u2019s family has not made any announcement that it will be donating $1 billion for the wall through a GoFundMe campaign.", "A headline\u00a0spreading that falsehood recently appeared on a number of websites \u2014 including trump-feed.com, thedailywire.site\u00a0and\u00a0toptopic.club \u2014 and has circulated\u00a0on social\u00a0media, where some commenters cheered the supposed announcement.", "But the story is actually the product of a publisher\u00a0with a history of starting viral hoaxes. America\u2019s Last Line of Defense published the story on wearethellod.com Dec. 30.", "For the past several years, that publisher, through a number of websites, has spread stories it deems satire, but that are often political in nature and frequently consumed and shared as news. We\u2019ve written\u00a0about\u00a0many of them.", "The websites that copied the story about the supposed Trump family donation failed to label the story as satire, which might have still become clear to those reading beyond the headline. For example, the story quotes \u201cArt Tubolls\u201d \u2014 a fake name that often appears in Last Line of Defense stories \u2014 and assigns him the nonexistent title of \u201cDirector\u00a0of Presidential\u00a0Image and Propaganda.\u201d", "Christopher Blair, the man behind America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, has openly\u00a0stated\u00a0his intent to troll conservatives by tricking them into believing made-up stories.", "His claims often gain traction online: One of the most viral falsehoods on Facebook last year, according to a BuzzFeed News analysis, was a Last Line of Defense story about Michael Jordan stepping down from Nike\u2019s board of directors in protest over controversial advertising.\u00a0We debunked that one, too.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cAbout Us.\u201d WeAreTheLLOD.com.
