This article discusses the construction of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor being built in Varanasi. It describes how locals were removed and their homes demolished for the construction of the corridor. Several other photographs of the construction process have also been published in the report. The temple seen in both images looks similar when examined carefully.", "When we looked for video reports on the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor on YouTube, we found a NewsClick video dated May 18, 2019, which covered the impact of this construction work on local residents. A closer look makes it clear that the visual seen in this video at the 2:50 mark is where the image in question was taken from.", "In addition to the temples seen in the video screenshot and the viral image below, the same tower, a small temple in the back, and nearby houses and windows are seen in both.
