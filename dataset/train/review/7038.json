["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on January 8, 2016", "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders says that the American people \u201cunderstand that something is profoundly wrong when the 20 richest people in our country own more wealth than the bottom half of the American population \u2014 150 million people.\u201d That statistic is correct, according to an analysis from a left-leaning think tank.", "However, that analysis also found that the bottom 40 percent of Americans have a combined negative net worth. That means that one doesn\u2019t have to be among the top 20 in terms of wealth to have more net worth than millions of Americans.", "In fact, any single individual with a positive net worth\u00a0\u2014 including Sanders \u2014 has more wealth than the bottom 40 percent combined.", "Sanders made the claim in a Jan. 5 speech about Wall Street in which he stressed inequality in America, one of his main campaign topics.\u00a0A reader asked us to \u201cverify the accuracy of this unbelievable statement.\u201d\u00a0Whether the wealth statistic is \u201cprofoundly wrong\u201d or \u201cunbelievable\u201d is of course a matter of opinion. We offer an explanation of the figure and context.", "The Vermont senator is referring to a December 2015 report titled \u201cBillionaire Bonanza: The Forbes 400 and the Rest of Us\u201d by researchers with the Institute for Policy Studies. Sanders\u2019 claim comes from the report\u2019s top key finding: \u201cAmerica\u2019s 20 wealthiest people \u2014 a group that could fit comfortably in one single Gulfstream G650 luxury jet \u2013\u00ad now own more wealth than the bottom half of the American population combined, a total of 152 million people in 57 million households,\u201d the report says.", "The report, by the think tank\u2019s Chuck Collins and Josh Hoxie, a former Sanders staffer, bases its numbers for the general population on the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2013 Survey of Consumer Finance. \u201cWealth\u201d or \u201cnet worth\u201d is not a measure of income, but instead the difference between assets and liabilities, or debts,\u00a0owed. Their figure of 152 million people is extrapolated from the total number of households. The report explains: \u201cThe total number of households (115,610,216) multiplied by average persons per household (2.63) divided in half is 152 million people.\u201d", "In the end notes, the report says\u00a0that the bottom 40 percent of Americans actually have a combined negative net worth, due to a high negative net worth of only the bottom 12 percent. As the report says, this skews that total net worth of the 40 percent \u2014 and consequently, the bottom 50 percent, too.", "\u201cBillionaire Bonanza,\u201d end notes: According to our calculations, the bottom 40 percent combined have a negative net worth, a figure that becomes positive in the 41 percentile. Only 12 percent have negative net wealth, but the large negative wealth of the bottom percentiles skews the bottom figures downward.", "This doesn\u2019t mean that the top 20 people haven\u2019t amassed considerable wealth, no matter how the numbers are sliced. The report says that the top 20 people have a combined net worth of $732 billion in 2015. The bottom 50 percent of Americans have a combined net worth of $676.14 billion, also in 2015 numbers. (The report relies on the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2013 numbers and adjusts them for inflation.)", "The top 20 still sit in a class among themselves even if we take out the bottom 12 percent of Americans, whose negative net worth brings the bottom 50 percent\u2019s figure down. Hoxie provided us with figures for each percentile. If that 12 percent were\u00a0left out, the rest of the bottom half of the population\u00a0\u2014 percentiles 13 through 50 \u2014 have a combined net worth of\u00a0$1 trillion. That\u2019s more than the $732 billion owned by the top 20 people, but that\u2019s also 20 people compared with about 116 million.", "Per capita, the top 20 have $36.6 billion\u00a0in net worth each. That\u2019s well more than even the 99th percentile, which starts at $7.9 million.", "But the gap Sanders cites is due not only to the wealthiest having so much wealth \u2014 it\u2019s due to the poorest, in terms of assets, having negative net worth.", "Since the bottom 40 percent have a combined negative net worth, one only has to have a net worth of zero to be wealthier than that. If your house is worth more than you owe and you have little to no additional debt \u2014 or even if you have no assets but no debt \u2014 you, too, would be wealthier than the bottom 40 percent combined.", "Sanders, in fact, is wealthier than the bottom 40 percent by this measure. CNN reported in May that Sanders \u201chas an estimated net worth of $330,507, making him the poorest candidate currently in the race.\u201d But that also makes him richer than the bottom 40 percent of the American population combined.", "It\u2019s important to note that having just $1 of positive net worth wouldn\u2019t make someone wealthier than every individual who\u2019s in the bottom 40 percent. The negative net worth for that 40 percent is a combined figure \u2014 skewed, again, by the large negative figures for some. The 30th percentile, for instance, starts at $14,800\u00a0of net worth.", "Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies\u00a0at the Brookings Institution, told us that Sanders\u2019 figure is a striking way of saying what economists say \u2014 that wealth is more unequal than income. Burtless said the fact that so many Americans have negative net worth wasn\u2019t surprising \u2014 \u201chow many 20-year-olds have positive net worth?\u201d he asked.", "Those 20-somethings may well be earning income, but have no assets and perhaps student loan debt. They may not be suffering, but their balance sheets don\u2019t look so good.", "Burtless gave another example of those counted as having no or negative net worth \u2014 senior citizens with no assets and whose monthly Social Security checks don\u2019t count as wealth, by the Federal Reserve\u2019s definition.", "At the other end of the spectrum are the very wealthy, whose total worth, Hoxie noted in an email to us, is difficult to pinpoint. Hoxie and his coauthor, Collins, used the\u00a02015 Forbes Magazine Forbes 400. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important to keep in mind that the figures for wealth at the top are nearly certain to be significantly underestimated,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we cite in our report, the use of offshore tax havens as well as complex trusts by the ultra wealthy make it effectively impossible to truly gauge how much wealth is held by the ultra wealthy.\u201d", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cd7a4c19-8347-4e0e-af4a-dd7d5629cc40", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
