In 2016, online pranksters famously attempted to name a new vessel for Britain's Natural Environment Research Council \"Boaty McBoatface.\" So is it really so implausible that the United States Navy might name a ship the \"USS Tig Ol Bitties\"?", "The well-known military satire web site Duffel Blog published an article on 17 May 2018, in which they jokingly claimed that the United States Navy was naming its new Zumwalt-class destroyer the \"USS Tig Ol Bitties\" after the name was chosen in an online contest. The satire site also included a fake tweet purporting to show President Donald Trump expressing his support:", "Heads are shaking while others cheer after a failed publicity stunt led to the Navy\u2019s next Zumwalt-class destroyer being named the USS Tig Ol Bitties, sources confirmed today.", "This is not a genuine tweet from President Trump and the US Navy is not planning on naming a new vessel the USS Tig Ol Bitties.", "The Duffel Blog has a long history of publishing actually humorous (and factually void) articles about military-related topics.
