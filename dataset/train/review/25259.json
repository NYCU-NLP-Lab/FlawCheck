["About this rating", "On 16 February 2017, stories appeared on various dubious web sites that\u00a0exaggerated the nature of a leaked draft of an executive order. According to the\u00a0story, the draft was actually a fully-fledged order that had already been signed into effect by President Donald Trump, barring illegal immigrants from collecting public benefits:", "Former president Barack Obama allowed illegals in America to apply and get on welfare. President Trump doesn\u2019t approve this. You\u2019d all agree that welfare is a privilege. It\u2019s bad how some believe it\u2019s the right that belongs to everyone who comes to this country. Illegals aren\u2019t that fortunate. They will soon learn what\u2019s like to live in a country ruled by Donald Trump. Every illegal who tries to collect a welfare check will feel justice on their back.", "President Trump signed an executive order according to which any illegal who lives on welfare will be sent home. And that\u2019s not all. America will no longer accept people who come here to live on our expense. These people will no longer be able to enter the country.", "Not only has President Trump not signed any such order, undocumented immigrants are already ineligible for public benefits under the terms of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.\u00a0According to the Washington Post, the draft order, titled \"Executive Order on Protecting Taxpayer Resources by Ensuring Our Immigration Laws Promote Accountability and Responsibility,\" actually stated:", "Our country\u2019s immigration laws are designed to protect American taxpayers and promote immigrant self-sufficiency. Yet households headed by aliens are much more likely than those headed by citizens to use Federal means-tested public benefits.", "Additionally, the draft said\u00a0that the government would try to \"deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge\" and explore the possibility of deporting immigrants who receive, as the Post reported, \"a certain amount of public assistance, including Food Stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Medicaid.\"", "Such a clause would ignore the fact that \"food stamps\" (formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) cannot legally be claimed by undocumented immigrants. The same holds true for both the TANF program. For its part, Medicaid specifies that no federal funding can be used for providing care to undocumented immigrants aside from \"limited emergency services.\"", "As PBS reported, around $2 billion a year (less than 1 percent of the program's cost) is spent on such emergency services. Most reported instances of emergency Medicaid use involve births, though that funding does not extend to prenatal care.", "The executive order draft did not supply evidence backing the claim that immigrant households are \"much more likely\" to rely on public assistance programs, and a 2013 analysis from the Cato Institute found just the opposite:", "Low-income (family income below 200% of poverty line) non-citizen children and adults utilize Medicaid, SNAP, cash assistance, and SSI at a generally lower rate than comparable low-income native-born citizen children and adults, and the average value of public benefits received per person is generally lower for non-citizens than for natives. Because of the lower benefit utilization rates and the lower average benefit value for low-income non-citizen immigrants, the cost of public benefits to non citizens is substantially less than the cost of equivalent benefits to the native-born.", "As a further debunking the hoax story, the Washington\u00a0Post reported that the Trump administration \"would not confirm or deny the authenticity of the orders.\"", "Hauslohner, Abigail. \u00a0 \"Newest U.S. Draft Immigration Restrictions Would Exclude Those Requiring Public Assistance.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 31 January 2017.", "Galewitz, Phil. \u00a0 \"How Undocumented Immigrants Sometimes Receive Medicaid Treatment.\" \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Rundown. \u00a0 13 February 2013.", "Bruen, Brian et al. \"Poor Immigrants Use Public Benefits at a Lower Rate than Poor Native-Born Citizens.\" \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Cato Institute. \u00a0 4 March 2013.", "Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \u00a0 \"Eligibility for Non-Citizens in Medicaid and CHIP.\" \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 November 2014.", "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. \u00a0 \"Guidance on Non-Citizen Eligibility.\"\r\n \u00a0  \u00a0  June 2011.", "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  \u00a0 \"Summary of Immigrant Eligibility Restrictions under Current Law.\" \r\n \u00a0  \u00a0  25 February 2009.", "Arturo Garcia is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
