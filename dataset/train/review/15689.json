["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on May 1, 2019", "In announcing that he will withdraw the United States from the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, President Donald Trump falsely claimed that under the international agreement, the U.S. would \u201csurrender American sovereignty\u201d and allow \u201cforeign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedom.\u201d", "As a matter of fact, the treaty\u2019s preamble clearly states that it reaffirms \u201cthe sovereign right of any State to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system.\u201d And the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said the treaty \u201cdoes not affect sales or trade in weapons among private citizens within a country.\u201d", "Rachel Stohl, an international arms trade expert who was a consultant during the Arms Trade Treaty process, said Trump was reinforcing \u201ca false narrative.\u201d", "Trump made his announcement during the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual meeting on April 26. His decision was applauded by the NRA\u2019s lobbying arm, which also said the treaty was a \u201cthreat to our national sovereignty and Second Amendment.\u201d", "Trump, April 26: So, in the last administration, President Obama signed the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. And in his waning days in office, he sent the treaty to the Senate to begin the ratification process. This treaty threatened your subjugate \u2014 and you know exactly what\u2019s going on here \u2014 your rights and your constitutional and international rules and restrictions and regulations.", "Under my administration, we will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone. We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedom. And that is why my administration will never ratify the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty.", "The president repeated a similar claim the next day at a rally in Wisconsin.", "Trump, April 27: Just yesterday, I announced that my administration is unsigning the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. We\u2019re unsigning it, we\u2019re pulling it back out of the United Nations. We\u2019re pulling it back out of Congress. All of you Second Amendment people, you know you know what it is. You\u2019ll be very happy with it because we will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on America\u2019s freedom. We\u2019re not going to allow it. That was a President Obama disaster.", "But Trump is making unsupported claims about the treaty that are similar to ones spread in a viral email we debunked years ago \u2014 before the ATT was even finalized.", "The treaty, which went into force in December 2014, requires parties to establish standards for regulating the international trade of conventional weapons such as battle tanks, warships, missiles and small arms. It aims to \u201cprevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms\u201d by prohibiting cross-border sales when U.N. arms embargoes would be violated, or when exporting nations suspect the weapons would be used by importers to commit war crimes, genocide, terrorism or other offenses against civilians.", "Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. was one of the 100-plus nations that signed the treaty, but it did not ratify it. More than three years after then-Secretary of State John Kerry signed the treaty in September 2013, Obama sent it to the Senate, which never held a vote on a resolution of ratification. (In 2013, the Senate voted 53-46 in favor of a nonbinding amendment to prevent the U.S. from entering into the pact.)", "Still, when signing the treaty, Kerry said that it was about \u201creducing the risk of international transfers of conventional arms that will be used to carry out the world\u2019s worst crimes,\u201d and that it \u201cwill not diminish anyone\u2019s freedom\u201d because it actually \u201crecognizes the freedom of both individuals and states to obtain, possess, and use arms for legitimate purposes.\u201d", "\u201cMake no mistake, we would never think about supporting a treaty that is inconsistent with the rights of Americans, the rights of American citizens, to be able to exercise their guaranteed rights under our constitution,\u201d Kerry stated.", "The Congressional Research Service also said in a report updated in March that the treaty \u201cdoes not affect sales or trade in weapons among private citizens within a country.\u201d In addition, CRS, the independent research arm of Congress, said that \u201c[b]ecause the United States already has strong export control laws in place, the ATT would likely require no significant changes to policy, regulations, or law.\u201d", "Stohl, managing director of the nonpartisan Stimson Center, which promotes global security and prosperity, said Trump\u2019s claims were not true.", "\u201cTrump reinforced a false narrative about the treaty \u2014 one that was generated and propagated by the NRA, politicians and other special-interest groups to prey on fears of \u2018full-scale gun confiscation\u2019 and boost fundraising efforts,\u201d Stohl wrote in an April 29 op-ed published by the Washington Post. \u201cThese groups want the American public to believe that the ATT infringes on U.S. sovereignty and Second Amendment rights. This is a lie.\u201d", "She added: \u201cThe ATT purposefully excludes issues surrounding domestic gun laws or regulations. It does not restrict or hinder the Second Amendment, nor does it create a national gun registry. In fact, the preamble makes specific reference to the legitimate trade, lawful ownership and use of certain conventional arms for recreational, cultural, historical and sporting activities. Insinuating that the ATT undermines U.S. laws and puts American liberty under foreign control is dishonest and misleading.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
