Alarmist claims advise people to stock up on food, water, medicine and weapons. In the days following the Jan. 6 riots on the U.S. Capitol, online message boards and social media platforms are filled with\u00a0assertions\u00a0that a nationwide military takeover is coming.", "Most versions of the rumor say the plan is being implemented by President Donald Trump, the final step in an elaborate scheme to release damning information about his enemies that will land them in jail and allow him to remain in office for another four years.", "But these lengthy and detailed narratives simply are not rooted in reality.", "The posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Military operations will be taking place in many of the major corrupt cities,\" the post continues. \"...The implementation of the Insurrection Act began after the raid on the Capitol and was marked by Trump's broadcast to the people to disband and return home. This broadcast wound up being blocked, for the most part, by the media. Nevertheless, his address fulfilled the requirements to initiate the Act.\"", "It went on to claim that the Federal Communications Commission told media organizations they can\u2019t \"block the flow of intel\" and concluded that Trump has no plans to concede and that he will remain in office for another four years.", "But Trump has not invoked the Insurrection Act, and the military is not being sent to take over \"major corrupt cities,\" by him or anyone else.
