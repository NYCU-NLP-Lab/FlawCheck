While their journey was beset by physical obstacles, it was also accompanied in the U.S. by a swell of misinformation.", "On 18 October 2018 the extreme-right legal advocacy organization Judicial Watch published a article headlined \"100 ISIS Terrorists Caught in Guatemala as Central American Caravan Heads to U.S.,\" suggesting an alarming confluence of events:", "In a startling revelation, Guatemala\u2019s president announced in the country\u2019s largest newspaper that nearly 100 ISIS terrorists have been apprehended in the impoverished Central American nation. Why should Americans care about this? A caravan of Central American migrants is making its way north. Let\u2019s not forget that Guatemala is one of the countries that bombarded the U.S. with illegal immigrant minors under Barack Obama\u2019s open border free-for-all. They came in droves from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala through the Mexican border and for years Uncle Sam rolled out the welcome mat offering housing, food, medical treatment and a free education", "The Judicial Watch article conflated two separate news stories, with the effect of leaving some readers with the impression that people with links to the Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist organization were potentially traveling with a migrant caravan toward the southern U.S. border.", "On 11 October 2018, at the Conference for Prosperity and Security in Central America in Washington, D.C., Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales announced that his government had arrested and deported 100 people \"highly linked to terrorist groups, specifically ISIS.\" This statement was reported by the Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre in a report aggregated by Judicial Watch.", "One day later, on 12 October 2018, about 160 people formed a growing migrant caravan in Honduras with plans to cross through Guatemala and then Mexico to seek asylum in the United States. The caravan didn't cross the Guatemalan border until 15 October 2018, meaning the  ISIS-linked individuals apprehended and deported by Guatemalan authorities were gone well before the caravan ever reached that country.", "President Donald Trump later tweeted that \"unknown Middle Easterners\" were among the migrants traveling north, but he offered no evidence for the claim:", "Sadly, it looks like Mexico\u2019s Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States.

A former senior intelligence official who continues to be briefed on current intelligence told NBC News that there is no evidence that any Middle Eastern terrorists are hiding in the caravan. Middle Eastern and African immigrants have routinely crossed illegally across the U.S.-Mexico border for years, but their numbers pale in comparison to the number of Central Americans. Last fiscal year, they accounted for less than one out of every 100 \u2014 0.7 percent \u2014 of border apprehensions, according to DHS.
