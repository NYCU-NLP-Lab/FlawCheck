One recent Instagram post that has been widely shared claims that vaccines \"will alter the DNA with a RNA Coding that will remove parts of your DNA and replace it with GENETIC CODING (TECHNOLOGY).\"", "According to the post, that will then \"disable the ability of spirituality and cause people to HAVE to cooperate with the New World Order/One World Order.\"", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

They don\u2019t affect DNA at all.", "This is the first time this type of vaccine has reached this point in the process of readying vaccines for general use, Lynas said, and because these vaccines involve injecting genetic material in human cell as opposed to traditional vaccines, which involve injecting an inactivated or weakened virus directly into the body, they could be easier to adjust as this coronavirus mutates.", "As for whether these vaccines can affect someone\u2019s spirituality, or control the behaviors of people who get them, \"that\u2019s in the realm of science fiction,\" Lynas said.", "We rate this Instagram post Pants on Fire.", "Instagram post, Nov. 17, 2020", "The New York Times, Moderna\u2019s Covid vaccine: What you need to know, updated Nov. 18, 2020", "The New York Times, Pfizer\u2019s early data shows vaccine is more than 90% effective, No. 9, 2020", "Poynter, Fact-check: Will COVID-19 vaccine alter your DNA?
