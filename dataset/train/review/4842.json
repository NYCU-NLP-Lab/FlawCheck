And a search of Bill Nye's verified Twitter account for any tweets containing the word \"terbium\" (which is in fact a real element) turned up no matches.", "The substance of this faux tweet is in fact an old science-themed joke which, as commonly happens, has become attributed to a famous \"science person\" in order to give it more potency.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
