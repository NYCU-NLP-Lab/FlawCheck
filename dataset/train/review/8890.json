Facing an impeachment inquiry, the president has repeatedly charged, without evidence, that the elder Biden forced out Ukraine\u2019s lead prosecutor to protect Hunter, who worked on the board of a Ukrainian company that was once under investigation.", "But as they accuse Hunter Biden of riding his family name to a fortune in Ukraine, the Trump children have put almost no stops to their own overseas business dealings, we found.", "Multiple news outlets and government accountability groups have documented international business dealings Eric Trump and his siblings have conducted since Donald Trump took office. In some cases, the Trump children themselves have celebrated their activities overseas.", "Before his inauguration, Donald Trump announced that he would be retaining ownership of the Trump Organization but transferring day-to-day control to his oldest sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr.", "The move followed a post-election promise Trump made on Twitter, when he pledged that \"no new deals will be done during my term(s) in office.\" He elaborated on that promise in a white paper detailing ethics rules the Trump Organization had agreed to observe.", "The white paper said the Trump Organization would function like an \"asset-management company,\" pursuing no new foreign deals and donating all profits from foreign officials\u2019 use of Trump properties to the U.S. Treasury. (In February, the company said it turned over $191,538 to cover foreign profits from 2018.)", "But Trump continues to make money from existing licensing and property deals sprawled across more than 20 countries, according to an analysis of Trump's foreign business interests from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group tracking money in politics.", "The Trump campaign pointed to an article in The Hill and otherwise directed our inquiry to the Trump Organization, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment.", "As a number of news outlets have reported, the Trump Organization has continued conducting business abroad.", "\"Eric Trump\u2019s claim that \u2018we got out of all international business\u2019 is clearly and demonstrably false,\" said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit government watchdog that tracks Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest. \"Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have repeatedly traveled internationally to conduct business.\"", "In September, a local council in Scotland voted to let the company build 550 homes and a second golf course as an expansion of a Trump-owned golf course in the area.
