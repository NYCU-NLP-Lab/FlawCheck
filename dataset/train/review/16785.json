["Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the Ohio Association of Second Harvest Foodbanks in Columbus, told a hearing of a U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee in June that participation in her agency's programs is at a record high.\n\nThe need for food assistance has increased dramatically since 2008 because of the recession, she said, but it was growing already over the past decade as the number of Ohioans in poverty jumped almost 50 percent.\n\nShe told the hearing -- which was called over a report by the Government Accountability Office on potential duplication of federal programs -- that economic recovery should make little difference, because her agency has not seen a correlation between the state of the national economy and people receiving food aid in Ohio.\n\n\"No, unfortunately, we haven't,\" she said.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, interrupted in surprise: \"But when the economy improves which we all hope it does sooner rather than later, you don't anticipate any less participants in your program?\"\n\n\"I don't,\" Hamler-Fugitt said. \"And if you just look at the data, Ohio currently ranks 50th out of all states in income growth.\"\n\nPolitiFact Ohio knew times were tough, but we did not expect to find Ohio running dead last.\n\nHamler-Fugitt cited an analysis based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis that looked at income growth over the past 50 years. Specifically, the analysis looked at data on disposable income, which is defined as all money earned by all residents of a state in a given year, minus all income taxes and property taxes.\n\nOver the last 50 years, the nation\u2019s disposable income grew at an annual rate of 7.1 percent. \u00a0Nevada\u2019s income growth rate, 10.1 percent, was easily the nation's highest. Arizona was the only other state above 9 percent. Florida, Texas and Colorado rounded out the top five.\n\nIndustrial states in the Northeast and Midwest fared the worst, according to the analysis, posted online by The Business Journals. Ohio\u2019s 5.9 percent per year rate of growth was the slowest. Michigan and New York were only slightly better.\n\nOhio actually ranked 51st in the analysis, which also included the District of Columbia.\n\nThat snapshot looked at Ohio\u2019s performance over 50 years. The state didn\u2019t fare much better in other time frames.\n\nRelated figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, for example, show Ohio\u2019s growth in personal income in 2010 was below the national average of 3.0 percent. It\u2019s 2.7 percent rate ranked 34th in the nation.\n\nNevada's growth in personal income in 2010, incidentally, was actually last in the nation at 0.3 percent. \u00a0\n\nThe most recent available figures from the U.S. Census Bureau also put Ohio in the bottom half of states in personal income per person (33rd) and in median household income (31st).\n\nWhat does it add up to?\n\nAn analysis of data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis supports Hamler-Fugitt\u2019s statement on income growth. That analysis covers a 50-year period. And while Ohio didn\u2019t rank last using other gauges, the state does land in the bottom half. Those pieces of information provide clarification and context.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Hamler-Fugitt\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "CQ Transcripts, \"House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Regulatory\nAffairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending holds hearing on\nfederal welfare program duplications and efficiencies, June 1, 2011\n\nHouse Committee on Oversight & Government Reform, \"Duplication, Overlap, and Inefficiencies in Federal Welfare Programs,\" Part 1 and Part 2, posted to YouTube June 1, 2011\n\nEmail from Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, Ohio Association of Second Harvest Foodbanks, June 22, 2011\n\nThe Business Journals, \"Nevada, Arizona are big winners in income growth during half-century,\" May 23, 2011\n\nNevada News Bureau, \"Income Growth In Nevada Last In Nation,\" March 23, 2011\n\nU.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, State personal income data 2010, March 23, 2011\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, 2011 Statistical Abstract, Jan. 6, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
