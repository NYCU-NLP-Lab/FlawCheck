That\u2019s a big stretch.", "Ford worked as director of biostatistics for Corcept Therapeutics, a California pharmaceutical start-up, from 2006 to 2012, according to an archive of her since-deleted LinkedIn page. Corcept published six papers under her name.", "But claiming that Corcept sells an abortion pill is like saying a road salt company sells food seasoning.", "The company sells Korlym to treat Cushing's syndrome, a rare, deadly condition characterized by high cortisol levels.

In a medication-induced abortion, mifepristone is administered first and another drug, misoprostol, follows. That empties the uterus by causing cramping and bleeding.", "The latter drug, misoprostol, can and is used alone for abortions. However, the combination of both drugs is typically used for greater effectiveness and fewer side effects.", "Mifepristone, on the other hand, is not administered alone to induce abortions. In some other countries, it is used alone as emergency contraception, according to Clare Flannery, a professor of endocrinology and reproductive sciences at Yale University. That\u2019s not an abortifacient, according to Flannery, because it plays a role before the sperm and egg implant in the uterus.

Korlym patients take up to four times that dose of mifepristone daily for months or even years.", "Korlym was the first drug the Food and Drug Administration approved for Cushing\u2019s syndrome.", "\"Mifepristone was developed in 1980, but there was so much political concern for its use in aiding abortions, that its other therapeutic potentials were overlooked and companies were nervous to pursue it for other conditions,\" Flannery said.", "The company explicitly warns about the drug\u2019s potential to terminate a pregnancy.", "\"Korlym should never be taken by women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant,\" a banner on the website reads. \"Taking Korlym during pregnancy will result in the loss of a pregnancy.
