Perps to appear in court soon.\u201d", "Comments on the misleading post led AFP to believe the images were old and a Google reverse image search confirmed the events happened in another South African township.", "In a post shared more than\u00a09,200 times on Facebook, published a few days before the post linking the raid to Port Elizabeth, the National Council of Societies\u00a0for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) posted six images with a caption explaining how after five years, four men were found guilty of participating in the criminal activity of organised dog fighting and sentenced to two years in prison. The raid itself took place in Tsakane in 2013, the post confirmed.", "Local reports further corroborated that the raid\u00a0took place in Tsakane and not Port Elizabeth.
