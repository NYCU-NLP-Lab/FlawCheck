Nice!\"", "Trump was correct about the number. He omitted the fact, however, that few of these created substantive legislative change, as NPR reported. Fifteen of the bills \"reversed Obama-era rules and regulations. Others renamed federal buildings, provided for the creation of memorials or were related to personnel or government spending.\"", "Some Trump supporters, including California Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Tulare, also have made problematic claims about the president\u2019s accomplishments.", "A reader suggested we fact-check this claim, made by Nunes on Fresno\u2019s KMJ radio, about Trump\u2019s bill signings:", "\"The news media hasn\u2019t covered this. But we have actually got more bills signed into law, more bills signed into law, this Congress working with this president, than any president previously before at this stage in the game,\" Nunes said on June 19, 2017, in an interview with host Ray Appleton.", "He made this claim on Trump\u2019s 150th day in the White House. By that point, Trump had signed 39 bills into law, according to GovTrack.us, a legislative research and tracking website.", "Nunes has gained additional attention in recent months, particularly for his actions as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.", "In April, he announced he was temporarily stepping away from leading that panel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He cited ethics complaints that he mishandled classified information.", "That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that Nunes has stayed silent on Trump. In fact, he\u2019s continued to praise the president\u2019s actions.", "We wondered whether the Nunes was right at the time he stated Trump had signed more bills \"than any president previously before at this stage in the game.\"", "Our research", "PolitiFact California and our national partner PolitiFact have checked related claims.", "In April, shortly after Trump\u2019s 100th day in office, we rated as Mostly True California Rep.

We clarified that, as of that time, none of the bills Trump had signed were major pieces of legislation.", "That same month, PolitiFact rated False Trump\u2019s claim that \"no administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days.\" It cited several presidential historians who said Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Truman and Barack Obama all accomplished more during their first 100 days in the White House.", "Outdated claim", "But as we noted earlier, Nunes made his assertion on Trump\u2019s 150th day in office. He was specific about it, too, saying Trump had signed more bills than other presidents \"at this stage in the game.\"", "That\u2019s simply not accurate, based on the research by GovTrack.us.", "Not only did Roosevelt and Truman sign more bills through 150 days, so did Presidents Jimmy Carter, 48, and Bill Clinton with 41.

It just happens that the legislation that went to Obama was grouped into fewer distinct bills,\" he said.", "Reporting by the Washington Post also shows Trump\u2019s bill signings fall short of other presidents\u2019 totals through 150 days.", "Asked about the claim, Nunes\u2019 spokesman Jack Langer told us the congressman \"was referring to it being the most bills signed in the first 100 days of a new administration since Truman.\" That would be accurate, if that\u2019s what Nunes said. But it\u2019s not.", "Of note, Trump has signed 36 executive orders, more than any president in recent history during his first 150 days, according to an analysis by the Washington Post.
