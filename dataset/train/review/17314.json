["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on January 17, 2020", "Various claims online suggest that climate change hasn\u2019t contributed to the bushfires ravaging the East Coast of Australia, pinning the blame instead on arson. Those claims distort the facts.", "Several recent reports have found that climate change is contributing to the hot, dry conditions that fuel the kind of fires currently raging up the East Coast of Australia. But claims that climate change played no role in those bushfires have been proliferating online.", "For example, a video from the conservative content generator\u00a0PragerU\u00a0has been viewed 2 million\u00a0times since it was posted on Jan. 7. The text in the video claims: \u201cThe popular narrative is that Australia\u2019s fires are caused by climate change. But the facts say otherwise\u2026 Since November 8, 2019, nearly 200 arsonists have been arrested for starting brush fires in Australia. The arsonists were responsible for about 50% of the bushfires. Not climate change. Arsonists. Repeat that: Not climate change. Arsonists. But the left doesn\u2019t care, because this fact doesn\u2019t agree with their \u2018science.'\u201d", "Here\u2019s what the video gets wrong: First of all, \u201cnearly 200 arsonists\u201d haven\u2019t been arrested since Nov. 8, 2019.", "As its source, the video cites a Jan. 7 story from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s newspaper the Australian with the headline: \u201cBushfires: Firebugs fuelling crisis as arson arrest toll hits 183.\u201d", "The story said that \u201cpolice arrested 183 people for lighting bushfires across Queensland, NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania in the past few months.\u201d But that total of 183 arson arrests occurred over various periods in 2019, including all of 2019 in the case of Victoria.", "The story also referenced statistics since Nov. 8, 2019, from only one state \u2014 New South Wales. Police there announced that they had taken \u201clegal action\u201d against 183 people for bushfire-related offenses. Only 24 of those people were charged for \u201calleged deliberately-lit bushfires,\u201d according to the police; others were cautioned or charged with different offenses.", "So, the video used the date from the New South Wales announcement and the number of arson arrests counted over\u00a0five states and various periods in 2019 from the newspaper story. The effect is an inflated number of arrests since the bushfires began.", "The larger point in the video, though, is that arson is primarily responsible for the bushfires in Australia, not climate change. That message has been distilled into online memes. It also has been trumpeted by some high-profile political figures, including Donald Trump Jr.", "But overemphasizing the role of arson and pitting it against climate change distorts the issue.", "The fact is, hot, dry conditions allow for bushfires to escalate, regardless of how they are started. As we explained in 2017, in a story about wildfires in the western U.S., climate change doesn\u2019t cause these fires, but it can exacerbate the hot and dry conditions that make wildfires more likely to develop and grow.", "Generally, about half of all bushfires are started by natural causes (mostly from lightning), according to Geoscience Australia, a government agency that deals with geology and geography. The other half are caused by people, who start them either accidentally or deliberately. Those that are started deliberately aren\u2019t necessarily malicious, according to the agency. They could be fires that were meant to be contained, but got out of control.", "The video\u2019s claim that half of the current fires are due to arson is also wrong.", "That figure appears to be based on another part of the story in the Australian, which said \u201cabout 50 per cent of bushfires were lit by firebugs and impending fire seasons excited them.\u201d It attributed that statement to James Ogloff, a professor of forensic behavioral science.", "We reached out to Ogloff and asked for the source of that figure. He said it came from a 2008 Australian Institute of Criminology report. But that report, more than a decade old, analyzed only fires that were assigned a cause \u2014 13% of those fires were deliberate and 37% were suspicious. It doesn\u2019t account for at least 40% of all fires that weren\u2019t assigned a cause.", "So we asked Colleen Bryant, the researcher who wrote that 2008 report, if her findings could support the claim that 50% of the current fires are attributable to arson. The short answer is, no. But she also provided to us a 14-page explanation of the current circumstances, which can be read here.", "The original report is neither a study of bushfires nor arson, she explained. Rather, it is an examination of deliberately lit vegetation fires.", "Vegetation fire is a broad category that covers any fire occurring in vegetation, whereas a bushfire is larger, akin to a wildfire. There are many more vegetation fires than bushfires.", "And deliberately lit fires aren\u2019t necessarily arson. They, too, are a broad category that can include arson, but also include suspicious, nuisance and other types of fire ignitions, where the cause of the fire is not conclusive.", "The original report is based largely on data kept over a four- to five-year period in the late 1990s and early 2000s by various state agencies, but not all fires are recorded. Some of the largest bushfires in northern Australia\u2019s wilderness are not attended, so they wouldn\u2019t be part of that data, for example.", "Based on her analysis of the available fire statistics, Bryant concluded that most of those very large bushfires have a natural origin, and they account for the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of all land burned.", "Ultimately, she wrote in response to us:", "Colleen Bryant, Jan. 15, 2020: Bryant (2008a) did conclude that as much as 50 percent of vegetation fires in Australia may be deliberately lit. However, that statistic is not, and should not be used as, an assessment of the likely causes (ignition) of Australia\u2019s 2019\u20102020 bushfires, as it is not an accurate reporting of what has occurred, and it is unlikely representative of the actual picture.", "For a rough idea of how much deliberate torching has contributed to the current fires, we reached out to the four states or territories ablaze on Australia\u2019s East Coast and got information on the number of fires and the number of arrests from one. In Queensland, there have been 1,068 reported bushfires between Sept. 10, 2019, and Jan. 8, 2020, according to the Queensland Police Service. Of those, 114 were \u201cdeliberately or maliciously lit,\u201d and 109 people have been cautioned, charged or sent to a restorative justice program, according to police. That would account for about 11% of the fires.", "A spokesman for the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services echoed the Geoscience Australia analysis of bushfire causes. \u201cThere\u2019s a real mix,\u201d he said in an interview with FactCheck.org, breaking that mix into three categories \u2014 natural causes, accidental human causes (cigarettes and sources as small as a spark from rusty breaks), and intentional human causes. Natural causes account for the bulk of the fires, he said.", "And, as we noted at the start, several reports have found that climate change is contributing to the conditions that generate large-scale bushfires. The \u201cState of the Climate\u201d report for 2018 released by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said: \u201cClimate change can have a significant influence on the frequency, magnitude and impact of some types of compound events,\u201d giving as an example warming and drying trends in Tasmania in 2015-2016, causing \u201crecord high fire danger.\u201d", "The bureau\u2019s \u201cannual climate statement,\u201d released on Jan. 9, reported that 2019 was the hottest and driest year on record for the country. It said:", "Australian Bureau of Meteorology: The second half of the year was particularly dry across most of the southern half of Australia, and followed several years of below average rainfall over parts of Queensland and New South Wales. Warm and windy conditions during spring to early summer led to repeated periods of severe fire weather, with very large bushfires affecting eastern Australia from September, with many fires continuing to burn after the end of the year.", "Those hot, dry conditions have allowed for one of the most severe fire seasons on Australia\u2019s East Coast in decades, according to NASA\u2019s Earth Observatory. The fires have been so severe that they have created pyrocumulonimbus, or fire clouds, that can ignite new fires with lightning strikes. In 2018, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology predicted that \u201cconditions associated with pyrocumulonimbus cloud formation\u201d could become more prevalent in southeast Australia, which is where many of the current fires are located.", "\u201cThe reality is that the fires are larger, hotter, and burning longer than ever before,\u201d said Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, in an interview. She likened the severity of the current fires in Australia to the\u00a0recent wildfires in the western U.S.", "\u201cThere are fingerprints of climate change in all of these blazes that really can\u2019t be denied,\u201d Marlon said.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
