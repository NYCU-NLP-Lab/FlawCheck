["About this rating", "\"Avocado\" comes from a Nahuatl word also meaning \"testicle.\"", "\"Guacamole\" does not directly translate as \"testicle sauce.\"", "Avocados are so ubiquitous as a staple of sports events and parties (at least, in the form of guacamole) that it's easy to forget that they are not native to the United States. Their widespread appeal here and around the world owes much to the efforts of committed botanists and businessmen at the turn of the 20th century.", "Avocados are actually native to Mexico and Central America, which is why they bear a name (\u0101huacatl) that derives from Nahuatl, a language spoken by the indigenous Nahua people of Mexico and El Salvador.", "The word \u0101huacatl in Nahuatl was indeed at one point used to mean \"the fruit of the avocado tree\" and, more slangily, \"testicle,\" presumably because of the fruit's shape; according to Nahuatl scholar Magnus Pharao Hansen, the word in the context of \"testicle\" carried a double meaning much like the word \"ball\" (or, more to the point, \"nut\") does in English.", "Spanish conquerors had a difficult time with the glottals and fricatives of local languages such as Nahuatl, and so over time the names of native flora and fauna became simplified: coyotl became coyote, mizquitl turned into mesquite, and \u0101huacatl became aguacate but lost its double meaning in the process (and became more of a double entendre).", "M\u014dlli is in fact Nahuatl for \"sauce,\" which in a linguistic coincidence sounds much like the Spanish infinitive moler (meaning \"to grind\"). However, it's not totally accurate to say that \"guacamole\" means \"testicle sauce,\" because in becoming the Spanish word aguacate (further distorted to avocado in English), the original Nahuatl for \"avocado\" word lost its second, more vulgate meaning (i.e., testicle).", "This may seem to be splitting hairs, but the fact remains that even if pre-Columbian Nahua peoples might have ever had occasion to utter the phrase \"testicle sauce,\" they would likely not have called it \"guacamole\"; instead, they would have used some variant of the more common words cuitlapanaatetl or atetl (testes; rocks) and m\u014dlli or ch\u012bllacu\u0113ch\u014dlli (sauce). \u00a0The word \"guacamole\" is part of Nahuatl as auacamulli, and there's no evidence, past or present, to suggest it was ever used to mean anything but avocados.", "Mesoamerican language specialist Dr. Frances Karttunen, who has written several books on the Nahuatl language, had this to add:", "The Spanish loanword aguacate (stress on the ca) is used to refer to \u201ctesticle\" [as] does huevo. Seems to me that contemporary Nahuah get a giggle out of looking up at the fruit hanging in the trees and thinking of them as vegetable testicles. (Likewise, on the campus of the U. Of Hawaii-Manoa there is an exotic tree known as a \u201cdead-rat tree\u201d and people, myself included, are forever looking at it and imagining its fruits as rats hanging by their tails.)", "But, except in jest, I don\u2019t think a Nahua would imagine a:huacamo:lli to be anything other than mashed up avocado.", "In other words, \"guacamole\" could be translated as \"testicle sauce\" in exactly the same way \"football\" could translate to \"foot-testicle.\"", "Brooke Binkowski is a former editor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
