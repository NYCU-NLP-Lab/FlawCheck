["By Sydney Schaedel", "Posted on July 26, 2017", "Q: Did Rep. Trey Gowdy end the Russia investigation?", "A: No. That claim was made in a headline that wasn\u2019t supported by its story.", "The headline of a July 12 story on world-politicus.com says \u201cTrey Gowdy Puts Investigation To Rest.\u201d It was posted on Facebook with an even more provocative header: \u201cTrey Gowdy Ends The Russia Investigation ONCE AND FOR ALL \u2013 Do You Support Him?\u201d", "But the story \u2014 which was flagged by Facebook users as potentially fake \u2014 doesn\u2019t support either headline.", "While the story correctly says the South Carolina Republican is the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, it incorrectly says that \u201cGowdy has been in charge of \u2026 the Russia investigation.\u201d He hasn\u2019t ended it, either.", "Gowdy, who only became oversight committee chairman on June 13, has said that his panel won\u2019t investigate possible collusion between Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 campaign and it won\u2019t\u00a0investigate whether Trump committed obstruction of justice. He said he does not want to interfere with the ongoing Russia investigation led by\u00a0Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III.", "\u201cI told Bob Mueller Tuesday that I would never do anything wittingly or unwittingly that veered over into his lane,\u201d Gowdy told a group of reporters on June 23. \u201cHis lane is broad and is undetermined at this point.\u201d", "However, Gowdy is also a member the House Intelligence Committee, which is still investigating Russia\u2019s meddling in the election, as well as potential ties between Russian officials and Trump associates.", "World Politicus credited its story about Gowdy to the Washington Examiner, which did not report that he ended the Russia investigation.", "Instead, the Examiner wrote that \u201cGowdy criticized the Trump administration for the ongoing \u2018drip, drip\u2019 of Russia-related revelations that escalated this week when the president\u2019s son admitted he met with a Kremlin-linked attorney who promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton.\u201d", "The Examiner quoted Gowdy as saying: \u201cSomeone close to the president needs to get everyone connected with that campaign in a room and say, \u2018From the time you saw Dr. Zhivago until the moment you drank vodka with a guy named Boris, you list every single one of those and we\u2019re going to turn them over to the special counsel,\u2019 because this drip, drip, drip is undermining the credibility of this administration.\u201d", "We\u2019ve written before that it is important to read beyond a provocative headline, especially when a story sounds unbelievable. The story headlined \u201cTrey Gowdy Ends The Russia Investigation ONCE AND FOR ALL\u201d is an example. It has no facts to back it up.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "\u201cTrey Gowdy Puts Investigation To Rest.\u201d World-politicus.com. 12 Jul 2017.", "Foran, Clare. \u201cTrey Gowdy Tapped to Take Over as House Oversight Chair.\u201d The Atlantic. 8 Jun 2017.", "Rahman, Rema. \u201cGowdy Officially Becomes House Oversight Chairman.\u201d Roll Call. 13 Jun 2017.", "Daly, Matthew. \u201cGowdy: Oversight Won\u2019t Investigate Russian Interference.\u201d U.S. News and World Report. 23 Jun 2017.", "Wong, Scott. \u201cGowdy won\u2019t use Oversight gavel to probe Russia.\u201d The Hill. 23 Jun 2017.", "Siegal, Josh. \u201cTrey Gowdy: \u2018Drip, drip drip\u2019 on Russia is undermining Trump administration.\u201d Washington Examiner. 11 Jul 2017.", "Kim, Kyle, and Krishnakumar, Priya. \u201cA guide to every Russia investigation happening right now.\u201d Los Angeles Times. 14 Jun 2017, accessed 25 Jul 2017.", "Kiely, Eugene, and Robertson, Lori. \u201cHow to Spot Fake News.\u201d FactCheck.org. 18 Nov 2016.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
