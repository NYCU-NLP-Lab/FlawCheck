["About this rating", "A viral video shared to Twitter in July 2020 showed a scuttling lemon-hued turtle that was reportedly rescued by residents of a village in southeastern India.", "Snopes' readers asked us to verify and indeed the video is real.", "Asian News International reported that the turtle was \u201crescued\u201d by locals in the southeastern Indian state of Odisha on July 18, 2020. The individuals then notified the Indian Forest Service (IFS). Susanta Nanda, who works with the agency, wrote on Twitter that the turtle\u2019s visibly pink eye is indicative of albinism, a rare inherited disorder.", "Albinism is a genetic condition that results in a reduction or the complete absence of melanin, the pigment responsible for coloring in the skin and eyes, according to the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation. In mammals \u2014 including humans \u2014 the Mayo Clinic notes that different mutations in melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin, can result in different types of albinism. This lack of pigment allows for the retina to be seen through the iris and can make the eyes appear red or pink.", "Albinism has also been observed in reptiles, birds, amphibians, and even insects. Although nearly any vertebrate animal can inherit albino genes, the condition is thought to present differently in reptiles and birds. In September 2017, about one in four recently hatched green sea turtles from one clutch were recorded by scientists as albino and described in the Marine Turtle Newsletter. Researchers noted that in birds and snakes, albinism is an \u201cautosomal recessive trait\u201d and a similar genetic process is believed to also occur in sea turtles. Recessive traits result from genes that must be contributed by both parents in order to be expressed in their offspring.", "Despite their Twitter-friendly appearance, albino turtles probably suffer high mortality rates as they are unable to effectively camouflage in their environments and are more likely to suffer from other health defects associated with the condition.", "Snopes contacted both IFS and Nanda to determine whether the yellow turtle was released, as other media outlets reported. We'll update when we hear back.", "O\u2019Kane, Caitlin. \u00a0 \"Rare Yellow Turtle Discovered in India.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CBS News. \u00a0 20 July 2020.", "Asian News International. \u00a0 \"Locals Rescue Rare Yellow Turtle in Odisha\u2019s Balasore.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 20 July 2020.", "Erickson, Jose. \u00a0 \"Multiple Leucism in a Nest of the Yellow-Spotted Amazon River Turtle, Podecnemis unifilis.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Salamandria. \u00a0 30 Oct 2015.", "Alfano, Andrea. \u00a0 \"Birding FAQs: How To Tell If a Bird Is Albino.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Audubon. \u00a0 9 Sept 2015.", "Gresens, Jill. \u00a0 \"An Introduction to the Mexicon Axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum).\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 LabAnimal. \u00a0 Oct 2004.", "Perrault, Justin and Christina Coppenrath. \u00a0 \"Albinism in Florida Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas) Hatchlings: Ratio-Based Evidence Of Basic Mendelian Recessiveness.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Marine Turtle Newsletter. \u00a0 2019.", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
