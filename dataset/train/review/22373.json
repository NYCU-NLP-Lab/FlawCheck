["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on February 15, 2018", "We\u2019ve written this before, but we will restate it: The U.S. intelligence community says Russia waged an influence campaign during the 2016 campaign to help elect Donald Trump, but it made\u00a0no determination on whether Russia\u2019s meddling affected the election outcome.", "We repeat ourselves, because Vice President Mike Pence recently revived a false talking point that U.S. intelligence agencies came to the \u201cuniversal conclusion\u201d that Russia\u2019s meddling had no impact on the election results. He made his remarks in an interview with Axios, a political website.", "Pence, Feb. 14: Irrespective of efforts that were made in 2016 by foreign powers, it is the universal conclusion of our intelligence communities that none of those efforts had any effect on the outcome of the 2016 election.", "As we have written, the\u00a0Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Jan. 6, 2017\u00a0released\u00a0a\u00a0declassified intelligence report\u00a0that said \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.\u201d Among other things, the report said, Russian intelligence services gained access to Democratic National Committee computers for nearly a year, from July 2015 to June 2016, and released hacked material to WikiLeaks and other media outlets \u201cto help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances.\u201d", "But that report did not say that \u201cnone of those efforts\u201d changed the outcome of the election, as Pence claimed. On that point, the DNI report clearly said that the intelligence community \u201cdid not make an assessment of the impact that Russian\u00a0activities had on the outcomes of the 2016 election.\u201d", "Director of National Intelligence report:\u00a0The US Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze US political processes or US public opinion.", "Since the report was made public more than a year ago, Trump and his supporters have peddled false and misleading interpretations of the intelligence report on the 2016 election interference.", "A day after the report was released,\u00a0Trump tweeted: \u201cIntelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!\u201d As we wrote, the fact that no machines were hacked does not mean that Russia\u2019s influence campaign did not affect the election results.", "Two days after the report was issued, Kellyanne\u00a0Conway, who is now\u00a0White House counselor, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper\u00a0testified before a Senate committee that Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the U.S. presidential election had failed.", "Conway, Jan. 8, 2017:\u00a0If you read the full report, they make very clear, Mr. Clapper in his testimony made very clear on Thursday under oath that the \u2014 that any attempt, any aspiration to influence our elections failed. They were not successful in doing that. And it\u2019s a very important point.", "Wrong again. In fact, Clapper said the complete opposite when he testified under oath before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Jan. 5, 2017. He said of the Russian interference: \u201c[T]he intelligence community can\u2019t gauge the impact that it had on choices that the electorate made. There is no way for us to gauge that.\u201d", "In a\u00a0Senate Select Intelligence Committee hearing\u00a0on Jan. 10, Clapper reiterated that the report \u201cdoes not \u2014 repeat does not assess the impact of Russian activities on the actual outcome of the 2016 election or draw any conclusions in that regard one way or the other.\u201d", "This has not deterred others in the Trump administration from distorting the report\u2019s findings.", "In October, CIA Director Mike Pompeo wrongly said, \u201cThe intelligence community\u2019s assessment is that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election.\u201d", "In that case, Pompeo\u2019s own agency had to reiterate that the intelligence community did not make any assessment in regards to whether Russia\u2019s meddling affected the election results.", "\u201cThe intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed, and the director did not intend to suggest that it had,\u201d agency spokesman Dean Boyd said in a statement clarifying Pompeo\u2019s remarks.", "We should also note that an October 2016 report by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis found that \u201cRussian government cyber actors\u201d potentially targeted \u201cInternet-connected election-related networks\u201d in 21 states. The department notified the 21 states in September 2017, but none reported any evidence of altered voter data or ballots.", "So, there remains no evidence that votes were changed. But the intelligence community has not said if Russia\u2019s influence campaign affected the election outcome.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
