["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on May 4, 2020", "President Donald Trump has claimed Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, wrote him a \u201cletter of apology\u201d regarding the administration\u2019s travel restrictions on China. But there\u2019s no evidence of such a letter, and Biden\u2019s campaign says it \u201cnever happened.\u201d", "We asked the White House about the president\u2019s claim, and we haven\u2019t received a response.", "It\u2019s possible Trump has added an extra layer of exaggeration on a prior claim that Biden had \u201capologized\u201d for criticizing the travel restrictions, a claim Trump made on April 28. But Biden didn\u2019t \u201capologize\u201d for any criticism. His campaign on April 3 said Biden supported the administration\u2019s travel restrictions on China, and it argued that Biden\u2019s earlier comments about Trump\u2019s \u201crecord of hysteria and xenophobia\u201d weren\u2019t a reference to the restrictions, though they were made the same day those travel prohibitions were announced.", "On Jan. 31, a day after the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar\u00a0declared a public health emergency for the U.S. and\u00a0announced\u00a0travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. The\u00a0policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S. It didn\u2019t apply to U.S. citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family.", "Also on Jan. 31, Biden, speaking at a\u00a0campaign event in Iowa about the coronavirus outbreak, said that Americans \u201cneed to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria and xenophobia \u2013 hysterical xenophobia \u2013 and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.\u201d", "He reiterated those comments the next day on Twitter, saying: \u201cWe are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science \u2014 not Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.\u201d", "Trump has repeatedly claimed that Biden called him \u201cxenophobic\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d because of the travel restrictions on China. But Biden didn\u2019t say he was talking about those restrictions.", "On April 3, the former vice president\u2019s campaign said\u00a0Biden supported the Trump administration\u2019s travel restrictions on China, and it said\u00a0Biden\u2019s \u201creference to xenophobia\u201d wasn\u2019t about the travel restrictions but rather \u201cTrump\u2019s long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China.\u201d", "\u201cJoe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, told CNN. \u201cScience supported this ban, therefore he did too.\u201d", "The next day, on April 4, Trump said there had been \u201cbreaking news last night\u201d that Biden \u201cagreed that [Trump] was correct when I stopped people from China very early \u2014 very, very early \u2014 from coming into our country.\u201d", "But Biden the following day criticized Trump for a \u201cslow\u201d response to the crisis, saying on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d:\u00a0\u201cYou got to go faster than slower. And we started off awfully slow. He indicated that I complimented him on \u2014 on dealing with China. Well, you know, 45 nations had already moved to keep \u2014 block China\u2019s personnel from being able to come to the United States before the president moved. So, it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s about pace. It\u2019s about \u2014 it\u2019s about the urgency. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been enough of it, urgency.\u201d", "As we\u2019ve explained before, both politicians have spun the facts on whether Trump\u2019s travel restrictions were \u201cvery, very early,\u201d as Trump claims, or after \u201c45 nations had already moved,\u201d as Biden said. Data from Think Global Health, a project by the Council on Foreign Relations tracking countries\u2019 travel restrictions, show \u201cthat the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China,\u201d a co-author of the tracker,\u00a0Samantha Kiernan, a research associate on global health, economics, and development, told us.", "In late April, Trump claimed that Biden had \u201capologized,\u201d and in a May 3 Fox News virtual town hall, the president twice said Biden made that apology in a letter.", "Trump, Fox News virtual town hall, May 3: They called me a racist. They said \u201cxenophobic.\u201d Biden said, \u201cHe was xenophobic.\u201d Biden has now written a letter of apology because I did the right thing. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. \u2026", "And he actually apologized with a letter on a Friday night saying, \u201cHe made the right move.\u201d It wasn\u2019t well played by the press, but he said I made the right move.", "We found no evidence of an apology letter. Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told us in an email: \u201cNever happened.\u201d", "As for Trump\u2019s claim about saving \u201chundreds of thousands of lives,\u201d we found no support for such a figure, either. As we\u2019ve written, the few studies that have been done on travel restrictions the United States and other countries enacted on China estimate those measures had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic.", "Trump also referred to \u201ca letter of apology\u201d a few weeks prior, in an April 13 coronavirus task force briefing, during a back-and-forth with a reporter over what the administration had done regarding the coronavirus pandemic in February. Trump cited his travel restrictions on China and said of Biden, \u201cWhy did he write a letter of apology?\u201d The reporter, CBS News\u2019 Paula Reid, replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think the unemployed people right now care about why Joe Biden didn\u2019t apologize to you, sir.\u201d", "In fact, Biden didn\u2019t apologize \u2014 his campaign instead said he supported the president\u2019s China travel restrictions.", "FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
