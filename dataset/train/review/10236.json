["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on September 23, 2020 | Updated on October 16, 2020", "Facebook posts claim that President Donald Trump has withheld aid from California to fight wildfires, while offering help to Russia. That\u2019s a rehash of a controversy in 2019, when Trump threatened to withhold aid from California, while offering help to Russia. The Trump administration has provided federal assistance to California for the recent wildfires.", "Text posts on Facebook are spreading the falsehood that President Donald Trump has denied federal aid to California, while offering to help Russia fight wildfires.", "But it\u2019s a rehash of a 2019 controversy.", "One version of the post that\u2019s been shared more than 20,000 times claims: \u201cTrump says No Aid for CA fires. But in July he offered to help Putin with fires in Russia.\u201d That one went up on Sept. 17 and many similar posts followed.", "Almost a month earlier, though, Trump had declared a major disaster in California and made federal relief funds available for areas affected by wildfires. That declaration has resulted in $7.7 million so far being allocated to those who were burned out of their homes or otherwise impacted, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA also has approved funding for firefighting equipment, supplies, and workers at more than a dozen fires so far. So, the first part of the claim is wrong.", "The second part of the claim appears to be from more than a year ago. On July 31, 2019, the Kremlin announced that Trump had offered U.S. support in fighting Siberian wildfires at the time. The following day, Trump confirmed to reporters outside of the White House that he had offered assistance, saying, \u201cwe\u2019re very good at putting out forest fires, frankly.\u201d", "We found no indication that the U.S. actually assisted Russia in fighting those fires.", "Trump\u2019s offer to help, though, showed up again in November 2019. Headlines compared it with Trump\u2019s attitude toward California Gov. Gavin Newsom during the state\u2019s fire season, which usually goes from late summer through the fall. The president had tweeted\u00a0on Nov. 3, 2019, \u201cEvery year, as the fire\u2019s rage & California burns, it is the same thing-and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor.\u201d", "In a related tweet, Trump criticized Newsom, blaming poor forest management for the extent of the seasonal California fires \u2014 a claim that he had made the year before and that he made again this year. We explained at the time, though, that while forest management techniques can be helpful in reducing the severity of some wildfires, they aren\u2019t effective for all ecosystems and the 2019 fires in California were exacerbated by hot, dry conditions with extreme winds.", "Trump did not declare a major emergency for the 2019 fires in California, but the state did get federal assistance. FEMA approved aid \u2014 as it\u2019s done this year, too \u2014 through Fire Management Assistance Declarations. Those declarations are requested by the state and authorized by the regional FEMA administrator, a role delegated by the president. They cover 75% of the cost for equipment, supplies, and labor spent fighting the fires.", "While Trump did extend an offer to help Russia fight it\u2019s wildfires in 2019, there\u2019s no evidence that he did so again this year. Neither of the phone calls between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that were reported on the Kremlin\u2019s website this summer include references to the fires. Although NASA\u2019s Earth Observatory described the blazes during Siberia\u2019s 2020 fire season as \u201cintense\u201d and due to \u201cabnormally warm temperatures.\u201d", "We asked the White House whether or not the president had extended the same offer in 2020, but we didn\u2019t get a response.", "Update, Oct. 16: Three weeks after this story was posted, the Trump administration\u00a0rejected, but then reversed itself and approved, a new request from California for a major disaster declaration related to fires that began in September. FEMA also has provided some federal support for dealing with those fires through Fire Management Assistance Declarations.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
