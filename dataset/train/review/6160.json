He then allegedly took them to a house in Nairobi\u2019s Kawangware area where more body parts were found.", "There are several clues to the story\u2019s lack of credibility. One is that it is sloppily written and littered with grammatical errors.", "For example it says the crime happened in Kenya, but adds that \u201cthere is no direct law against cannibalism in South Africa\u201d.", "But also, there is no reporting in other Kenyan media of what would be a shocking story.", "A Google search does show that a \u201cNino Mbatha\u201d \u00a0was indeed convicted of murder, but in South Africa.", "In December 2018, Mbatha and his co-accused Lungisani Magubane were found guilty of killing Zanele Hlatshwayo for her body parts.
