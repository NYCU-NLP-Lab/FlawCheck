Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterm election.", "The Navasota Examiner article about the rally quoted the VFW post commander Carl Dry about a request he says he received while the O\u2019Rourke campaign was setting up for the event.", "\"They wanted to open the doors (to the Flight Deck Lounge), and I couldn\u2019t allow that, and they wanted to take the flags down.

He said they were not wearing name tags or other identifiers related to the O\u2019Rourke campaign.", "Dry said he assumed the two individuals were part of the campaign because they came to him from the room where the event was being held and returned to it after he told the first \"no,\" and the second \"hell, no.\"", "\"I had to assume they were Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign people,\" Dry said. \"Whether they were or not, I don\u2019t know.

The most prominent image on the campaign website\u2019s homepage is a photo of O\u2019Rourke, with the American flag behind him. He performed at a July 4 concert this year with Willie Nelson in front of the flag. There are also numerous photos and videos on social media of him speaking in front of the American and Texas flags from other events this summer.", "It\u2019s not unreasonable to assume, as Dry did, that the people who asked to \"take down\" the American flags at the Aug. 25 rally were from the O\u2019Rourke campaign. But it is an assumption, and furthermore it\u2019s not clear why they were asking: It\u2019s possible they wanted to move them to another location or feature them in some other way. We can say that the campaign definitely does not show an \"aversion\" to the flag or to patriotic symbols, as it has used them in many other settings.
