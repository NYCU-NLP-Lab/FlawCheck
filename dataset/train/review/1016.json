The brevity of his remarks allows us to consider his statement in full:", "\"Mr. Speaker, Katrina breaks my heart. When I consider its tragic aftermath, the ancient parable comes to mind: \u2018And the rains descended and the flood came and the winds blew and beat against the house and it fell with a great crash.\u2019", "\"For most American families, when a tree falls on your house, you tend to the wounded, you rebuild, and then you figure out how you are going to pay for it. Later today Congress will continue the work of funding the relief and recovery from Hurricane Katrina, and well we should, by speeding more than $50 billion to FEMA and other agencies.", "\"But as we tend to the wounded, as we begin to rebuild, let us also do what every other American family would do, in like circumstances, and expects this Congress to do: let us figure out how we\u2019re going to pay for it.", "\"Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren.\"", "The parable to which he refers is a Bible verse, but it\u2019s actually Matthew 7:27, not 7:25 as the tweet said. (The wording is very similar.) In context, the parable is about believing in the true God in the face of temptation or suffering, although here Pence is clearly playing off the idea of building on stable ground.", "While the tweet that\u2019s been shared said Pence urged Congress not to approve Katrina aid, the video that accompanied the piece \u2014 and Pence\u2019s full remarks \u2014 actually support the opposite conclusion. Pence did not oppose any aid for Katrina victims. He said in his remarks that Congress should pay for relief efforts.", "Pence joined the vast majority of lawmakers who voted later that same day in favor of a $51.8 billion relief package, which passed 410-11. The bill then passed the Senate 97-0 and was signed into law by President George W.

Their plan was even called \"Operation Offset.\" Among the group\u2019s targets were a prescription drug benefit for seniors and transportation projects.", "But even as Pence and other congressional Republicans looked to find cuts to curtail a budget deficit, he did not propose holding up Katrina relief. He continued his cost-cutting rhetoric a couple of weeks later, when he discussed cutting \"big-ticket items\" from the budget to deal with Katrina spending.", "Bloggers said a video showed Pence quoting the Bible as justification for \"Congress not to fund Katrina relief effort.\"", "They cited a short 2005 floor speech in which Pence said Katrina relief should pass, but then Congress should look to cut costs elsewhere. He did not hold the aid bill hostage, even while making cost-cutting a personal priority.
