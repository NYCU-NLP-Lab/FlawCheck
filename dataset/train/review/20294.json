The 37 seconds have been clipped from a press conference held at the White House by president Trump and can be watched from 18:40 minutes in the video below. As evident, Sauce thanks the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the \u201crapid approval\u201d of the coronavirus test developed by his company.", "This was also tweeted by Roche Diagnostics.

In fact, there are no approved vaccines for the infection yet. Drug companies and researchers are trying to find ways to handle the new coronavirus. As per a Forbes Tracker, the status of the research is in the trial period. Organisations have either begun human testing or have partnered with international bodies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), CDC, etc, regarding testing. Some of the vaccines are also in the development stage. As per Forbes, a new vaccine takes 10-15 years to be developed however the process can be more rapid due to the advancement of technology in the last few years,", "Donate Now", "Pooja Chaudhuri is a senior editor at Alt News.", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
