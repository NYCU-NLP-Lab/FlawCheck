["The January 4, 2021 post shares a message from someone claiming to work at BfArM, Germany\u2019s Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, who said they \u201cmanaged to sneak an ampoule of the vaccine secretly\u201d in order to perform at-home tests on the sample. The post claims that this unnamed vaccine is \u201cslightly radioactive\u201d and dangerous \u201cenough to cause disease and genetic damage,\u201d adding that there \u201ccould be radium in this vaccine.\u201d", "Similar claims can also be found in German, Italian, Romanian and Serbian Cyrillic.", "While the claim does not say what the allegedly stolen vaccine is for, it circulated online as countries around the world seek to immunize their populations against Covid-19, and is part of a trend of inaccurate information aimed at raising fears about vaccines.", "\u201cNo vaccines are stored at the BfArM so such substances cannot be \u2018smuggled out,\u2019\u201d Maik Pommer, a spokesman for the institute, told AFP by email.", "\u201cVaccines are not within the remit of the BfArM,\u201d he said, adding that the main task of the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices is the authorization and supervision of medicinal products.", "\u201cThe licensing and monitoring of vaccines is the responsibility of the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), the Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines,\u201d he said.", "Susanne St\u00f6cker, spokeswoman for the PEI, said by email that \u201cthe fact that this person claims to have stolen the ampoule from BfArM shows that this text is fake news. It proves that the person doesn\u2019t even know which of the German regulatory authorities is responsible for vaccines. I can confirm that the Paul Ehrlich Institute, Federal Institute for Vaccine and Biomedicines is responsible for vaccines.\u201d", "When asked if there was any evidence of a dose or ampoule of any vaccine being snuck out of the PEI, St\u00f6cker said: \u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cThere is no radium in any vaccine,\u201d Scott Halperin, Director of the Canadian Center for Vaccinology, said in an email.", "Referring to the green glow of a syringe pictured in the post, Halperin said \u201cthat wouldn\u2019t be radium, which has a bluish color. No vaccines contain phosphors which would make them glow.\u201d", "Julie Bettinger, a vaccine safety scientist at British Columbia Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Vaccine Evaluation Center, said by email that \u201cno vaccines that protect against preventable diseases are radioactive, and I am not aware of any vaccine approved in Canada or the US that contains radium.\u201d", "Bettinger also said that \u201cthere is really strict tracking of the vaccines so it would not be possible for someone to \u2018sneak\u2019 one out.\u201d", "More of AFP Fact Check\u2019s reporting on health misinformation can be found here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
