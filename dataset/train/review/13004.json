In the short\u00a0period between President Trump's 20 January 2017 inauguration and 15 February 2017, separate fake tweet controversies involving the Commander-in-Chief appeared to show that\u00a0he insulted Navajos\u00a0and pledged to drug test welfare recipients.", "Strauss, Valerie. \u00a0\u00a0 \"Betsy Devos Apparently \u2018Confused\u2019 About Federal Law Protecting Students with Disabilities.\"\r\n \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 The Washington Post.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 17 January 2017.", "Politwoops. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \"Deleted Tweets from Donald J.
