These rumors are not based on medical records, personal confessions, or any other type of credible information, but instead spring from a series of clickbait advertisements promoting content about transgender celebrities.", "We found at least three different advertisements which use images purportedly showing Julia Stiles before and after gender reassignment surgery. In all cases, the \"before\" image actually shows actor Ansel Elgort:", "According to AdSpider.io (a web site that tracks online advertisements), these ads first appeared online in July 2016, when they were pushed by content recommendation network RevContent. These advertisements truly did redirect to stories about transgender celebrities, such as Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox, but the articles \"18 Transgender Celebrities We've Come to Admire,\" \"31 Stars You Forgot Were Transgender\" and \"18 Transgender Celebs We Knew Nothing About\" didn't actually feature either Julia Stiles or Ansel Elgort.", "Elgort acknowledged these rumors in an April 2016 tweet:", "What's up @MissJuliaStiles . #theinternet pic.twitter.com/VseHYSypzk", "\u2014 Ansel Elgort (@AnselElgort) April 20, 2016", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
