["About this rating", "Revelations came to light in fall 2019 that U.S. President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate current Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden and his son. In response, the president\u2019s defenders have highlighted a May 4, 2018, letter signed by three Democratic senators to Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor general of Ukraine (a similar role to the U.S. attorney general), as evidence that claims of improper behavior are misplaced. The letter was notably described by Washington Post columnist Marc Theisen as betraying a \u201cdouble standard.\u201d", "This sentiment was amplified by several media outlets, as well as a viral tweet (retweeted by Donald Trump Jr.) from the Twitter account Comfortably Smug, which according to BuzzFeed News is run by a \u201cRepublican political consultant and deliberate spreader of false information\u201d:", "Several reasons exist why the above tweet and associated sentiment are incorrect and misleading. At the top of that list is the fact that the letter in question did not concern a request to \u201cinvestigate Trump,\u201d nor did it request the opening of any investigation.", "Instead, it requested information on why Ukrainian special prosecutor Serhiy Horbatyuk (who serves in a special prosecutor role charged with investigating corruption cases linked to former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich) had been \u201cprohibited\u201d from \u201cissuing subpoenas for evidence or interviewing witnesses\u201d in four existing investigations into former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort. Manafort, prior to joining the Trump campaign, had worked as a political consultant for Yanukovich and his political party. The four investigations involved money that flowed either to Manafort for this consulting work or to a law firm working with Manafort and others to improve Yanukovich\u2019s image in the West. They did not involve Trump.", "The three Democratic senators \u2014 then-Foreign Affairs Committee members Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy \u2014 were responding to a May 2, 2018, New York Times report that the four Manafort investigations in Ukraine were specifically singled out from a docket of nearly 3,000 corruption cases in Horbatyuk\u2019s portfolio to be blocked from issuing subpoenas and interviewing witnesses. U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, in his charge to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, was investigating Manafort in part because of concerns that he owed substantial funds to Russian oligarchs as a result of this consulting work, potentially giving them leverage over him as he ran Trump's campaign. The reason Ukrainian officials impeded the investigation was no secret, according to the Times \u2014 it was to placate the Trump administration, which opposed the Mueller probe:", "Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament who is an ally of [now former] President Petro O. Poroshenko, readily acknowledged that the intention in Kiev was to put investigations into Mr. Manafort\u2019s activities \u201cin the long-term box.\u201d", "\u201cIn every possible way, we will avoid irritating the top American officials,\u201d Mr. Ariev said in an interview. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t spoil relations with the administration.\u201d", "These discussions came at a complicated time for Ukraine, a country that has been fighting Russian aggression and that had been in the process of securing arms from the United States. \u201cThe decision to halt the investigations by an anti-corruption prosecutor was handed down as the Trump administration was finalizing plans to sell the country sophisticated anti-tank missiles, called Javelins,\u201d the Times reported.", "Far from requesting an \u201cinvestigation\u201d, the senators requested answers to three specific questions from a specific Ukrainian government official:", "Manafort broadly admitted to involvement in activities related to those four Ukrainian probes via a September 2018 guilty plea.", "Even ignoring the allegedly implied quid pro quo in the Trump-Zelensky call, a comparison between the senators\u2019 request for information from the chief Ukrainian law enforcement official and Trump\u2019s requests of Zelensky is problematic.", "As senators on the Committee on Foreign Relations, which not only provides oversight for arms deals but also general oversight of America\u2019s relationships with its allies, Menendez, Durbin, and Leahy were acting within their constitutional rights and obligations as official representatives of the U.S. government with oversight responsibility over the executive branch.", "Conversely, in his July 25 phone call with Zelensky, Trump explicitly requested that the Ukrainian president meet with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani \u2014 an unelected private citizen without a security clearance or oversight from anyone but Trump \u2014 to initiate investigations into a disparate set of claims whose sole unifying feature is that they concern Trump\u2019s political rivals: the Democratic National Committee and the Biden family.", "Because the letter at issue did not actually demand an investigation into Trump or even compel initiation of any investigation, we rank the claim that Democrats asked Ukraine to \u201cinvestigate Trump\u201d in 2018 as false.", "DailyWire.com. \u00a0 \u201c\u2018Double Standard\u2019: Senate Democrats Asked Ukraine To Help Them Investigate Trump.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 25 September 2019.", "Pollack, Joel B. \u00a0 \u201cDemocrats Wrote to Ukraine in May 2018, Demanding It Investigate Trump.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Breitbart News. &nbsp 24 September 2019.", "foreign.senate.gov. \u00a0 \u201cLetter to Yuriy Lutsenko.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 4 May 2018.", "Thiessen, Marc A. \u00a0 \u201cDemocrats\u2019 Double Standard on Ukraine.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0\u00a024 September 2019.", "Stuef, Jack. \u00a0 \u201cThe Man Behind @ComfortablySmug, Hurricane Sandy's Worst Twitter Villain.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 BuzzFeed News. \u00a0 30 October 2012.", "Kramer, Andrew E. \u00a0 \u201cUkraine, Seeking U.S. Missiles, Halted Cooperation With Mueller Investigation.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0\u00a02 May 2018.", "U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. \u00a0 \u201c1:17:cr-00201-ABJ #423 Statement of the Offenses and Other Acts.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 14 September 2018.", "WhiteHouse.gov. \u00a0 \u201cMemorandum of Telephone Conversation: President Zelenskyy of Spain\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 24 September 2019.", "Congressional Research Service. \u00a0 \u201cArms Sales: Congressional Review Process.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Updated 14 August 2019.", "Graham, David, A.. \u00a0 \u201cTrump\u2019s Incriminating Conversation With the Ukrainian President.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Atlantic. \u00a0 25 September 2019.", "Vogel, Kenneth and Matthew Goldstein. \u00a0 \u201cHow Skadden, the Giant Law Firm, Got Entangled in the Mueller Investigation.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0\u00a024 February 2019.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
