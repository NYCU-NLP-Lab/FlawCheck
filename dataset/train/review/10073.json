TPLF refers to the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front, an opposition party in Ethiopia.", "The caption continues: \u201cFollowing an operation that enabled the commando army to seize one of TPLF\u2019s buildings, many TPLF\u2019s mafia members have been caught fleeing with bags and boxes of money. At this rate, what they have hidden underground will be dug out (sic).\u201d", "The image shared with the post shows boxes and cases packed with cash on the floor of a room.", "Tensions have spiked between TPLF\u00a0in Ethiopia\u2019s north and\u00a0the national government since the 2018 election of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, with regional opposition leaders accusing his administration of discrimination.", "Matters escalated this month after Abiy ordered a military operation in Tigray in response to an alleged attack on a federal army camp\u00a0by TPLF, which they\u00a0denied.", "Using the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP Fact Check found similar posts sharing the image on Facebook here, here, here and here.", "However, the claim linking the money to the TPLF is false.

Indeed, both images were found in AFP's photo archives with captions that show they were shared by the police after their raid on Lima's flat.", "Abiy announced on November 4, 2020, that he had ordered an offensive in Tigray.
