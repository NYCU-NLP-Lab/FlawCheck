Jay Roberts, R-Ocilla, who spearheaded the bill, said about 85 percent of the hotel guests who pay the fee will be from outside Georgia.", "\"This shifts some of the burden to visitors who will have to share the costs to modernize the transportation network in Georgia,\" said Roberts, now a planning director for the state Department of Transportation, during floor debate on the final bill.", "The state\u2019s hospitality industry, though, was blindsided by the last-minute addition of the fee and has claimed it will hurt business and Georgians.", "The Georgia Convention and Visitors Bureau points to a survey of hoteliers that shows about a third of leisure guests are in-state tourists.

That would cost hotels about $22.5 million.", "But if hotels pass them along to guests, where are those folks from?", "Roberts said he cited his figure based on memory of lawmakers\u2019 debates on funding for the new Falcons stadium.", "\"I remember \u2026 that we were told that approximately 85 percent of the people that stay in the metro Atlanta motels/hotels are from out of state,\" Roberts said.", "In fact, Roberts underestimated slightly. \u00a0According to a website run by stadium advocates, 86 percent of overnight guests in the state\u2019s largest hotel market are from outside Georgia.", "So where does the Georgia CVB get its figures?", "From the 2013 Georgia Longwood study that looked at both statewide figures as well as Atlanta, which has 94,000 of the state\u2019s 177,000 hotel rooms.", "That report concluded 31 percent of leisure guests \u2013 that is, not including business travelers, conventioneers or people traveling with social groups like a church or school trip \u2013 were in-state travelers.

The numbers are plausible, but we don\u2019t know what they will mean.\"", "Our ruling", "The state lawmaker who helped Georgia pass a nearly $900 million bill to tackle the state\u2019s backlog of road and bridge work said a hotel fee in the bill would help shift the burden to out-of-state visitors.", "Jay Roberts was correct with his numbers, at least in the largest hotel market in the state.", "But hoteliers have a point that the fee could hit more Georgians in the state\u2019s smaller cities and regions, even if the numbers vary by the type of visitors staying.", "Roberts implied the 85 percent out-of-state figure was statewide, even if his citation was clearly only for metro Atlanta.", "He was accurate, but the statistic needs more information to be fully understood.", "We rate his claim Mostly True.", "Georgia Public Broadcasting, 2015 Legislative session, House Day 39, (PM session), March 31, 2015", "Georgia Department of Audits,Senate Revised Fiscal Note on HB 170, March 23, 2015", "Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"Nightly charge could impact state's tourism, industry warns leaders,\" April 27, 2015", "WABE radio, \"Added Fee at Ga.
