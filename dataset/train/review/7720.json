["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "U.S. Rep Glenn Nye portrays himself as a boldly independent Democrat who bucks his party on key issues such as health-care reform and the Wall Street bailout.\n\nIn at least four TV ads, the freshman congressman from Virginia Beach and Norfolk has stressed he voted against the bank bailout, which is formally known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.\n\n\"I stood up to my party leaders and voted no on the Wall Street bailouts,\" Nye said in one ad. (To emphasize his theme, he titled the ad \"Independence.\")\n\nBut there\u2019s a big problem with his claim: Nye was not a member of Congress when TARP was approved.\n\nThe final House vote approving TARP came Oct. 3, 2008 -- 32 days before Nye was elected and 95 days before he took office.\n\nThe bill set up a $700 billion bailout fund for banks that had made bad investments. President George W. Bush quickly signed the bill to avert what many feared could be a doomsday economic collapse.\n\nAlthough the TARP was intended to rescue the financial industry, the Bush administration in December 2008 broadened its reach\u00a0to allow an infusion of money for U.S. auto companies.\n\nNye has received considerable flak for the claim. So how can he say he voted against the TARP? He cites two votes cast during his first weeks in office.\n\nOne of the votes was on Jan. 14, 2009. But when we looked into it, we learned the vote did not concern the life or death of TARP. Nye simply opposed a procedural resolution to allow debate on a bill that would impose tough new restrictions on how companies could spend TARP money.\n\nProcedural resolutions are pretty routine and it\u2019s clear this was not considered a significant vote. For example, we couldn\u2019t find stories about it the following day\u2019s editions of the New York Times or the Washington Post. The House passed the resolution largely along party lines.\n\nNye did buck his party leaders on that vote because they wanted the debate to proceed. He was one of only 15 Democrats who voted against their party. But we find it\u2019s not accurate for him to characterize that as a vote \"against the bailout.\"\n\u00a0\nThe other vote he cites was January 22, 2009, on a bill to give the treasury secretary access to the second half of the $700 billion in TARP money. The law had said the second $350 billion would become available only if the administration asked for it and at least one chamber of Congress approved.\n\nBut that vote was essentially meaningless. The Senate had approved the request on Jan. 15, freeing the money to go to the Treasury.\n\nThe Republican-sponsored resolution had no impact on events; it was the equivalent of a coach challenging a referee\u2019s call a week after the game ended. Still, Nye was among 99 who supported the GOP resolution.\n\nSo Nye says he voted against the bailout. People hearing his claim would undoubtedly think he was referring to the main vote on the TARP, but he wasn\u2019t even elected when that vote was taken.\n\nHe cites one vote on a procedural motion that was not substantive and that the news media did not characterize as significant, and another vote that was more substantive, although the issue was moot at that point.\n\nSo there is just a small amount of truth to his claim. We find his claim Barely True.", "Nye for Congress Campaign, \"Nye Sets the Record Straight\" press release, Aug. 12, 2010.", "Nye for Congress, \"Independence\" TV ad,\u00a0Sept. 12, 2010", "Interview with Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense", "Thomas, Vote on H.
