The Dutch cycle more than any other nation in the world, almost 900 kilometres per year per person, amounting to over 15 billion kilometres annually. The self-driving bicycle enables safe navigation through the city for Amsterdam residents, and furthers Google\u2019s ambition to improve urban mobility with technology. Google Netherlands takes enormous pride in the fact that a Dutch team worked on this innovation that will have great impact in their home country.", "While many viewers encountered this video on the Google Netherlands channel on April Fools' Day (and thus understood that it was spoof of the Google Self-Driving Car Project), this short film reached a wider audience when it was posted (outside its original context) a few days later to the Calimero Facebook page. The Calimero version of the video has been viewed over 5 million times since then (nearly three million times more than the original video on Google Netherlands), on a site that makes no mention of an April Fools' Day joke.", "Although Google Netherlands likewise made no specific reference to April Fools' Day when they originally posted the video, they\u00a0did include a link to a \"making of\" video that showed the \"self-driving\" bicycle concept to be a hoax:", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
