["When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker proposed making state employees pay more for health and pension benefits, one of his aides said the changes would cost the average worker roughly 8 percent of his or her salary.\n\nWalker\u2019s move so angered MSNBC-TV talk show host Ed Schultz that he came to Madison on Feb. 17, 2011 -- the day the Legislature was scheduled to vote on the proposals -- to air his show.\n\nTwo days earlier, Schultz claimed on \"The Ed Show\" the impact on state workers would be much greater than 8 percent. He said:\n\n\"People who earn $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year might have 20 percent of their income just disappear overnight.\"\n\nSchultz hedged a bit by saying might. But the implication was the effect of Walker\u2019s proposals would be to cut the income of large numbers of state workers by 20 percent.\n\nLet\u2019s see if he\u2019s right.\n\nSchultz said in the broadcast that he had been given figures that show a 20 percent impact. We asked his staff for that information and they said they would attempt to provide it. \u00a0But as of publication, we have not heard from them.\n\nUnder the Republican governor\u2019s plan, state employees would contribute 5.8 percent of their pay toward pensions and pay at least 12 percent of their health insurance premiums.\n\nMeanwhile, we consulted other sources on how much more state workers would pay if the budget repair bill is adopted.\n\nIt\u2019s a political debate, but this is largely a mathematical question.\n\nHere\u2019s what our sources said:", "Under the plan, all employees would pay the same percentage of their income toward pensions.\n\nBut the larger health insurance payments would eat up a higher percentage of the income of low-income employees than of high-income employees.\n\nSo the total impact would vary on a percentage basis.\n\nThat said, the total impact, in terms of a percentage of income, would not vary widely, according to Wineke. The vast majority of state employees take the same so-called Tier 1 health coverage, he said.\n\nLet\u2019s return to the statement:\n\nSchultz said Wisconsin state employees earning $30,000 to $50,000 per year \"might have 20 percent of their income just disappear overnight\" as a result of Walker\u2019s proposals to boost state employee payments for health and pension benefits. It was a broad statement about the impact of the measures. \u00a0\n\nThe sources we consulted indicate the range is 6.8 percent to 11 percent. Even if the higher payments comprise 20 percent of the income of some employees, there\u2019s no indication it will be that high on a wide scale, particularly for state workers earning as much as $50,000 per year. If Schultz can provide evidence of a large-scale 20 percent impact, we\u2019ll review this item.\n\nBut this is our rating: False.", "(Editor\u2019s note: On March 4, 2011, this item was changed to fix an error in the percentage of employee salary that goes toward paying for pensions and health insurance for a hypothetical employee at UW-Eau Claire.)", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Walker calls for cuts or big layoffs, Feb. 11, 2011\n\nMSNBC-TV, \"The Ed Show,\"(at 3:45) Feb. 15, 2011\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Eau Claire Chancellor Brian Levin-Stankevich, memo to employees, Feb. 11, 2011\n\nInterview, former Wisconsin Division of Compensation and Labor Relations administrator and former Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Joe Wineke, Feb. 17, 2011\n\nE-mail interview, Gov.
