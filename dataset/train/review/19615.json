Face it girls, there are times when subterfuge isn't enough \u2014 you may need to take fast action, FAST!", "That's why a girl couldn't find a finer new friend than the Colt Cobra .38 Snub Nose. You'll enjoy the modern styling as you draw it from your purse. You'll sense the velvet smoothness of the action as you cock the hammer. You'll appreciate the crispness of the trigger pull, designed with your long nails in mind, as you fire again and again.", "Although the overall appearance of the ad is convincing at first glance, the closer one looks the more preposterous its content reveals itself to be. The image is a parody of 1950s advertising, but a number of inconsistencies and anachronisms stand out.", "The magazine named in the lower righthand corner, for example \u2014 \"Ladies Life & Household,\" it's supposedly called \u2014 never existed (or if it did, every trace of it has been expunged from modern records).", "The handgun's finish is described as \"Colt's beautiful pacifier blue\" \u2014 an obvious satirical reference to 1950s gender role stereotypes (if Colt ever manufactured a \"pacifier blue\" firearm, no examples of it exist to be found today).", "The pistol shown in the illustration, allegedly a Colt Cobra .38 (the same kind of revolver Jack Ruby used to kill JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963), appears to be a different model altogether.

The face of the \"mouth-breathing lunkhead\" with \"droopy, lifeless fish eyes\" who serves as the villain of the tableau shows unmistakable signs of digital tampering. It isn't just the eyes that droop:", "From all of the above it makes sense to suppose that there was an existing scanned image, most likely of another vintage ad, that served as a template for the Colt Cobra parody.
