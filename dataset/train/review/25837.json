["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "President Barack Obama, surrounded by uniformed law enforcement officers, outlined pitfalls of a budgetary sequester during a speech on Feb. 19, 2013.", "Will the sequester yank away parents\u2019 child care?\n\nOn March 1, mandatory federal budget cuts take effect that were supposed to be so painful that Congress would take action to avoid them.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has urged lawmakers to avoid the cuts, known as the sequester, and has been citing dire predictions about who might be hurt by the across-the-board reductions in a broad range of federal programs.\n\nOn Feb. 19, 2013, he warned that if Congress didn\u2019t take action, \"tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported the next day that \"day care centers are almost certainly not going to be padlocked on March 1.\"\n\nBut what will happen? And will it send parents scrambling?\n\n Child care subsidies and Head Start\n\nAt least two federal programs that affect parents\u2019 child care options face cuts under the sequester.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount \u2014 tentatively 7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for nondefense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.)\n\nThe uniform cuts must be applied to any \"program, project or activity\" that isn\u2019t otherwise exempted. However, within a given program, officials don\u2019t have to cut every line item equally. They have discretion to move money around within a program.\n\nThe two big federal programs affecting child care are the Child Care Development Block Fund, which helps states provide child care subsidies for low-income working parents that affect more than 1.6 million kids. The second is early education program Head Start, which awards grants to public and private agencies to increase kids\u2019 \"school readiness,\" such as with whole or half-day programs in schools and centers. (It also includes programs that wouldn\u2019t offset parents\u2019 child care needs.) Head Start says it serves more than a million kids a year.\n\nAll of Head Start\u2019s funding is open to sequester, according to the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget. About half of the Child Care Development Block Fund\u2019s program\u2019s federal funding is mandatory \u2014\u00a0and therefore exempt from the sequester \u2014 but the other half faces cuts.\n\nBoth programs are organized under the Health and Human Services Department, which estimates that \"up to 70,000 children\" would lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start programs, with some centers closing their programs early this year or delaying their start in the fall. Meanwhile, budget cuts would leave \"up to 30,000 children\" without child care services, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote.\n\nHouse Democrats and the White House also rely on the HHS estimates.\n\nBut the precise impact and timing of the cuts is difficult to quantify. Why? Because the programs are designed to give considerable control over spending to states and other public and private agencies.\n\nHead Start\u2019s rolling grant process means cuts will need to be made over the next seven months, the remainder of the current fiscal year, said Ted Froats, a spokesman for HHS\u2019 Administration for Children and Families. But with the child care grant program, while cuts also take place over seven months, it\u2019s harder to say when the impact may be felt.", "The department reached its 30,000 estimate by reducing the amount of funding available for the year according to the rules of the sequester and comparing that with the average cost per child served, Froats said.\n\nBut states have \"broad flexibility\" in administering the program, which is also partly funded by the states themselves and by moving money from other federal pots, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.\n\nParents qualify for subsidies on a sliding scale, with some paying co-pays \u2014 and rules vary state by state.\n\nStates might respond to federal cuts in a variety of ways, such as:\n\n\u2022 Imposing stricter eligibility criteria.\n\n\u2022 Freezing new enrollments.\n\n\u2022 Reducing subsidy amounts.\n\n\u2022 Increasing parental co-payment amounts.\n\nSo it\u2019s possible currently enrolled parents may keep their care, but with a lower subsidy or a higher co-pay.", "Still, it\u2019s important to note that states are already stretched. Nearly half had waiting lists or stopped taking new families in 2012, according to a report by the Women's National Law Center, which advocates for affordable child care. Meanwhile, reimbursement amounts have lagged. Parents may not be able to keep up with yet another cut.\n\nAnd the idea that states might be able to move money around and still support the same number of kids doesn\u2019t hold up, said Karen Schulman, a senior policy analyst who co-authored the report.\n\n\"They wouldn't have waiting lists if they had other ways around,\" she said. \"... To me, that suggests they've already looked at the 'fat.'\"\n\n(The libertarian Cato Institute in 2010 noted a 2004 report from Congress\u2019 Government Accountability Office found HHS didn't do a sufficient job overseeing state management of the program, leading to waste and abuse. But GAO\u2019s recommendations have since been implemented.)\n\n Our ruling\n\nThe president warned that if Congress didn\u2019t take action, \"tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids.\"\n\nThe sequester does hit two big programs that affect parents\u2019 child care or their need for it \u2014 a subsidy program and the early childhood education program Head Start. The government estimates up to 100,000 kids would be affected. But neither the White House nor HHS has provided sufficient evidence to establish the number of kids whose parents would need to find other child care.\n\nParents might be able to keep their subsidized child care with lower subsidies or higher co-pays. In the case of Head Start, it\u2019s not clear how many of the affected kids would lose spots in the types of programs that might leave their parents in a child-care lurch. Between the two, \"tens of thousands\" is plausible, but unproven.
