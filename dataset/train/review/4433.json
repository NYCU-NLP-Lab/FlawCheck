The company has not mentioned this alleged remake in any press releases, and we found no genuine news articles reporting that the company was planning to remake it. Bedknobs and Broomsticks was also absent from a recent list of upcoming live action Disney remakes.", "The poster itself is a composite of at least three different images. Kate Winslet's face, for instance, was taken from an advertisement for Lanc\u00f4me, and the hair in this image was taken from a still shot of the Dolores Umbridge character from the Harry Potter movie series:", "The body in this image came from a still shot of actress Claire Foye as Queen Elizabeth II in the historical drama The Crown:", "Faux movie posters are a popular pastime for some fans. We have previously covered hoax advertisements for a sequel to Monsters Inc. (charmingly entitled Boo), a Netflix series based on the Harry Potter books and films, and a sequel to Hocus Pocus.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
