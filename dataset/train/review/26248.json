["Following news that President Donald Trump\u2019s packed travel schedule and large family have depleted the Secret Service\u2019s annual funds, conservative pundit David Frum declared the costs incurred by the president unprecedented.", "\"No president in history has imposed larger personal lifestyle costs on the taxpayer than Donald Trump,\" he wrote on Twitter.", "No president in history has imposed larger personal lifestyle costs on the taxpayer than Donald Trump. https://t.co/Zvp2cyJoNS", "In an interview, Frum clarified that \"personal lifestyle costs\" excluded work trips, such as the G20 conference in Hamburg, Germany, or presidential residences where security costs are fixed, like the presidential retreat at Camp David.", "The pricey personal trips Frum had in mind include weekend trips to Trump-owned golf resorts in Palm Beach, Fla., Sterling, Va., and Bedminster, N.J.", "\"The Florida/Bedminster costs are entirely volitional, as are the costs of Melania\u2019s decision to live apart from her husband for most of his first year in office. There is no public purpose to any of those decisions,\" Frum told PolitiFact.", "As we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s hard to separate leisure and work when it comes to the presidency, particularly as Trump has hosted state visits at his resorts. That said, might Trump\u2019s leisure trips and residential circumstances amount to the costliest in presidential history?", "It\u2019s too early to tell, as even the highest estimates of Trump\u2019s spending can\u2019t match former President Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in office.", "Although Frum didn\u2019t include this qualifier, he might have meant at this point in Trump\u2019s presidency. Trump does seem on pace to outstrip previous presidential spending by the end of his term.", "Trump has left the White House more often at this point in his presidency than other modern presidents, according to CBS White House correspondent Mark Knoller, and the cost of protecting Trump while he\u2019s away is not cheap.", "Here\u2019s the important point to keep in mind: There are no definitive reports on the cost of Trump\u2019s travel, nor of any other president. The most comprehensive analyses exist on Trump and Obama\u2019s presidencies, and have been carried out by watchdog groups.", "The Government Accountability Office is the agency that traditionally computes costs for presidential travel, but its analysts have not calculated lifestyle costs for any president. Instead, they\u2019ve looked into specific trips at Congress\u2019 request.", "The latest report looked at the cost of a four-day vacation President Barack Obama took to Palm Beach in February 2013. The trip cost approximately $3.6 million, and has formed the basis of much speculation on the cost of Trump\u2019s travel.", "Basing its estimates on that report, the liberal Center for American Progress\u2019 said that a trip to Mar-a-Lago costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 million, which we rated Half True.", "It\u2019s not precise to stick that price tag on every presidential trip, as costs vary depending on the size of the vehicles used and where they\u2019re flown in from. That trip included a stop in Obama\u2019s hometown of Chicago, and costs for Air Force One travel were also almost $60,000 higher per hour at the time, according to Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning organization that has sued both Democratic and Republican administrations for public records.", "Using the $3.6 million estimate, the Center for American Progress placed Trump\u2019s personal travel costs through Aug. 3 at $32 million.", "That\u2019s a bit under a third of what Judicial Watch calculated Obama spent on personal travel in his eight years in office ($100 million).", "Judicial Watch offered a more conservative estimate for Trump.", "The watchdog group calculated the costs of five of Trump\u2019s and three of Melania\u2019s Mar-a-Lago visits and Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s Super Bowl trip in February using Air Force hourly travel rates obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. Those added up to a total of $3.6 million.", "That excludes, however, any of Trump\u2019s trips after March and security costs, as the Secret Service hasn\u2019t yet provided the data requested through the Freedom of Information Act. They also exclude other expenses, like $3.3 million in overtime costs Palm Beach County\u2019s presidential residence protection program incurred during Trump\u2019s visits.", "An internal agency document obtained by the Washington Post in March gives a better estimate of the amount spent on security by the Trump administration.", "The report said the Secret Service requested $60 million in additional funding for next year. $26.8 million would go to protecting Trump\u2019s family in Trump Tower and $33 million would fund travel costs. The Management and Budget Office had rejected the request.", "More recently, Secret Service Director Randolph Alles told USA Today that more than 1,000 agents have already hit the federally mandated annual caps for salary and overtime allowances.", "He attributed the dearth to both an unprecedented number of White House protectees -- Trump has 42, including his 18 family members, whereas Obama had 31 -- and efforts to secure Trump\u2019s multiple residences.", "Alles is in conversation with lawmakers to raise the cap from $160,000 per year to $187,000, but even that would leave 130 veteran agents without full compensation for hundreds of hours of work.", "Congress also had to approve compensation for 1,400 agents\u2019 thousands of hours of overtime that were earned above the limit in 2016.", "In the absence of concrete cost figures, we compared the president and the vice president\u2019s collective travel, measured loosely by the number of days logged by Secret Service agents protecting the vice president and president when they traveled. More agents worked travel days protecting Obama and Vice President Joe Biden at the six-month mark than Trump: 534 travel days to 378 for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.", "But when we added the president and vice president\u2019s associated family members into the mix, agents had traveled 4,054 days protecting Trump to Obama\u2019s 1,621. That\u2019s in part because Trump has a larger family with adult children whose business ties take them all over the world.", "The 567 personnel assigned to the Office of Protective Operation are projected to exceed the pay cap in 2017, which put them on track to equal the total overtime hours worked in 2016.", "Frum said \"No president in history has imposed larger personal lifestyle costs on the taxpayer than Donald Trump.\"", "It\u2019s too early to call Trump\u2019s personal travel itinerary the costliest in presidential history, as he\u2019s only a few months into the job. It\u2019s also a bold claim to make in the absence of definitive data on the costs of presidential travel, which is generally not disclosed.", "Frum may nonetheless be onto something. Travel and security records we gathered suggest Trump is on pace to outstrip Obama\u2019s spending on security and transport costs. But it\u2019s still too soon to tell, and Frum\u2019s statement remains an exaggeration.
