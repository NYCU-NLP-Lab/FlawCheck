["An old, fake claim that a fashion designer made racist remarks about black people is getting renewed attention online as users share what looks like a news headline.", "\"Michael Kors: \u2018I\u2019m tired of pretending I like blacks,\u2019\" reads the headline in the image shared on Facebook on July 5. It\u2019s dated Jan. 6, 2015, and goes on to quote Kors as saying: \"These people have made a mockery of my product, brand and life. I can\u2019t stomach the thought of my Michael Kors purses being stuffed with synthetic hair, weave or whatever those people call it.\"", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But the post stems from a story NaHa Daily, a now-defunct satirical website. The supposed article also quotes Kors as saying things like, \"Just for the sake of a sale I have to deal with women like Nicki Minaj?\"", "\"Considering every black person either has or knows someone with a MK watch, MK purse or MK key chain this might affect Michael Kors sales,\" the story says.", "But there\u2019s no evidence Kors said anything like what the NaHa Daily story \u2014 or Facebook post \u2014 allege. The designer is well-covered in the news. His reaction to First Lady Melania Trump wearing his label at her husband\u2019s 2017 congressional address garnered media attention, for example. Searching the Nexis news database, we found no articles quoting Kors saying he doesn\u2019t like black people.", "We rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "Facebook post, July 5, 2019", "NaHa Daily, \"Michael Kors CEO: \"I\u2019m tired of pretending to like blacks,\" Jan. 6, 2019", "W, \"Michael Kors reacts to Melania Trump wearing his label at Trump\u2019s Congress address,\" March 3, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
