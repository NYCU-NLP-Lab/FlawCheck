["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on November 27, 2019", "Sen. Elizabeth Warren misleadingly told a group of school-choice activists that her children \u201cwent to public schools,\u201d not private ones. Warren\u2019s campaign later clarified that her daughter attended public school, while her son mostly attended private school.", "The subject of where Warren\u2019s children went to school came up after the Democratic presidential candidate held a campaign rally in Atlanta on Nov. 21. Warren agreed to meet afterward with a group of pro-charter school advocates who had interrupted her speech at the event by reportedly chanting, \u201cOur voice! Our choice!\u201d", "The group, known as the Powerful Parent Network, said members traveled from different parts of the country to Atlanta to talk to Warren, whose education plan says she wants to \u201cstop the diversion of public dollars from traditional public schools through vouchers or tuition tax credits,\u201d as well as \u201cend federal funding for the expansion of charter schools\u201d and \u201cban for-profit charter schools.\u201d Warren is \u201cwrong on education when it comes to our children,\u201d one of the members\u00a0said in a video that helped raise money to fund their trip.", "A 54-second recording from the meeting with Warren shows the same group member, Sarah Carpenter, telling the Massachusetts senator, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the same choice that you made for your kids because I read that your children went to private school.\u201d", "In response, Warren said, \u201cNo, my children went to public schools.\u201d", "But that\u2019s misleading. Warren has two children, and one of them attended both public and private schools, her campaign has since admitted.", "\u201cElizabeth\u2019s daughter went to public school. Her son went to public school until 5th grade,\u201d the campaign explained in a statement provided to FactCheck.org. It also said: \u201cElizabeth wants every kid to get a great education regardless of where they live, which is why her plan makes a historic investment in our public schools. Every public school should be a great school. Her plan does not affect funding for existing non-profit charter schools, but she believes we should not put public dollars behind a further expansion of charters until they are subject to the same accountability requirements as public schools.\u201d", "Warren\u2019s son, Alexander, attended at least two private, college preparatory schools, according to articles from conservative outlets that wrote about her claim. We could not independently confirm which private schools he attended, and the campaign didn\u2019t disclose them.", "The Washington Free Beacon, citing a school yearbook, reported that Warren\u2019s son attended Kirby Hall School in Austin, Texas, at least during the 1986-1987 school year, when he was in the fifth grade. At the time, Warren was teaching at the University of Texas at Austin. There is an \u201cAlex Warren\u201d in Kirby\u2019s 1987 yearbook, according to an online version of the book at classmates.com.", "Also, the Federalist reported that, at age 15, he later attended the Haverford School in Haverford, Pennsylvania, while his mother taught at the University of Pennsylvania. The Federalist said it obtained a yearbook photo of Alexander from another Haverford alumnus who attended the all-boys school at the same time he did.", "As for Warren\u2019s daughter, Amelia, \u201cshe grew up trailing her law professor parents, attending nine public schools between kindergarten and 12th grade,\u201d according to a 2003 article in Wharton Magazine.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
