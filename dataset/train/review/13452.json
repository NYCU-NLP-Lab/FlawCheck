["On August 25, Republic TV hosted its routine late night program \u2018The Debate\u2019 where Arnab Goswami invited panelists to discuss the Rs 700 crore relief aid that was allegedly promised to the Kerala government by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan\u2019s Office tweeted on August 21 about the aid, which was later denied by the UAE. The CM, however, stood by his claim and all eyes are now turned to the UAE-based Malayali billionaire who was the only source of the information, as clarified by Vijayan.", "Goswami\u2019s show titled \u2018#FloodAidLie\u2019 attempted to discuss the purported fake news. However, soon after it was aired, the journalist received a lot of backlash on social media as many claimed that he called the people of Kerala \u201cshameless\u201d.", "Both individual users and social media pages posted a 30-second clip of Goswami\u2019s show where he can be heard saying, \u201cThis group is shameless. It\u2019s the most shameless bunch of Indians I have ever seen. They have gone around spreading the lie religiously. I don\u2019t know what they get for it, whether they get paid money. Do they get paid money for abusing their own country? Are they part of a group? Who are they funded by? The point is it\u2019s a conspiracy to malign India.\u201d The video shared by Facebook page Beef Janta Party has been shared over 2,800 times.", "#OMKVArnab", "WOW!!", "Arnab Cowswamy, unofficial spokesman of the sanghis, just called the suffering people of Kerala \u201cthe most shameless bunch of Indians I have ever seen\u201d!!

If one were to watch the minutes preceding the viral clip on social media, the show takes a dig at Congress and the Left for spreading the alleged lie of Rs 700 crore aid from UAE. Before panelists come on screen, Goswami introduced the debate saying, \u201cBiggest fake news story of the year. The UAE goes on record to deny the 700 crore flood aid fake story to Kerala. And the conspiracy was of the Congress party, Congress netas, trolls.\u201d He also goes ahead to say that Republic TV has \u201cexposed the troll army deployed by Congress to promote the flood aid lie.\u201d", "Seconds before Goswami begins his \u201cthis group is shameless\u201d monologue, the program shows a clip of CM Vijayan talking about the purported relief fund. It then flashes this question on the screen \u2013 \u201cPoliticians lied on flood aid?\u201d, and the debate begins thereafter. A screengrab of the frame just before Goswami\u2019s statements is attached below.", "The clip posted on social media does not show the first few minutes of the debate. Many viewers believed that he was referring to Keralites with his \u201cthis group of shameless people\u201d remark. Even though Goswami did not single them out, they weren\u2019t completely at fault for making the assumption. He kept referring to an imaginary bunch of people who conspired to spread an alleged lie. But the news originated from the Chief Minister\u2019s Office, was carried out by multiple media outlets, including Republic TV and then shared by citizens on social media.", "If the aim was to target politicians and Congress IT cell members, screaming the words \u201ctukde tukde gang\u201d, \u201canti-nationals\u201d, \u201cvultures\u201d and \u201ccarnivores\u201d throughout the length of the show was unnecessary and left space for ambiguities.
