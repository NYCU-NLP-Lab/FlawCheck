We Checked.", "Terming it \u201cstrange, unthinkable and very disheartening\u201d, the leader of a Nigerian pro-reform group castigated the \u201cmonumental\u201d pay of the country\u2019s lawmakers.", "Areoye Oyebola, a former newspaper editor who chairs the Movement for Nigeria\u2019s Total Transformation, urged a pay cut of as much as 90%.", "Amid grinding poverty, a Nigerian senator earns \u201cUS$1.7 million annually\u201d, Oyebola said, \u201cfar higher than the US$400,000 yearly income of the US president\u201d.", "\u201cEven a member of the house of representatives also earns more than the American president. What a tragic and pathetic situation!\u201d he added.", "Oyebola confirmed to Africa Check that he was quoted correctly, but didn't give a specific data source to back it up.", "\u201cYes, I said it. I also wrote it in my book and this is based on my calculations and information I saw on the internet,\u201d he said, referring to his Grave issues Nigeria must tackle 2012 publication. \"It's there. It\u2019s all over the internet!\"", "We pored over the internet to find out.", "In Nigeria, the state agency that sets the pay of public officers is the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission. The country has 109 senators and 360 members of the lower house of representatives in its national assembly.", "The revenue agency\u2019s spokesman Ibrahim Mohammed told Africa Check that the legislators were currently being paid according to a 2007 remuneration structure.", "A proposed 2009 review championed by late President Umaru Yar'Adua, which would have cut their pay, was rejected by the national assembly, Mohammed added. He said the commission is working on another salary structure that would dock the lawmakers pay.", "\"We are yet to conclude on the downward review of the remuneration package for political and public office holders, though it started in 2015.\"", "A cross-country comparison of legislator pay by the National Institute for Legislative Studies, the research and advisory body of Nigeria\u2019s parliament, reflects the 2007 remuneration structure.", "Senators earn an annual basic salary of N2,026,400 (US$6,630 at the current official exchange rate), while that of a house of representatives member is N1,985,212 (US$6,495).

These are accommodation, car loans, furniture allowances and a send-off amount at the end of their term.", "Calculated annually, these extra benefits can take the annual pay of a senator to US$62,000 and US$50,964 in the case of a house of representatives member.", "Samuel Atiku, the head of research at public finance watchdog BudgIT, told Africa Check that due to a lack of transparency in parliament\u2019s budget process the total annual pay may be even higher than what is publicly shared.", "The national assembly enjoys wide financial autonomy, which has created conditions for secrecy about their pay. This has led to campaigns for more transparency.", "Following pressure, including from the presidency, the lawmakers in May 2017 gave a peek of their books - the first time since Nigeria\u2019s return to democracy in 1999. For this year, parliament will get N125 billion (US$409 million) in total.", "\u201cThere are schools, hospitals and other critical projects to be built that will affect the lives of millions of Nigerians,\u201d Atiku said. \u201cI don't think there is any justification for the national assembly of about 460 members to have a bigger budget than some states in Nigeria.\u201d (Note: Yobe state has N70 billion to spend this year.)", "The head of a Nigeria pro-reform group criticised the pay of the country\u2019s legislators, saying they were earning more than the president of the United States.", "Excluding additional benefits paid every four years, a Nigerian senator earns about a tenth of the annual pay package of a US president.
