["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 17, 2019", "An image of elected officials playing a computer card game has gone viral on social media. But the photo is from 2009, and it shows state lawmakers in Connecticut, not members of Congress.", "Deception and poker go hand in hand, but one of the latest viral images to mislead users on social media invokes the more benign card game of solitaire.", "More than 40,000 users on Facebook shared the meme, which includes a photo of lawmakers sitting behind laptops as a colleague speaks in the background. The computer card game can be seen clearly on two of the screens, while a third screen appears to show an image of a baseball player on ESPN\u2019s website.", "But the image is not current, nor is it of members of Congress \u2014 as the meme implicitly suggests, and as Facebook users commenting and sharing appeared to believe (\u201cThe easy slippery slide to becoming a multi millionaire!

On the other hand, state lawmakers in Connecticut, like those in the photo, receive a base salary of $28,000, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.", "The photo was taken\u00a0Aug. 31, 2009, by Connecticut-based photographer Jessica Hill, and still appears on her website. Her caption reads: \u201cHouse Minority Leader Lawrence F. Cafero Jr., R-Norwalk, far right, speaks while colleagues play solitaire on their computers as the House convenes to vote on a new budget for the fiscal year in the Capitol, in Hartford, Conn.\u201d", "One of the two lawmakers seen playing the game, Democratic state Rep.
