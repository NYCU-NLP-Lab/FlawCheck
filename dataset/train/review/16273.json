["\u201cA caller to a radio talk show recently shared that his wife was hospitalized and told she had COVID and only a couple of days left to live. A doctor friend suggested she be tested for legionnaires disease because she wore the same mask every day all day long. Turns out it WAS legionnaires disease from the moisture and bacteria in her mask,\u201d an August 6, 2020 Facebook post says.", "\u201cShe was given antibiotics and within two days was better. WHAT IF these \u2018spikes\u2019 in COVID are really something else due to mask wearing??\u201d it says.", "Other examples of the claim can be found on Facebook -- here and here -- Twitter -- here -- and Instagram -- here and here.", "Legionnaires\u2019 disease is a serious type of pneumonia caused by a bacteria called Legionella, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).", "About 1 out of 10 people who contract it will die from the disease. Common sources of infection are found in very humid environments and complex water systems, such as decorative fountains, cooling towers, or large plumbing systems.", "When it comes to Legionella development, \u201cplaces that we worry about are places with a lot of humidifying air,\u201d Dr Taison Bell, critical care and infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia, told AFP by phone.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not something that can persistently live on a mask,\u201d he added. \u201cTo say that the moisture from your own breath causes Legionella, that\u2019s just not true.\u201d", "Shanta Whitaker, vice president of health policy at a government affairs firm, with a doctorate in microbiology from Yale University, also agreed that the \u201cbacteria is ubiquitous in nature and not found on our skin, body.\u201d", "Research shows that Legionella is not contagious. It does not develop on dry surfaces and cannot be contracted by mold, according to the non-profit organization legionella.org.", "And \u201cyou cannot contract Legionnaires\u2019 disease from wearing face masks,\u201d the website says.", "Although some symptoms can overlap in both diseases, such as fever and shortness of breath, others are only common to one, such as a loss of taste and smell in COVID-19 patients.", "\u201cIt does not connect with what\u2019s going on with COVID-19,\u201d Bell said.", "\u201cWhile there can be some overlap, they are different diseases in that Legionella disease is not one that spreads from person to person and is not expected to cause an epidemic or a pandemic, but more localized outbreaks that are limited to a building or a water source,\u201d he said.", "It \u201cis not something that would spread throughout the population, from person to person.\u201d", "AFP Fact Check has debunked more than 600 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
