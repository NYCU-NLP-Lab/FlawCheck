["By Robert Farley", "Posted on August 2, 2016", "Donald Trump said he\u2019s worried about a \u201crigged\u201d general election, citing \u201cprecincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican\u201d in 2012. Voting experts said such outcomes in certain urban districts were entirely plausible given the demographics.", "Trump\u2019s comments about the potential for a \u201crigged\u201d election were made during an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News on Aug. 1 (starting at the 7:22-mark).", "Hannity, Aug. 1: You said at a speech today you\u2019re afraid this election is going to be rigged. Explain.", "Trump: Yeah. Well, I\u2019ve been \u2014 I\u2019ve been hearing about it for a long time. And I know last time, there were \u2014 you had precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican. And I think that\u2019s wrong. I think that was unfair, frankly, than Mitt Romney. You had areas where a lot of people were curious, \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d", "\u2026 and I\u2019m telling you, November 8th, we\u2019d better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it\u2019s going to be taken away from us.", "As Trump said, there were numerous media reports in 2012 about voting precincts in Philadelphia and Cleveland in which\u00a0Romney did not receive a single vote.", "The Philadelphia Inquirer reported on Nov. 12, 2012, that there were 59 voting divisions in the city where \u201cMitt Romney received not one vote. Zero. Zilch.\u201d In those districts, President Barack Obama got nearly 20,000 votes.", "Although those results sparked concern among some Republicans about vote fraud, the Inquirer article noted that the districts in question \u2014 each with several hundred registered voters \u2014 were clustered in almost exclusively black sections of Philadelphia where the vast majority of registered voters are Democrats. In one of the divisions, for example, the Inquirer found just 12 Republicans on voter registration lists, and reporters couldn\u2019t locate any who voted for Romney.", "At FactCheck.org, we dealt with this issue and other voting conspiracies contained in a viral email in early 2013.", "Similarly, the Cleveland Plain Dealer found nine precincts in which\u00a0Obama shut out Romney. Those districts were mostly clustered on the east side of Cleveland \u2014 where Obama won 96 percent of the vote.", "Voting experts told us districts with unanimous votes for Obama were not evidence of vote fraud. In fact, they said, based on demographics and party affiliation in urban areas, such votes\u00a0were expected.", "\u201cThose results seem perfectly plausible without any reasonable suspicion of vote fraud,\u201d Sasha Issenberg, author of \u201cThe Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns,\u201d told us via email.", "Issenberg said some back-of-the-envelope math shows just how unremarkable those results were in Philadelphia and Cleveland. In Ohio, according to exit polls, 96 percent of the African American vote went to Obama; in Pennsylvania, it was 93 percent. Issenberg pointed to one Philadelphia census tract where 95 percent of the population is African American, in addition to those who identify as biracial/multiracial. (Only 49 out of 4,488 people in the tract are white.)", "\u201cIn cities like Philadelphia and Cleveland this type of racial polarization isn\u2019t that unusual,\u201d Issenberg said. \u201cCensus tracts are much larger than divisions, as precincts are known in Philadelphia \u2014 the smallest unit at which votes are reported, usually a few hundred each. Is it hard to imagine that a fraction of a census tract that is 95+ percent black could go 100 percent for Obama when voters across that category statewide are voting at a 93 percent rate?\u201d", "Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said Trump pointing to these voting anomalies as evidence of \u201crigged\u201d elections is \u201ca laughable and even irresponsible allegation.\u201d", "\u201cWith no evidence at all, Trump is charging \u2014 in advance of the election \u2014 that if he loses, it might well be because the election is rigged. Puh-leaze,\u201d Sabato told us via email. \u201cThe precincts that gave Romney no votes or very few votes were nearly all-minority. President Obama received 93 percent of the African-American vote, according to the national exit poll, while Romney received 6 percent. With that kind of backing for Obama, it is almost inevitable that some black precincts would show 100 percent backing for him.\u201d", "Besides, Sabato said, \u201cIf you were going to steal an election, why would you concentrate your efforts on precincts where your candidate was already going to receive nearly all the votes? Wouldn\u2019t you logically go to precincts where the pickings weren\u2019t so slim?\u201d", "Philadelphia and Cleveland weren\u2019t the only cities in which voting districts went entirely for Obama.", "In 2008, Jonathan Rodden, a political science professor at Stanford and a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution, collected precinct-level results for more than\u00a0165,000 precincts in all states (except Oregon).", "Rodden told us he found there were more than 1,600 precincts around the country in which\u00a0Obama received 100 percent of the vote.", "\u201cVirtually all of them were in dense city centers populated overwhelmingly by minorities,\u201d Rodden told us via email. \u201cThis phenomenon was not limited to one or two cities \u2014 it happened in cities throughout the country. Either vote fraud took place in virtually every major city, or the Republican candidate simply performed poorly in city centers. I\u2019m pretty comfortable with the latter interpretation!\u201d", "So Trump was right about there being a number of precincts \u201cwhere there were practically nobody voting for the Republican.\u201d But that isn\u2019t evidence that vote tallies were \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201crigged.\u201d Experts said that demographics explain not only how it was possible, but probable.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4daf1461-5746-45a8-9593-487cce06096f", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
