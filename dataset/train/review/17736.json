["Judge Amy Coney Barrett has been selected as President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick, but her record and religious faith\u00a0have led some to criticize her nomination. A meme posted on Facebook claims one of those critics is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.", "\u201cSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) Says Judge Amy Coney Barrett is \u2018wildly out of the mainstream\u2019 and shouldn\u2019t serve on the Supreme Court. Because she\u2019s Catholic. Because she\u2019s a Christian. Do you hear that, you 51 million US Catholics, you 205 million US Christians? The Democrats officially oppose Catholics and Christians. Vote accordingly,\u201d the post reads.", "The Facebook user who posted the meme told USA TODAY that she\u2019s not the only conservative to back this claim.", "\u201cAccording to GOOGLE, there\u2019s almost 70.5 Million Catholics in the US, so that\u2019s over 20% of the population! How can that NOT be MAINSTREAM?

He criticized both Brasher and Senate Republicans over the nominee\u2019s lack of experience, as Brasher had spent just six months on a district court prior to his nomination. He also criticized Brasher\u2019s record on\u00a0voting rights, women\u2019s reproductive rights, gun safety and marriage equality.", "\u201cThe Senate majority is asking us to promote a candidate for a circuit court judgeship who has less than a year of experience as a judge,\u201d Schumer said.\u00a0\u201cBut he\u2019s not just unqualified; maybe why they\u2019re promoting him so quickly is because they love the fact that his views are so wildly out of the mainstream.\u201d", "Fact check:Sen.

He said in January 2017 that he was concerned the likelihood of a \u201cmainstream nominee\u201d was decreasing with \u201cthe hard right running the show.\u201d When asked to define mainstream, he said, \u201cYou know it when you see it.\u201d", "Still, Schumer has criticized Barrett\u2019s nomination and said he \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d her as a choice for the Supreme Court.", "Fact check:In early 1970s, RBG represented woman discharged from military because she wouldn't get an abortion", "The claim that Democrats oppose Christians and Catholics is baseless.
