Nora Scheland in the FBI\u2019s national press office told us in an email that she had \u201cno further data and no year-by-year data that I can provide\u201d beyond the estimate of 10,000 \u201cMS-13 members and associates.\u201d", "Trump claimed that the Obama administration \u201callowed\u201d MS-13 to \u201cform in cities\u201d across the country, but its origins and spread date back much earlier than Obama\u2019s time as president.", "We asked the White House press office for support for the president\u2019s claim, but we have not received any.", "The gang called MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, originated\u00a0in Los Angeles in the 1980s, according to several accounts, at a time when El Salvador was embroiled in a civil war.", "A\u00a02005 National Gang Threat Assessment report by the National Alliance of Gang Investigators Association and funded by the Justice Department said that the \u201cprimarily El Salvadoran\u201d gang \u201cformed in the Rampart area of Los Angeles, which was heavily populated by Mexican-American gangs. After being constantly victimized by the dominant Mexican gangs, El Salvadoran immigrants banded together for protection, thus enlarging their membership and force. The group called itself Mara Salvatrucha, or MS, and as it grew in size, it aligned with the Mexican Mafia under the Los Surenos umbrella.\u201d", "A Congressional Research Service report, updated in 2008, explained that \u201c[t]he more recent emergence, growth, and expansion of two Latino street gangs, the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and the 18th Street Gang (also known as the Mara 18 or M-18), have raised concern among policy makers for several reasons,\u201d including whether the gangs were becoming transnational criminal organizations.

By the end of the 1980s, some estimates indicate that more than 300,000 Salvadorans had settled in Los Angeles. One hypothesis on the gang formation asserts that Salvadorian immigrants during this period banned together and formed the MS-13 gang. MS-13\u2019s early membership is reported to have included former guerrillas and Salvadoran government soldiers whose combat experience during the Salvadoran civil war contributed to the gang\u2019s notoriety as one of the more brutal and violent Los Angeles street gangs. Moreover, the gang developed a widely reported reputation of employing unusual methods of violence, including using machetes in gang attacks. Despite the gang\u2019s reputation, sources in law enforcement indicate that little evidence exists to substantiate that the MS-13 gang is more violent than other street gangs.", "By the time of the 2005 threat assessment report, the gang had spread across the U.S. Since the 1980s, the report said, \u201cthe gang has successfully migrated from southern California to the East Coast, establishing a significant presence in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and New York.\u201d", "Washington, D.C., and its suburbs were of particular concern. The report described MS-13 as \u201cone of the newest threats to the [South] region, especially in Washington, DC, Virginia, and the surrounding areas.\u201d", "The previous year, in December 2004, in fact, the FBI had formed the MS-13 National Gang Task Force to\u00a0\u201ccounteract this growth\u201d of the gang.

Deported individuals often maintain their ties to gangs in the United States, resulting in the extension of criminal enterprises into other countries. Hispanic gang members find it easier to access drugs and weapons in their home countries and courier the items back to the Untied States rather than to conduct their operations within the United States. U.S. currency used to pay for drugs and weapons is easily exchanged and has a much higher value in many foreign countries.", "Leap, however, cautions that poverty is the root cause of gangs, not immigration. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that gangs are developing in Central America\u201d in impoverished areas, she says. \u201cAs long as people are poor we\u2019re going to have gangs.\u201d", "Leap told us what causes gangs to flourish isn\u2019t immigration policy, as Trump claimed, but economics.", "\u201cGangs do not flourish because of weak immigration policies.\u00a0Gangs flourish because of economic disenfranchisement.

Bush administration and continued under Obama\u2019s. A 2008 Department of Justice fact sheet lists several initiatives, including school- and neighborhood-based programs and international law enforcement coordination. In 2005, First Lady Laura Bush spearheaded a three-year initiative to keep boys out of gangs. In October 2012, the Obama administration\u2019s Treasury Department\u00a0designated MS-13\u00a0as a \u201ctransnational criminal organization,\u201d giving authorities the power to block and seize the gang\u2019s financial assets.", "And in January 2016, the FBI wrote about how the FBI and State Department had sponsored six Central American Law Enforcement Exchange programs since 2009, the FBI said, to bring together international law enforcement personnel working on gang violence, in particular by MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang.", "MS-13 is still active.
