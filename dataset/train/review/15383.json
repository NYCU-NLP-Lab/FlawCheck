Donna Howard, D-Austin, floated her comparison in an August \u00a02016 press conference called by Democratic leaders from Austin critical of Republican nominee Donald Trump, who was rallying Austin-area supporters later the same day.", "Clinton has said she\u2019ll focus on ensuring quality child care for all in part by making sure no family has to devote more than 10 percent of its income to child care.", "For the Truth-O-Meter\u2019s sake, we wondered if child care costs exceed college tuition in some states.", "In 2014, PolitiFact found Mostly True President Barack Obama\u2019s claim that in 31 states, \"decent child care costs more than college tuition.\" Obama\u2019s conclusion was cherry-picked from several results from an advocacy group\u2019s 2013 survey of child care costs. Obama also ignored uncertainty about how federal aid and tax credits might affect the comparison.", "When we inquired about Howard\u2019s claim, Scott Daigle, her chief of staff, said by email she primarily drew on research posted online by the liberal Economic Policy Institute.", "A web search led us to an October 2015 institute breakout suggesting child care costs for a 4-year-old exceeded in-state tuition at a public college in 24 states in 2014 -- though not Texas.

The group says in its 2014 report that the survey relied on state and local Child Care Resource and Referral offices to provide 2013 cost data related to the average price of child care for infants and 4-year-old children \"in legally operating child care centers and family child care homes.\" Six states including Texas didn\u2019t deliver information, the report states, so the price of child care in those states was adjusted from prior years\u2019 data.", "Upshot, per the group: \"In 2013, the average annual cost for an infant in center-based care was higher than a year\u2019s tuition and fees at a four-year public college in 31 states and the District of Columbia. Even the annual average cost of care for a four-year-old in a center, which is less expensive than care for an infant, was higher than public college tuition and fees in 20 states.\" For Texas, a chart shows, the $6,643 for one year of child care for a 4-year-old (adjusted from 2012 data) trailed $8,522 in average annual tuition and fees at a public college.", "We noticed that the group\u2019s 2015 report states that its survey taken that year showed that in 2014, the average annual cost for an infant in center-based care was higher than a year\u2019s tuition and fees at a four-year public college in 28 states, though not Texas--a conclusion that differs with the institute's findings.", "\"Even the annual average cost of care for a four-year-old in a center, which is less expensive than care for an infant, was higher than public college tuition and fees in 19 states,\" the report states, Texas narrowly not among them.
