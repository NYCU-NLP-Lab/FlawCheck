The former head of Health and Human Services pointed to the experience of one of the main insurers in Florida, Blue Cross Blue Shield, which is headed by CEO Pat Geraghty, as a success story.", "\"Florida has not been a welcoming state to this law.

We can go forward.\u2019 \"", "We decided to fact-check Sebelius\u2019 claim about the number of Floridians who enrolled through the federal health care law in spite of Republican efforts against it, including from Gov.

Florida Blue anticipated an increase because some other insurers, such as UnitedHealthCare and Aetna, exited the marketplace where consumers can shop for policies.", "\"The number fluctuates throughout the year, but historically the enrollment numbers actually increase within the few months following the open enrollment close date, so that number will probably rise slightly over the next couple of months,\" Kluding said.", "Florida Blue sells plans in all Florida counties and is the largest insurer participating in the federal marketplace in Florida.", "With all insurers combined, about 1.7 million Floridians enrolled through the federal health care law for 2017. So Florida Blue is the largest insurer on the marketplace.", "Sebelius and Geraghty both attended an annual health care conference at the University of Miami on March 3. At the conference, Kluding said, Geraghty told Sebelius \"that the company is now serving approximately 1 million individual members, and that Florida Blue has operated this ACA business profitably.\"", "Florida Blue made a small profit in the ACA market -- a single-digit positive margin, Kluding said.", "Sebelius\u2019 number about Florida Blue enrollment was close to the actual figure.

They have the largest market shares and historically being the insurer of last resort, their pool didn\u2019t change as radically as a lot of other insurance companies did,\" Tanner said.", "While Florida Blue has seen rising enrollment, some other insurers have scaled back offering plans on the exchange in Florida or have exited the market entirely. (Half of the insurers doing business in Florida offer plans on the exchange.)", "UnitedHealthCare and Aetna exited the individual market, although Aetna is still writing off-exchange plans, said Amy Bogner, a spokeswoman for the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.

Florida Blue said 940,000 people enrolled as of Jan. 31, and the insurer expects the number to rise.
