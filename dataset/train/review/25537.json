["About this rating", "Leading up to the inauguration of then-U.S. President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20, 2021, a widely circulated video appeared to show the U.S. Army Band had practiced \u201cHit the Road Jack\u201d outside of the White House, where then-President Donald Trump was still in residence.", "The video was shared on Twitter on Jan. 18, 2021, by a user who goes by the name Cathay Dawkins, and it was also shared the following day on TikTok. In both videos, the original poster claimed they were standing outside the White House when the military band was practicing \u201cHit the Road Jack\u201d just two days before Biden was set to be sworn in as president in the U.S. Capital.", "In the days following the original posting, the video circulated across social media platforms, including as a YouTube video that was shared by user Jeremy Hocket and had been viewed more than 60,000 times as of this writing.", "Snopes contacted the U.S. Army Military District of Washington to determine whether the band was in fact playing the classic song recorded by Ray Charles. In an emailed statement, Media Relations Division Chief Shaunteh Kelly confirmed that the video had been doctored: \u201cThe Military support to presidential inaugurations provides the Department of Defense with an opportunity to demonstrate the professionalism of the Armed Forces,\u201d wrote Kelly. \u201cThe Army Band was rehearsing the \u2018National Emblem\u2019 as a part of the military\u2019s precision, teamwork, and dedication to ceremonial excellence. The video was edited. Someone superimposed another band playing \u2018Hit the Road Jack.\u2019\u201d", "Further analysis by the Snopes team confirmed that the original, undoctored video was posted to Twitter on Jan. 18 by CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta. The original video contained a wider shot of the marching band members, and ambient noise could be heard in the background.", "It appeared that the video had been overlaid with an audio recording of a different marching band. As was first reported by the fact-checking site Lead Stories, an analysis through the music identifying app Shazam showed that the music added to the clip came from a recording of the Ohio State University Marching Band performing the song conducted by Jon Woods. This was confirmed by a secondary listen to the audio recording using Siri.", "The video was copyrighted and released in 2012 and was posted to YouTube in February 2015. The audio from the fake video can be heard at the 1 minute 18 second mark in the video below:", "Follow-up posts by social media users who shared the doctored video further confirmed that it was fake. In a second video, Hocket shared the same footage as the YouTube video above and with the caption, \u201cWhat they were really playing ;)\u201d.", "Whether the video in question was meant to be a joke or to incite further heated discourse between political factions, it is obvious that the video of the marching band was authentic but the audio was fabricated \u2014 not to mention copyrighted.", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
