["About this rating", "In August 2016, an image of a Tweet ostensibly posted by 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, in which he supposedly admitted to having an open marriage, began circulating on social media:", "We could not find this tweet (supposedly posted on 12 July 2015) in Kaine's Twitter feed, however. While it has been displayed on sites such as Prntly.com, a disreputable outlet that has a penchant for publishing both fake news and spurious pro-Trump articles, a direct link to the alleged Tweet has not yet materialized.", "The earliest iteration of the above-displayed image we could uncover was posted to the Twitter account of Scott Ernst on 6 August 2016:", "Ernst's Twitter feed, like Prntly's content, is full of discredited stories, conspiracy theories, and pro-Trump/anti-Clinton material.", "Given that Senator Kaine's Twitter feed is almost exclusively devoted to policy, it would be highly unusual for him to post such a personal message to his official account. Moreover, the sentence used in the questionable tweet was lifted verbatim from a July 2015  article by Michael Sonmore on \"What Open Marriage Taught One Man About Feminism\" published at the same time as the datestamp on Kaine's putative tweet (so even if the sentence had appeared in a Kaine tweet, it would have been an obvious reference to that just-published article rather than an admission that his wife was seeking sexual partners outside their marriage):", "When my wife told me she wanted to open our marriage and take other lovers, she wasn\u2019t rejecting me, she was embracing herself. When I understood that, I finally became a feminist.", "Tim Kaine has been married to Ann Holton since 1984.", "Bump, Phillip. \u00a0 \"The Pro-Trump Fake News Website That\u2019s Finding an Audience \u2014 with Trump\u2019s Help.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 2 April 2015.", "Sonmore, Michael. \u00a0 \"What Open Marriage Taught One Man About Feminism.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NY Mag. \u00a0 16 July 2015.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
