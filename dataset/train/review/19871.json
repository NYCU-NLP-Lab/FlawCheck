Rick Scott and the state Cabinet and Florida\u2019s 29 Republican electors. The website also cites the same story in the Detroit Free Press.", "The filing alleges that the state\u2019s election results were invalid, contending that voting machines malfunctioned or were hacked, many votes went uncounted and mail-in ballots weren\u2019t included, among other problems.
