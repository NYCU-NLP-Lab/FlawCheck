["In a televised debate July 23, 2012, the Texas GOP candidates for U.S. Senate sought to bolster their conservative credentials before the July 31 primary runoff election.\n\n\"Amnesty\" is a dirty word in this context, and Ted Cruz tacked his opponent\u2019s name right onto it.\n\n\"The Dewhurst amnesty,\" Cruz claimed, \"would take every single illegal alien in the United States and give them a guest worker permit.\" His source for that, he said, was a 2007 speech by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst \"where he explicitly advocated a guest worker program for every single illegal alien in the United States today\" -- more than 11 million people, by the Pew Hispanic Center\u2019s 2010 estimate, though of course not all would be adults qualified for a guest-worker program.\n\nIs that what Dewhurst said?\n\nLauren Thurston, a spokeswoman in Dewhurst\u2019s state office, emailed us a copy of the February 17, 2007, speech given when Dewhurst was named \"Mr. South Texas,\" an annual honor bestowed by a Laredo civic group.\n\nThe speech\u2019s reference to guest workers is this:", "\"I support secure borders both north and south and I support a guest worker program for those here today illegally. Labor and skilled workers are critical to our Texas economy.\"", "Thurston didn\u2019t address our request for more information about the program Dewhurst said he supported. Dewhurst campaign spokesman Matt Hirsch told us by email that Dewhurst was not referring to any specific program and has consistently opposed \"any amnesty.\"\u00a0\n\nDewhurst faced questions about his 2007 speech in a July 24, 2012, interview by Andrea Watkins of Houston\u2019s KRIV-TV, which aired the debate; his campaign posted video of the interview online.\n\nExcerpts:", "Andrea Watkins: Did you support a guest worker program in that speech?", "David Dewhurst: In the speech, then and now is my same position. There\u2019s no room for any discussion on doing anything until we secure the border. ...", "Once the border is secure, would you still support a guest worker program, as you were saying in that speech?", "I would want to look at all of our options and see what is available. \u2026 What I was really focused on is that we need a sensible legal immigration policy. That\u2019s what I\u2019m after.", "Mr. Cruz thinks, though, that a guest worker program that you were supporting is even more broad than the amnesty \u2026 the new policy that president Obama has adopted \u2026 President Obama would allow about eight hundred thousand people in the United States to stay, and your guest worker program would be for everyone who is in the United States illegally.", "First of all, it\u2019s not my guest worker program. I wasn\u2019t recommending any specific changes to our immigration policy, just that once we secure our borders -- and the federal government has not done a good job -- \u00a0then Congress, I believe, needs to take up the issue and look at \u2026 how we try and identify those people that are here, that are national security risks to the United States. \u2026 Again, I\u2019ve always been categorically opposed to amnesty, which is a pathway to citizenship for those who live here right now.", "PolitiFact researchers often explore different uses of the word \"amnesty\" in connection with illegal immigrants, recently reaching a definition similar to Dewhurst\u2019s \"pathway to citizenship\" in a June 20, 2012, fact-check. Generally, amnesty consists of giving a group of lawbreakers a permanent guarantee that they won\u2019t be punished for their offense. In immigration debates, we wrote, it is most accurate when applied to policies that give illegal immigrants a way to achieve permanent legal status.\n\nSo: A pathway, without punishment. Permanently.\n\nWe searched the Nexis newspaper archive for instances of Dewhurst otherwise declaring his views on guest worker programs and found one mention. An April 25, 2007, Houston Chronicle news story says Dewhurst told the paper in an interview that he \"has long urged Congress to enact a guest worker program for immigrants.\" The story does not quote Dewhurst in any way about securing the border.\n\nWe did find, though, stories and opinion pieces mentioning prominent Texas Republicans\u2019 support in 2006 and 2007 for immigration reforms urged by President George W. Bush that included a guest-worker program. Congress failed to reach agreement on such a plan in September 2006.\n\nA McClatchy News Service news story June 2, 2007, said that different forms of the guest worker program had specified a maximum number of participants that ranged from 200,000 to 600,000 per year.\n\nWe also note that in May 2012, Dewhurst accused Cruz of supporting amnesty. Dewhurst got a Pants on Fire rating from us June 1, 2012, for his radio ad claiming his opponent helped steer two groups that led the national push for amnesty. Cruz was on the board of one group Dewhurst named -- the Hispanic Alliance for Prosperity Institute -- and that group wasn\u2019t even close to leading the drive for comprehensive immigration reform (possibly to include a limited path to legal residency).\n\nOur ruling\n\nDewhurst\u2019s 2007 speech advocates a guest-worker program for \"those here today illegally,\" a view he seems to have aired again in an interview a couple months later and one that he also has not forsworn, far as we can tell.\n\nSo, it can fairly be said Dewhurst advocated a guest-worker program for illegal immigrants already here.\n\nWould every single illegal immigrant be in the program, as Cruz says? As a practical matter, probably not, but Dewhurst\u2019s speech laid out no limits.\n\nHis speech did, however, cite the need for border security, and of late, Dewhurst has said secure borders should be ensured before a guest-worker program is implemented. This significant clarification isn\u2019t acknowledged in Cruz\u2019s claim, which we rate Mostly True.", "KRIV-TV Houston and King Street Patriots debate between Republican candidates for U.S. Senate, July 23, 2012,\n\nEmail interview with Lauren Thurston, deputy director of communications and director of constituent affairs, Office of Lt.
