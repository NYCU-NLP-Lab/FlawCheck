When you look at what\u2019s happening in the world, it\u2019s almost as if the world is going to hell in a handbasket. The president is on the verge of being accused of possible crimes where they\u2019re talking about impeachment, the stock market is collapsing today, but yet in Albany there seems to be an obsession with something that has been, in fact, a legislative practice for decades. And in fact when there was a question brought up about it, legal memos were presented and offered to the press to verify that was has been done has been consistent with legislative law and legislative practice for decades, the comptroller\u2019s office verified that that is in fact in legislative law and has been practiced for decades.
