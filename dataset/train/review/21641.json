Let us have the highest voter turnout in Democratic primary history in New York.\"", "We wondered whether it\u2019s accurate for Sanders to say he\u2019s won when turnout is high and lost when the turnout is low.\u00a0We didn\u2019t find a unified source that presents 2016 Democratic primary turnout rates on a state-by-state basis, so we created measurements that address two different ways of measuring turnout.
