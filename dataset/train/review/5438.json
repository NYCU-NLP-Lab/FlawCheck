["Amid accusations that President Donald Trump may have obstructed justice, conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh said President Barack Obama did the exact same thing.", "The New York Times and others have reported that back in February, Trump took FBI director James Comey aside and asked him to scale back the FBI\u2019s investigation into former White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and payments he received from foreign countries. Trump fired Comey several weeks later.", "Limbaugh said Obama took similar action during the FBI\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Other conservative outlets have mirrored this point.", "\"What Trump is alleged to have done is actually no different than what Barack Obama did in April last year when he made it known that he didn\u2019t want Hillary prosecuted,\" Limbaugh said on his show May 17. \"In fact, the Obama situation is actually worse.\"", "We reached out to Limbaugh but did not hear back.", "Limbaugh is likely referring to an interview Obama gave to Fox News Sunday\u2019s Chris Wallace in April 2016. During the interview, Obama\u00a0briefly discussed the ongoing FBI probe into Clinton\u2019s email use.", "Here is the key exchange between Obama and Wallace (read the full transcript here):", "Wallace: \"Can you still say flatly that she did not jeopardize America\u2019s secrets?\"", "Obama: \"I\u2019ve got to be careful because, as you know, there have been investigations, there are hearings, Congress is looking at this. And I haven\u2019t been sorting through each and every aspect of this.", "\"Here\u2019s what I know: Hillary Clinton was an outstanding secretary of state. She would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy. \u2026", "\"I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America\u2019s national security. Now what I\u2019ve also said is that \u2014 and she has acknowledged \u2014 that there\u2019s a carelessness, in terms of managing emails, that she has owned, and she recognizes.", "\"But I also think it is important to keep this in perspective. This is somebody who has served her country for four years as secretary of state, and did an outstanding job. And no one has suggested that in some ways, as a consequence of how she\u2019s handled emails, that that detracted from her excellent ability to carry out her duties.\"", "This interview and Trump\u2019s private conversation with Comey are not the same.", "Obama, speaking in a public setting, said he believed Clinton \"has not jeopardized America\u2019s national security.\" But he never said outright that the FBI should end its investigation, nor did he say Clinton was innocent. In fact, Obama acknowledged the ongoing FBI investigation.", "In contrast, reports by the New York Times\u00a0and others say Trump told the director of the FBI, explicitly and directly, what he hoped he would do regarding an ongoing investigation.", "According to the reports about Comey\u2019s memo of the private White House conversation with Trump, Trump said, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\"", "For the record, the White House denies the reports.", "There are clear differences between the situations.", "\"Obama was speaking to the press and expressing his confidence in the integrity of Secretary Clinton, which is not the same thing as asking the director of the FBI not to pursue an investigation,\" said Rebecca Lonergan, a University of Southern California law professor and former public corruption prosecutor.", "A reasonable person could critique Obama for offering his opinion on an ongoing investigation instead of saying \"no comment.\" Indeed, some legal commentators and conservative pundits accused Obama at the time of subtly putting his thumb on the scale.", "But legal scholars\u2019 reaction to Trump\u2019s reported actions has been much more robust. Trump\u2019s private meeting with Comey, coupled with Trump\u2019s decision to fire him, raises legitimate questions of impropriety.", "Peter Henning, a Wayne State University law professor and white collar crime expert, said he isn\u2019t convinced that Trump\u2019s actions count as obstruction of justice.", "(Obstruction of justice, presidential immunity, impeachment: What you need to know)", "But Obama\u2019s remarks \u2014 delivered in a public setting without addressing a particular agent, witness or other involved party \u2014 are much less significant, he said.", "\"The difference between them is (that Trump\u2019s actions are) probably enough to initiate an investigation,\" Henning said.", "Limbaugh\u2019s assertion misses another obvious point: Trump has gone beyond what Obama said about Clinton\u2019s ongoing investigation. Trump has repeatedly defended Flynn in media interviews and on Twitter, without expressing caution about ongoing probes.", "\"Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!\" he tweeted March 31.", "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!", "\"Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation,\" he said in a Feb. 16 press conference. \"He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given. He didn't have to do that because what he did wasn't wrong.\"", "Limbaugh said, \"What Trump is alleged to have done is actually no different than what Barack Obama did in April last year when he made it known that he didn\u2019t want Hillary prosecuted.\"", "Obama did say that he didn\u2019t believe Clinton harmed national security amid an ongoing FBI investigation into her email setup. But he never said she was innocent of all crimes, nor did he say the FBI should drop its investigation. And he made these remarks in an on-camera news interview, during which he made a point to distance himself from the investigation.", "Trump\u2019s situation is different: In a secret, one-on-one conversation, Trump explicitly told Comey that he hoped the FBI would back off from its Flynn investigation, according to reports. It may not have been an order, nor a clear example of obstruction of justice, but the exchange raises red flags.", "Limbaugh\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "Rush Limbaugh show, \"Obama Actually Did What Trump Is Accused of Doing,\" May 17, 2017", "New York Times, \"Comey Memo Says Trump Asked Him to End Flynn Investigation,\" May 16, 2017", "PolitiFact, \"Obstruction of justice, presidential immunity, impeachment: What you need to know,\" May 17, 2017", "Fox News, \"Exclusive: President Barack Obama on Fox News Sunday,\" April 10, 2016", "National Review, \"Under the Obama Precedent, No Trump Obstruction of Justice,\" May 17, 2017", "Email interview, USC law professor Rebecca Lonergan, May 17, 2017", "Phone interview, Wayne State law professor Peter Henning, May 17, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
