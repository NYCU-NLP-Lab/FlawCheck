But some others think it may understate the reach of the mandate by millions.", "But no one\u2019s sure just how many million. Let us explain.", "Here\u2019s how the mandate works: Starting in 2014 \u2014 now 2015 \u2014 employers with more than 50 full-time equivalent employees must offer affordable health coverage. If they don\u2019t offer coverage, or offer coverage that\u2019s too limited or too expensive, they\u2019ll likely end up on the hook for penalties (the government\u2019s calling them \"shared responsibility payments\") of about $2,000 per full-time employee, excluding the first 30.", "For the visual learners among you, the independent nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation summarized the mandate in this nifty infographic.", "The employer mandate\u2019s supposed to work hand-in-hand with the individual mandate that everybody \u2014 with a few exceptions \u2014 carry health insurance or pay a tax penalty. If employers don\u2019t offer coverage, their workers may seek it out on new insurance exchanges, where they may be eligible for tax credits.", "The employer penalties are designed to discourage dumping employees onto the exchanges, where they may drive up the cost of government subsidies. Or, barring that, to offset the cost of those subsidies. (The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in May, before the delay, that the penalties would be worth $10 billion in 2015.)", "But Menendez argued on Meet the Press that because the mandate applies only to larger companies, most of whom already offer insurance, the number of workers who would have been affected just isn\u2019t all that big. More specifically: about 1 percent of the American workforce.", "Let\u2019s talk about that calculation for a second.", "The size of the U.S. labor force, according to the government, is about 156 million.", "Menendez\u2019s sources estimated the mandate only affects about 1 million or 1.5 million workers \u2014 about 1 percent of 156 million.", "They focused only on the likely number of employees who work for the 5 percent of large firms that don\u2019t offer insurance, based on a widely respected employer survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "We know because we talked to them: Zeke Emanuel, a bioethicist, and Mark Duggan, a health economist, both scholars at the University of Pennsylvania who have advised the Obama administration.

It\u2019s in the range of Menendez\u2019s 1 percent.", "It\u2019s reasonable to assume that most of the companies with more than 50 employees that don\u2019t offer insurance are on the small side, they say, because the Kaiser research shows the larger the size of the firm, the more likely it is to offer insurance.", "Kaiser itself concludes that in 2012, 95 percent of employers with at least 50 workers offered insurance \u2014 and among firms of that size, 98 percent of employees worked for a company that offered coverage to at least some of its workers.", "Here\u2019s the criticism: What about the uninsured workers who work for companies that offer insurance?", "Duggan and Emanuel (and others, including Romneycare/Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber at MIT) say most of those folks wouldn\u2019t trigger the mandate, anyway: They\u2019re part-time or temporary workers that companies won\u2019t be required to insure.", "Other health economists we spoke with said: Not so fast. How do you know?", "Christopher Conover, who works for the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University, argues there are millions of uninsured workers who work for companies that offer insurance who may well qualify for employer coverage under Obamacare.", "He pointed to a recent example in the New York Times of a restaurant that would likely be subject to the employer mandate.

The problem is that no one\u2019s sure how many of those workers would be subject to the mandate \u2014 as opposed to part-time or temporary workers who don\u2019t qualify for employer insurance now, and wouldn\u2019t in 2015, either.", "But that number, even if it's millions more, remains a small percentage of the U.S. workforce.
