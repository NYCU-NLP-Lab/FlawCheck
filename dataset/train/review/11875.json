We thought we would start by checking whether McConnell is getting more contributions from lobbyists than anyone in Congress.", "Campaigns and candidates use \"lobbyists\" like a dirty word, but you may be asking, \"what exactly is a lobbyist?\" Glad you asked.", "Lobbyists are people who are hired to persuade members of Congress on a particular issue. They are brought in by many different industries, from private companies like Microsoft or ExxonMobil, to associations representing local governments, to nonprofits focused on hot-button legislation. Some organizations have in-house lobbyists, and others hire large firms that lobby Congress on a variety of topics.", "We first checked in with the Lundergan Grimes campaign to see where they got their numbers. They linked us to a report by Open Secrets, a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog website run by the Center for Responsive Politics.", "The report, titled \"Sincere or Strategic, Lobbyists Give Big,\" looked at trends in donations from federally registered lobbyists.

Contributions are not party exclusive; five of those 25 gave strictly to Republicans, 11 gave to Democrats and a handful gave to both.", "Open Secrets also released a list of the members of Congress who have received the most donations from lobbyists during the campaign cycle (since the start of 2013).", "With $281,301 in contributions from lobbyists, McConnell topped the list, followed closely by House Speaker John Boehner at $278,380.

Markey raised about\u00a0$306,000 from lobbyists between that special election and his 2014 re-election race, so he technically leads the cycle. A spokeswoman for Open Secrets said that when Lundergan Grimes made her statement, the organization had not yet updated their website with Markey\u2019s contributions. Markey's situation, though, is a quirky anomaly, because he was in the unusual position of running twice in one campaign cycle.", "McConnell isn\u2019t just the top congressional recipient of donations from lobbyists.

He was fourth in contributions from lobbyists.", "It\u2019s worth noting that in 2010 when Majority Leader Harry Reid was up for re-election, he benefited most from lobbyist contributions as well. With $947,000 in donations from lobbyists, Reid received nearly $300,000 more from lobbyists than the next closest lawmaker. So it\u2019s not uncommon for party leaders to receive significant financial backing during their re-election fights.", "For her part, Lundergan Grimes has received $54,699 from lobbyists, 51st among candidates running in 2014.", "Our ruling", "Lundergan Grimes said McConnell is \"the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle.\" Based on the analysis from Open Secrets, McConnell tops the chart for 2014. That\u2019s probably a perk of his party position more than anything.
