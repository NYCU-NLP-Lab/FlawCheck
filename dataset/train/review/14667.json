There's folks that are not in this chamber today because of that very issue,\" he told radio station WUSF\u2019s Health News Florida. \"People spoke in those districts, and we feel like Medicaid expansion isn\u2019t necessarily a very popular issue on the street.\"", "The Florida House and Senate are currently debating whether to expand the program to insure the very poor as part of contentious budget negotiations. Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, opposes Medicaid expansion and was speaking broadly about how discussing it had doomed some candidates\u2019 political ambitions. His office said he \"was speaking as a matter of his perspective.\"", "But we at PolitiFact Florida thought his statement can be verified or contradicted by public opinion polls.

Residents using the exchange would pay premiums and be required to either have a job or attend school. The House has not set forth a proposal of their own.", "Several polls over the years have looked at whether Floridians favor making the program larger. In 2013, three polls showed support for expansion as high as 62 or 63 percent, although one from the James Madison Institute was as low as 30 percent. One 2014 University of Florida poll put approval of expansion at 67 percent.", "That\u2019s a pretty wide range, but it likely had a lot to do with how the poll questions were worded, according to Alan Reifman, a Texas Tech University professor who specializes in social science research methodology.", "The James Madison Institute poll\u2019s question focused on how the state\u2019s budget would grow with a bigger Medicaid program, with no mention of how many Floridians would be covered or that the federal government would be paying the lion\u2019s share, Reifman said.", "A Public Policy Polling question that included state and federal costs, plus the number of people who would benefit through coverage and new jobs was \"probably the most balanced question-wording of those I\u2019ve seen,\" he said.

That poll found a 44-44 percent split between those who favored and opposed expansion.", "Partisan attitudes were more apparent when Let\u2019s Get to Work polled a sample of 500 Republican primary voters -- they opposed Medicaid expansion by 75 percent.", "Our ruling", "Crisafulli said, \"Medicaid expansion isn\u2019t necessarily a very popular issue on the street.\"", "He was speaking broadly about how constituents don\u2019t want the expansion.
