["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on October 9, 2020", "On the subject of President Donald Trump\u2019s COVID-19 diagnosis, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden misquoted Trump as saying, \u201cI probably got it from Blue Star parents.\u201d That\u2019s not what Trump said.", "In an Oct. 8 interview with Fox Business\u2019 Maria Bartiromo, Trump said he always assumed he might contract the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because as president, he has to meet with people and cannot always remain socially distanced. He mentioned a White House reception on Sept. 27 for the families of military veterans who died in action as one example.", "\u201cI meet a lot of people and I have to. I\u2019m the president of the country. I can\u2019t hang around in a basement,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo, I figured there would be a chance that I would catch it. Sometimes I\u2019d be with \u2014 in groups of \u2014 for instance, Gold Star families.\u201d", "\u201cI met with Gold Star families. I didn\u2019t want to cancel that. But they all came in and they all talked about their son and daughter and father. And they all came up to me and they tell me a story, Maria,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they tell me these stories and I can\u2019t say, \u2018Back up, stand 10 feet.\u2019 I just can\u2019t do it.\u201d", "Several new outlets, including CNN, the New York Times,\u00a0the Wall Street Journal\u00a0and the Military Times, wrote that what Trump said \u201cappears to blame\u201d those families, or \u201csuggests\u201d they were responsible for him testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this month.", "But Biden went beyond that characterization in his remarks later that day at a campaign event in the swing state of Arizona.", "After saying veterans \u201cdeserve better than a president who will say anything to deflect responsibility for any mistake he makes,\u201d Biden went on to say: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you noticed, he recently said that, they asked him where he got the COVID, he said, \u2018I probably got it from Blue Star parents.\u2019 They\u2019re people who lost a child in battle.\u201d", "Trump didn\u2019t say that.", "When Bartiromo actually asked Trump how he may have contracted the virus, he didn\u2019t provide a direct answer. He first talked about how Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis became infected even though they often wear face masks.", "\u201cYou catch this thing. It\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s particles of dust. It\u2019s tiny stuff,\u201d Trump said.", "\u201cNow, as far as the White House is concerned, somebody got in. There was a day of celebration with Notre Dame, et cetera, et cetera. Somebody got in and people got affected,\u201d he added, making an apparent reference to a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who teaches law at the university.", "At least 11 people who attended that event, including Trump, have since tested positive for the coronavirus.", "It wasn\u2019t until later in the interview, when Bartiromo again asked Trump about his condition and his symptoms, that Trump brought up the risk he takes when interacting with people he meets, including Gold Star families.", "(Biden mentioned Blue Star families, which are immediate family members of those who served during a time of conflict. But Gold Star families are immediate relatives of those who died while serving in a time of conflict.)", "Bartiromo, Oct: 8: And you said it was a blessing in disguise.", "Trump: A blessing in disguise. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m glad because I\u2019m the leader. And I can\u2019t be like Biden where I hang out in a basement every day. Sure, he \u2014 if I wanted to hang out in a basement, I wouldn\u2019t catch it, but I meet a lot of people and I have to. I\u2019m the president of the country. I can\u2019t hang around in a basement.", "So, I figured there would be a chance that I would catch it. Sometimes I\u2019d be with \u2014 in groups of \u2014 for instance Gold Star families. I met with Gold Star families. I didn\u2019t want to cancel that. But they all came in and they all talked about their son and daughter and father.", "And, you know, they all came up to me and they tell me a story, Maria. It was really amazing actually, beautiful but sad. And they come up and they tell me a story about my son, sir, was in Iraq or he was in Afghanistan. And sir, he did this and he did that and then he charged in order to save his friends.", "And yes, sir, he was killed but he saved his friends. He\u2019s so brave, sir. And they tell me these stories and I can\u2019t say, \u201cBack up, stand 10 feet.\u201d I just can\u2019t do it. And I went through like 35 people and everyone had a different story. I could also say don\u2019t tell stories. They\u2019re telling the story of their son who just died or daughter \u2014", "Bartiromo: Right.", "Trump: \u2014 or husband who just died in a war or recently died, you know, mostly over the last 10, 12 years but some very recent. And I can\u2019t back up, Maria, and say, \u201cGive me room, I want room. Give me 12 feet, stay 12 feet away when you talk.\u201d They come, they come, within an inch of my face sometimes.", "They want to hug me and they want to kiss me. And they do. And frankly, I\u2019m not telling them to back up. I\u2019m not doing it. But I did say it\u2019s like, you know \u2014 it\u2019s obviously dangerous. It\u2019s a dangerous thing I guess if you go by the COVID thing. But I\u2019m thinking \u2014", "Bartiromo: Yes.", "Trump: Look, I look at the numbers. I figured that you probably \u2014 that probably at some point I\u2019d catch it and I\u2019ll get better. That\u2019s what happened. I\u2019ve caught it.", "When later asked about Trump\u2019s remarks, a White House spokeswoman, Alyssa Farah, told reporters the president wasn\u2019t faulting Gold Star families.", "\u201cHis point was merely that in the time frame that he was potentially exposed, there were a number of different venues that he\u2019d been at and individuals he had interacted with that it could have come from \u2014 and by no means are blaming anyone who was present,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we did take a lot of precautions for that event. So based on contact tracing, the data we have, we don\u2019t think it arose from that event.\u201d", "None of the families who attended the reception have since tested positive for the virus or shown symptoms, according to news reports, although some had been photographed with the president.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0Swing State Watch\u00a0is an occasional series about false and misleading political messages in key states that will help decide the 2020 presidential election.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
