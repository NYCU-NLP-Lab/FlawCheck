Is it possible Pat Toomey earned less on Wall Street than Clinton did for a single speech there? We decided to find out.", "How much has Hillary made for her speeches?", "It\u2019s no secret Clinton has made a lot money from giving speeches, but most of the speeches that she\u2019s given were not to Wall Street banks.", "According to her 2014 tax return, 14 of the 41 speeches Clinton gave in 2013 were to Wall Street banks, and she was paid the same amount, $225,000, for most of them.", "But on Oct. 7, 2014, her Public Financial Disclosure Report report states that she gave a speech to Deutsche Bank and earned $260,000 for it. CNN compiled a list of all the amounts that the Clintons have earned for speaking to big banks from February 2001 to May 2015, and it reaffirms that amount for her Deutsche Bank speech.", "But Toomey\u2019s claim specifically refers to Wall Street.", "If Clinton made $260,000 in her most profitable speech to a Wall Street firm, then Toomey would have had to have made an average of about $43,000 during his six years on Wall Street for his claim to be true.", "The Rise of the Stock Market and the Traders in it", "Toomey worked on Wall Street from 1984 to 1990 for Chemical Bank and Morgan Grenfell. In a 1999 interview with Derivatives Strategy magazine, Toomey discussed the work he did at Morgan Grenfell, where he said he and a few others were recruited to start a \"serious derivatives operation.\"", "\"We were dealing in various currencies,\" said Toomey, \"all kinds of interest rate and currency-related derivatives\u2014options, swaps, forwards and so on.\"", "A report by the Los Angeles Times confirmed Toomey traded derivatives around interest rates and currencies.", "Again, when we asked the Toomey campaign if they could provide us with approximate salary figures for Toomey or Wall Street derivatives traders in the 1980s, we didn\u2019t receive a response. Luckily, there are some figures we can use as approximations.", "The derivatives market exploded during Toomey\u2019s time on Wall Street. In fact, the size of the global derivatives industry more than quintupled from 1986 to 1991. According to a report by Mother Jones, the notional value of derivatives contracts went from $865 billion to nearly $4.5 trillion.", "Salaries for Wall Street employees were not nearly as lucrative as they are today, but employees there were still among the highest-paid in the nation. A New York Times article from 1987 put the average salary on Wall Street that year at $65,000, before bonuses (which was more than three times the average New Yorker\u2019s salary of $19,000). That number included all Wall Street employees, from the highest-ranking positions to new analysts. According to the Derivatives magazine article, Toomey\u2019s position at Chemical Bank was \"associate,\" a position generally considered to be above entry level and often given to people with MBAs.", "Philip Bond, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Washington, said a salary of $43,000 was within the realm of possibility.", "\"I guess an average of $43,000 a year strikes me as being on the low side,\" said Bond, \u00a0\"But I don't think it is impossible. After talking to colleagues here, I believe the starting salary for an undergraduate on Wall Street would have been considerably less than $43,000 in 1985.\"", "However even in the 1980s, Wall Street traders generally earned significant bonuses along with their annual salaries. Former bonds salesman Michael Lewis wrote about how bonuses were determined in his bestselling book Liar\u2019s Poker.", "\"A salesman's year-end bonus was determined by traders,\" writes Lewis, \" A trader's bonus was determined by the profits on his trading books. A salesman had no purchase on a trader, while a trader had complete control over a salesman.\"", "Toomey doesn\u2019t appear to have been a bad trader. Morgan Grenfell hired him and other associates to start its derivatives operation in 1986, according to the Derivatives Strategy magazine article.", "If Toomey made significant profits as a derivatives trader, then he would likely have made a solid bonus along with his salary. Lewis, as he notes in Liar\u2019s Poker, made a bonus of $45,000 in his first year as a bonds salesman, matching his $45,000 salary that year. Lewis had a M.A. in economics when he entered Wall Street, while Toomey only had a B.A. in government.", "It is possible Toomey made an annual compensation of less than $43,000 per year, but that seems unlikely when we take a bonus into account.
