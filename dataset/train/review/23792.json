He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, 'There's no reason for this.' \"", "Trump drew criticism for the incident because his words neglect the fact that Jackson was a slave owner.", "TheRedShtick.com used an excerpt from a May 1 New York Times story about the flap, then went off on its own invented tangent.", "The post said Trump told their intern, Dave Robicheaux, that Col. Harland Sanders, the founder of the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant chain, was a \"tremendous Civil War hero.\"", "\"Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter,\" the post read.", "\"Robicheaux attempted to explain to Trump that Col. Sanders was born 25 years after the end of the war, that The Donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with a Biblical story about Jesus feeding the multitudes, and that Valley Forge was neither an encampment nor a battle site during the Civil War.\"", "It should be pretty obvious that this story is more than a bit contrived, starting with the name of the post\u2019s author, Manny Schewitz.
