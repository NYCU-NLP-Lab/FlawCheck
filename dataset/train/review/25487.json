["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on July 20, 2018", "Q: Did former FBI attorney Lisa Page tell House lawmakers that China, not Russia, was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee?", "A: There\u2019s no evidence of that. Page\u2019s attorney said stories making that claim are \u201ccompletely false\u201d and that Page testified that the \u201cevidence demonstrated Russian interference in the election.\u201d", "A former FBI attorney\u2019s recent testimony behind closed doors to lawmakers provided what some Republican representatives have described as new insight into two high-profile federal investigations: the one into Russian meddling in the 2016 election \u2014 and whether there was coordination with the Trump campaign \u2014 and the now-closed probe into\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.", "But that attorney, Lisa Page, did not provide a \u201crevelation\u201d that China, not Russia, was actually behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee computer network, according to her lawyer, who was present.", "Stories and social media posts parroting that claim spread widely this week \u2014 including on YouTube and Facebook \u2014 following Page\u2019s July 13 and July 16 interviews with members of the House Judiciary and House Oversight and Government Reform committees.", "A July 17 story on the website\u00a0True Pundit, citing unnamed \u201cfederal sources,\u201d purported that \u201cthe\u00a0embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed \u2018assets\u2019 had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s 30,000+ \u2018missing\u2019 emails.\u201d", "\u201cThe Russians didn\u2019t do it,\u201d said the story, which was shared thousands of times on social platforms. \u201cThe Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources,\u201d it added.", "The website\u00a0YourNewsWire.com\u00a0republished that story, topping it with: \u201cAccording to testimony\u00a0given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings, former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China, not Russia, hacked the DNC server.\u201d", "But Page didn\u2019t say that, according to her attorney, who was with Page during the private interviews.", "\u201cThese stories are completely false,\u201d Amy Jeffress said in a statement provided to FactCheck.org. \u201cIn nearly ten hours of testimony before the Committees, Lisa did not say a single word about China hacking the DNC server, and this conspiracy theory about the FBI instructing her to cover up such a story is nonsense. Her testimony was consistent with the intelligence community\u2019s unanimous assessment: the evidence demonstrated Russian interference in the election.\u201d", "It\u2019s possible Congress will release a transcript of the testimony.", "As Jeffress said, the false claim runs counter to what U.S. officials have found: that Russians interfered in the 2016 election, including by hacking the DNC computer network.", "The U.S.\u00a0Department of Justice last week indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers for their roles in the computer hacking. The department\u2019s July 13 press release\u00a0said the Russians \u201cengaged in a sustained effort to hack into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee, and the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, and released that information on the internet under the names \u2018DCLeaks\u2019 and \u2018Guccifer 2.0\u2019 and through another entity.\u201d", "A declassified intelligence report\u00a0published in 2017\u00a0by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence made the determination that \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d", "Those findings were also supported by a bipartisan review conducted by the Senate Intelligence Committee. A\u00a0summary of the committee\u2019s findings released in July called the 2017 report a \u201csound intelligence product.\u201d", "Page came to the attention of lawmakers after text messages exchanged between her and FBI agent Peter Strzok in 2016 were made public. The text messages, which were highly critical of then-candidate Trump, called into question the objectivity of Page and Strzok, both of whom had been assigned to the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation.", "Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III removed Strzok from the investigation in July 2017 after the texts were discovered during an internal investigation by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general. Page, on the other hand, worked on the investigation in a 45-day temporary position, and was no longer assisting in the Russia probe when the texts were brought to the attention of the special counsel and the deputy attorney general.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.", "\u201cA Review of Various Actions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice in Advance of the 2016 Election.\u201d Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Justice.
