["Atlanta officials had some explaining to do last month when an audit concluded the city mismanaged federal grants designed to combat crime in poor neighborhoods plagued by illegal drug activity.", "The city disagreed with some of the findings and noted that crime was down significantly in the neighborhoods the program was designed to help. Mayor Kasim Reed\u2019s Office of Communications put out a press release, noting the program had enjoyed some success.", "\"From 2009 to 2013, in the Pittsburgh and Mechanicsville neighborhoods, crime is down 42 and 35 points, respectively.

Did crime really drop by these percentages in those neighborhoods, as the city claimed?", "From 2007 to 2010, the city of Atlanta received slightly more than $1.1 million in U.S. Justice Department grants for its now-defunct Weed and Seed program. The Justice Department questioned the city\u2019s spending of nearly $400,000 in grant money.", "\"Weed\" is used to represent the campaign to weed out criminals and drug dealers while \"seed\" represents the effort to plant seeds of revitalization.", "\"Four elements make up the two-pronged Weed and Seed strategy,\" the Justice Department said in its report. \"Law enforcement; community policing; prevention, intervention, and treatment; and neighborhood restoration.\"", "The four neighborhoods that received help from the Weed and Seed program are located on the city\u2019s south side. Pittsburgh and Mechanicsville are located near Turner Field. English Avenue and Vine City are located near the Atlanta University Center and the Georgia Dome. All four neighborhoods have had trouble with crime, drug dealers and mortgage foreclosures.", "Carlos Campos, a spokesman for the city, agreed to assist PolitiFact Georgia when we questioned the crime numbers and asked for more details.", "Campos called us back a couple of days after our initial inquiry. He said the city\u2019s numbers in the press release were incorrect.
