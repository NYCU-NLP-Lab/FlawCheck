["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "A third-party group in the middle of an ultra-competitive Republican state Senate primary is continuing to make illegal immigration a centerpiece of the campaign.\n\nThe group, Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics, is targeting former state Rep. Aaron Bean for past votes. Bean is running for a Jacksonville-area seat against current state Rep. Mike Weinstein. Previously, we looked at the claim that Bean voted for \"in-state tuition breaks for illegal immigrants.\" We examined the facts and rated the claim Mostly True.\n\nFloridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics is doubling down with a different claim in a new TV ad, accusing \"Mr. Bean\" (a reference to the dimwitted British character played by comedian Rowan Atkinson, perhaps?) of voting to \"also give health care subsidies to illegal aliens\" in 2007.\n\nWe decided to see if the new attack has merit.\n\nAs evidence, the group cites HB 7189, a proposal considered during the 2007 legislative session about Florida KidCare,\u00a0which houses federal and state subsidized health care programs for children.\n\nThe goal of this bill was to fulfill a plan by now-U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who was Florida House speaker in 2007 and 2008, to expand access to health care coverage for children. (It was Idea No. 86 in his 2006 book 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida\u2019s Future.)\n\nHB 7189 would have allowed anyone who is under 19, a Florida resident and uninsured to be enrolled in KidCare. The bill made a number of administrative tweaks to ease the application process.\n\nMore pertinent to our fact-check, the bill would have expanded premium assistance\u00a0to two types of children, if the Legislature appropriated money for them: children of state employees, and \"noncitizens\" or \"not qualified aliens.\"\n\nThe inclusion of \"noncitizens\" and \"not qualified aliens\" is the basis of the claim from Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics.\n\nBut that\u2019s in error.\n\nNon-qualified aliens and noncitizens isn\u2019t code for \"illegal immigrant.\"\n\nStates commonly use the terms to refer to other noncitizens who are lawfully present in the U.S.", "Arizona\u2019s Medicaid administration agency, for instance, breaks down three groups of noncitizens like this: qualified aliens, undocumented aliens (aka illegal immigrants), and non-qualified aliens, who are admitted legally for a limited time and include foreign students, business visitors, and temporary workers on visas.\n\nRep. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, who sponsored the KidCare reform push in 2007 and is running for state Senate this year, told PolitiFact Florida the bill was not written to subsidize illegal immigrants\u2019 health insurance.\n\n\"Certainly the intent of the bill was not to expand KidCare to illegal aliens,\" Galvano said. \"The thrust of the bill was ultimately to lessen the fiscal impact on the taxpayer while at the same time providing health care to those in need.\"\n\nLike most bills, this legislation was written without the kind of detailed rulemaking delegated to state agencies. Had the bill become law, those rules might have been more explicit so that the subsidized premiums would not apply to illegal immigrants, though they are already banned under federal law from receiving government assistance.\n\nTo be fair to Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics, what \"noncitizens\" and \"not qualified legal aliens\" actually meant got lost on the Legislature as well.\n\nDuring debate on the House floor, Rep. Gayle Harrell, R-Port St. Lucie, introduced a late-filed, one-line amendment: \"The Florida Kidcare Program shall not provide premium assistance for enrollees who are illegal aliens.\"\n\nHer amendment spawned impassioned, and confused, debate, with some conservatives saying undocumented children should be eligible, too. \u00a0\"This is not about illegal children. It\u2019s not about legal children. It\u2019s about children in the state of Florida,\" said Rep. Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah, according to a couple news accounts.\n\nHarrell did not have the support needed to bring the amendment for a floor vote. The bill passed the House 98-14, with Bean and Rubio among conservatives voting in favor (Bean, then House Healthcare Council chairman, voted for it\u00a0in committee too). But drama over the amendment slowed the bill\u2019s momentum in the final days of session, and the Senate decided not to bring the proposal to a vote.\n\n\"Unfortunately, some people thought the bill would have impacted undocumented kids,\" said Karen Woodall, executive director of the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, who pushed for the bill in 2007. \"That whole debate -- while it was in my opinion morally correct and good -- it made it seem like it was going to impact those kids, and that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t pass in the Senate.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nFloridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics says Bean voted to give health care subsidies to illegal immigrants.\n\nThe group, however, misrepresents the bill\u2019s intent by saying \"not qualified legal aliens\" is the same as \"illegal immigrants.\" That\u2019s not true. The bottom line is HB 7189 -- which never passed -- would have applied to children legally allowed to be in the United States.\n\nWe rate the claim False.", "Department of State, Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics\u00a0tracking page\n\nFlorida Times-Union, \"Group hits Aaron Bean on immigrant tuition vote, drags Marco Rubio back to the issue,\" July 24, 2012\n\nFlorida Times-Union, \"Group backing Mike Weinstein says Aaron Bean lied in interview,\" July 26, 2012\n\nFlorida Times-Union, \"Immigration spat continues: Aaron Bean changes tune on tuition vote, did not support health subsidies for illegal aliens,\" Aug. 3, 2012\n\nHB 7189 committee analysis\n\nHB 7189\n\nHB 7189 floor vote, April 25, 2007\n\nInterview with Karen Woodall, executive director of the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, Aug. 8, 2012\n\n100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future, Marco Rubio, published in 2006\n\nPolitiFact Florida, \"Rubio claims 57 of his 100 ideas were made law by the Florida Legislature,\" Feb. 26, 2010\n\nTampa Bay Times, \"Despite pleas, KidCare is low priority,\" May 4, 2007 (accessed via Nexis)\n\nPalm Beach Post, \"House-approved KidCare plan would revamp, simplify process,\" April 26, 2007 (accessed via Nexis)\n\nMiami Herald, \"KidCare plan may die in the Senate,\" May 3, 2007 (accessed via Nexis)\n\nHouse Journal\u00a0for April 25, 2007\n\nFlorida KidCare website, eligibility requirements for non-citizens\n\nInterview with former Rep.
