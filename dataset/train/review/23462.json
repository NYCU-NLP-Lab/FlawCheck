["Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, an independent candidate for U.S. Senate, defends his departure from the Republican Party by criticizing the \"extreme views\" held by the GOP\u2019s right wing \u2014 and by extension his Republican rival, Marco Rubio.\n\nSo on Oct. 24, 2010, in their fifth debate of the campaign, Crist strove to paint Rubio as a rigid idealogue who wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade and didn\u2019t support stem cell research. Then he turned it up a notch, saying Rubio had said that folks who didn\u2019t agree with him ought to leave the country.\n\n\"You know, these are extreme views that I am not comfortable with,\" Crist said. \"(Rubio) took it to a point so much so that (he) said that, you know, people who essentially don't agree with him, ought to leave the country, like Keith Olbermann.\"\n\nCould it be true?\n\nCrist campaign spokesman Danny Kanner pointed us to a Palm Beach Post story from March 2010 about a Rubio campaign stop in West Palm Beach. The story ended this way:", "Rubio also said he was against amnesty for immigrants, believing legal immigration will never work if illegal immigrants are granted amnesty.", "Then, he closed the speech with a thought he said originated from Glenn Beck, FOX News' popular conservative talk show host.", "\"There are millions of people in America that hate our country, so why can't we just do a trade?\" Rubio said. \"We'll send you Sean Penn, Janeane Garofalo and Keith Olbermann, and you can send us people that actually love this country and want to help us build it.\"", "The story prompted this impassioned response from the MSNBC host: \"You have inadvertently revealed that you don't see those with other viewpoints as merely disagreeing with you. You have inadvertently revealed \u00a0that you dismiss them as not loving this country.\"\n\nSunday morning, Rubio\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t flinch.\n\nSpokesman Alex Burgos offered this quick response from his BlackBerry after the debate: \"It's true what Marco said, and we appreciate the governor bringing it up.\"\n\nGiven the evidence, and both sides\u2019 endorsement of it, we rate Crist\u2019s statement True.", "CNN \"State of the Union\" transcript, accessed Oct. 24, 2010\n\nPalm Beach Post, \"Rubio says Obama's offshore drilling proposal \u2018right decision for country,\u2019\" March 31, 2010\n\nE-mail from Crist campaign spokesman Danny Kanner, Oct. 24, 2010\n\nPalm Beach Post blog, \"Keith Olbermann Rips Rubio for Comments in West Palm Beach,\" April 1, 2010\n\nE-mail from Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Burgos, Oct. 24, 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
