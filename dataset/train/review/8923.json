They can. Congress\u2019 action just makes this explicitly legal.", "An ISP\u2019s function is to connect its users to websites or online apps, and so it can see nearly everything its users do on the Internet, including what kind of underwear they buy. An advertiser might be interested in purchasing that information from an ISP because then it can predict whether a given user is more likely to respond to an ad for boxers, briefs or tighty-whities.", "Beyond shopping habits, ISPs and advertisers can glean more significant personal information about their customers from Internet browsing patterns \u2014 like that\u00a0a spouse is contemplating divorce because he looked up \"best divorce lawyers in my area,\" or that a person has a chronic medical condition because she spent a long time reading certain pages on WebMD.", "In October 2016, the FCC established rules intended to give consumers more control over how ISPs used their data. The rules required ISPs to obtain explicit information from their customers before using and sharing their web browsing history, which would include underwear purchases.", "The rule also required the ISPs to get consent before sharing other \"sensitive information,\" like Social Security numbers, precise geolocation data and financial or health information. Many Internet companies and trade associations had already committed to requiring consumers to opt-in before they can share that sort of information, per guidance from the Federal Trade Commission.", "But these opt-in rules never went into effect; Congress killed them in March 2017, months before the December 2017 start date.

This, combined with Congress\u2019 reversal of the FCC rules, might encourage ISPs to expand their role in online advertising, said Peter Swire, a professor at Georgia Tech and the chief counselor for privacy during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration.", "\"There\u2019s a lot of online advertising today,\" Swire said. \"Now the big broadband companies will play more actively in that space.\"", "Those who supported gutting the FCC rules argue that the regulations put ISPs at a disadvantage compared to other Internet companies, like search engines or social media sites, that already sell users\u2019 data without first getting permission. They also say the rules stifle technology innovation.", "Privacy advocates, however, say that ISPs have an especially large window into its users Internet habits, and this rule could have opened up the possibility of beginning to enact privacy regulations on other web-based companies.", "\"This is troublesome because of the larger question: Is privacy opt in or opt out?\" said Jamie Winterton, director of strategy for Arizona State University\u2019s Global Security Initiative. \"Can your browser behaviors be bought and sold?\"", "Privacy protections", "Though they can see a lot, there are limitations to what ISPs can see.", "Some websites use encryption, so the ISP can see the domain name but not the exact page on that website the user is browsing. A website is encrypted if the address starts with \"https\" not \"http.\" For example, if a web user visit the Macy\u2019s website, which is encrypted, their ISP will know they\u2019re browsing the Macy\u2019s website, but it won\u2019t know if they\u2019re shopping for underwear, a prom dress or bedding. (The article you\u2019re currently reading is not encrypted.)", "However, if someone visits MeUndies.com right after visiting VictoriasSecret.com \u2014 both encrypted \u2014 an advertiser can probably make an educated guess that the person is in the market for some underwear. There are many more sophisticated ways an ISP or third party can glean information about a user even when the data is encrypted.", "Regardless, most ecommerce sites remain unencrypted, Swire said.", "An Internet user who really does not want an ISP tracking any of their data can use a Virtual Private Network, which, put simply, is a way to scramble all Internet traffic so the ISP and potential hackers can\u2019t get at it.
