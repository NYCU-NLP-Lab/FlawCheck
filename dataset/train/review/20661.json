["A three year-old YouTube video resurfaced on July 25, when the Facebook page \u201cJustin Trudeau Not\u201d posted it alongside the caption: \u201cTrudeau directs 2 billion from Canada Pension Fund to Mumbai.\u201d", "The video was also shared thousands of times via this 2016 article from the Cultural Action Party of Canada. According to data from CrowdTangle, that article was reposted in multiple Canadian Facebook groups in July 2019.", "In the video, a man donning a t-shirt supporting a Conservative member of parliament claims that Trudeau took $2\u00a0billion from Canadian citizens\u2019 retirement savings in order to fund housing projects in the Indian city of Mumbai.", "Based on the comments, several Facebook users understood that the Canadian prime minister stole the money from the pension fund in order to give it to India as a form of grant, as comments such as \u201che should go to jail until he pays it all back,\u201d suggest.", "The claims made in the video are based on a 2016 Reuters article published on the CBC website citing a statement from the chief minister of Mumbai\u2019s state of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis. Fadnavis told reporters, \u201cA week back, the Canadian ambassador \u2026 informed me that the Canadian pension fund is ready to invest $2 billion in Mumbai for affordable housing.\u201d", "\u201cEverything about that is totally not true,\u201d Darryl Konenbelt, director of media relations for the CPPIB, told AFP. \u201cThat alleged $2 billion in housing is not true.\u201d", "AFP contacted the High Commission of Canada in India to verify if High Commissioner Nadir Patal has spoken with Fandavis, but it had not answered by the time of publication.", "The CPPIB is an independent institution in charge of investing funds from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Canada\u2019s federal retirement scheme. The CPPIB manages the retirement savings of 20 million contributors, nearly all working individuals in Canada, outside Quebec, which has its own pension plan.", "CPPIB began to invest in India in 2009. In April 2019, Alain Carrier, CPPIB head of international, said in an interview that the investment board had invested Can$8.2 billion in the subcontinent, representing about 2 percent of the fund\u2019s global exposure. India is one of 52 countries in which the CPP funds are invested, far behind the United States, the main recipient with Can$131.2 billion. The fund also invests Can$60.9 billion in Canada.", "Since the CPPIB manages public funds, most holdings and investments can be consulted online here. The Real Estate portfolio shows only two companies in India: Indospace Industrial and Phoenix Mills Limited. The former creates industrial and warehouse parks throughout India, while the latter builds \u201cretail-led mixed-use\u201d properties in Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore and Chennai, according to their respective websites.", "CPPIB staff did not wish to provide AFP with any further statements on the subject of the board\u2019s investments in India.", "The claim that Trudeau influenced CPPIB investment decisions is false. Although the CPP is the country\u2019s public pension, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act guarantees CPPIB\u2019s autonomy from the government.", "CPPIB\u2019s twelve board directors are approved by the minister of finance. However, \u201cpoliticians have absolutely no influence on CPPIB\u2019s investment decisions,\u201d Keith Ambachtsheer, director emeritus of the International Centre for Pension Management told AFP in an email. \u201cIf any CPPIB board member is contacted by a politician on any investment matter, the Board member MUST report the encounter immediately,\u201d he added.", "The CPPIB\u2019s web page also states that, \u201cthe assets of the fund are managed in the best interest of the Canadian contributors and beneficiaries who participate in the Canada Pension Plan. These assets are strictly segregated from government funds.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
