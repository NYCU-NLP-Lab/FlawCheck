["About this rating", "On 25 April 2017 the unreliable web site USA Politics Today claimed former President Bill Clinton was on his deathbed, and that arrangements were being made for his purportedly imminent demise:", "Sources close to the Clinton family say that Slick Willy, 40th President of the United States and perpetual cheater, will be lucky to make it through the end of the week.

As of 20 April 2017, he was in good spirits at an award ceremony and a restaurant in lower Manhattan. The former President is also slated to speak at an Emory University gala in late April 2017, an even that would likely be canceled if he was inches from death in Arkansas.
