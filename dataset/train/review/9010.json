["By Sydney Nixon", "Posted on February 26, 2021", "A computer-rendered image has been mischaracterized on social media posts as a photo taken from Mars, purportedly showing Earth, Venus and Jupiter in vertical alignment. Although the same image was previously debunked in 2012, the claim resurfaced after the Perseverance rover landed on Mars in mid-February.", "Perseverance, the NASA rover, landed on Mars on Feb. 18. As part of NASA\u2019s multibillion-dollar Mars 2020 mission, Perseverance has been tasked with seeking out \u201csigns of ancient life\u201d and bringing back samples of rock and soil.", "Within minutes of landing, Perseverance produced two low-resolution images of the Martian surface. These images sparked a burst of viral posts on Facebook regarding other sights \u2014 mostly in jest \u2014 showing a McDonald\u2019s and a Dollar General store on the Mars landscape.", "On Feb. 21, a Facebook account called AstrophileDaily.com \u2014 which says it is \u201cdedicated to sharing latest news in science, especially astronomy, physics and technology\u201d \u2014 shared this image, which it claims to depict \u201cEarth, Venus and Jupiter as seen from Mars.\u201d The post has since amassed nearly 2,000 shares, and 3,000 reactions.", "But the image and description are deceiving and did not come from the Mars Perseverance mission.", "Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer at The Franklin Institute, told us in an email that the photo was \u201cmost likely generated from a desktop planetarium program.\u201d", "He also directed us to an article from 2012 in Discover Magazine\u00a0titled \u201cAn unreal Mars skyline.\u201d", "When NASA\u2019s earlier rover, Curiosity, landed on Mars in August 2012, the same image of Earth, Venus and Jupiter began orbiting on social media. Discover debunked claims about the image, noting various clues that it wasn\u2019t authentic, including the \u201crendered by software\u201d colors of the sky and landscape.", "The article\u2019s author, Phil Plait, wrote: \u201cI have a lot of experience looking at space images, and you just get a sense of what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t. This one screams fake.\u201d", "The final giveaway is the tiny \u201cNE,\u201d as in northeast, on the lower left corner of the image. Images rendered by planetarium software programs, like Starry Night and SkySafari, include coordinates along the horizon to contextualize the user\u2019s point-of-view, Plait said.", "The article concluded, \u201cthe picture itself isn\u2019t a hoax! It\u2019s just a computer generated image probably meant to represent a real scene.\u201d", "Actual images of Mars from Perseverance are easy to view on the NASA website. See one below:", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
