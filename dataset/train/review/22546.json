["As stimulus payments began showing up in bank accounts this week, some social media users wondered whether those experiencing homelessness also should benefit from direct payments of as much as $1,400.", "Model and activist Hamdia Ahmed\u2019s post on Twitter about the topic on March 15 had nearly 170,000 retweets as of March 17. A viral Facebook post shows a screenshot of an exchange where one user tells another that homeless people are eligible.", "\u201cI wish all homeless people got the $1,400 too,\u201d the user had written.", "As others have pointed out to the user, homeless people are eligible. But they might need to take extra steps to be able to access the funds if they have not filed tax returns or other paperwork to receive payments in the previous two rounds of direct payments.", "Neither the user who shared the Facebook post nor the original poster responded to a request for comment.", "President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law on March 11. The $1.9 trillion law included direct payments of up to $1,400 for eligible Americans, plus $1,400 for each dependent child, with a phase out for higher earners.", "Nothing in the law disqualifies someone who is homeless from receiving the stimulus payment.", "\u201cThey are certainly eligible,\u201d said Donald Whitehead, executive director for the National Coalition for the Homeless.", "The Internal Revenue Service is \u201cworking aggressively with partner groups inside and outside the tax community to help as many people, including those in the homeless community, receive the stimulus payments as possible,\u201d IRS spokeswoman Jodie Reynolds said in an email to USA TODAY.", "Homeless people were eligible for two rounds of stimulus payments in 2020, as well.", "\u201cAssuming that the person who is homeless or unsheltered has an income below the income threshold, they are eligible,\u201d Laura Scherler,\u00a0senior director of economic mobility for the United Way, told USA TODAY.", "In 2020, the IRS offered a tool for those who did not file a tax return to apply for the payment. Most people whose income is under $12,400,\u00a0and married couples with income less than $24,800,\u00a0are not typically required to file a return.", "Anyone who filed a return previously or used the nonfilers tool automatically will get the most recent stimulus payment automatically, Reynolds said.", "Others must file a 2020 tax return, even if they are not required to under income guidelines, to get the third payment, she said. That also will give them the option to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit if they did not receive the first two stimulus payments.", "A search tool on the IRS website can tell people whether their payment already is on the way.", "Anyone who earned $72,000 or less is eligible to file a federal return for free on the IRS website, which also will give the option to claim the credit for the previous two stimulus rounds.", "The IRS also offers a search tool to find free tax preparation services from volunteers for those who earn $57,000 or less, people with disabilities, those who speak limited English and for those age 60 and older.", "For people without access to the Internet or a smartphone, Scherler said the 211 community services hotline also can refer people to free tax preparation services, and United Way has set up a hotline to answer questions about the stimulus at 866-698-9435.", "Individuals who want to file a return also will need identification, she said. The 211 hotline also can connect those people with services that can help them get identification.", "Individuals for whom the IRS has bank information on file will receive their payments through direct deposit.", "The IRS is working with other federal agencies, including the FDIC, to help those without a bank account receive the payments, Reynolds said. The FDIC launched a website with information about how to open a bank account online.", "For those who receive Social Security retirement, survivor or disability benefits, railroad retirement benefits, supplemental security income or Veterans Affairs benefits, payments could be deposited directly onto cards associated with those programs.", "Stimulus payments also can be mailed via check or added to a prepaid debit card. Scherler said many organizations that serve unsheltered and homeless people allow them to use the organization\u2019s address to receive benefits.", "The claim that people experiencing homelessness are eligible for the $1,400 stimulus in the latest COVID-19 relief legislation is TRUE. While homeless people are eligible, they must file a 2020 federal income tax return if they did not file a return last year or complete a non-filer form the IRS provided.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
