Gretchen Whitmer, investigators said \u2014 surprising news that generated wide national coverage at a time when fears of civil unrest are already in the spotlight.", "But some social media claims suggest that journalists lost interest in this headline-grabbing case after they discovered the suspects were sympathetic to Black Lives Matter and antifa. Antifa, which stands for \"anti-fascist,\" is a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists that\u2019s been around for decades.", "\"Notice how the Whitmer kidnapping story disappeared after we found out the perps were ANTIFA and BLM anarchists,\" one post says.", "\"13 Antifa members arrested for plotting to kidnap a governor,\" another post says. \"13 Antifa members ARRESTED for trying to KIDNAP Gov.

However, there is no evidence that the kidnapping suspects are antifa activists. And we found that of what is now a total of 14 suspects, only one is known to have attended a Black Lives Matter protest. Another suspect criticized the movement.", "On Oct. 9, the day after the kidnapping plot was disclosed to the public, the New York Times published a story titled, \"What we know about the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan\u2019s governor.\"", "The article doesn\u2019t mention Black Lives Matter or antifa, except for a reference to a tweet from President Donald Trump, who, criticizing Whitmer, said Democrats \"refuse to condemn Antifa, Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities.\"", "The FBI named Adam Fox was the leader of the kidnapping plot. Fox reached out to members of an anti-government group known as the Wolverine Watchmen for help, according to the Times.", "Seven members of the Wolverine Watchmen were arrested and state authorities accused them of threatening to start a civil war and collecting the addresses of police officers to target them.", "In addition to Fox, the names of the other men facing federal charges are Kaleb Franks, Brandon Caserta, Ty Garbin, Daniel Harris and Barry Croft.", "The federal criminal complaint against these men frequently references a Michigan based \"militia group.\" It does not mention antifa or Black Lives Matter.", "The names of the men charged by the state are Paul Bellar, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison. The state later arrested an eighth man: Brian Higgins.", "The state affidavit in support of the criminal complaint against these men does not mention antifa or Black Lives Matter either.

Antifa activists tend to include communists, socialists and anarchists who protest against white supremacy and other far-right causes. Experts say that while they sometimes turn violent, the bulk of antifa organizing is nonviolent.", "Many militia members are opposed to racism, Cooter said, and they expressed genuine outrage over the death of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis in May after a police officer pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck.
