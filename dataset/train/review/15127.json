["By Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley, Lori Robertson, Jessica McDonald and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on October 22, 2019", "For more than an hour, President Donald Trump presided over a cabinet meeting, reeling off numerous false or misleading claims:", "Trump made his remarks during an Oct. 21 cabinet meeting, which started \u2014 after a prayer from Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson \u2014 with the president talking about the U.S. economy, which he described as doing \u201cfantastically well.\u201d (See \u201cTrump\u2019s Numbers October 2019 Update\u201d for a statistical measure of how things have changed since Trump took office.)", "Trump claimed, without evidence, that President Barack Obama tried to call North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u201c11 times,\u201d but Kim \u201cdid not take his call.\u201d", "Trump, Oct. 21: I like Kim; he likes me. We get along. I respect him; he respects me. You could end up in a war. President Obama told me that. He said, \u201cThe biggest problem \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to solve it.\u201d He told me doesn\u2019t know how to solve it. I said, \u201cDid you ever call him?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Actually, he tried 11 times. But the man on the other side \u2014 the gentleman on the side did not take his call. Okay? Lack of respect. But he takes my call.", "Obama\u2019s national security adviser and deputy national security adviser both called Trump\u2019s claim false.", "Susan Rice, who served under Obama as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 2009 to 2013 and as Obama\u2019s national security adviser from 2013 to 2017, tweeted that Trump\u2019s claim is \u201ca total fabrication.\u201d She added, \u201cTrump is completely delusional, and it\u2019s scary.\u201d", "Likewise, Ben Rhodes, who served as Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, tweeted, \u201cObama never called Kim Jong Un. Obama never tried to meet Kim Jong Un. Trump is a serial liar and not well.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s claim is similar to one we fact-checked back in July. Then, Trump said Obama was \u201cconstantly \u2026 begging for meetings\u201d but that Kim Jong Un refused. As we wrote then, Obama administration officials and experts on U.S.-North Korea relations said that\u2019s not true.", "\u201cAt the risk of stating the obvious, this is horse-sh*t,\u201d Rice tweeted then. \u201cYes. It\u2019s horseshit,\u201d added Gen. Michael Hayden, via Twitter.\u00a0Hayden served as director of the CIA from 2006 to Feb. 12, 2009, shortly after Obama took office.", "Trump praised his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, saying the subsequent fighting that resulted between Turkey and the Syrian Kurds sparked a \u201cdeal\u201d that he claimed \u201cpeople have been trying to make\u201d for years.", "Trump, Oct. 21:\u00a0If shooting didn\u2019t start for a couple of days, I don\u2019t think the Kurds would have moved. I don\u2019t think, frankly, you would\u2019ve been able to make a very easy deal with Turkey. \u2026 If they didn\u2019t go through two and a half days of hell, I don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve done it. I think you couldn\u2019t have made a deal. And people have been trying to make this deal for years. But we\u2019re close to making it. We\u2019ll see what happens.", "Henri Barkey, a professor of international relations at Lehigh University and adjunct senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, called Trump\u2019s claim of failed past attempts to broker such a deal \u201ccomplete nonsense.\u201d", "\u201cThere is no effort of any sorts in the past between Turkey and Syrian Kurds,\u201d Barkey told us in an email. \u201cHe is making things up.\u201d", "On Oct. 6, the White House\u00a0announced\u00a0it would withdraw U.S. special forces in northern Syria and that Turkey would soon move \u201cforward with its long-planned [military] operation\u201d against the Syrian Kurds, who had been U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State. Three days later, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00a0started\u00a0\u201cOperation Peace Spring,\u201d resulting in\u00a0dozens of deaths\u00a0of civilians and Kurdish fighters.", "After\u00a0bipartisan criticism,\u00a0Trump sent Vice President Mike Pence to meet with Erdogan in Ankara, Turkey, where on Oct. 17 they\u00a0announced\u00a0a five-day pause in the Turkish military operation to \u201callow for the withdrawal of YPG\u201d from \u201cthe nearly 20-mile-wide safe zone area, south of the Turkish border in Syria.\u201d The People\u2019s Protection Units, or the YPG, is the armed wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party.", "Turkey does have a long history of conflict with the Kurds, but direct Turkish involvement in northern Syria dates only to 2016. In August 2016, Turkey began Operation Euphrates Shield in northern Syria to clear the area of Islamic State terrorists and \u201cprevent the YPG from establishing an autonomous area along the northern Syrian border with Turkey,\u201d as explained in a\u00a0January Congressional Research Service report.", "Turkey felt threatened by the Syrian Kurds on its border. The Kurds were hoping for support from their allies in Washington, D.C. \u201cSyrian Kurds wanted political recognition from DC,\u201d and \u201cdown the road support for their autonomous state\u201d in northern Syria, Barkey said.", "Trump falsely said that \u201cnobody has ever done\u201d a National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, an event in which Americans can safely dispose of unused prescription drugs. The Drug Enforcement Administration began holding such national events in 2010.", "Trump\u2019s claim followed a briefing from White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on an upcoming take-back day on Oct. 26. After thanking Conway, he said, \u201cTake Back Day is a big deal. And they\u2019ve been talking about it for a long time. Nobody has ever done it. But it is big.\u201d", "The scheduled take back day, however, will not be the first, nor was the first national take back under Trump\u2019s watch.", "The initiative launched under Obama in 2010, with the primary aim of reducing misuse of old prescription drugs. The DEA has since organized two events each year \u2014 one in the spring and one in the fall \u2014 to encourage people to get rid of drugs lingering in their medicine cabinets. The most recent one was in April; Saturday\u2019s take back will be the 18th event.", "At the April 2016 event, the DEA collected a then-record 893,498 pounds of unwanted medicines. A new record was set two years later with 949,046 pounds. So far, across all 17 completed events, the DEA has collected nearly 12 million pounds of drugs.", "During a take back, people can drop off their expired, unused or unwanted medications anonymously and for free \u2014 no questions asked \u2014 at a variety of locations across the country. This year, for the first time, the DEA will accept vaping devices and cartridges, in light of the recent spate of deaths and lung injuries linked to those products.", "This isn\u2019t the first time that Trump has falsely taken credit for launching a new program.", "Last October, he took credit for the Veterans Choice Program, which allows veterans to seek health care outside of the VA if there are long wait times or travel burdens, and falsely added that it had taken \u201c44 years\u201d to pass the legislation. In fact, the program was created in 2014 under Obama. And in July 2018, Trump inaccurately said that prior to a law he signed in 2017, there was \u201cnothing you could do\u201d to get rid of VA employees who mistreat military veterans. On average, around 2,300 VA workers were fired each fiscal year before Trump\u2019s legislation going back to 2005.", "In remarks about the ongoing House impeachment inquiry, Trump wrongly claimed that \u201cmany\u201d of the \u201cambassadors\u201d Democratic-controlled House committees are interviewing were \u201cput there during Obama, during Clinton, during the Never Trump or Bush era.\u201d", "Actually, among the nine government officials who have testified in closed sessions so far, just two were appointed to their current or recently resigned positions under the Obama administration. The other seven were appointed by Trump or Trump appointees, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.", "Trump, Oct. 21: They\u2019re interviewing \u2014 they\u2019re interviewing ambassadors who I\u2019d never heard of. I don\u2019t know who these people are. I never heard of them. \u2026 Don\u2019t forget, many of these people were put there during Obama, during Clinton, during the Never Trump or Bush era.", "Let\u2019s go through the list:", "That list doesn\u2019t include Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, a Trump appointee, who publicly testified before the House intelligence committee on Sept. 26.", "Trump also made the illogical claim that there was no informant who provided information to the whistleblower. And even more absurdly, Trump suggested the informant was Rep. Adam Schiff.", "Trump said the whistleblower relied on \u201csecond- and thirdhand information\u201d and Trump questioned the very existence of an informant who told the whistleblower about the content of Trump\u2019s July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "Trump, Oct. 21: Now, I happen to think there probably wasn\u2019t an informant. You know, the informant went to the whistleblower, the whistleblower had second- and thirdhand information. You remember that. It was a big problem. But the information was wrong. So was there actually an informant? Maybe the informant was Schiff. It could be Shifty Schiff. In my opinion, it\u2019s possibly Schiff.", "Later, in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, Trump reiterated his groundless theory.", "Trump, Oct. 21: And where is the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because is that person a spy? Or does that person even exist? I have a feeling that person doesn\u2019t exist. I think Schiff might\u2019ve made it up.", "Let\u2019s quickly deconstruct why Trump\u2019s theory makes no sense.", "Despite Trump repeatedly claiming that the whistleblower \u201cgave a totally false account of my conversation\u201d with the Ukrainian president, as we have written, the whistleblower\u2019s account of the phone call matches up with the White House-released memo. (Though the president takes issue with the whistleblower\u2019s allegation that he \u201cpressured\u201d Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.)", "Specifically, the whistleblower made these three claims that were corroborated by the memo: Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cinitiate or continue an investigation\u201d into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden; assist the U.S. in investigating allegations that \u201cRussian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine\u201d; and \u201cmeet or speak\u201d about these matters with Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.", "The whistleblower, described by the New York Times as a CIA officer who was detailed to the National Security Council, wrote in his complaint that while he did not participate in Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukraine president, \u201cin the course of official interagency business\u201d he was informed about details of the phone call by \u201cmultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\u201d", "The intelligence community\u2019s inspector general conducted a preliminary review of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and determined there were \u201creasonable grounds to believe that the complaint relating to the urgent concern \u2018appears credible.'\u201d Fox News reported that during the closed-door testimony of Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson to House lawmakers, it was revealed that the preliminary investigation included interviews with a handful of witnesses, including two of the whistleblower\u2019s supervisors.", "Since then, the New York Times reported that a second whistleblower, one with firsthand knowledge of the phone call, has stepped forward and was interviewed by Atkinson\u2019s office.", "Given that the original whistleblower did not participate directly in the Ukraine phone call, and yet got key details about it correct, it stands to reason he was provided that information by an informant.", "As for Trump\u2019s theory that the informant might be Schiff, that makes no sense. As we wrote, Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, wrongly implied that his committee had no contact with the whistleblower before receiving the complaint, when the whistleblower had in fact reached out to a committee aide before filing a complaint. Trump has speculated that Schiff \u201cprobably helped write\u201d the complaint, but there\u2019s no evidence of that, and a spokesman for Schiff and the House intelligence committee said in a statement, \u201cAt no point did the Committee review or receive the complaint in advance.\u201d", "But Schiff did not participate in the phone call, and therefore could not have provided details to the whistleblower about it, at least not unless Schiff was debriefed on the call by \u2014 an informant.", "Trump does indeed donate his salary, which we\u2019ve written about before, but he was wrong when he said \u201cno other president has done it.\u201d", "Trump, Oct. 21: I give away my salary. It\u2019s, I guess, close to $450,000. I give it away. Nobody ever said he gives away his salary.\u00a0 \u2026 They say that no other president has done it. \u2026 They think George Washington did, but they say no other.", "Trump\u2019s annual salary is $400,000, and the press has covered the quarterly announcements on which government programs would be receiving Trump\u2019s donated salary.", "But John F. Kennedy also donated his salary in 1961, according to a Nov. 14, 1962, news article that attributed that information to the Minneapolis Tribune and Des Moines Register. The article said Kennedy was following the practice of Herbert Hoover, who \u201cbanked his presidential salary and gave it entirely to charity,\u201d according to the Hoover presidential library.", "Snopes.com wrote about this issue before Trump took office, noting that in Washington\u2019s case, according to one book, he did refuse the salary at first but then accepted it at Congress\u2019 urging.", "In his book, \u201cGeorge Washington\u2019s 1791 Southern Tour,\u201d Warren L. Bingham wrote: \u201cAt first, Washington refused the salary, but Congress insisted on the principle, on which Washington also agreed, that the presidency should not be reserved for only those wealthy enough to work for free.\u201d", "In defending his decision to host the 2020 G-7 at his Doral golf resort in Miami \u2014 and his subsequent reversal\u00a0in the face of criticism \u2014 Trump claimed that other presidents \u201cran their business\u201d while in office, citing Obama\u2019s book and Netflix deals. But the book, reportedly a memoir on his presidency, and Netflix collaboration were announced after Obama left office.", "Trump, Oct. 21: Hey, Obama made a deal for a book. Is that running a business? I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t even discuss it while he was President. Oh, yeah. He has a deal with Netflix. When did they start talking about that? That\u2019s only, you know, a couple of examples.", "Penguin Random House announced on Feb. 28, 2017, a month after Obama left office, that it would publish books both by the former president and former First Lady Michelle Obama. The deal is reportedly worth about $65 million. Netflix announced a production deal with the Obamas in May 2018.", "Trump also overlooks the fact that hosting the G-7 at Doral was akin to awarding a government contract to himself and accepting payments from foreign governments.", "Trump made several claims about China\u2019s economy, and some of them were inaccurate.", "First, Trump said, \u201cChina is doing very poorly \u2014 worst year they\u2019ve had in 57 years.\u201d Later, he claimed, \u201cthey announced that they have the worst numbers they\u2019ve had in 20 years.\u201d He was closer to being accurate the second time.", "\u201cThey announced six,\u201d Trump said, referring to China\u2019s growth in its real gross domestic product.", "Most recently, China announced its economy grew by 6% in the third quarter of 2019, when compared with the same period the previous year. That was \u201cthe weakest pace in at least 27-1/2 years,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0a Reuters\u2019 analysis of quarterly data.", "On an annual basis, China is currently projected to have real GDP growth of 6.1% for all of 2019,\u00a0according to\u00a0the International Monetary Fund. But that would be the lowest annual growth in 29 years \u2014 since China\u2019s GDP grew by 3.9% in 1990,\u00a0according to\u00a0World Bank data going back to 1961.", "Trump went on to say: \u201cSo, if I weren\u2019t elected, by right now, China would be the largest economy in the world. It was expected. It was said by many people that China would, right now \u2014 they were expecting around the second year of this term.\u201d", "We don\u2019t know where Trump saw that China was projected to surpass the U.S. as the world\u2019s largest economy in 2018. As of 2016, China\u2019s GDP in nominal dollars was $11.2 trillion, which was still about 40 percent less than the U.S. GDP of $18.7 trillion.", "Plus, by one measure \u2014 purchasing power parity, which accounts for differences in prices across countries \u2014 China had already become the leading economy in 2014,\u00a0according to\u00a0a Congressional Research Service report updated in June. Citing figures from the IMF and World Economic Forum, the CRS report said, based on PPP, China ($25.27 trillion) was still ahead of the U.S. ($20.49 trillion) in 2018, while the U.S. ($20.49 trillion) still outranked China ($13.40 trillion) in nominal dollars.", "Trump also was wrong when he said, \u201cAnd we\u2019re getting bigger, and they\u2019re not.\u201d China\u2019s economic growth has slowed in recent years, but it is still increasing at a faster rate than real U.S. GDP, which\u00a0grew by 2.9% in 2018 and at an annual rate of 2% in the second quarter of 2019.", "And as the\u00a0IMF noted\u00a0in July 2018, \u201c[e]ven with a gradual slowdown in growth, China,\u201d in nominal figures, \u201ccould become the world\u2019s largest economy by 2030.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
