(Martin did not reply to an inquiry from her representative.)", "Unlike many viral images we see, this one provided its sourcing.", "It cited an article by Alex Seitz-Wald in Salon.com and the liberal Center for American Progress. The chart was put together from elements of the Salon article by Adam Peck, an editor with the website ThinkProgress, which is affiliated with the Center for American Progress. Peck told PolitiFact that the graphic was originally created to be embedded in a separate Think Progress article.", "The accompanying ThinkProgress article \"was our opportunity to provide readers with the kind of information and nuance that simply don't work in a visual capacity,\" Peck said. \"Obviously, the pitfall is that those graphics can be easily divorced from their companion articles, losing whatever nuance we set out to provide.\"", "Also important to note: The Salon article, the ThinkProgress article and the graphic were all published in 2013. (Seitz-Wald has been at NBC News since 2014.)", "So the underlying data is five years old.", "The meme\u2019s re-emergence means there\u2019s been a game of telephone, with notable context falling by the wayside.", "Student survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School gather at the capitol in Tallahassee, Fla., on Feb. 21, 2018.\u00a0(AP/Mark Wallheiser)", "You wouldn\u2019t know it from the graphic, but whether an ID is required for a gun sale depends on who is making the sale.", "Under federal law, federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run background checks for sales to an unlicensed buyer. Specifically, a potential purchaser must show identification, complete a federal document known as a Form 4473, and pass a National Instant Criminal Background Check System check.", "Where the meme has a point is that in the states that didn\u2019t pass a tougher law, unlicensed private sellers are exempted from having to complete the background check process. Commonly, such unlicensed sellers operate from gun shows or flea markets, although a licensed dealer selling from a show would have to run the background check.", "\"For anyone who thinks he or she might not pass a background check, or is looking to circumvent any waiting period, they can bypass both in a majority of states,\" said Peck, the graphic's creator.", "As Seitz-Wald noted in his article, states can add their own restrictions on top of these requirements. At the time the article was written, only about a third had done so. Since then, Oregon and Washington have begun requiring background checks (and thus an ID) on all gun sales, including private transfers.", "This distinction \u2014 between the rules for licensed sellers and for unlicensed sellers \u2014 didn\u2019t make it into the meme.", "That matters. While it is possible in many states to buy a firearm without an ID by seeking out an unlicensed seller, such purchases account for a fraction of all sales. Gun shops and other types of brick-and-mortar stores \u2014 where background checks are required \u2014 account for a majority of purchases.", "A research paper published last year in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that of the 70 percent of gun transfers studied that were purchases \u2014 as opposed to gifts and inheritances \u2014 53 percent were purchased from stores and 17 percent were purchased from family, friends, online or gun shows. Those percentages have increased over time. In the past two years, 64 percent were purchased at stores.", "In other words, it\u2019s certainly possible to purchase a gun without an ID in many states, but in reality, a large majority of purchases are done with IDs and background checks.", "The graphic is more problematic on the point that in no state can you vote without proof of ID.", "It\u2019s certainly true that a number of states have requirements for voters to hand over a government-issued photo ID in one of just a few categories, such as driver\u2019s licenses. The strictest of these include Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.", "Other states also have ID requirements to vote, but in many cases, they allow easier-to-obtain paperwork, including documents without a photograph in some cases. Some of the valid documents, depending on the state, include student ID cards, utility bills, bank statements, paychecks, government checks, Medicare or Medicaid cards, employer ID cards, or a bank or debit card.", "Finally, there are 16 states that do not currently require documents at polling booths at all. They are California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont\u00a0and Wyoming.", "So the notion that every state requires an ID to vote is incorrect.", "If the graphic had said that an ID is required to register to vote, it would have been somewhat more accurate. Under the federal Help America Vote Act, every state must request identification when registering first-time voters who did not register in person and did not provide identification when filling out the mail-in registration form. For these voters, a wide variety of documents are accepted for registration; many states allow some of the non-photo IDs cited above to serve that purpose.", "The viral image said that in most states, you can buy an assault rifle with no proof of ID, but in every state, you need proof of ID to vote.", "It is indeed possible to buy an assault rifle without an ID if you go to a gun show \u2014\u00a0but the graphic neglects to mention that these sales are the exception rather than the rule. A significant majority of gun purchases are made in transactions that require ID and a background check.", "As for the voting claim, some states have imposed strict photo ID laws at the voting booth. However, the graphic ignores that about one-third of states require no ID at all to vote, and that many of those that do require identification allow a range of documents to serve that purpose, including student IDs, utility bills and debit cards.", "We rate the viral image Mostly False.", "Areva Martin, tweet, Feb. 18, 2018", "Salon.com. \"Clinton\u2019s line was true: The sad facts about assault weapons and voting,\" Aug. 29, 2013", "National Conference of State Legislatures, \"Voter Identification Requirements,\" Jan. 5, 2018", "National Conference of State Legislatures, \"Voter Verification Without ID Documents,\" accessed Feb. 22, 2018", "Matthew Miller, Lisa Hepburn, and Deborah Azrael, \"Firearm Acquisition Without Background Checks: Results of a National Survey,\" (paper in Annals of Internal Medicine), Feb. 21, 2017", "FBI, \"National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Federal Firearms Licensee Manual,\" accessed Feb. 21, 2018", "FindLaw, \"Federal Voter ID Requirements: The Help America Vote Act (HAVA),\" accessed Feb. 21, 2018", "ThinkProgress, \"Why It\u2019s Easier To Buy An Assault Weapon Than To Vote, In One Graphic,\" Aug. 29, 2013", "PolitiFact, \"Bernie Sanders repeats false claim about gun sales without background checks,\" Feb. 20, 2018", "Email interview with Alex Seitz-Wald, journalist, Feb. 21, 2018", "Email interview with Adam Nathaniel Peck, associate editor at ThinkProgress, Feb. 21, 2018", "Email interview with Ari Freilich, staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Feb. 21, 2018", "Email interview with Gary Kleck, Florida State University criminologist, Feb. 21, 2018", "Email interview with Dylan Lynch, policy associate at the National Conference of State Legislatures, Feb. 22, 2018", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
