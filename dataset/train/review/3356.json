Everything we see is a perspective, not a truth.\"", "We have a few opinions of our own about this one. And others had questions \u2014\u00a0this post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which also owns Instagram.)", "First, there\u2019s the Instagram account. It has 361,000 followers and the bio suggests that the account belongs to the actor Jim Carrey \u2014 it has an illustration of his face and says, \"Alrighty then.\"", "But the account isn\u2019t verified with a blue checkmark, unlike the real @JimCarrey Twitter account. That account\u2019s bio says: \"The ONLY official social media account for Actor Jim Carrey!\"and has 18.5 million followers.", "Second, the illustration of the man in the Instagram post doesn\u2019t look like Marcus Aurelius. He looks like Caracalla, another Roman Emperor who was given the name Septimius Bassianus at birth and renamed Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.", "But Caracalla a.k.a. Marcus Aurelius Antoninus is not the same Marcus Aurelius who wrote philosophical musings in \"Meditations\" and to whom this quote is often attributed.", "We didn\u2019t find the quote searching an online version of the book and we couldn\u2019t find a credible citation showing that Marcus Aurelius said it.", "Dirk Baltzly, a philosophy and gender studies professor at the University of Tasmania in Australia, told us it\u2019s \"just vaguely possible\" that the quote in the Instagram post \"is a highly creative\" translation or paraphrase from a passage in Meditations. One edition translates the original Greek this way:", "\"But among the principles readiest to thine hand, upon which thou shalt pore, let there be these two. One, that objective things do not lay hold of the soul, but stand quiescent without; while disturbances are but the outcome of that opinion which is within us. A second, that all this visible world changes in a moment, and will be no more; and continually bethink thee to the changes of how many things thou hast already been a witness. \u2018The Universe\u2014mutation: Life\u2014opinion.\u2019 \"", "But, Baltzly said, this is an old-fashioned and poor translation. Marcus Aurelius\u2019s view wasn\u2019t that there are no facts. Rather, he believed there are facts but that properly understood, none of the facts of the external world should disturb us.", "\"What disturbs us is the (allegedly false) opinion that, for instance, death is a bad thing or that losing your money really harms you,\" Baltzly told us in an email. \"In truth, the only thing that should disturb you is the realization of your own moral feelings and \u2014\u00a0unlike all the crap in the world \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s something you yourself can fix.\"", "Because the universe is constantly changing and each person plays a relatively small part in the world and then dies, Baltzly said, \"everyone has a limited perspective on it.\" But that doesn\u2019t mean that people don\u2019t know anything or that there are no objective facts and only perspectives.", "\"The emperor was a stoic \u2014\u00a0not a skeptic,\" Baltzly said. \"So I\u2019d call BS on that quote.\"", "We rate this post Fase.", "Instagram post, Sept. 23, 2019", "Britannica, Marcus Aurelius, visited Sept. 24, 2019", "Jim Carrey Twitter account, visited Sept. 24, 2019", "@jimcarreyhere Twitter account, visited Sept. 24, 2019", "Yahoo, 15 celebrities you must follow on Instagram, Feb. 14, 2013", "Britannica, Caracalla, visited Sept. 25, 2019", "\"Meditations,\" by Marcus Aurelius", "Modern Stoicism, Did the Stoics really say that?
