["Since taking office on Jan. 20, President Joe Biden has issued a flurry of executive orders, including one that is\u00a0aimed at preventing discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation and\u00a0prohibiting workplace discrimination in the federal government.", "While the move was celebrated by LGBTQ advocates, the announcement brought forth criticism\u00a0from some conservatives on social media, with claims that the order threatens women's rights. Critics protested with the hashtag\u00a0#BidenErasedWomen.", "A Facebook post shared on Jan. 23 claims Biden ordered schools to allow transgender athletes to play in women's sports.", "\"This is insane. A Biden Executive order call for Transgenders to be included in Women's sports,\" reads a post\u00a0from \u201cStudents for Trump\u201d founder\u00a0Ryan Fournier, which has been posted to Facebook as a screenshot by a Facebook user.", "Another user\u00a0shared a screenshot of a tweet from author Abigail Shrier that reads, \"On day 1, Biden unilaterally eviscerates women's sports. Any educational institution that receives federal funding must admit biologically-male athletes to women's teams, women's scholarships, etc. A new glass ceiling was just placed over girls.\"", "Mark Chase, a spokesperson for Fournier,\u00a0pointed to Section 1 of the executive order and said education institutions that receive federal\u00a0funding\u00a0must allow boys who self-identify as girls to\u00a0participate in female sports, and that there would be administrative consequences if not. He said the order would build upon the Supreme Court's Bostock v. Clayton case \"in an ambitious manner.\"", "\"Women\u2019s sports is a protected category. This ensures fair competition, which will only be diminished if schools are pushed to give biological men the right to participate in them. This executive order is a threat to decades of women\u2019s achievement thanks to executive fiat,\"\u00a0Fournier said In a statement to USA\u00a0TODAY.", "USA TODAY reached out to\u00a0Shrier and the Facebook users for comment.", "Fact check: Vice President Kamala Harris used 2 Bibles when she was sworn in", "The \u201cExecutive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation\u201d calls for a broader application of last year's\u00a0Supreme Court Bostock v. Clayton County ruling, which mandated that LGBTQ people are protected from sex discrimination in the workplace.", "The majority opinion held that, \u201cIt is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.\u201d", "The order\u00a0builds on the landmark ruling and directs federal agencies to extend protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression,\u00a0and calls for the Supreme Court ruling to apply to Title IX, the federal law that prohibits discrimination in federally funded schools.", "Under \"Bostock's reasoning,\" Title IX,\u00a0the Fair Housing Act and Section 412 of the Immigration and Nationality Act\u00a0\u201cprohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, so long as the laws do not contain sufficient indications to the contrary.\u201d", "\"Every person should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear, no matter who they are or whom they love,\" Biden's executive\u00a0order reads. \"Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports.\"", "The order states that discrimination against LGBTQ people \"overlaps with other forms of prohibited discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race or disability,\" as spelled out in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.", "The executive order does not tie an\u00a0education institution's federal funding to allowing biological male athletes access to women's sports teams and scholarships, the White House said in a statement issued to USA TODAY.", "The order mandates\u00a0that all students, including transgender students, be able to learn without facing\u00a0sex discrimination, and as part of that, transgender women should compete\u00a0on female teams, according to the statement.", "Fact check:Biden said he plans to increase COVID-19 small business relief to people of color and women", "Advocates for the LGBTQ community also have refuted claims that the executive order takes away women's rights and\u00a0emphasized\u00a0that the order spells out existing laws.", "Gillian Branstetter, a spokesperson for the National Women\u2019s Law Center,\u00a0told Vox that the order is\u00a0not a \"radical step\" and that the Biden administration is \"merely enforcing the Supreme Court's ruling as it was written.\"", "Branstetter added that Biden's executive order\u00a0\u201cis not an abandonment of his call for unity by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d and\u00a0\"it\u2019s frankly a little boilerplate because it\u2019s merely enforcing the Supreme Court (decision) as is the executive branch\u2019s constitutional duty.\"", "Chase Strangio, deputy director for transgender justice at the American Civil Liberties Union,\u00a0wrote on the ACLU's site\u00a0that Biden \"most certainly did not 'erase women' \u2014\u00a0 whatever that means.\"", "\"By stating the administration\u2019s intention to follow Supreme Court precedent and federal law, at core all the newly-elected president did was lay out what the law is and agree, unlike his predecessor, to follow it,\" Strangio wrote, adding that federal statutes are the source of legal protections for LGBTQ people, not Biden's executive order.", "However, what the order does do, according to Strangio, is establish that the Biden administration is prepared to enforce all legal protections under federal law for LGBTQ people.", "\"Every employer, every landlord, every health care provider that is considering firing or evicting or denying health care to a transgender person must now think about the fact that all three branches of the federal government have made clear that anti-LGBTQ discrimination is illegal,\" Strangio wrote.", "More:\u00a0As transgender troop ban gets reversed, LGBTQ community hopeful for Biden's years to come", "The executive order does not address athletics beyond the mention of discrimination in \"school sports.\"\u00a0Further, transgender amateur athletes already have policies they must follow in order to compete.", "According to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which oversees 24\u00a0sports at over 1,000 colleges and universities, gender confirming surgery or legal recognition of a player's transitioned sex is not required in order for transgender players\u00a0to participate on a team.", "When hormones are used, the NCAA requires\u00a0one year of hormone treatment for trans female athletes prior to competing on a women's team, and trans male athletes remain eligible to compete in women's sports until the athlete begins a physical transition using testosterone.", "In November 2015, the International Olympic Committee agreed that those who transition from female to male are able to compete in male sports without restriction.", "Those who transition from male to female are able to compete in the women's category after\u00a0declaring the gender identity of female, which cannot be changed for a minimum of four years;\u00a0and demonstrating\u00a0testosterone levels below a specific level\u00a0for at least 12 months before their first competition and then throughout the eligibility period.", "For K-12, according to Transathlete.com, policies vary by state and and school district, with\u00a016 states having policies in place that facilitate the full inclusion of transgender, nonbinary and

The order protects against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and states children should not be \"denied access\" to\u00a0\"school sports.\" The White House said this would include having transgender females play on women's teams.\u00a0But\u00a0the posts do not acknowledge that rules for transgender athletes are already in place at the college and Olympic levels, as well as in many states and school districts.\u00a0Further, it is false to say any\u00a0educational institution that receives federal funding must add biologically male athletes to teams.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
