On Diwali, you will see every town, city and village is lit up with thousands of lamps everywhere. But the celebration is not just about lighting lamps outside \u2013 an inner light has to come. Light means clarity. Without clarity, every other quality that you possess will only become a detriment, not a gift, because confidence without clarity is a disaster. And today, too much action in the world is performed without clarity. Without the necessary clarity, whatever you try to do will be a disaster. Light brings clarity to your vision \u2013 not just in a physical sense. How clearly you see life and perceive everything around you decides how sensibly you conduct your life. Diwali is the day when the dark forces were put to death and light happened. This is also the predicament of human life. Like the dark clouds which brood in the gloomy atmosphere, not realizing that they are blocking the sun, a human being does not have to bring any light from anywhere. If he just dispels the dark clouds that he has allowed to gather within himself, light will happen. The Festival of Lights is just a reminder of that. ~Sadhguru #Imagination artwork #goldentemple #diwali #harimandirsahib #sikhtemple #sikh #sikhism #bandichordivas #chineselanterns #imagination #adoberisingstars #sikhexpo #happydiwali #instagram #enter_imagination #photoshop_creative #ps_fantasy #indianphotography #indianphotographyclub #bestvacations #ngtindia #navkaranbrar #discoverearth #WHPlikealocal #artingoutloud #theweekoninstagram", "A post shared by  Nav Brar (@navkaranbrar1) on Oct 18, 2017 at 9:18pm PDT", "A reverse image search on Google found the two separate photographs used to create the misleading image had circulated online for years.", "The image of the sky lanterns has circulated online for at least six years in reports on Thailand\u2019s Loi Krathong festival, for example here in November 2013 and here in November 2014.", "The image of the Golden Temple was posted online here in November 2012.", "Below is a comparison showing the composite image (L) and the photo from the Thai festival (top right) and India\u2019s Golden Temple (bottom right):", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
