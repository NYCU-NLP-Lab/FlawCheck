["About this rating", "On 12 March 2017, the Facebook group \"Animal Rights Warriors\" shared a video purportedly showing an injured monkey in a cage along with a link to a petition asking L'Oreal to stop testing cosmetics on animals:", "That Facebook post, as well as the linked petition, has since been deleted.", "The video in question did not show a monkey that had been injured at a cosmetics testing facility. L'Oreal, a company that has been the subject of several false animal testing rumors, stopped testing their products on animals in 1989 and hasn't tested any individual ingredients on animals since 2013:", "L\u2019Or\u00e9al has developed a very rigorous safety evaluation procedure of its products, backed by Research. Well before the question of animal testing was raised by civil society or within a regulatory framework, L\u2019Or\u00e9al has been committed to new methods of assessing safety that don\u2019t involve animals. A true pioneer, L'Or\u00e9al has been reconstructing human skin models in laboratories to elaborate safety tests since 1979, as an alternative to animals. In 1989, L\u2019Or\u00e9al completely ceased testing its products on animals, thus 14 years before the regulation required so. Since 2013, L'Or\u00e9al has completely stopped testing ingredients on animals.", "The company specifically addressed the video in question when a copy of it was posted to  YouTube:", "L\u2019Or\u00e9al has nothing to do with these images/videos and such practices. The link between L\u2019Or\u00e9al and this content is not true at all. Please don\u2019t hesitate to warn others that it\u2019s false.", "Although the video does not depict an animal that was harmed through testing at L'Oreal (or any other cosmetics company facility), it does unfortunately document a terribly injured animal.", "The monkey, who was named \"Fighter,\" was severely injured when it was electrocuted by a high voltage tower in the Mulund Colony of Mumbai, India.
