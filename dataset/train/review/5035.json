["A meme dating to 2015, claiming that World War II Gen. George S. Patton expressed disdain for left-wing Democrats, surfaced on Facebook in the days after the November election. It\u2019s already gotten a one-two fact-check punch from Snopes and PolitiFact.", "The short answer: There is no evidence that Patton \u2014\u00a0an innovator in the use of tanks in combat \u2014\u00a0ever said this. Snopes found the earliest use of the quote in \u201cThe Unknown Patton\u201d by Charles Province, a 1983 book. Province did not use footnotes in his book and said the work was not a biography.", "In an email, Province wrote that the quote \"was directly from Gen.\u00a0Patton's World War II diary,\" though he wrote in a follow-up email that he could not supply a date for it, writing that his \"materials were in storage.\"", "\"I wouldn't have put in the book if it weren't from one of those diaries,\" he wrote.", "A review of Patton's wartime diary, which he kept from late 1942 until shortly before his death in December\u00a01945, did not show any evidence that Patton said this, nor did a review\u00a0of Martin Blumenson's \"The Patton Papers,\" which contain excerpts from Patton's letters and diaries.", "PolitiFact traced the first use of the quote back to \u201cThe Proper Study of Mankind,\u201d a 1948 book by Stuart Chase. A search of newspapers.com did not show the quotation or its attribution to Patton before 1988.", "The version of the meme currently circulating was posted on Facebook on Nov. 4, 2018, and just recently went viral. A message seeking comment was sent to the user who posted the meme.", "More:Fact check: List of 'deadliest days in American history' is partly false", "Patton expressed a broad disdain for politics but showed little understanding of and even less interest in the topic. It wasn't that Patton lacked exposure to politics. His father, George S. Patton Sr., was a conservative Democrat who won election to several local offices in California, including mayor of San Marino.", "But the father\u2019s interest didn\u2019t get passed down to the son. Patton said he had \u201cno more gift for politics than a cow has for fox hunting,\u201d wrote Robert H. Patton, his grandson, in \u201cThe Pattons: A Personal History of an American Family.\u201d", "Robert Patton wrote that the general\u2019s views were \u201ca sort of reactionary royalism\u201d that disdained labor unions and what Gen. Patton called \u201cgrafting politicians.\u201d But he didn't develop these ideas much further.", "\u201cHe wanted only two things from government: \u2018Consistent military preparation\u2019 \u2014 and someday, please, a declaration of war,\u201d Robert Patton wrote.", "Patton's wartime diary focuses almost wholly on the general's experiences with his colleagues; his experiences in the North African and European campaigns, and his boundless self-esteem.", "\u201cThe thing I must do is to retain my SELF-CONFIDENCE,\" Patton wrote on May 22, 1943. \"I have greater ability than these other people and it comes from, for lack of a better word, what we must call greatness of soul and based on a belief\u00a0\u2014\u00a0an unshakable belief \u2014\u00a0in my destiny.\u201d", "The general rarely discussed or interacted with politicians of either party during the war.\u00a0His few mentions of\u00a0them tended to be positive. He warmly recorded\u00a0a note from President Franklin Roosevelt in May 1943, thanking him for his contributions to the North African campaign. In November\u00a01944, he recorded a visit from Averell Harriman, then the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, who passed on Joseph Stalin's compliments of Patton's fighting style.", "On March 13, 1945, Patton recorded a dinner with Harry Taylor, then a foreign correspondent for the Scripps-Howard newspapers.", "\"(Taylor)\u00a0has very positive views on a large number of subjects, the chief of which seems to be dislike of the Democratic Party and all concerned with it,\" Patton wrote.\u00a0\"Naturally I made no comments in that direction, as I am certainly not a politician and have no desire to become one.\u201d", "More:Fact check: Viral photo shows protest in Paris, not Oregon", "After World War II, Patton was assigned to lead the military government of the German state of Bavaria, where his lack of political skills came to the surface, along with his anti-Semitism. Describing a visit to a refugee camp with Gen. Dwight Eisenhower on Sept. 17, 1945, Patton wrote in his diary that \u201cJewish DPs (displaced persons), or at least a majority of them, have no sense of human relationships.\u201d", "\u201cThey decline, when practicable, to use latrines, preferring to relieve themselves on the floor,\u201d he wrote.", "Five days later, while holding a press conference, Patton belittled denazification efforts in that area, saying he had \u201cnever seen the necessity of the denazification program.\u201d When reporters noted complaints that \u201creactionary Nationalists and Nazis still dominated the life of Bavaria,\u201d Patton said \u201cReactionaries! Do you want a lot of communists? I don\u2019t know anything about parties. I\u2019m here to see that they do what they\u2019re told.\u201d", "\u201cThis Nazi thing is just like a Democratic and Republican election fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing was that these damned Nazis got other people by the scruff of the neck and other Germans just didn\u2019t have the guts to go back.\u201d", "Patton\u2019s comments cost him the leadership of the Third Army. The general lashed out at the reporters in his diary, writing of \u201ca very apparent Semitic influence in the press.\u201d", "\u201cThey are trying to do two things,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFirst, implement communism, and second, see that all businessmen of German ancestry and non-Jewish antecedents are thrown out of their jobs. They have utterly lost the Anglo-Saxon conception of justice and feel that a man can be kicked out because somebody else says he is a Nazi.\u201d", "We rate this claim FALSE. There is no evidence that Patton ever said this. While Patton expressed contempt for politicians, he showed little interest in or knowledge of party politics during his lifetime. His comparison of the Nazi Party \u2014\u00a0an organization dedicated to the industrialized murder of racial and ethnic minorities \u2014\u00a0to the Democratic and Republican parties reflected this.", "Contact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Brian Lyman at 334-240-0185 or blyman@gannett.com.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
