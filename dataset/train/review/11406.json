["A video shared more than 4,000 times on Facebook and archived here shows a woman dressed in a nursing uniform claiming to have cured\u00a0 Covid-19 patients using a combination of onions, ginger, garlic, lemon and hot water.", "\u201cThis is one COVID remedy,\u201d reads the caption on the post, published on a page called Men and Women for Christ.", "The woman says in her introduction she is a nurse in an\u00a0intensive care unit and is employed by Hanson Grey Agency, a recruitment firm in London. In the video, she demonstrates how to prepare the tonic.", "The woman claims\u00a0the hot water in the mixture will \u201cdestroy Covid\u201d, adding she had treated many patients with her concoction and achieved\u00a0a 100 percent success rate.", "Hannah Ahmed, the managing director of Hanson Grey, told AFP Fact Check by email that the company is \u201caware of this video and are familiar with the nurse,\u201d but did not provide any other details.", "\u201cThis steam is very hot. Therefore if there is any virus in your throat or in your nostril, then this will destroy it,\u201d the woman says\u00a0in the video.", "This claim is false. AFP Fact Check has previously debunked claims that steam inhalation could kill the virus.", "Dr\u00a0Jason McKnight, assistant clinical professor in the department of primary care and population health at Texas A&M University, told AFP Fact Check in March 2020 that \u201cthe only way to \u2018kill\u2019 a virus is through antimicrobial cleaning solutions, which should NEVER be inhaled or introduced into the body in any way\u201d.", "There is no evidence that the coronavirus can be killed with high heat \u201ceither inside or outside of your body\u201d.

Health professionals told AFP Fact Check as early as February 2020 that there is no evidence for its use as an effective treatment.", "\u201cThere is no scientific evidence to substantiate the claim that boiled water with garlic cures the novel coronavirus nor is there any proper medical research available on the subject,\u201d Dr\u00a0Wasim Khawaja of the Pakistani Institute of Medical Sciences told AFP Fact Check by phone on February 4, 2020.", "Onions have also appeared in many misleading posts as both a cure and a way to prevent\u00a0Covid-19. Although onions are a good source of antioxidants and vitamins, the WHO does not classify them as a potential cure for the disease.", "Health professionals have also told AFP Fact Check that lemon and ginger do not cure Covid-19.", "Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, there have been many individuals, organisations\u00a0and countries promoting\u00a0one false cure or another.", "The president of Madagascar, for example, promoted a tonic cure for Covid-19 and supplied it to some African countries, without the backing of WHO-supported trials or approval procedures.\u00a0 When the drink was introduced by President Andry Rajoelina, the country officially only had a handful of Covid-19 cases and no known deaths linked to the disease.
