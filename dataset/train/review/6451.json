["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on January 7, 2021 | Updated on May 24, 2021", "Viral social media posts and a Republican House member have amplified claims wrongly identifying some right-wing figures at the U.S. Capitol riot as part of \u201cantifa.\u201d The claims feed into an unfounded conspiracy theory that anti-fascist activists in disguise orchestrated the event.", "Following a pro-Trump mob storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, viral posts spread a groundless theory that members of \u201cantifa\u201d \u2014 not supporters of President Donald Trump \u2014 were actually behind the riot.", "There has been no evidence put forward that \u201cantifa,\u201d an umbrella term used to describe anti-fascist groups, was responsible for the events.", "U.S. Capitol Police announced that 14 people were arrested on Jan. 6, most for unlawful entry. That\u2019s in addition to the 69 individuals arrested by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, 41 of which were on Capitol grounds (but not all of those were inside), a spokesman told us. The latter department\u2019s acting chief, Robert J. Contee III, said during a Jan. 7 press conference that he could not yet identify any particular groups involved. Federal authorities are also investigating. The FBI\u2019s assistant director in charge of the FBI Washington field office,\u00a0Steven D\u2019Antuono,\u00a0said\u00a0in a Jan. 8 call with reporters that there was currently \u201cno indication\u201d that antifa activists had disguised themselves as Trump supporters and carried out the Capitol riot.", "But some of the social media posts have claimed, wrongly, that specific individuals photographed in the events were part of \u201cantifa.\u201d", "One Facebook post shared by more than 4,000 users claimed, \u201cFYI These are NOT Trump supporters\u2026.Antifa THUGS.\u201d The post included a photo of the rioters inside the Capitol with an arrow pointing to a man wearing a headpiece with fur and horns.", "The man seen in the photo has actually been identified as Jake Angeli, who has been videotaped at similar events in the past and has been described as \u201ca fixture at Arizona right-wing political rallies over the past year\u201d by the Arizona Republic.", "Attorney Lin Wood \u2014 who has peddled other election-related conspiracy theories \u2014 likewise retweeted a post suggesting Angeli was \u201cantifa\u201d and saying that he was at an \u201cAZ BLM rally in June.\u201d", "But a larger version of the same photo shows Angeli was carrying a sign for QAnon, the pro-Trump conspiracy theory.", "Angeli can also be seen carrying a QAnon sign in a video taken in November 2020 and shared by Travis View, a podcast host who researches QAnon. In the video, Angeli discusses a conspiracy theory about the media.", "Another tweet shared by Wood suggested that a different, bearded man pictured in the Capitol was a member of antifa by comparing the photo to an image from the website phillyantifa.org.", "But the Philly Antifa website was actually identifying the man in the photo, and another man, as alleged neo-Nazis \u2014 not its own members.", "The faulty claims about those three individuals were also at the core of a dubious Washington Times story, headlined: \u201cFacial recognition firm claims Antifa infiltrated Trump protesters who stormed Capitol.\u201d", "The story was shared more than 87,000 times, according to CrowdTangle analytics data, and cited by Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz (at 1:16:00) when the House resumed debate over an objection to certify Arizona\u2019s Electoral College votes.", "The story claimed that a group called XRVision (whose work has been previously cited by right-wing outlets) \u201cused its software to do facial recognition of protesters and matched two Philadelphia Antifa members to two men inside the Senate.\u201d It further said that \u201cXRVision also has identified another man who, while not known to have Antifa links, is someone who shows up at climate and Black Lives Matter protests in the West.\u201d", "But an attorney for XRVision provided us with a statement saying that the story misrepresented its work and that \u201cXRVision didn\u2019t generate any composites or detection imagery for the Washington Times nor for a \u2018retired military officer,'\u201d as was claimed by the Washington Times.", "The statement instead claimed that XRVision identified the three individuals \u2014 the two alleged neo-Nazis pictured on the Philly Antifa website and Angeli \u2014 and that it did not identify any of them as being members of antifa.", "\u201cThe image analysis that we performed were distributed to a handful of individuals for their private consumption and not for publication,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOur attorney is in contact with the Washington Times and has instructed them to \u2018Cease and Desist\u2019 from any claims regarding sourcing of XRVision analytics, to retract the current claims, and publish [an] apology.\u201d", "The Washington Times has since removed its story.", "Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of \u201cAntifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\u201d told us in an email that he had seen \u201cno evidence of antifa involvement\u201d in the riot. He said \u201cthe entire political nature of what happened is completely anathema to what antifascists advocate.\u201d", "Other known figures on the right were among those who publicly showcased their participation in the riot. For example, Tim Gionet, an alt-right personality known as \u201cBaked Alaska,\u201d live-streamed his participation in breaking into the Capitol.", "During the riot, four individuals died \u2014 three due to presumed medical emergencies. A\u00a0fifth individual, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick,\u00a0died\u00a0Jan. 7 as a result of injuries sustained during the riot.", "Update, May 24: Although Capitol Police and the Justice Department initially reported that Sicknick died as a result of injuries sustained during the riot, the Washington Post has since reported that District of Columbia Chief Medical Examiner Francisco J. Diaz found that Sicknick suffered two strokes nearly eight hours after being sprayed with a chemical irritant during the riot. Diaz told the Post that Sicknick died of natural causes, but \u201call that transpired played a role in his condition.\u201d", "One woman,\u00a0Ashli Babbitt, reportedly an Air Force veteran, was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer while rioters were \u201cforcing their way toward the House Chamber\u201d inside the Capitol, the department\u2019s chief\u00a0said. On Twitter, Babbitt espoused her support for Trump and QAnon.", "Update and correction, Jan. 8: An earlier version of this story misspelled Babbitt\u2019s last name. We have corrected that error and updated this story to include information on the Jan. 7 death of a Capitol Police officer and a Jan. 8 statement by an FBI official.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
