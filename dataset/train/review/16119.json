["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on November 25, 2020", "An unfounded conspiracy theory of widespread election fraud claims that an election technology company called Smartmatic switched votes in the 2020 election. But Smartmatic provided ballot-marking machines to only one U.S. county in the election.", "The Trump campaign\u2019s legal team increasingly has been leaning on conspiracy theories in its effort to blame the president\u2019s reelection defeat on widespread voter fraud, for which there is no evidence.", "In court, the team has brought largely unsuccessful lawsuits that lack evidence. In public, they have been spouting unfounded claims and conspiracy theories.", "The most recent example is aimed at a company called Smartmatic, which has said it supplied voting equipment to one U.S. county.", "Despite Smartmatic\u2019s relatively small share of the U.S. voting apparatus, Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, and Sidney Powell, who had appeared with the Trump campaign\u2019s legal team until recently, have suggested that it is the source of nationwide fraud.", "Powell claimed at a Nov. 19 press conference that Smartmatic had switched votes away from Trump and gave them to President-elect Joe Biden using technology supposedly developed for former Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013. Previously, Powell had advanced a similar conspiracy theory that a secret supercomputer was used to switch votes. We already debunked that one.", "As of Nov. 25, Biden held a more than 6 million vote lead over Trump, according to the Associated Press.", "Giuliani also pushed the claim about Smartmatic on Fox Business, saying\u00a0on the Nov. 18 episode of\u00a0Lou Dobbs Tonight\u00a0that the company was \u201cfounded in 2005 in Venezuela for the specific purpose of fixing elections.\u201d", "But Smartmatic was actually founded in 2000 in Boca Raton, Florida. It is now headquartered in London, England.", "Smartmatic\u2019s founders are\u00a0Venezuelan, though, and the company\u2019s first election contract was in Venezuela, so those connections may have contributed to confusion about the company\u2019s origins. However, the claim that it created a voting system that could be manipulated at the behest of Ch\u00e1vez lacks any support.", "Most references to this claim are vague, but one version that offered some specificity came from Powell at the lengthy Nov. 19 press conference. There, she said that Smartmatic\u2019s voting systems \u201cwere created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to make sure he never lost an election after one constitutional referendum came out the way he did not want it to come out.\u201d", "Powell promised an affidavit in support of that claim and she quoted heavily from a letter Rep. Carolyn Maloney, of New York, wrote in 2006 detailing concerns about Smartmatic\u2019s purchase of another election technology company.", "Neither of those documents proves her point, though.", "We\u2019ll start with the affidavit, which was submitted anonymously in a federal lawsuit challenging the election results in Georgia. The suit was brought by an Atlanta-area lawyer, not by the Trump campaign.", "The statement is eight pages long with several redacted portions. It was made by someone in Dallas, Texas who described himself as having been on Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s \u201cnational security guard detail.\u201d", "According to the affidavit, the person \u201cwas a direct witness to the creation and operation of an electronic voting system in a conspiracy between a company known as Smartmatic and the leaders of conspiracy with the Venezuelan government.\u201d That scheme involved Ch\u00e1vez and other high-level Venezuelan officials working in 2009 to \u201ccreate and operate a voting system that could change the votes in elections from votes against persons running the Venezuelan government to votes in their favor in order to maintain control of the government.\u201d", "The statement is thin on details.", "It mostly describes what the anonymous affiant claims to have seen happen during elections in another country a decade ago.", "He suggested that the same nefarious things \u2014 namely vote switching \u2014 might have happened in the 2020 U.S. election because vote counting stopped at some point on election night and resumed the following day, with dwindling returns in Trump\u2019s favor.", "We\u2019ve written before about similar claims, but there is nothing unusual about counting mail-in ballots after Election Day. It\u2019s normal. In fact, most states don\u2019t start counting mail-in ballots until Election Day, as we\u2019ve previously reported, and mail-in ballots take longer to count.", "As for the 2006 letter from which Powell borrowed heavily at the press conference, it\u2019s moot for several reasons.", "Maloney, the New York Democrat who wrote it, was urging review of Smartmatic\u2019s purchase of another election technology company called Sequoia Voting Systems. She was concerned about Smartmatic\u2019s Venezuelan connections and the potential for vote tampering in the U.S., since, according to her letter, Sequoia machines had been used to record more than 125 million votes in the 2004 presidential election.", "Here\u2019s why that letter is moot 14 years later:", "Apart from the dubious support for this conspiracy theory, the company it\u2019s targeting doesn\u2019t do much work in the United States. Smartmatic says it provided voting equipment to only one U.S. county in the 2020 election.", "Los Angeles uses the company\u2019s VSAP touchscreen machines, according to the California Secretary of State\u2019s list of certified voting equipment used in each county.", "Biden held 71% of the vote in that county, as of Nov. 20 (with just over 40,00 ballots left to be counted) compared to Trump\u2019s 27% of the vote, according to the tally from the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder.", "That result is similar to the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, in which Hillary Clinton received 72% of the vote and Trump received 23% in Los Angeles.", "Those outcomes also reflect the partisan make-up of the largely Democratic county \u2014 50% of registered voters in Los Angeles are Democrats, 17% are Republicans, 31% aren\u2019t affiliated with any party, and the remainder belong to third-parties, according to the most recent report on statewide party affiliation from the California Secretary of State.", "According to Smartmatic\u2019s website, the company also sold voting equipment to Cook County, Illinois (which includes Chicago) in 2005, but those machines have since been replaced and Cook County now uses equipment made by Dominion Voting Systems, according to the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s list of certified voting equipment used in each county.", "Samira Saba, a spokeswoman for Smartmatic, has confirmed that Los Angeles is the company\u2019s only client in the U.S., according to the Associated Press. Saba didn\u2019t respond to our requests for comment.", "So it\u2019s unlikely that Smartmatic could have orchestrated a nationwide vote switching scheme considering that its only involvement in the election was providing ballot-marking devices to Los Angeles, California.", "Peddlers of this conspiracy have made it seem more plausible by tying it to another, similar theory aimed at an election technology company that has a bigger presence in the U.S. That company is Dominion Voting Systems, which has about 30% of the U.S. voting machine market, according to ProPublica. After the Nov. 3 election, Dominion also was baselessly accused of vote switching, but we\u2019ve already debunked\u00a0that claim.", "One example of this combined conspiracy theory came from Powell and was amplified by Dobbs.", "On Nov. 19 Powell claimed on Dobbs\u2019 Fox Business show, \u201cThe fact is, the Dominion machines run the Softmatic software.\u201d That\u2019s false. Regardless of the facts, Dobbs\u2019 show shared a clip of that interview on its social media channels, which have garnered tens of thousands of views.", "Both companies have issued statements denying that kind of agreement. Dominion said, \u201cDominion does not use Smartmatic software.\u201d Smartmatic said, \u201cSmartmatic has never provided Dominion Voting Systems with any software, hardware or other technology. The two companies are competitors in the marketplace.\u201d", "Separately, and more importantly, regardless of the type of software that might be used in any voting system, the agencies and organizations that oversee U.S. elections said in a joint statement, \u201cThere is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\u201d", "That said, there is enough of a history between the two companies for conspiracy theorists to sew together a story. So we\u2019ll explain that history here.", "The perception that Smartmatic and Dominion are connected comes largely from their separate dealings with a third company, Sequoia Voting Systems.", "As we said, Smartmatic\u2019s 2005 purchase of Sequoia caused some concern in the U.S., as described in Maloney\u2019s 2006 letter. In light of those concerns, Smartmatic sold Sequoia in 2007 to a holding company called SVS, which was made up of Sequoia\u2019s existing leadership.", "Sequoia continued using some of Smartmatic\u2019s intellectual property in its voting machines, according to a lawsuit between Smartmatic and SVS over another issue. The 2008 court opinion that revealed the IP issue didn\u2019t explain what kind of IP, specifically, Sequoia was using or whether or to what extent it was related to software.", "In 2010, Dominion purchased all of Sequoia\u2019s assets, including its \u201cinventory and all intellectual property including software, firmware and hardware, for Sequoia\u2019s precinct and central count optical scan and DRE voting solutions,\u201d according to a press release Dominion issued at the time.", "Dominion didn\u2019t respond to our request for comment, so we don\u2019t know whether Dominion used the IP or software that it purchased in that deal or, if it did, in what way. But, it\u2019s worth noting that this happened 10 years ago and any software that was purchased in the deal is likely outdated.", "Another factor contributing to the perception that the companies are connected is a 2009 licensing agreement that allowed Smartmatic to use Dominion\u2019s technology related to \u201cprecinct count optical scan\u201d machines in markets outside of the U.S. and Canada. The issue was made public in a lawsuit that followed a disagreement between the companies about which one could sell the technology to Puerto Rico.", "But that\u2019s not proof of any kind of secret software sharing that would have an effect during this year\u2019s U.S. election, and it certainly doesn\u2019t prove anything about election fraud.", "In fact, the joint statement from those who oversee U.S. elections said that \u201c[t]he November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
