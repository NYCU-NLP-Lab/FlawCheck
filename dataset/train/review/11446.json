The account, which has been inactive for two years, was at the time posting tweets about the University of Maiduguri. The caption said it showed a woman carrying the \u201clifeless body of a newborn baby found in University of Maiduguri female hostel\u201d.", "A Google search of \u201cUnimaid female hostels\u201d showed that the incident had been reported by some Nigerian media outlets a day earlier.", "This story\u00a0published by The Cable on May 25 shows a different photo of the same woman in red carrying the baby.", "Three people who were students at the university at the time -- Enyigwe Peter, Baraya Bala Abdullahi and Naomi Joda Dibal -- confirmed that the baby was found at the university.", "Peter took the photograph of the woman in red, and told AFP he had spoken with local media about the incident. The photo of the woman in red, used by The Cable, can also be seen on his Facebook page.", "Abdullahi had also posted a different picture of the woman, confirming again that the photograph was taken in Maiduguri.", "Naomi Joda Dibal, who was an undergraduate student at the time of the incident and is now pursuing postgraduate studies at UNIMAID, told AFP that the baby was found at the university\u2019s Murtala female hostel.", "\u201cIt happened in Murtala hostel. This woman was the hall mistress then,\u201d she told AFP.", "\u201cWhat actually happened on that day was that an unknown student aborted the baby and tried to dispose of the baby. When the alarm was raised, this woman, being the hall mistress, went and saw what happened.\u201d", "Dibal was able to identify the woman, but\u00a0we have so far been unable to reach her.", "Dibal said the photograph was taken as the hall mistress was carrying the baby to the university clinic.", "She added that she has seen the picture many times on Facebook \u201cwith different stories\u201d, taken out of context.", "Nigeria\u2019s Christian and Muslim populations are among the biggest in the world, according to the\u00a0Pew Research Center. Misleading posts with a religious message are very common.", "This particular post threatened readers by saying Jesus Christ \u201cpromised calamity for those that will not spread this news\u201d, encouraging people to spread it far and wide despite its misleading content.", "Before you share a message, you may want to run a Google search and read the comments below, to see if anyone has flagged up any potential problems with it already.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
