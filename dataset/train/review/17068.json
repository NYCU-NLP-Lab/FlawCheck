["One of the misleading posts was published\u00a0here on Facebook on January 8, 2021. It has been shared more than\u00a0100 times.", "The purported quote shown next\u00a0to the image of Judith Collins, leader of\u00a0the New Zealand National Party, reads: \u201cActually, he\u2019s a damn sight better than any of the other Presidents that have been there before him, including those that you admire, Miss Ardern.\u201d", "The text under the quote reads: \u00a0\u201cJudith Collins on Donald Trump.\u201d", "Several Facebook users appeared to believe the quote is genuine and posted critical comments in response. They described\u00a0the remark as\u00a0\u201cdisgusting\u201d, while berating Collins as \u201cdumb\u201d and \u201cmost dangerous woman\u201d, among other pejoratives.", "The purported quote\u00a0was also shared hundreds of times on Facebook here, here, here and here.", "The posts, however, misquote\u00a0Collins. They\u00a0misrepresent what\u00a0Collins\u00a0said\u00a0during a debate against Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on September 30, 2020. The debate was hosted by New Zealand media outlet\u00a0Newshub. It was published on the site's\u00a0YouTube channel here.", "Collins' remarks were given\u00a0in response to a question from\u00a0Patrick Gowe, the debate's moderator, about whether Trump was a \u201cdangerous influence on the world\u201d.", "At the YouTube video\u2019s one-hour, 23-minute and 10-second\u00a0mark, Collins responds by agreeing with Ardern that New Zealand has to find ways to\u00a0work with foreign leaders. She then adds: \u201cHe [Trump] has actually done some quite recent stuff with Israel and UAE and so actually that's better than war, don't you think? He hasn\u2019t been ready to rush into war\u201d.", "The statement refers to the Israel-United Arab Emirates Normalization Agreement, which was signed by the UAE foreign minister, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump at the White House on September 15, 2020.", "At the video\u2019s one-hour, 23-minute and 23-second mark, Ardern then retorts: \"It is a worry when the best thing you can say is at least we haven't had war\u201d.", "Collins responds: \"Well actually it's a damn sight better than any of the other presidents that have been there before, including those you admire Ms Ardern. Actually, I think keeping away from war is a good thing.\u201d", "The quote graphic shared on Facebook replaces \u201cit\u2019s a damn sight better\u201d with \u201che\u2019s a damn sight better\u201d and omits the final clause of Collin\u2019s reply. The misquote\u00a0misrepresents the original context, making it appear that Collins was praising Trump generally and not speaking specifically about his administration's Middle East policy.", "The graphic\u2019s attribution, which reads \u201cJudith Collins on Donald Trump\u201d, also misleads readers as it ignores the fact that Collins was speaking solely about Trump\u2019s involvement in brokering the Israel-UAE Normalization Agreement.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
