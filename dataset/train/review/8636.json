["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on May 10, 2016", "Donald Trump distorts the facts when he says \u201cHillary Clinton wants to take your guns away\u201d and \u201cabolish the Second Amendment.\u201d Clinton\u2019s gun violence prevention proposal would impose restrictions, including a ban on semi-automatic \u201cassault weapons,\u201d but it does not call for banning all guns.", "Trump made his remarks at a rally in Lynden, Washington, eliciting boos from his audience. As we have written before, Trump made a similar remark in a TV interview on Jan. 6, when he claimed Clinton \u201cwants to take everyone\u2019s gun away.\u201d", "Trump, May 7:\u00a0Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to abolish it. Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to take the bullets away. She wants to take it.", "Clinton has a gun violence prevention proposal on her website, which would deny gun owners from buying certain guns and block or delay the ability of some to purchase guns. But it does not call for taking any guns away.", "Among other things, her plan would:", "Clinton has said her gun proposals are \u201cconsistent with constitutional rights,\u201d acknowledging that gun owners have a constitutional right to own guns.", "Now, Clinton\u2019s critics point to past comments that she has made as evidence that she wants to take away all guns. But these interpretations distort her position.", "In October, Clinton was asked at a town hall in Keene, New Hampshire, about whether she would consider a gun buyback program like the one that was instituted in Australia after a mass shooting in Tasmania in 1996. In that case, Australia\u00a0banned certain semi-automatic, self-loading rifles and shotguns, and purchased 640,000 prohibited firearms in a buyback program. Clinton said some U.S. communities have held gun buyback programs and it \u201cwould be worth considering\u201d on a national level.", "Clinton, Oct. 16, 2015: Now communities have done \u2026 gun buyback programs. But I think it would be worth considering doing it on the national level if that could be arranged. Remember I know after the terrible \u201908 financial crisis, one of the programs that President Obama was able to get in place was cash for clunkers. Remember that? Getting them off the road. It was partly a way to get people to buy new cars, \u2019cause we want more economic activity, it was partly a way to get old models, that were polluting too much, sort of off the road. So I think that is worth considering. I do not know enough detail to tell you how we would do it, or how it would work, but certainly the Australian example is worth looking at.", "The National Rifle Association said her comments in Keene proved that the \u201creal goal of gun control supporters is gun confiscation.\u201d", "But Clinton\u2019s non-committal answer to a hypothetical question at a single campaign stop hardly amounts to proof that she \u201cwants to take your guns away,\u201d as Trump said. She said only that the Australia buyback program is \u201cworth looking at\u201d and \u201cworth considering.\u201d It is not part of her gun violence prevention plan.", "Trump went a step further this time, saying that Clinton \u201cwants to\u00a0abolish the Second Amendment.\u201d", "The evidence for this appears to be a recording of a speech that Clinton gave in New York last year, although Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to our request for clarification. In that speech, Clinton said that \u201cthe Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment, and I am going to make that case every chance I get.\u201d", "The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website that obtained an audio of her speech, wrote\u00a0at the time: \u201cAlthough Clinton did not identify which Supreme Court case she disagreed with, she appeared to be criticizing the landmark 2008 ruling in\u00a0District of Columbia v. Heller, which found the handgun ban in Washington, D.C., unconstitutional.\u201d", "Gun rights advocates point to that quote to claim that Trump was right in claiming that Clinton\u00a0\u201cwants to\u00a0abolish the Second Amendment.\u201d", "Asked about Clinton\u2019s remarks about the Second Amendment, Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin confirmed that Clinton was referring to the Heller case. He said Clinton\u00a0\u201cbelieves Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.\u201d", "\u201cOf course Hillary Clinton does not want to repeal the Second Amendment. Donald Trump is simply peddling falsehoods and conspiracy theories in an attempt to divide the American people and win votes,\u201d Schwerin said in an email to us. \u201cAlong with the vast majority of Americans, Clinton believes there are common sense steps we can take at the federal level to keep guns out of the hands of criminals while respecting the 2nd Amendment. She also believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.\u201d", "In that response to us, the Clinton campaign is echoing, in part, a separate dissenting opinion in Heller written by Justice Stephen Breyer, who wrote that the District had a compelling public safety interest in banning handguns.", "Nominated by President Bill Clinton, Breyer agreed with the dissenting opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens that the individual right to keep and bear arms is limited to militia\u00a0service. There is \u201cno indication that the Framers of the Amendment intended to enshrine the common-law right of self-defense in the Constitution,\u201d Stevens wrote (page 2). But Breyer also wrote a dissent in which he said that\u00a0even if the Second Amendment protects the\u00a0right to bear arms for self-defense, the\u00a0District\u2019s law did not violate the Second Amendment because it \u201cproperly seeks to further the sort of life-preserving and\u00a0public-safety interests that the Court has called \u2018compelling\u2019 \u201d (page 26-27).", "Breyer wrote that the law did not \u201cdisproportionately burden\u201d gun owners for several reasons, including: The ban was \u201ctailored to the life-threatening\u00a0problems it attempts to address\u201d; it banned \u201cone\u00a0class of weapons, handguns, leaving residents free to\u00a0possess shotguns and rifles, along with ammunition\u201d; and it covered an area that \u201cis totally urban.\u201d", "Schwerin\u2019s statement that \u201ccities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe\u201d is consistent with Breyer\u2019s dissent.", "Schwerin\u2019s statement that Clinton\u00a0\u201cdoes not want to repeal the Second Amendment\u201d is consistent with Clinton\u2019s past statements\u00a0about protecting \u201cconstitutional rights of responsible gun owners.\u201d Here are three of them:", "Clinton, June 20, 2015: Now, I lived in Arkansas and I represented Upstate New York. I know that gun ownership is part of the fabric of a lot of law-abiding communities. But I also know that we can have common sense gun reforms that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable, while respecting responsible gun owners. What I hope with all of my heart is that we work together to make this debate less polarized, less inflamed by ideology, more informed by evidence, so we can sit down across the table, across the aisle from one another, and find ways to keep our communities safe while protecting constitutional rights.", "Clinton, Feb. 29: If we can\u2019t figure out how to respect the constitutional rights of responsible gun owners, but keep guns out of people who have felony records, who are fugitives, stalkers, have domestic violence restraining orders against them, are dangerously mentally ill, shame on us. (At the 25 minute mark.)", "Clinton, April 20:\u00a0There is a Second Amendment, there are constitutional rights. We aren\u2019t interested in taking away guns of lawful, responsible gun owners.", "Trump may choose not to believe what Clinton says, but the fact is there is no evidence that Clinton wants to \u201ctake your guns away\u201d or \u201cabolish the Second Amendment.\u201d She hasn\u2019t said that, and her gun proposals would not do that.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b537dd59-628d-47cc-9588-1ac9d1df84f2", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
