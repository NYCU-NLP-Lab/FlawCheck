A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that 63 percent had an unfavorable opinion in November 2016. An Associated Press/NORC poll in January 2017 came back with 36 percent in favor, 13 percent who didn\u2019t care one way or the other, and 50 percent who opposed it.", "The White House press office noted a February 2017 YouGov poll that found that 34 percent favored including the mandate in any bill to replace the Affordable Care Act and 66 percent opposed it. The press office also pointed to similar results from an April 2017 Harris poll.", "Public opinion became more complicated around the time Republicans started voting on bills to repeal and replace Obamacare. As that process moved forward, more pollsters began asking people if they thought the individual mandate should stay or go.", "In March 2017, CNN/ORC gave respondents a list of options and asked them if they \"favor or oppose including that policy in a replacement bill.\" Half, 50 percent, said the requirement to obtain coverage should be kept and about half, 48 percent, said it should be ditched.", "The Kaiser tracking poll in October 2017 took a different approach to the same topic, and got results similar to CNN/ORC.", "Kaiser set up the question this way: \"The Trump administration has made a number of changes related to the health insurance marketplaces.

Again, a split decision.", "An earlier Kaiser tracking poll triggered higher levels of support for enforcing the mandate.

The individual mandate has a particularly strong tie to the law\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The rationale is that if the government is going to force insurance companies to cover everyone, then it must deliver a big insurance pool with a lot of healthy people in it. (There might be other ways to get to more or less the same place, but this fact-check is about the mandate.)", "The pre-existing conditions protection is popular. In the November 2016 Kaiser poll, nearly 70 percent of the public supported that piece of the puzzle.

Republican views have largely held steady, but independents have warmed to the law, and Democrats even more so.", "\"Democrats in particular have rallied around the ACA in the past year as it has come under threat of repeal or dismantling by executive order,\" Hamel said. \"In the current political context, people who support the ACA are willing to defend even the pieces of it that they don\u2019t like rather than see the whole law undermined or repealed.\"", "Trump said the individual mandate is \"highly unpopular.\" As recently as February 2017, a YouGov poll found that 65 percent of people opposed it, a finding that is consistent with earlier polls from other organizations. That\u2019s a fair sign of the provision\u2019s unpopularity.", "On the other hand, when people were given more details about the mandate, they had a more favorable view, as high as about 60 percent.", "And in the context of repealing the Affordable Care Act, the most recent polls found the public generally split 50/50 on whether to keep the mandate in force.", "Public opinion about the individual mandate is not a simple black-and-white choice.
