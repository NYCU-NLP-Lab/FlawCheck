["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on April 5, 2019", "Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was wrong when she said it took until April 2 of this year for a female worker to \u201cearn the same as a white man doing the same job\u201d did in 2018.", "That date actually marked Equal Pay Day for women, a public awareness campaign that brings attention to the gap in annual earnings between female and male workers, in general. It\u2019s not based on race, or workers doing the same job.", "\u201cIt\u2019s all full-time workers\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s not just white men,\u201d said Michele Leber, the chair of the National Committee on Pay Equity, which originated Equal Pay Day in 1996.", "Gillibrand, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, made her claim during an MSNBC interview the day of the event.", "\u201c[T]oday is Equal Pay Day,\u201d Gillibrand told \u201cHardball\u201d host Chris Matthews on April 2. \u201cSo it\u2019s the day actually in the year when a woman has to work all last year and up until today to earn the same as a white man doing the same job.\u201d", "That\u2019s not accurate, Leber told us by email.", "This year\u2019s Equal Pay Day for women was determined using Census Bureau figures for 2017, the most recent annual data available. That year, the real median earnings of men and women who work full-time, year round, were $52,146 and $41,977, respectively. That means the female-to-male earnings ratio was 80.5 percent (or 80 cents for every $1).", "Based on that information, NCPE calculated that a woman earning the median amount\u00a0would have to work 91 days into this year (in addition to all of 2018) to earn the same amount a man at the median level made last year alone. (The 91st day of 2019 was Monday, April 1, but NCPE says it has traditionally picked a Tuesday in April to bring national attention to the overall gender income gap.)", "We contacted Gillibrand\u2019s campaign about her claim, but didn\u2019t receive a response.", "She may have confused the observance on April 2 with other dates throughout the year that NCPE says do \u201csymbolize how far into 2019 women in \u2026 designated groups have to work to earn what white men earned in 2018.\u201d", "Equal Pay Day for Asian American women, for example, was back on March 5, and the day for white women only is coming up on April 19. The days for black women, Native American women and Latinas are much later this year, on Aug. 22, Sept. 23 and Nov. 20.", "The dates go in order in relation to the size of the gap in earnings for each group of women when compared with their white male counterparts.", "Still, the data is for all year-round, full-time workers in those racial and ethnic groups. It\u2019s not for those with the same occupation, as Gillibrand said.", "The Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research recently published a report analyzing the gap in median weekly earnings for male and female full-time workers doing the same job. IWPR says it is a nonpartisan think tank that \u201cconducts and communicates research to inspire public dialogue, shape policy, and improve the lives and opportunities of women of diverse backgrounds, circumstances, and experiences.\u201d", "The group\u2019s report on 2018 earnings says that the female-to-male earnings ratio for all full\u2013time weekly workers was 81.1 percent, and women\u2019s percentage of their male counterparts\u2019 median weekly earnings was higher than that in 14 of the top 20 most common occupations for women. Those who made nearly as much as their male counterparts included cashiers and customer service representatives (almost 99 percent); bookkeeping, accounting and auditing clerks (95 percent); social workers (nearly 94 percent); and registered nurses (91 percent). In two cases, female workers earned more than their male counterparts: receptionists and information clerks (102 percent) and general office clerks (nearly 105 percent).", "On the other hand, the analysis shows that women do not earn more than men in any of the top 20 male-dominated occupations. The study didn\u2019t find enough data for female workers to make a valid comparison in five of those fields: electricians, construction workers, grounds maintenance workers, carpenters or auto mechanics. In the other 15 professions for which comparable data are available, women earned more than 81.1 percent of their male counterparts\u2019 earnings in just six professions, including customer service representatives (nearly 99 percent) and software developers (nearly 87 percent).", "The IWPR report also notes that \u201c[f]emale-dominated occupations tend to have lower median earnings than male-dominated occupations,\u201d and that \u201c[w]omen\u2019s median earnings are lower than men\u2019s in nearly all occupations,\u201d overall.", "As the IWPR report shows, pay equity varies for women based on their occupation, so Equal Pay Day isn\u2019t April 2 for a woman working \u201cthe same job\u201d as a white man \u2013 as Gillibrand said.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
