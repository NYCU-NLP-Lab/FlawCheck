["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on May 1, 2018", "In talking about the importance of the 2018 midterm congressional elections, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi misrepresented government data to claim that \u201c1 in 5 children in America goes to sleep hungry at night.\u201d", "There is no precise measurement for childhood hunger in the United States. But the Census Bureau\u2019s most recent household food security survey found that about 6.5 million children, or 8.8 percent, \u201clived in households in which 1 or more child was food insecure\u201d in 2016.", "Also, the federal definition of \u201cfood insecurity\u201d includes households with \u201clow food security\u201d and \u201cvery low food security\u201d at any point during the previous 12 months. Until 2006, \u201clow food security\u201d was known as \u201cfood insecurity without hunger\u201d and \u201cvery low food security\u201d was called \u201cfood insecurity with hunger.\u201d", "\u201cVery low food security among children was 0.8 percent in 2016,\u00a0essentially unchanged from 0.7 percent in 2015,\u201d said the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s 2017 report on food security.", "Pelosi made her remarks at her weekly press conference on April 26, which was \u201cTake Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day.\u201d At her press conference, the California Democrat was joined by the children of Capitol Hill staffers and the media.", "The Intercept released a tape recording\u00a0that day of House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer urging Levi Tillemann, a progressive candidate in Colorado\u2019s 6th Congressional District, to drop out of the Democratic primary to clear the field for the party\u2019s preferred candidate,\u00a0Jason Crow. Asked if\u00a0the Democratic leaders in Washington should get involved in primaries, Pelosi pivoted to the issue of childhood poverty and hunger.", "Pelosi, April 26:\u00a0What is important in all of this is that 1 in 5 children in America lives in poverty and goes to sleep hungry at night. That is what makes this election so urgent for our country and for our children.", "Later in the news conference, Pelosi repeated that \u201c1 in 5 children in America goes to sleep hungry at night because they are so poor.\u201d", "Do 20 percent of the children in the United States go to bed hungry?", "Pelosi\u2019s office referred us to Table 1B of the USDA\u2019s September 2017 report, \u201cHousehold Food Security in the United States in 2016.\u201d\u00a0The USDA administers the\u00a0Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, once known as the food stamp program, and several child nutrition programs\u00a0for low-income Americans in an attempt to combat hunger.", "The USDA report is based on the 2016 Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement, an annual survey conducted by the Census Bureau. And,\u00a0as Pelosi\u2019s office told us, the report says 16.5 percent of U.S. households with children were food insecure at some point during 2016. But\u00a0that doesn\u2019t mean that the children in those households go to bed hungry.", "In an attempt to identify the number of \u201cfood-insecure children,\u201d the federal government differentiates\u00a0household\u00a0food insecurity \u201cby whether it affected the dietary intake of adults only or adults and children.\u201d", "\u201cParents and guardians try to shield children from experiencing food insecurity to the extent possible, and they are often able to maintain adequate food intake and normal meal patterns for their children even when parents themselves experience food insecurity,\u201d the USDA says in\u00a0a separate\u00a0June 2017 report on children\u2019s food security.", "There were nearly 3.1 million \u201chouseholds with food-insecure children,\u201d which is 8 percent of U.S. households with children, according to the September 2017 report. Of course, some of those households have more than one child.", "So, how many U.S. children were \u201cfood insecure\u201d in 2016?", "\u201cAbout 6.5 million children (8.8 percent) lived in households in which 1 or more child was food insecure,\u201d according to the USDA report cited by Pelosi\u2019s office.", "There are also ranges of food security that help the USDA determine \u201cthe severity of food insecurity experienced\u201d by children. Here\u2019s the definition of \u201cfood insecurity,\u201d as described on the USDA website:", "\u201cIn 0.8 percent of households with children (298,000 households), food insecurity among children was so severe that caregivers reported that children were hungry, skipped a meal, or did not eat for a whole day because there was not enough money for food,\u201d the September 2017 report says. \u201cThese households are described as having very low food security among children.\u201d", "As noted by the USDA, \u201clow food security\u201d was once known as \u201cfood insecurity without hunger\u201d and \u201cvery low food security\u201d was known as \u201cfood insecurity with hunger.\u201d\u00a0But the USDA in 2006 stopped using the \u201cwith hunger\u201d and \u201cwithout hunger\u201d labels, and combined those categories into a single \u201cfood insecurity\u201d category. As the USDA explains on its website, the Committee on National Statistics at the time recommended that the USDA stop using those labels because \u201chunger is not adequately assessed in the food security survey.\u201d", "USDA, \u201cDefinitions of Food Security,\u201d Oct. 4, 2017: The word \u201chunger,\u201d the panel stated in its final report, \u201c\u2026should refer to a potential consequence of food insecurity that, because of prolonged, involuntary lack of food, results in discomfort, illness, weakness, or pain that goes beyond the usual uneasy sensation.\u201d To measure hunger in this sense would require collection of more detailed and extensive information on physiological experiences of individual household members than could be accomplished effectively in the context of the CPS [Current Population Survey].", "That means the USDA does not use the food security survey to measure hunger, even though Pelosi does.", "Henry Connelly, a spokesman for Pelosi, told us:\u00a0\u201cA child in a household without enough food on the table is in danger, and that\u2019s the point Leader Pelosi is making.\u201d", "Fair enough. But the statistic she cited to make her point misrepresents the government data.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
