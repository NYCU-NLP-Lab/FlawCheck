And you can thank the Obama health law.\"", "McCaughey then claims that the law offers incentive payments, and eventually penalties, to pressure doctors and hospitals to convert to electronic health records. She quotes a cardiologist saying sex questions are \"insensitive, stupid and very intrusive\" and a nephrologist declaring that new requirements turn your medical record \"into an interrogation, and the data will not be confidential.\"", "Readers sent us the op-ed and asked us to fact-check it.

The government says the switch from paper will offer easier access to health records and data, provide reminders and alerts for doctors and patients, and reduce medical errors.", "The change wasn\u2019t part of Obamacare, though. And it doesn\u2019t require any \"sex questions\" \u2014 except for whether you\u2019re male or female. You might hear the words, \"Are you sexually active?\" from your doctor, but it wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the health care law.", "In other words, McCaughey\u2019s claim was utterly at odds with the evidence.", "\"Arrgghhh \u2014 now I have heard it all!\" said Molly Cooke, president of the American College of Physicians.", "Cooke, an internist, told PolitiFact that when she was in medical school in the 1970s, she was taught to ask:", "\u2022 Are you sexually active (with other people)?", "\u2022 If yes, are your partners men, women or both?", "\u2022 If no, is that out of choice, because you don\u2019t currently have an appealing partner, because you have no privacy, or some other reason?", "\u2022 Are you happy with your sex life, however it is?", "\"My classmates and I were taught to ask all patients all four questions,\" she said. \"I am not saying that we always did it, but these questions are as old as the hills.\"", "The rationale is that patients\u2019 answers may reveal important information about their health, safety and well-being, she said.

They need to note preferred language, gender, race, ethnicity, date of birth, height, weight, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking status.", "The demographic information helps doctors catch disparities in care, said Paul Tang, an internist who chairs the workgroup on \"meaningful use\" for the health information technology committee created by the Recovery Act.", "Just as with paper records, that information is protected by federal health privacy laws, such as HIPAA, and in some cases additional state law.", "In the second stage, the requirements for doctors get more sophisticated, with provisions for electronic access for patients to their health information, ability to transmit data to immunization registries, and more.
