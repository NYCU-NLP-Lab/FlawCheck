["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on August 22, 2019", "A thoroughly debunked hoax claiming that Instagram users can stop the platform from using their pictures if they post a statement rescinding permission has been circulating again. This time, it ensnared a member of the Trump administration.", "Some hoaxes are built to last. And one such monument to digital deception has had a resurgence recently, duping several high-profile figures including Energy Secretary Rick Perry.", "The hoax dates back to at least 2012, when the myth-busting site Snopes first debunked it. Then there was a comeback in 2015 and 2016, when the Los Angeles Times and the Guardian wrote about it. And now, again, it\u2019s circulating widely on social media.", "The claim warns Instagram users that the platform will be implementing a new \u201crule\u201d allowing the social network to \u201cuse your photos.\u201d It tells users that if they post a statement rescinding permission, the supposed \u201crule\u201d won\u2019t apply to them.", "But Instagram already has the right to \u201cuse\u201d photos uploaded to the site.

Among them was Perry, who posted the text on his personal Instagram account and highlighted the post on his personal Twitter account. Although the energy secretary apparently took down the Instagram post, he later uploaded a spoof of the hoax.", "Perry didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
