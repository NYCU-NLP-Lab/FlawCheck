["About this rating", "On 20 January 2019 the 'America's Last Line of Defense' posted a meme positing that freshman U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had passed a 'Change Unfit New Textbooks' Act (a puerile acronym) requiring that school textbooks be scrubbed of any mention of Confederate General Robert E. Lee:", "This meme was a complete fabrication.  As of this writing, Ocasio-Cortez (who, like all members of Congress, can only propose legislation, not \"pass\" a bill on her own) had not yet sponsored any bills in the House.  She was listed as a co-sponsor of some fifteen bills, none of them related to textbooks or Robert E. Lee.", "America's Last Line of Defense is part of a network of websites and social media accounts that publishes political disinformation under the guise of proffering \"satire.\"", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
