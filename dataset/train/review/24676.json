["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on July 15, 2020", "A viral video falsely labeled \u201cRegistered Republican Not Allowed to Vote!\u201d suggests that Republicans were kept from voting in Louisiana\u2019s recent primary. The person featured in the video \u2014 which has been viewed millions of times \u2014 was actually registered as a Democrat, so she couldn\u2019t vote in the closed Republican primary.", "Louisiana held its presidential primary on July 11. Two days later, a popular conservative Facebook page posted a video claiming that a registered Republican there wasn\u2019t allowed to vote.", "The video is labeled: \u201cRegistered Republican Not Allowed to Vote!\u201d It has been viewed more than 4 million times so far.", "But the woman featured was actually registered as a Democrat.", "Holly Sanders, who made the video of herself after leaving her polling place in Lafayette Parish, said in the recording, \u201cI just went to vote and I got inside and I couldn\u2019t vote for my party.\u201d", "She went on to say, \u201cI am registered as a Republican, I know damn well I am, and, for some reason, I\u2019m now Democrat today. And I cannot vote unless I vote Democrat.\u201d", "But voter registration records list her as a Democrat. Sanders first registered in 1997, Charlene Menard, registrar of voters in Lafayette Parish, said in a phone interview with FactCheck.org. Sanders\u2019 most recent registration was done online in 2015, which requires voters to select their preferred party affiliation, Menard said.", "In the video, Sanders addressed her registration as a Democrat, saying, \u201cSomewhere along the way something got messed up.\u201d She gestured with air quotes. \u201cYeah. Got messed up, alright.\u201d", "The video prompted tens of thousands of comments, many expressing sentiments like this: \u201cCheating is the only way these Democrat Demons can win.\u201d", "When we reached her by phone, though, Sanders said, \u201cAm I saying I was switched? No. All I\u2019m saying is go check yourself.\u201d She didn\u2019t answer direct questions about her party registration, but she said several times that she would encourage other voters to check their party affiliation before the November presidential election.", "Referring to the popularity of her video after it was picked up by conservative commentator David J. Harris Jr.\u2019s Facebook page, Sanders said, \u201cI\u2019m suddenly this face of America\u2026 otherwise I\u2019d take it down.\u201d", "Sanders couldn\u2019t remember how often she had voted or if she\u2019d ever voted in a primary election before this one, but she said that she wasn\u2019t very political until President Donald Trump became a candidate.", "In the video, Sanders is wearing a hat that says, \u201cYes, I\u2019m a Trump girl \u2014 get over it\u201d and she ends the recording with, \u201cGo Trump!\u201d", "Menard said that her office received complaints similar to Sanders\u2019 on primary day, estimating that there were about 200 calls from voters who wanted to change their party affiliation.", "\u201cLouisiana, in the olden days, was a Democrat state,\u201d Menard said. \u201cAlong the way, people started changing, but didn\u2019t change their voter registration.\u201d", "And, in Louisiana, the two major parties hold closed presidential primaries, meaning that only those who are members of the party can vote to elect the party\u2019s candidate for president.", "So, that\u2019s why Sanders wasn\u2019t able to vote in the Republican primary \u2014 she wasn\u2019t a member of the Republican Party.", "All other primaries and elections in Louisiana are open to participation regardless of party affiliation.", "As for the results of the Louisiana Republican primary, Trump won his party\u2019s support with 96% of the vote, according to the Louisiana Secretary of State\u2019s office. Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld finished a distant second with 2% of the vote.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
