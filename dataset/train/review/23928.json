["Rick Scott\u2019s opponents for governor are telling reporters to essentially brush off a June 2010 poll that shows the former Columbia/HCA hospital CEO beating both Attorney General Bill McCollum in the Republican primary and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink in a hypothetical November match-up.", "Focus on the fraud, they say. The fraud. The fraud.", "\u201cRick Scott has spent $15 million in half as many weeks to fund his public image repair squad\u2019s pricey and misleading paid media campaign,\u201d McCollum spokesman Kristy Campbell said June 10, 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise he has skyrocketed in the polls since Floridians are just beginning to learn about his questionable past. His lead will evaporate when Floridians learn Rick Scott oversaw the most massive Medicare fraud scheme in American history.\u201d", "Democrats added their own e-mail titled \u201cFraud is not a mistake,\u201d and a 2-minute, 40-second web video called \u201cSlick Rick.\u201d", "\u201cRick Scott may think that his millions of dollars will allow him to avoid answering hard questions about his record as CEO of Columbia/HCA ... but with your help we will make sure he is held accountable,\u201d said the Florida Democratic Party\u2019s Eric Jotkoff.", "The fraud. The fraud.", "PolitiFact Florida had to bite. Here we\u2019ll focus on whether Scott\u2019s old company, Columbia/HCA, committed fraud, and also explain Scott\u2019s role with the company, his part in a federal investigation and the outcomes of the federal probe.", "To borrow a line from Scott\u2019s television ads \u2014 Let\u2019s get to work.", "Columbia/HCA history", "Scott started what was first Columbia in the spring of 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company by purchasing more hospitals. A hospital network created efficiencies. Efficiencies created profits.", "In 1994, Scott\u2019s Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies. When Scott resigned as CEO in 1997, Columbia/HCA had grown to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries, Scott\u2019s campaign says. The company employed more than 285,000 people.", "Now about Scott\u2019s departure in 1997.", "That year, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country. In time it became apparent that the investigation focused on whether Columbia/HCA bilked Medicare and Medicaid.", "Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public and before the depth of the investigation became clear. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy.", "At issue, Scott says, is that he wanted to fight the federal government accusations. The corporate board of the publicly traded company wanted to settle.", "And settle, Columbia/HCA did.", "In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced what it called the largest government fraud settlement in U.S. history when Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties.", "Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement, which all apply to when Scott was CEO:", "The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million.", "The total fine:\u00a0 $1.7 billion.", "Plea deals, fraud", "As part of the 2000 settlement, Columbia/HCA agreed to plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies. A corporate felony comes with financial penalties but not jail time, since a corporation can\u2019t be sent to prison.", "Among the 14 felonies, Columbia/HCA pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States.", "Also, four Florida-based Columbia/HCA executives were indicted. Two were convicted of defrauding Medicare in 1999 and were sentenced to prison, only to have those convictions overturned on appeal. A third executive was acquitted and a jury failed to reach a verdict on the fourth.", "Was Scott close to going to prison for his part in the case?", "It appears not at all.", "The former CEO was never indicted and was never questioned in the case, he says. He may have been a target of the investigation \u2014 an ABC News report from 1997 says he was \u2014 but that never translated into charges.", "Sorting it out", "Let\u2019s boil this down.", "Was Scott running Columbia/HCA when it found itself at the center of a massive federal investigation? Yes.", "Did the company pay a record $1.7 billion in government penalties and fines? Yes, Columbia/HCA paid.", "And as we checked in this item, did his former company commit fraud? Yes, it pleaded guilty to fraud charges as part of a settlement.", "Of course, the million-dollar question is how much of the blame ultimately falls on Scott? And that\u2019s an answer we can\u2019t provide.", "Scott was in charge so he bears some responsibility and has said so. But there has yet to come to light any detail of how much he knew, and when he knew it.", "Though that won\u2019t keep us from looking.", "McCollum's campaign, in a statement, said Rick Scott's former company Columbia/HCA committed fraud. We rate the statement True.", "St. Petersburg Times, Rivals pounce on Quinnipiac poll results, June 10, 2010", "Alex Sink campaign, Rick Scott can't talk about accountability, May 18, 2010Alex Sink campaign, e-mail interview with Kyra Jennings, May 18, 2010Bill McCollum campaign, A Fraud Florida Can't Afford, May 18, 2010Rick Scott campaign, FAQs, accessed May 19, 2010Miami Herald, Columbia/HCA downplays probe at annual meeting, Scott defends company's record, May 16, 1997, accessed via Nexis", "Modern Healthcare, Federal agents strike at Columbia's Roots, March 24, 1997, accessed via Nexis", "Modern Healthcare, Columbia's storm builds: Company honchos try to calm workers as troubles swirl, April 07, 1997, accessed via NexisModern Healthcare, Columbia probe widens: Federal raid in 7 states targets lab, home-care records, July 21, 1997, accessed via NexisUSA TODAY, Columbia's new caretaker Physician heal thy firm: Tall task ahead of CEO, July 28, 1997, accessed via NexisSt. Petersburg Times, Top Columbia / HCA officials quit, July 26, 1997, accessed via NexisNew York Times, HCA Is Said To Reach Deal On Settlement Of Fraud Case, Dec. 18, 2002, accessed via NexisU.S. Justice Department, HCA to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages, Dec. 14, 2000U.S. Justice Department, Press statement RE: HCA, Dec. 18, 2002", "The Tennessean, Investors yawn over settlement, Dec. 15, 2000, accessed via NexisInterview with HCA attorney Walter P.
