["A claim circulating on social media alleges that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has taken a \u2018U-turn\u2019 and said that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients needn\u2019t be isolated or quarantined as they cannot spread the virus.", "A video of Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead COVID-19, WHO Health Emergencies Programme, is also making the rounds on YouTube. From the channel \u2018JayyU.S TV\u2019, it has gained nearly 50,000 views.", "Alt News has also received verification requests on its official mobile application.", "The viral clip is part of a press briefing held by WHO on June 9. The transcript of the complete briefing can be accessed here.", "At 34 minutes Dr Kerkhove says, \u201cWe have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing. They\u2019re following asymptomatic cases, they\u2019re following contacts and they\u2019re not finding secondary transmission onward. It\u2019s very rare and much of that is not published in the literature. We are constantly looking at this data and we\u2019re trying to get more information from countries to truly answer this question. It still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits onward.\u201d", "WHO did not say that asymptomatic patients cannot spread coronavirus but that the transmission is \u201cvery rare\u201d. This comment was not well-received by the scientific community. Liam Smeeth, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, was quoted by Reuters as saying, \u201cIt goes against my impressions from the science so far that suggest asymptomatic people \u2013 who never get symptoms \u2013 and pre-symptomatic people are an important source of infection to others.\u201d He added that he had not seen the data Kerkhove\u2019s statement was based on.", "The next day, WHO clarified on its statement and said that more research is needed to establish the extent of asymptomatic transmission.", "\u201cSince early February, we have said that asymptomatic people can transmit #COVID19, but that we need more research to establish the extent of asymptomatic transmission. That research is ongoing\u201d-@DrTedros", "\u2014 World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) June 10, 2020", "It further said, \u201cTo some, it came across as if the WHO was suggesting that people without symptoms weren\u2019t driving spread. Some studies, however, have estimated that people without symptoms (whether truly asymptomatic or presymptomatic) could be responsible for up to half of the spread, which is why the virus has been so difficult to contain. Isolating people who are sick, for example, does not prevent the possibility they already passed the virus on to others. Some modeling studies have assumed quite widespread asymptomatic transmission.\u201d", "Viral social media claims also suggest that asymptomatic patients needn\u2019t be quarantined however WHO never made such a statement. It in fact said, \u201cPeople not showing symptoms can spread the virus, whether they ultimately feel sick or not. That\u2019s why wearing masks and keeping distance are so important to limiting transmission.\u201d", "In a tweet posted yesterday (July 16), WHO wrote that one of the reasons Spain was able to manage COVID-19 transmission is isolation.", "Therefore, the World Health Organisation is in favour of self-isolation and the claim that asymptomatic patients cannot spread the disease is false.", "Donate Now", "Pooja Chaudhuri is a senior editor at Alt News.", "A video of a ladder moving on its own, purportedly from Jharkhand, is viral on\u2026", "In a 2-minute video, a man recommends a \u201ctechnique\u201d to prevent infection from Omicron, the\u2026", "A video of a set of iron nails that appear to melt after being placed\u2026", "Several social media users have shared an image that shows two columns \u2014 \u2018Cepa/variante\u2019 (Spanish\u2026", "A 90-second video of a man dissecting a banana has been shared on the internet\u2026."]
