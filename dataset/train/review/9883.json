["Numerous Facebook posts, including this one with more than 500 shares, claim that Osagie Ize-Iyamu, who recently announced his intent to make a second bid for governor in Edo state on the ticket of Nigeria\u2019s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party, collapsed shortly after a local court confirmed the suspension of the party\u2019s national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.", "\u201cIze iyamu colapsed upon hearing that oshomole has been removed\u2026 (sic),\u201d the post reads.", "Oshiomhole served two terms as governor of Edo state until 2016 when he supported Godwin Obaseki to succeed him under the APC. Obaseki defeated Ize-Iyamu, who was at the time running with the main opposition party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party. Shortly after the poll, Oshiomhole\u00a0became APC\u2019s national chairman, while Ize-Iyamu defected to the party.", "Since then, the relationship between Obaseki and Oshiomhole has soured. Obaseki called for Oshiomhole\u2019s suspension, while Oshiomhole has been rooting for Ize-Iyamu to unseat Obaseki when he comes up for reelection in September 2020.", "The comments in the viral post suggest some Facebook users believed the claim that the photo shows Ize-Iyamu receiving medical attention\u00a0after the court\u2019s order to suspend Oshiomhole, while others were sceptical, even dismissive.", "The photo also appears in Facebook posts shared here and here, alongside a similar claim.", "An old photo from 2015", "But the claim is false. The photo was taken five years ago at an unrelated event.", "AFP Fact Check ran reverse image searches and found that another photo of the scene was published by a Twitter user called Otas Julius on June 17, 2015. It says the Edo politician was \u201cdonating blood to save lives\u201d.", "A leader must lead by example pastor ize-iyamu donating blood to save lives @Gidi_Traffic @PastorIzeIyamu @BBCAfrica pic.twitter.com/JJpoz3gmuW", "A keyword search on Twitter for \u201cIze-Iyamu\u201d and \u201cblood\u201d produced another tweet by the new media director for Ize-Iyamu\u2019s campaign, Tinyan Otuomagie.
