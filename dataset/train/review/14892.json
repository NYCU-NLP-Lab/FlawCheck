Maybe more people should bring this into the news.\"", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "This is just one variation of the many rumors that claim Guzm\u00e1n gave up information during his testimony in the trial.", "Like the others, it is completely fabricated because Guzm\u00e1n didn\u2019t take the stand at all during his trial.", "According to the trial\u2019s transcript and several media reports, Guzm\u00e1n chose not to testify at the trial and his defense only called one witness, FBI agent Paul Roberts. The agent was called to discuss notes he took about a drug trafficker previously involved with Guzm\u00e1n, in an attempt to highlight discrepancies between the notes and the testimony the trafficker gave during the trial.", "Alex Cifuentes, a former Guzm\u00e1n associate, took the stand and testified that, among other Mexican officials paid off by Guzm\u00e1n, former Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto took a $100 million bribe from the kingpin. But there was no testimony about Comey, Pelosi, or any other American official.", "A post on Facebook says Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n took the stand and said James Comey helped launder $150 million \"cartel money\" for Nancy Pelosi.", "This claim is unfounded. EGuzm\u00e1n did not take the stand at his trial, and therefore could not have testified that his cartel gave millions to Comey, Pelosi or any American official.", "This rumor is Pants on Fire!", "Facebook post, Sept. 14, 2019", "New York Times, El Chapo Found Guilty on All Counts; Faces Life in Prison, Feb. 12, 2019", "Snopes, Did \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Testify That He Gave Millions to Pelosi, Schiff, and Clinton?
