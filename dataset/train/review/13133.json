Among other things, Monahan asserted that he had found a video on his mother's computer of Ellison \"dragging my mama off the bed by her feet, screaming and calling her a 'fucking bitch' and telling her to get the fuck out of his house\":", "Ellison denied both the allegations of abuse and the existence of such a video, while Karen Monahan, the putative victim, maintained that Ellison had subjected her to \u201cnarcissist abuse\u201d:", "Representative Keith Ellison has denied allegations that he emotionally and physically abused a former girlfriend, including once trying to pull her off a bed while yelling obscenities at her.", "The denial by Mr. Ellison, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for state attorney general, was forceful. \u201cKaren and I were in a long-term relationship which ended in 2016, and I still care deeply for her well-being,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis video does not exist because I never behaved in this way, and any characterization otherwise is false.\u201d", "In an email to The New York Times, Ms. Monahan, an organizer at the Minnesota chapter of the Sierra Club, said that she survived what she described as \u201cnarcissist abuse\u201d after a multiyear relationship with Mr. Ellison, the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee.", "\u201cIt is the most difficult form of abuse to articulate,\u201d Ms. Monahan, 44, wrote in the email. \u201cIt is a slow insidious form of abuse. You don\u2019t realize it is happening until it\u2019s too late.\u201d", "Karen Monahan later shared elements of her story on Twitter:", "I was asked if my party @MinnesotaDFL @DNC   believed me when I broke my silence regarding @keithellison.

In follow up texts viewed by CNN, Ellison did not directly address the physical altercation.", "However, CNN reported that when they asked Monahan for a copy of the video, \"Monahan said she misplaced it when moving and provided no other evidence to corroborate her story at the time.\"", "The month after this story first broke, a meme featuring a picture of a woman bearing deep, ugly purplish bruises around her right eye and jawline began to circulate on social media, along with the claim that it depicted Karen Monahan:", "However, the notion that the photograph was truly a picture of Karen Monahan that documented her condition after an assault by Ellison was questionable, because neither she nor her son claimed that Ellison had beaten or struck her about the face and head.", "Moreover, not only does the pictured woman not look like Karen Monahan, but Monahan herself stated on Twitter that \"This picture is NOT me\" and asked users to stop sharing it:", "This picture is NOT me.
