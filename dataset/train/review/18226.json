["Wisconsin Republican Mark Neumann has repeatedly cast himself as more conservative than his three opponents in the Aug. 14, 2012 U.S. Senate primary -- and he often cites his record on taxes as evidence.\n\nOn the tax reform page of his campaign website, Neumann declares he is \"the only candidate who has never supported a tax increase.\"\n\nOn another page, he says that during his two terms in the House of Representatives in the 1990s, he \"repeatedly voted for lower taxes \u2014 never raising taxes.\"\n\nAnd a host of anti-tax groups have given him awards.\n\nBut congressmen cast many votes.\n\nWhen it comes to Neumann\u2019s claim that he never voted to raise taxes during his four years in Congress, at least two bills he voted for -- the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act -- raise questions.\n\nAs the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office notes, the two were companion measures that President Bill Clinton signed into law on Aug. 5, 1997. Together they cut taxes by $370 billion, mostly through tax credits for families with children, and raised other taxes, primarily on cigarettes and air travel, by $130 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s a net tax reduction of $240 billion -- which the budget office pointed out was the first major reduction in federal taxes since the early 1980s. \u00a0\n\nBut, obviously, $130 billion in tax increases isn\u2019t small change, either.\n\nIn response, Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander said:\n\n\"Neumann has always, always, always said he is fine making changes to our tax structure as long as the overall impact is the same or lower taxes.\"\n\nBut that\u2019s not the statement we\u2019re testing. The claim was an absolute.\n\nOur rating\n\nNeumann said he never voted for a tax increase.\n\nBut looking at just two of the major bills he supported, although they contained $370 billion in tax decreases, they also contained $130 billion in tax increases.\n\nWe rate Neumann\u2019s statement False.", "Mark Neumann campaign website, Tax Reform page\n\nMark Neumann campaign website, Meet Mark page\n\nGovTrack.us, Balanced Budget Act of 1997\n\nGovTrack.us, Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997\n\nGovernment Printing Office, text of Balanced Budget Act of 1997\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"A historically polarized Congress; an increasingly conservative GOP,\" Feb. 25, 2012\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Wisconsin Senate hopefuls Neumann and Baldwin personify the chasm between the parties,\" Sept. 14, 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, \"Budgetary implications of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997,\" December 1997\n\nCongressional Budget Office, \"Budgetary implications of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997,\" December 1997\n\nCongressional Budget Office, \"An economic analysis of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997,\" April 2000\n\nEmail interview, Mark Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander, Aug. 3 and 7, 2012\n\nWisconsin Historical Society, Mark Neumann Blue Book biography", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
