["President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address that the country\u2019s progress toward energy independence can be measured in miles per gallon.\n\n\"Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy. After years of talking about it, we're finally poised to control our own energy future,\" he said. \"We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar, with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show for it.\"\n\nA lot of energy claims are packed in that statement. Here, we\u2019ll examine whether we\u2019ve \"doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas.\"\n\nWe reached out to the White House asking for backup to this claim but did not receive any. But back in 2011, the EPA announced a plan, in partnership with a dozen automakers, to increase average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks. (That figure represents a combined city/highway rating as tested in a lab. In real-world driving, the EPA estimates drivers would average closer to 43 mpg.)\n\nIs that for cars coming off the assembly line now? Not hardly. The 54.5 mpg benchmark is the goal for model year 2025 vehicles.\n\nFuel efficiency is gradually increasing on the way to the 2025 goal. When he took office in 2009, federal standards called for an average rating of 27.5 mpg. For 2013 vehicles, the standard is 30.5 mpg. In 2016, it rises to 34.1.\n\nSo comparing fuel efficiency in 2009 and now, there\u2019s an increase of 11 percent -- not nearly double.\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama said the U.S. has \"doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas,\" which clearly sounds as though cars on the road today are running at twice their earlier fuel efficiency. But he was comparing a real number with a projected one, a standard for vehicles manufactured more than a decade from now.\n\nThe statement was misleading and more importantly untrue.
