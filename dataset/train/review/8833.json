["House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks during a news conference in Washington on June 11, 2020. (AP)", "In 2008, the House sergeant-at-arms inquired about whether Pelosi could have access to a plane that could fly across the country without stopping to refuel.", "She did not request or use a 757.", "Pelosi has flown commercial airlines since 2011.", "A claim that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi uses an expensive Boeing 757 jet to shuttle her between California and Washington, D.C., each week has been circulating for more than a decade.", "But it\u2019s no more true today than it was in 2008, when FactCheck.org first vetted it.", "A March 25 Facebook post shared thousands of times claims that Pelosi, D-Calif., insists on flying in a 220-seat Boeing 757 to her home state, costing taxpayers nearly $5.8 million annually.", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "The post states that Pelosi ordered the Boeing 757 jet because the smaller Air Force C-20B jet that\u2019s normally made available to the House speaker could not make it across the country without stopping to refuel.", "Did the speaker order this? And are taxpayers really paying almost $5.8 million annually for her to travel to and from work? The answer is no.", "A spokesperson for Pelosi told PolitiFact, \"Speaker Pelosi travels by commercial air. This is false.\"", "Pelosi did have acess to a\u00a012-seat Gulfstream V during her first stint as speaker, spokesperson Drew Hammill said, from 2007 to 2011, due to security precautions set in place following the Sept. 11 terror attacks. After that, however, she began routinely flying commercial flights. She became speaker again in January 2019.", "The speaker has been spotted flying on commercial airlines recently. In July 2019, CNN\u2019s senior Washington correspondent, Jeff Zeleny, tweeted a photo of Pelosi sitting in coach on a Delta plane in Detroit.", "Speaker Pelosi was negotiating the fine print of this budget deal from her aisle seat of a delayed Delta flight from Detroit. She\u2019s had the phone pressed to her ear for much of the last three hours. For those wondering, she\u2019s in coach. https://t.co/0W7xyy71qE pic.twitter.com/gYWs1gwtss", "This isn\u2019t the first time this particular rumor was spread about Pelosi\u2019s flying habits.", "When FactCheck.org reported on this claim in 2008, it found that the rumor dates back to 2007, when Pelosi first became speaker. Bill Livingood, then the House sergeant-at-arms, asked the Air Force and the Defense Department for a plane that could transport Pelosi across the country without stopping to refuel. The House sergeant-at-arms is the chamber\u2019s top law enforcement and security official.", "Pelosi\u2019s predecessor, Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., had access to an Air Force C-20B, a small 12-seater that he used to travel to his home district, as well as a larger plane \u2014 a C-32, a military version of a Boeing 757 \u2014 that was made available to him following 9/11. But FactCheck.org found that while Livingood inquired about a plane that could fly across the country without stopping, Pelosi herself didn\u2019t request this larger jet \u2014 nor did she use it, Hammill said.", "In 2010, FactCheck.org and PolitiFact also debunked claims of Pelosi raking up a $100,000 bar tab on her plane rides.", "A viral post on Facebook claims that Nancy Pelosi ordered a 200-seat Boeing 757 jet to fly from Washington, D.C., to San Francisco, costing taxpayers $5.8 million annually.", "Pelosi did not request such a plane. And the post leaves out important context that would explain why the U.S. government provided a larger plane for the speaker of the House. It also ignores the fact that Pelosi flies on commercial airlines.", "We rate this statement False.", "Correction (July 1, 2020): Pelosi had access to\u00a0a 12-seat Gulfstream V aircraft during her first term as speaker. An earlier version of this story incorrectly suggested she had access to and occassionally flew on a larger plane. This story has been updated to reflect that change. The ruling stands.", "Facebook, Steven Beardsley, March 25, 2020", "FactCheck.org, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Personal Jet, December 28, 2008", "FactCheck.org, Pelosi\u2019s Party Plane, March 4, 2010", "PolitiFact, Michele Bachmann Accuses Pelosi of spending $100,000 on alcohol for flights, September 21, 2010", "Email and phone interview with Drew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi spokesperson, May 26, 2020 and June 11, 2020", "Jeff Zeleny, Tweet, July 22, 2019", "Judicial Watch, Judicial Watch Uncovers New Documents Detailing Pelosi\u2019s Use of Air Force Aircraft, January 28, 2010", "The Washington Post, The Trump-Pelosi State of the Union duel, annotated, January 23, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
