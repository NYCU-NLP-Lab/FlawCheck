Sheen told Oz that he stopped taking conventional HIV medication for about a month after Chachoua\u2019s treatment made HIV \"undetectable\" in his blood.", "Oz pointed out that Chachoua was not licensed to practice medicine in the United States and his method of convincing Sheen \u2014 by injecting himself with Sheen\u2019s blood \u2014 was not only unorthodox, but highly inappropriate. Sheen agreed to take his medicine again.", "It gets weirder.", "A few weeks later, Chachoua expressed his disappointment in Sheen and touted his treatment on Jan. 29\u2019s Real Time with Bill Maher.", "\"I found a place in Mexico with all these IV drug users, prostitutes, all the high profile things that are necessary for AIDS but I didn\u2019t find AIDS,\" he said. \"What I found was, their\u00a0people were drinking milk from goats, which had arthritis. These goats have a virus called CAEV, and this virus destroys HIV and protects people who drink it for life.\"", "This treatment, says Chachoua, not only cured Sheen but helped eradicate HIV in Comoros, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, in 2006.", "Let\u2019s state off the bat that Chachoua has been, as Maher noted, \"called a quack a million times.\" His claims that he eradicated HIV in Comoros in 2006 and cured Sheen are profoundly untrue.", "\"We have no cure for AIDS and it\u2019s certainly not going to be anything related to goat\u2019s milk,\" said Jeffrey Laurence, the senior scientific consultant for programs at amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research.", "The facts on CAEV", "As its name suggests, the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus or CAEV \u00a0\u2014 which is part of the same genus of viruses as HIV \u2014 causes arthritis and encephalitis in goats. Some research shows that infected goats may develop antibodies that will \"cross react\" with HIV.", "What does this mean? If you remember the lock-and-key model from your biology textbook, you\u2019ll know that your body produces antibodies that are specific to an antigen. Some CAEV antibodies, in addition to flagging CAEV, can also identify HIV. Simply put, they recognize HIV as an antigen. That\u2019s it.", "There is no evidence these antibodies \"destroy\" or protect against HIV, said Brian Murphy, a professor of pathology at the University of California Davis\u2019 School of Veterinary Medicine, who\u2019s studied CAEV.", "Scientists have actually known about this cross-reactivity for decades, but in the grand scheme of AIDS research, it\u2019s meaningless, according to Laurence of amfAR.", "\"It wouldn\u2019t make my list of 100 things to consider in the search for a cure,\" he said. \"There are so many more interesting things to look into without having to look into cross-reactions with goats.\"", "Nonetheless, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases did support research into CAEV\u2019s vaccine potential in the 2000s before determining that it wasn\u2019t viable. Currently, there\u2019s a team of scientists at Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble, France, working on a CAEV-based HIV vaccine.", "Yahia Chebloune, one of the immunologists on the team, explained the concept to us.", "The team\u2019s vaccine prototype combines CAEV with HIV and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus). Unlike HIV, CAEV doesn\u2019t destroy T helper cells \u2014 the white blood cells essential to the immune system \u2014 nor does it replicate as aggressively and indefinitely or create an AIDS-like disease in goats.", "So when the vaccine was tested on mice, macaques and llamas, their T helper cells weren\u2019t destroyed and the animals could produce antibodies, suggesting that the vaccine was effective in stopping the HIV strains from replicating.", "Got goat milk", "None of this suggests that Chachoua has successfully cured Sheen or the 780,000 inhabitants of Comoros against HIV.", "Simply \"drinking milk from goats with arthritis\" cannot protect anyone from the virus. CAEV is not transmittable to humans, so Charlie Sheen couldn\u2019t have developed CAEV antibodies \u2014 even if they did \"destroy\" HIV (again, they don't).", "\"This is the craziest story I\u2019ve ever heard,\" said Chebloune. \"The claims of Dr. Sam Chachoua are not scientifically serious.\"", "Is it possible that Chachoua inoculated Sheen with a homemade CAEV-based vaccine like Chebloune\u2019s? Our multiple requests for comment went unanswered so we\u2019ll never know for sure.", "But the one CAEV vaccine prototype we found triggered an immune response in animals and has yet to be tested on humans. What\u2019s more, as Lawrence of amfAR noted, vaccinating someone against a disease is not the same thing as curing it.", "Then there\u2019s the most damning evidence against Chachou: Sheen is still HIV-positive, while there were 7,900 HIV cases in Comoros in 2012.", "\"I\u2019m not cured, no,\" Sheen said on Feb. 11\u2019s Dr. Oz.", "Salvator Niyonzima, who directs the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS in Comoros, told Oz that he and his colleagues \"have never heard of Dr. Samir Chachoua.\"", "Our ruling", "Chachoua said he cured Charlie Sheen and Comoros of HIV with \"milk from goats which had arthritis.\"", "Chachoua is taking a nugget of science and twisting into an absurd claim.
