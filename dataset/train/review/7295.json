["In 2016, Senate Republicans refused to hold a confirmation hearing for Merrick Garland, then-President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.", "The seat was eventually filled by Neil Gorsuch, whom President Donald Trump nominated after taking office. Garland, shut out, kept his post as chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.", "But reports suggesting a possible Garland score-settling were off base. And Garland is not investigating a tax evasion case against Trump, as a recent Facebook post claims.", "\"Holy Cow!\" begins the post before referring obliquely to the president. \"Guess who\u2019s investigating Turnip\u2019s tax evasion case? None other than \u2026 Merrick Garland. I know he\u2019ll be utterly fair. It\u2019s just kind of sweetly karmic that it\u2019s his case.\"", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "First, Trump has not been charged with tax evasion. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office recently suggested in a court filing that it has grounds to investigate the president and his business for tax fraud, but that\u2019s a case over the president\u2019s financial records that\u2019s being fought in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.", "The claim in this Facebook post appears to stem from efforts by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to review Trump\u2019s financial information. In April 2019, the committee subpoenaed several years of the president\u2019s financial information from Mazars, an accounting firm that prepared Trump\u2019s financial statements. The request came after Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, claimed Trump had inflated his net worth as he unsuccessfully tried to buy the Buffalo Bills football team.", "Trump responded\u00a0by suing the accounting firm and the House committee\u2019s chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., to keep the records private.", "U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Congress was within its rights to request the records as part of an investigation into whether the president illegally inflated or deflated amounts on his financial statements.", "Trump appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where Garland served as chief judge.", "At the time, publications such as Newsweek reported that Trump\u2019s \"subpoena appeals now head to Merrick Garland\u2019s court.\" Vanity Fair published a story with the headline: \"Trump begs Merrick Garland to keep his financial lies private.\" The magazine also tweeted the story, writing: \"Trump\u2019s fate now rests in the hands of Merrick Garland, the judge whose Supreme Court seat Republicans effectively stole.\"", "Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, took issue with that framing.", "\"Dear internet,\" he tweeted at the time. \"Chief Judge Garland is one of 11 active judges, and 17 judges total who currently hear appeals on the D.C. Circuit as part of three-judge panels. The odds that his case goes to a panel including Garland, specifically, are \u2026 modest.\"", "And in fact, the case didn\u2019t wind up with Garland. In October, a three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that the House committee could subpoena Trump\u2019s records. Garland was not on the panel. Two judges appointed by Democratic presidents \u2014 David Tatel and Patricia Millett \u2014 wrote the ruling for the court. Judge Neomi Rao, who was appointed by Trump, dissented.", "The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in July that the House can subpoena the records if it meets rigorous standards. The Supreme Court then kicked the case back to the appeals court for further review. It\u2019s now being briefed again before the three-judge panel, Vladeck told us.", "The panel does not include Garland, who stepped down as chief judge in February but continues to serve on the court.", "\"The only way he\u2019d even be involved in this case at this juncture is if it goes before the en banc (full) court rather than the three-judge panel, which seems more than a little unlikely,\" Vladeck said in an email.", "We rate this Facebook post False.", "Facebook post, Sept. 29, 2020", "The New York Times, Shadow of Merrick Garland hangs over the next Supreme Court fight, Sept. 19, 2020", "NPR, Senate confirms Gorsuch to Supreme Court, April 7, 2017", "Cornell Law School, Tax evasion, visited Sept. 29, 2020", "Newsweek, Donald Trump\u2019s subpoena appeals now head to Merrick Garland\u2019s court, May 21, 2019", "The New York Times, Trump could be investigated for tax fraud, D.A. says for first time, Sept. 21, 2020", "CNN, House Committee subpoenas Trump financial information from accounting firm, April 15, 2019", "USA Today, Michael Cohen: President Trump inflated net worth as part of effort to buy Bills, Feb. 27, 2019", "Washington Post, House oversight committee postpones subpoena deadline for Trump financial records until court ruling, April 23, 2019", "House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Cummings issues statement on ruling that Mazars must comply with Oversight Committee subpoena Trump\u2019s records, Oct. 11, 2019", "Vanity Fair, Trump begs Merrick Garland to keep his financial lies private, May 21, 2019", "Vanity Fair tweet, May 21, 2019", "Steve Vladeck tweet, May 21, 2019", "Washington Post, Appeals court rules against Trump in fight with Congress over president\u2019s accounting firm records, Oct. 11, 2019", "Wall Street Journal, Appeals court says house can subpoena Trump accounting records, Oct. 11, 2019", "U.S. Court of Appeals District of Columbia, Merrick B.
