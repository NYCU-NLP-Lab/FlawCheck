We don't win! We don't win on anything.\"", "More recently, during an Oct. 10 rally in Ambridge, Pa., Trump offered a variation on that theme -- and the U.S. chess community wasn\u2019t happy about his remarks.", "Trump was in the midst of criticizing international trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He said he supports the idea of bilateral agreements, saying that such deals would make it possible for the United States to threaten to withdraw, then renegotiate on more favorable terms before the agreement expired.", "Trump went on to say that with multilateral pacts like the TPP, \"you can't terminate -- there's too many people, you go crazy. It's like you have to be a grand chess master. And we don't have any of them.\" (You can see it here, around the 19:45 mark.)", "Trump\u2019s statement sounded wrong to us. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry, but as it turns out, it is wrong. In fact, the comment provoked anger and ridicule within the chess community, which knows that the United States is currently on a roll in international competition.", "Chess grandmasters", "It\u2019s literally wrong that \"we don\u2019t have any\" chess grandmasters.

Urcan, a Singapore-based chess writer and historian. \"The previous Olympiad was won by China, and Russia and Ukraine are extremely competitive. Having the United\u00a0States\u00a0finish first was a huge boost for chess in America and a moment of genuine pride.
