["As total U.S. COVID-19 cases\u00a0exceed\u00a0600,000 and deaths surpass 25,000, mask use\u00a0is becoming increasingly common. On April 3, \u00a0the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed its stance to recommend voluntary use of face masks in public. And\u00a0some state and local governments are requiring masks or cloth face coverings while out in public in certain circumstances.", "Amid the many conversations about face masks, misinformation about proper use continues to spread. The claim that disposable masks should be reversed depending on the health of the wearer persists despite fact checks finding otherwise.", "On March 15, a Facebook user posted an image of a sign depicting\u00a0a common disposable mask and instructed people to wear masks with the\u00a0\u201cWhite side out: Filter- When (you\u2019re)\u00a0not sick and want to keep virus out\u201d and \u201cBlue side out: to keep germs in when (you\u2019re)\u00a0sick.\u201d", "The user told USA TODAY that the sign had been posted in her doctor's office. When she learned this was inaccurate,\u00a0the Facebook user removed the post, which had nearly 10,000 shares. Her post was not unique. Similar posts making\u00a0the same claim\u00a0have been appearing on social media since January.", "In the World Health Organizations instructional video \u201cWhen and how to wear medical masks to protect against coronavirus,\u201d Dr. April Baller explains the inside of the mask \u201cis usually the white side.\u201d", "\u201cThe colored side of the mask is usually the front and should face away from you, while the white side touches your face,\u201d the San Francisco Department of Public Health explains on its website.", "Dr. Wing Hong Seto, the co-director of the WHO Collaborating Center\u00a0for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, addressed the claim directly to QuickTake by Bloomberg on Jan. 24.", "\u201cYou see it has the blue color on the outside because it is waterproof and then you have white on the inside because it is absorbent,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, if I cough, it absorbs it.\"", "Seto also stressed the importance of wearing a face mask\u00a0with the metal wired edge on top and disposing of used masks without touching the outside.", "PriMed, a leading medical mask producer, explains the importance of proper mask usage\u00a0on its website. Medical masks are made to be fluid resistant, with the waterproof layer on the outside to \u201cminimize the amount of fluid that could transfer from the outer layers through to the inner layers as the result of a splash or spray,\u201d in accordance with the American Society of Testing and Materials standards.", "\u201cThe filtration efficiency and protective ability of a medical face mask is compromised when the mask becomes wet, torn or dislodged,\u201d PriMed states.", "Several fact-checkers\u00a0have debunked the claim, clarifying that disposable medical masks should always be worn with the white, absorbent layer facing inward.", "Verafiles, a Filipino verified signatory of the International Fact-Checking Network Code of Principles, was one of the first to address the claim in January after the vice mayor of Manila,\u00a0Sheilah \u201cHoney\u201d Lacuna-Pangan,\u00a0incorrectly demonstrated how to wear a surgical mask.", "The Manila Public Information Office then published a video of Lacuna-Pangan\u2019s incorrect demonstration on its Facebook page. The original video has since been taken down, but copies are still available on YouTube.", "The claim was also addressed by PolitiFact in February and the Associated Press in March.", "We\u00a0rate the claim that infected people should wear reversed disposable medical masks to prevent spreading COVID-19 as\u00a0FALSE\u00a0because it is not supported by our research. Medical experts and a manufacturer say disposable face masks should always\u00a0be worn with the wired edge upward and colored side outward. Mask users should\u00a0carefully dispose of such masks\u00a0after each use and practice\u00a0good hygiene\u00a0to properly prevent the spread of COVID-19.
