In early December 2018, remarks made by President Donald Trump about his having a \"very good brain\" were tied to her via a meme. In August 2018, another meme falsely suggested that Ocasio-Cortez made a statement revealing she didn't know the difference between billions and trillions.", "At 29, Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman in U.S. history to be elected to Congress. She's an outspoken progressive who comes from a working class background, and perhaps because of these differences she's often the target of belittling rhetoric -- from a spate of articles mocking her inability to afford rent in Washington, D.C., to critiquing her clothing choices.", "WNYC. \u00a0 \"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Pitches a 'Green New Deal' to Tackle Climate Change.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 4 December 2018.", "Hess, Abigail. \u00a0 \"29-Year-Old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Is Poised to Become the Youngest Woman in Congress.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNBC. \u00a0 6 November 2018.", "Rosenberg, Eli. \u00a0 \"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Wore Clothing, A Journalist Tweeted a Photo, And the Internet Pounced.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 15 November 2018.", "Da Silva, Chantal. \u00a0 \"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Most Popular Twitter Takedowns and Comebacks.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Newsweek. \u00a0 10 December 2018.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
