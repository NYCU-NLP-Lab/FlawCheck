["About this rating", "During ongoing national debate over a novel policy of separating families at the border, a photograph circulated (originally from Joshua Feuerstein, a self-styled \"American evangelist, Internet and social media personality\" who last made headlines in 2015 when he manufactured a so-called \"Christmas cup controversy\") that purportedly depicted a room full of immigrant children that former President Barack Obama had supposedly removed from their parents' custody:", "The attached text read:\nAs you stare at this picture of innocent children being separated from their parents at the border and feel your hatred toward President Trump start to boil over from the bowels of your soul...I'd just like to point out it was taken in 2014 .. when Obama was President! #share\nSome versions were shared with no accompanying text, inviting readers to project their own interpretation onto the image:\nImages of its type (dated to the Obama administration) were often described as having been ignored at the time they were originally taken. However, this image did appear in anti-immigration memes from 2014 and 2015, such as one framing the photograph as evidence the Obama administration (described here as a \"cabal\") was encouraging (\"seducing\") immigrant (\"illegal alien\") children to come to the United States:\n\nThe meme's text read:\nINSIDE AN OBAMA APPROVED REFUGEE CAMP\n140,000 Illegal Alien Children Seduced into coming to America By the Obama Cabal. MORE COMING NEXT YEAR TOO\nHey Obama.. Why not use the FEMA CAMPS??\nOr are those being prepped for Patriot Resistance Fighters!!\nThe first iteration we could find of that image was alongside a 5 June 2014 post published by Breitbart. Although Breitbart shared the photograph on Facebook on 21 June 2018, the outlet did not include a link to its earlier reporting. In its original article, the children were described as \"unaccompanied,\" indicating that they came without their parents, not that they were separated from their families by American authorities:\nBreitbart Texas obtained internal federal government photos depicting the conditions of foreign children warehoused by authorities on U.S. soil on Wednesday night. Thousands of illegal immigrants have overrun U.S. border security and their processing centers in Texas along the U.S./Mexico border. Unaccompanied minors, including young girls under the age of 12, are making the dangerous journey from Central America and Mexico, through cartel-controlled territories, and across the porous border onto U.S. soil.\nThe photograph was subsequently disseminated by numerous web sites and news outlets. National Review's \"Immigration Bedlam\" said of the children in the photo:\nSome 6,775 unaccompanied alien children (UAC) crossed the U.S.\u2013Mexican border in 2011, the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement reports. (The first bar in the ORR\u2019s chart, above, should read 2003\u20132011.) ORR expects 60,000 UACs this year. This number could reach 130,000 in 2015. Detaining them for $252 each, per day, will cost taxpayers $453.6 million per month this year and could cost $982.8 million per month next year.\nThe image and events around it were widely reported for several months, appearing in the Houston Chronicle, Splinter News, the Los Angeles Times, Mashable, and Reuters, among others.\nStories during that time specifically reiterated that the photographs showed unaccompanied minor children in the custody of United States Customs and Border Protection and temporarily housed at a Texas Air Force base:\nThe photos have a timestamp of May 27, 2014.\nA spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the agency has not \u201cofficially released any photos at this time in order to protect the rights and privacy of unaccompanied minors in our care.\u201d\n...

In June 2014, the image was published as part of numerous news stories (and occasionally alongside editorial pieces objecting to the presence of the unaccompanied minor children.)
