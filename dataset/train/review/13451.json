Trump blamed the \u201cdishonest\u201d news media for cherry-picking his words to distort his statements on Charlottesville, when, in fact, the president cherry-picked his words from his past statements to put a positive spin on his much-criticized remarks.", "Trump first spoke about Charlottesville on Aug. 12, the day of the white nationalist rally, and then again on Aug. 14 and 15. He read excerpts from each of his remarks to his Arizona audience, but he omitted key phrases that caused a political backlash.", "First, Trump spoke of his remarks on Aug. 12, a Saturday.", "Trump, Aug. 22:\u00a0So here\u2019s what I said, really fast, here\u2019s what I said on Saturday: \u201cWe\u2019re closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia\u201d \u2014 this is me speaking. \u201cWe condemn in the strongest, possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.\u201d That\u2019s me speaking on Saturday.", "Actually, Trump said, \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides. On many sides.\u201d In his retelling, Trump left out the words in bold.\u00a0His Aug. 12 remarks were criticized at the time even by members of his own party, who faulted the president for blaming both sides and not singling out by name the hate groups that organized the rally.", "Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado tweeted, \u201cMr. President \u2013 we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism.\u201d Sen.

It has no place in America.\u201d", "That quote was actually from his second set of remarks, on Aug. 14, which he repeated on Aug. 15 before blaming both sides.", "Trump explained his point in reading excerpts from his past statements on Charlottesville: \u201cBut the point is, that those were three different \u2014 there were two statements and one news conference. The words were perfect. They [media outlets] only take out anything they can think of, and for the most part, all they do is complain. But they don\u2019t put on those words.
