The campaign is correct that Obama voted against a bill to fund troops, which passed anyway.", "Obama's vote came after Democrats had sought unsuccessfully to attach a timetable for withdrawing troops. After that language was removed, Obama and several other senators decided to vote against the measure, saying they could not rubber-stamp an open-ended occupation.

(Mitt) Romney and Sen. McCain clearly believe the course we are on in Iraq is working, but I do not.\"", "The vote came when the primary contest for both the Democratic and Republican nominations was wide open, seven months before the first primaries.

But the ad's statement \u2014 \"he voted against funding our troops\" \u2014 is phrased with no qualifications or caveats. Actually, Obama has voted for troop funding several times in other measures.
