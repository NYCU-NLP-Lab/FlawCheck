Charlie Crist, now a Democrat and a 2014 candidate for governor, wrote an op-ed thanking U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a one-time Senate race opponent of his.", "Sound nice? It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a thinly veiled dig at Rubio.", "\"Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s endorsement of Obamacare for his own family should end the rhetoric coming from Governor Rick Scott and other tea party groups,\" Crist wrote, adding, \"The rollout of the Affordable Health Care Act has clearly been flawed, but that doesn\u2019t mean that our work towards affordable health care should end. It should continue.\"", "We wanted to sort through the rhetoric and clarify Rubio\u2019s stance on President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law.", "First things first: Rubio did purchase insurance for his family on the Washington\u00a0marketplace. Rubio and others are signing up for insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces to comply with the law\u2019s individual mandate.", "Federal lawmakers will stop getting government-provided coverage. Instead, they\u2019ll purchase insurance alongside small businesses and the uninsured. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced that rule in an amendment to the law so that legislators would see firsthand what average Americans would experience on the marketplaces.", "Federal legislators make up the only group of people to get kicked off employer-provided insurance. When they sign up on the marketplaces, they\u2019ll get a subsidy that covers up to 75 percent of their premium costs. That subsidy they get is similar to the deal many Americans get through employer-provided benefits.", "Some of Rubio\u2019s fellow Republicans have refused the federal subsidy, or refused insurance on the marketplaces altogether in favor of choosing a policy directly through a private insurer. Crist is highlighting that Rubio didn\u2019t do the same. But does taking the subsidy mean\u00a0Rubio endorsed Obamacare for his family?", "Crist\u2019s spokesman offered us one Merriam-Webster definition of \"endorse\" to support his point: \"to publicly say that you like or use (a product or service) in exchange for money.\"", "But there\u2019s another definition that applies here, one that\u2019s at least equally common: \"to publicly or officially say that you support or approve of (someone or something).\"", "Rubio is publicly saying he\u2019s using a product, but it\u2019s not quite right to say it\u2019s in exchange for money. The money is awarded to any U.S. legislator who buys insurance on the exchanges, whether or not they make that decision public. He\u2019s getting the money because that\u2019s what the law stipulates, not because he\u2019s promoting Obamacare.", "And that second definition of \"endorse\" rings false. Rubio has been vocal in his criticism of Obamacare, as Crist\u2019s column itself acknowledges.", "\"Senator Rubio is following the law, even though he opposes it,\" said Brooke Sammon, Rubio\u2019s spokeswoman, after the senator enrolled in Obamacare.", "Rubio has even called the individual mandate a \"disaster,\" and pushed for getting the entire law repealed and replaced.", "In response to Crist\u2019s column, Rubio said Monday, \"I don\u2019t endorse Obamacare. I much rather would have a vibrant private market where individuals like myself and others can buy health insurance from any company that will sell it to us.\"", "It is worth repeating the Miami Herald\u2019s observation, though, that when Rubio served as Florida House speaker while Crist was governor, Rubio pushed to open an exchange that would help small businesses offer insurance. So he\u2019s supported that sort of concept before, even if he emphatically doesn\u2019t support something similar on the federal level.", "Our ruling", "Crist said Rubio endorsed Obamacare for his family. He did sign up for insurance on the Washington\u00a0marketplace, but we think calling that an endorsement is too strong. Rubio certainly doesn\u2019t support Obamacare, and has pushed for its\u00a0repeal. He\u2019s signed up through the marketplace simply to abide by the law.
