["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on April 18, 2018", "Q: Can U.S. residents collect \u201cM.A.G.A. Checks\u201d?", "A: No. A \u201cM.A.G.A. Check\u201d is the invention of a publisher selling an investment guide that makes promises of easy money.", "There is no evidence of any public or private program offering a \u201cM.A.G.A. Check.\u201d", "But a story posted on a website called magachecks.com has been circulating on Facebook claiming that President Donald Trump has passed a law resulting in \u201cmassive payouts\u201d named for his campaign slogan \u2014 Make America Great Again. Users of the social media site flagged it as potentially false.", "The story is actually a sales pitch for a monthly investment newsletter called \u201cTrue Wealth.\u201d", "The sales pitch makes lofty promises of easy money. It consists of vague references to unnamed government programs and testimonials from people with single syllable first names and a last initial \u2014 like \u201cJim G.,\u201d who, it claims, is \u201con pace to collect $5,295 in \u2018M.A.G.A. checks\u2019 before the year is over\u201d and \u201cBob A.,\u201d who is supposedly expecting to collect $2,400.", "For example, it claims \u2013 without any supporting evidence \u2013 that Trump brought back a 1960s-era law that allowed real estate companies to pay \u201cpractically ZERO Federal income taxes.\u201d The publisher promises \u201cbig cash payments\u201d to subscribers who invest in these \u201ccash-rich companies.\u201d", "\u201cIn this special report, I\u2019ll tell you what I believe are the 4 most stable, reliable and cash-rich companies in the M.A.G.A. program today \u2013 ones that regularly dole out big cash payments to their shareholders,\u201d the sales pitch says.", "The publisher also refers to coverage of the program on major financial sites, but those articles don\u2019t actually exist. For example, the sales pitch claims that Forbes \u201ccalled the income from \u2018M.A.G.A. Checks\u2019, \u2018very reliable and repeatable.'\u201d But a search of Forbes\u2018 website shows that the publication has made no mention of \u201cM.A.G.A. Checks\u201d anywhere, let alone calling them \u201creliable.\u201d Similarly, the sales pitch claims that Nasdaq.com said, \u201c\u2018M.A.G.A Checks\u2019 will soar in 2018.\u201d Again, a search of the site shows no mention of \u201cM.A.G.A. Checks.\u201d", "According to domain registry records, the site that posted the sales pitch is owned by Stansberry & Associates Investment Research.", "Stansberry & Associates used to be called Pirate Investor, but\u00a0changed its name in 2005 after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a suit in federal court alleging that the company had run a scheme to defraud its subscribers. In August 2007, the court found that Pirate Investor and its editor, Frank Porter Stansberry, had defrauded subscribers by selling a false stock tip and ordered them to pay back $1.3 million, plus $240,000 in penalties.", "U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis wrote in that decision: \u201cStansberry\u2019s conduct undoubtedly involved deliberate fraud, making statements that he knew to be false; Pirate acted in reckless disregard of regulations when it published Stansberry\u2019s unbelievable claims without a shred of confirmation.\u201d", "Garbis\u2019 judgment was upheld by an appeals court in September 2009, and Pirate Investor and Stansberry\u00a0paid back the money by November 2010.", "Stansberry is still an editor at the company, according to its website.", "The Social Security Administration also has had at least two run-ins with Stansberry & Associates, according to reports to Congress from the Office of the Inspector General. First, in 2006, the OIG had received complaints that the company was claiming that there was a program called \u201cUpper Social Security\u201d that would allow a person to collect \u201c10-times more than \u2018ordinary\u2019 Social Security.\u201d The company agreed to stop using the phrase. Then, in 2011, Stansberry & Associates paid $55,000 to settle a claim for misleading advertising in a publication called \u201cGet Social Security No Matter What Your Age\u201d \u2014 the company admitted no wrongdoing in that settlement.", "Stansberry & Associates also has generated more than 100 complaints to the Better Business Bureau, with many consumers saying that they had purchased a single book and were later charged $149 for a subscription that they hadn\u2019t authorized \u2014 85 percent of the reviews for the company are negative.", "Spokesmen for both the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said that they hadn\u2019t heard of any program issuing \u201cM.A.G.A. checks\u201d and cautioned consumers about investing in anything that sounds too good to be true.", "Similarly, Kimberly Burham, managing director of legislation and special projects at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, had heard of no such program.", "Although the story makes unrestrained claims, such as, \u201cThis is a no brainer if you want monthly checks rolling in like clockwork,\u201d the writer was unwilling to explain to us the basis of those claims. Steve Sjuggerud, the author of the story, did not respond to multiple calls for comment.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Sjuggerud, Steve. \u201cCan \u2018M.A.G.A. Checks\u2019 Really Make America Great Again!?\u201d Magachecks.com. Apr 2018.", "State of Maryland Department of Assessment and Taxation.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
