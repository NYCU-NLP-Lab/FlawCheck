As they sat in the patrol car, three suspects approached and opened fire. They fatally wounded Corporal Smothers and injured the manager.", "All three suspects were arrested after the incident and sentenced to death for Corporal Smothers' murder.", "Corporal Smothers had been employed with the Baton Rouge City Police Department for 14 years, and is survived by her two daughters and four sons.", "Smothers' passing came just a few days before Dunn's 18th birthday and a month before he committed to playing college football at Florida State University (FSU). He was the eldest of Smothers' children, and by most accounts he assumed a father-figure role in the life of his five younger siblings.", "Here's how the Los Angeles Times described Dunn and his siblings in a December 1994 article headlined \"Turning His Grief to Good: Florida State Running Back Warrick Dunn Sets an Example for All\":", "Derek is doing well at Catholic High.

By 2018, that number had grown to 159:", "\u201cMy rookie year in the NFL, in Tampa, I was challenged by coach [Tony] Dungy,\u201d Dunn said. He told us, \u2018If you are going to live in this community, you want to be a part of this community and give back.\u2019 From that challenge, I thought about my mom and her dream of home ownership, and that\u2019s how it all started. We did three homes in 1997, and now we\u2019re up to 159.", "\u201cI grew up in a situation where we needed a lot of support. I lost my mom at 18. Single mom, six kids, and a Baton Rouge police officer. She was gunned down by armed robbers at a bank. When she lost her life, the city of Baton Rouge started a fund for us. And that\u2019s how we were able to survive and pay bills. And when I saw that from the city, that really helped me understand what it means to care about your neighbor and to give back and support. I just think now I have been driven for so many years\u2014this is part of who I am, to want to see people smile and help anyone that I can possibly help.\u201d", "Our only quibble with this meme is the statement that Dunn \"built and paid for over 145 houses for single mothers.\" While the former NFL quarterback has certainly donated plenty of time, money, and effort into his charitable endeavors, he did not single-handedly build and pay for all these homes. Dunn's non-profit, Warrick Dunn Charities, partners with other non-profits such as Habitat for Humanity to build homes for disadvantaged families:", "Even in retirement, Dunn and his Warrick Dunn Charities are still partnering with Habitat for Humanity to build homes for disadvantaged families across the United States. In December, Dunn and Habitat combined to build homes number 158 (in Detroit) and 159 (in Atlanta) and place two families in them before the holidays.

A number of social media users shared this meme along with messages stating that Nike should have used Dunn, not Kaepernick, in their latest commercial:", "This meme misleadingly suggests that Colin Kaepernick has not similarly sacrificed by using his own money for charitable endeavors.   However, in January 2018 Kaepernick completed his pledge to donate a total of $1 million to charity over eighteen months, with a list of all the organizations he donated to  viewable here.", "And Dunn himself praised Nike's latest advertising campaign for raising Kaepernick's profile as the latter drove the conversation about social justice:", "\"I think it\u2019s a brilliant campaign,\u201d Dunn said.", "\"They just raised his profile because Kaepernick the last couple of years has been the face of this movement of social justice.\"", "\u201cTo be the first guy to come out and really talk about the issues that black kids, black men are being shot and killed, I commend him,\" Dunn said in a CNN interview.", "When asked if he thought Nike's stance to create the campaign was a financial or moral decision, Dunn cited the latter.", "\"It\u2019s a moral decision. It can\u2019t be about finances,\" Dunn said.", "\"I think overall they (Nike) understand the issues. A lot of their star athlete spokesmen are African American.
