["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on May 25, 2018", "During a recent hearing on the role of innovation in addressing climate change, several Republicans made faulty claims about the climate, past and present:", "The congressmen \u2014 all members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee \u2014 made their claims while questioning Philip Duffy, a physicist and the president of the Woods Hole Research Center, a climate change think tank. On a number of occasions, Duffy contested what the Republicans said, to no avail. We\u2019ll take their claims one by one.", "Brooks, the congressman from Alabama, made two false claims during the hearing \u2014 one about river sediments and cliff rocks and another about ice in Antarctica \u2014 both during a debate with Duffy about the causes of sea level rise.", "Brooks\u00a0asked why \u201csea levels have risen\u201d since \u201chuman beings have been on the planet.\u201d Duffy then\u00a0correctly explained that \u201csea levels over the last 3 million years have gone up and down in line with the cycles of ice ages.\u201d", "During their exchange, Duffy also said that \u201cground subsidence\u201d is \u201ca factor in some regions.\u201d Ground subsidence, or the sinking of land, does contribute to land loss in some regions, such as in Louisiana, which we wrote about in March 2017.", "But those answers didn\u2019t satisfy Brooks, so he pointed to factors he believed are causing sea level rise.", "Brooks, May 16: What about erosion? Every single year that we\u2019re on Earth, you have huge tons of silt deposited by the Mississippi River, by the Amazon River, by the Nile, by every major river system and, for that matter, creek, all the way down to the smallest systems. And every time you have that soil or rock, or whatever is it, that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise because now you\u2019ve got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up. What about the White Cliffs of Dover, California, where you have the waves crashing against the shoreline, and time and time again you\u2019re having the cliffs crash into the sea? All of that displaces water which forces it to rise. Does it not?", "Duffy\u2019s response: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that on human time scales those are minuscule effects.\u201d Duffy is right again, as we\u2019ll explain.", "Brooks doubled-down on these claims in a May 19 op-ed published on the news site AL.com. \u201cOver the history of planet Earth, far and away the #1 cause of sea level rise has been erosion and its resulting deposits of sediment and rocks into the world\u2019s seas and oceans,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cThere is no close second cause of sea level rise.\u201d", "This is false.", "According to a 2017 report by the\u00a0U.S. Global Change Research Program, global sea level rise is \u201cprimarily driven by two factors,\u201d both directly related to global warming.", "First, the oceans are expanding because water swells as it gets warmer. According the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the \u201coceans are absorbing more than 90 percent of the increased atmospheric heat associated with emissions from human activity.\u201d", "Second, there\u2019s also more water in the oceans because\u00a0mountain glaciers and the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are melting, explains the 2017 report.", "We asked Steven Goodbred Jr., an environmental scientist at Vanderbilt University whom we interviewed\u00a0for another piece on sea level rise, for his take on Brooks\u2019 claim. He did say that \u201csediment does displace water,\u201d but it has a minuscule effect \u201con shorter time scales (<100 years) due to the small volume of sediment relative to the immense volume of the oceans.\u201d", "On time scales longer than 100 years, \u201cit has no real effect\u201d because of a process called isostasy, where \u201cthe added weight of sediment to the oceans causes the crust to sink and the reduced weight of the sediment eroded from the land causes it to rise,\u201d Goodbred added. In other words, there\u2019s \u201cno net change in water level relative to land,\u201d he said.", "Torbj\u00f6rn E. T\u00f6rnqvist,\u00a0a geology professor at\u00a0Tulane University in New Orleans whom we spoke with for the March 2017 piece on land loss in Louisiana, gave us the same explanation, adding that Brooks\u2019 comments \u201care utter nonsense.\u201d", "This brings us to the second false claim Brooks made. As he continued his exchange with Duffy, Brooks asked \u201cwould it surprise you to know that as global temperatures rise \u2014 assuming for the moment that they do \u2014 that that actually increases the amount of ice that is collected on Antarctica?\u201d\u00a0Brooks repeated these claims in his May 19 op-ed.", "Duffy\u2019s response: \u201cThat\u2019s not true sir.\u201d Duffy is right \u2014 it\u2019s not.", "We wrote about ice levels in Antarctica and Greenland in January, after President Donald Trump\u00a0falsely implied the globe\u2019s ice caps are at \u201crecord\u201d high levels.\u00a0According to NASA, both of these ice sheets have declined in mass since 2002. \u201cBoth ice sheets have seen an\u00a0acceleration of ice mass loss since 2009,\u201d the agency adds.", "During the hearing, Brooks supported his claim by saying that he \u201cmade a trip down to Antarctica and met with National Science Foundation scientists and they all agreed with global warming and they emphasized that you\u2019re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming.\u201d", "His explanation?", "\u201c[P]rojected global warming will LOWER sea levels because warmer Antarctic air will carry more moisture above the Antarctic land mass, and deposit that moisture in the interior of Antarctica, where it will take hundreds of years to glacially make its way to the sea,\u201d wrote Brooks in his op-ed. NSF \u201cscientists opined that the increase in Antarctic continental ice will more than offset the loss of ice elsewhere on planet Earth.\u201d", "We reached out to Brooks\u2019 office to ask for the names of the NSF-funded scientists who gave him this information, but we received no response.\u00a0We also contacted multiple researchers studying the topic, and they all agreed that Brooks\u2019 explanation was inaccurate.", "Santiago de la Pe\u00f1a, a researcher at Ohio State University who studies glacier dynamics, told us that, while he was there when\u00a0Brooks and other politicians visited Antarctica in 2014, he did \u201cnot recall having said conversation\u201d with Brooks.", "\u201cCurrent climate models do contemplate an increase of snowfall over Antarctica in a warming scenario,\u00a0which is logical given a potential increase of moisture in the atmosphere,\u201d he added, but \u201cthe increase would be of an order of magnitude smaller than total mass loss.\u201d", "Erin Pettit, an associate professor at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, who studies glaciers, told us that she \u201cdid meet with the congressional visitors as a whole for about 10 minutes,\u201d\u00a0but she didn\u2019t speak with Brooks specifically. \u201cThe vast majority of the peer reviewed papers in recent years would not agree with the congressman\u2019s statement,\u201d she added.", "In short, while there might be some ice gained in the interior of Antarctica, there\u2019s a net loss because ice is retreating along the coasts at a faster rate.\u00a0Other experts in this area \u2014 Eric Steig at the University of Washington, David Holland at New York University and Richard Alley at Penn State \u2014 also told us Brooks\u2019 claim was inaccurate for the same reasons.", "We\u2019ve written plenty of times about claims made by Rep. Lamar Smith, who is the chairman of the House science committee. But rarely, if ever, has a scientist corrected him on the spot, as Duffy did during the hearing.", "While putting up a slide showing two graphs (see image below), Smith said, \u201cYou will see that for the last 100 years sea level rise has been basically constant,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s been going up at about 1.8 mm per year, and you\u2019ll see that there appears to be no correlation between the increase in the sea level and carbon emissions.\u201d", "Duffy interjected, pointing out to Smith that he had \u201cshown a sea level record from one location.\u201d", "Duffy, May 16: You\u2019ve shown a sea level record from one location.", "Smith: Right, this is San Francisco. I\u2019ve looked at also Boston, which appears to be the same.", "Duffy: The rate of global sea level rise has accelerated and is now four times faster than it was 100 years ago.", "Smith: Is this chart inaccurate then?", "Duffy: It\u2019s accurate, but it doesn\u2019t represent what\u2019s happening globally. It represents what\u2019s happening in San Francisco.", "Smith: All of the charts I\u2019ve seen, whether it be San Francisco, whether it be Boston, or anywhere else, show about the same degree of increase.", "Again, Duffy is right.", "First, the rate of global sea level rise is around four times faster than what it was about 100 years ago. We reached out to Duffy for support for his claim, and he sent us a study led by James Hansen, a\u00a0climate scientist at Columbia University. That paper summed up previous research on the topic, which showed the average rate of sea level rise was about 0.6 millimeters per year between 1900 and 1930. Between 1993 and 2015, the rate was about 2.6 mm per year, which is 4.3 times faster \u2014 and that\u2019s the conservative estimate.", "However, we should mention that we\u2019ve written previously that other climate scientists have said the Hansen paper\u2019s\u00a0future projections for global sea level rise are exaggerated, one of those scientists being Michael Mann, the\u00a0director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University. We reached out to Mann to ask him if the paper\u2019s summary of past observations is accurate, and he confirmed that it is.", "Second, Duffy is right that sea level rise in San Francisco, or any other specific location, \u201cdoesn\u2019t represent what\u2019s happening globally.\u201d\u00a0As we\u00a0explained\u00a0in March 2017, local sea level rise takes into consideration phenomena, such as ground subsidence, not just melting ice and the thermal expansion of the oceans, which is what scientists consider when they look at rise globally.", "Plus, juxtaposing sea level rise in one location with global carbon emissions is an apples-to-oranges comparison. When you look at sea level rise globally and compare it with global temperature rise, there is a strong association, says the 2017 Global Change Research Program\u2019s report. And as we\u2019ve written countless times, there\u2019s also a causal link between global temperature rise and carbon emissions from human activity.", "When we reached out to Smith\u2019s office for comment, his spokesperson didn\u2019t provide us with any evidence to the contrary.", "Florida Rep. Bill Posey also questioned Duffy about the Earth\u2019s climate previous to the development of human civilization \u2014 and made several scientific misstatements along the way.", "During their exchange, Posey asked Duffy what \u201cthe temperature on Earth [was] before the last ice age,\u201d to which Duffy responded,\u00a0\u201cBefore the last ice age, the last interglacial, well, similar to what it was about 100 years ago.\u201d", "Duffy is a little off here. According to NOAA, \u201cglobal mean annual surface temperatures were warmer than preindustrial [times] by about 1\u00b0 to 2\u00b0C\u201d during the last interglacial period, which started about 125,000 years ago.", "Posey followed up by rhetorically asking, \u201cYou think? You don\u2019t think maybe it was 30 degrees warmer when dinosaurs roamed the Earth?\u201d As we\u2019ll explain, he\u2019s much more than a little off.", "Duffy then responded by correctly stating, \u201cThere certainly have been epochs in the past when global temperature was warmer than it is now.\u201d", "There have been periods during which the Earth\u2019s mean temperature was warmer than it is today, but Posey is wrong to say that the mean global temperature was 30 degrees warmer at any point when dinosaurs roamed.", "NOAA explains:\u00a0\u201cOur planet probably experienced its hottest temperatures in its earliest days\u201d at more than 3000 degrees\u00a0Fahrenheit about 4.54 billion years ago. Even after \u201cthose first scorching millennia,\u201d Earth \u201chas sometimes been much warmer than it is now,\u201d the agency adds. NOAA points to two such periods \u2014 between 600 and 800 million years ago and about 55 to 56 million years ago.", "NOAA\u00a0points out that these record periods \u201coccurred before humans existed.\u201d It added, \u201cThose ancient climates would have been like nothing our species has ever seen.\u201d\u00a0But did dinosaurs roam during either of these periods?", "Dinosaurs are traditionally thought of as living between 247 and 66 million years ago,\u00a0a time known as the Mesozoic Era.\u00a0However, scientifically speaking, dinosaurs still exist today, as research has shown that modern-day\u00a0birds are a group of dinosaurs that survived the mass extinction of dinosaurs occurring 66 million years ago.", "So, a record warm period didn\u2019t occur when dinosaurs, as we typically think of them, roamed the Earth. Still, since modern-day birds are technically dinosaurs, one could say dinosaurs were still around about 55 to 56 million years ago. But how hot was it?", "During this period \u2014 what scientists call the\u00a0Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum \u2014 evidence suggests that the planet\u2019s\u00a0global mean temperature rose \u201cby as much as 5-8\u00b0C (9-14\u00b0F) to an average temperature as high as 73\u00b0F,\u201d NOAA explains. The global average temperature over the past few years has hovered between 58 and 59 F, or upwards of 1.5 F above the 20th century average of 57 F.", "So that comes out to, at most, around 14.5 F warmer about 55 million years ago than now \u2014 not 30 F warmer, as Posey said. In degrees Celsius, the difference would be even smaller. And it\u2019s also worth reiterating that this warm period did not occur during the previous interglacial period \u2014 or the last ice age \u2014 about 125,000 years ago, which is what Posey first asked Duffy about.", "In short, Posey\u2019s statement is wrong on multiple counts.", "Posey made another false claim while questioning Duffy about the cause of the last ice age.", "Posey, May 16: What caused the end of the last ice age?", "Duffy: The ice ages are caused by oscillations in the Earth\u2019s orbital parameters.", "Posey: Yeah, the last one was caused by a cataclysmic collision of an asteroid on this planet, I believe.", "Again, Duffy is right and Posey is wrong. There are additional factors, however.", "NOAA explains, \u201cVariations in Earth\u2019s orbit through time have changed the amount of solar radiation Earth receives in each season.\u201d And the warmer periods \u2014 the interglacials \u2014 \u201ctend to occur during periods of peak solar radiation in the Northern Hemisphere summer.\u201d But there are likely other factors at play as well.", "Pettit, at\u00a0the University of Alaska, put it this way: \u201cIce ages in general are caused by subtle changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit and Earth\u2019s tilt, with complexities introduced by feedbacks within our climate system and the arrangement of the oceans and continents.\u201d", "One example of a feedback in the climate system is the\u00a0ice-albedo feedback, NOAA explains. As solar radiation increases with changes to the Earth\u2019s orbit, it melts ice covering the planet, which, in turn, leads to more solar radiation being absorbed by surface, leading to more warmth. Why? Because ice is more reflective, or has a higher albedo, than land or water.", "So where did Posey get this idea that an asteroid caused the last ice age? We contacted his office to find out, but we never received a response.", "Posey may be confusing the cause of ice ages with the theory that asteroid impacts caused the\u00a0Younger Dryas. This is a period between 11,600 and 12,900 years ago when the planet\u2019s climate got drastically colder, explains Nature in a September 2013 article.", "But as Pettit explained to us in an email, \u201cThat theory is definitely not the leading one, but more importantly it only applies to *one* particular cold period of a thousand years at the very end of the last ice age. It did *not* cause the last ice age.\u201d", "Toward the end of their exchange, Posey asked Duffy: \u201cWhat do you say to people who theorize that the Earth, as it continues to warm, is returning to its normal temperature?\u201d Duffy responded: \u201cIf you want to characterize a temperature above today\u2019s temperature as normal, you\u2019re free to do that, but that doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s a planet that we want to live on.\u201d", "Posey then replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get philosophical,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m trying to stay on the science here.\u201d But the fact of the matter is \u2014 he didn\u2019t stick to the science, and neither did Brooks nor Smith.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
