["A pan-African magazine gave eye-raising numbers about how much Nairobi owes Beijing. Not all of them added up, however.", "The periodical was correct that China was by far Kenya\u2019s largest bilateral creditor, owed nearly five times as much as the next nearest creditor, Japan.", "The $6.4 billion figure for how much was owed to China was, however, outdated, from September 2019, and approximately $300 million less than the most recent data.", "The Africa Report journalist said \u201cexternal\u201d was used erroneously instead of \u201ctotal\u201d debt. Experts have explained these terms were not interchangeable.", "Reporting on what it said was a looming deadline for Kenya to repay a major loan from China, pan-African magazine Africa Report made claims about what Kenya owed the Asian country.", "\u201cWith about $6.4 billion of outstanding loans, China is by far Kenya\u2019s largest bilateral creditor but still accounts for less than 10% of the country\u2019s current $76 billion external debt,\u201d the January 2021 article reads.", "Do these numbers stand up to closer scrutiny?", "Kenya\u2019s outstanding loans to China total US$6.4 billion.", "Data on debt owed to China was somewhat of a \u201cmoving target\u201d, Eric Olander, who wrote the article, told Africa Check. But the \u201cmost common\u201d figure he had seen was $6.4 billion.", "Olander also shared a link to a November 2020 Bloomberg news article that cited Kenya treasury data and gave this debt as $6.7 billion. He added that a report from the treasury had put the amount owed to China at \u201c$6.5 billion by June 2021\u201d.", "Kwame Owino, chief executive of policy thinktank Institute for Economic Affairs, Kenya, told Africa Check that a quarterly report from the treasury had the country\u2019s most recent debt figures.", "Another data source was a public statement made by finance minister Ukur Yattani to parliament, Owino said.", "The treasury report, published in September 2020, showed that Kenya owed China $6.7 billion as at that month. Debt was last at $6.4 billion \u2013 the amount in the Africa Report \u2013 a year earlier, in September 2019.", "The minister\u2019s statement, made in December 2020, said that China accounted for 21% of external debt, which he gave as KSh3.66 trillion. Using the exchange rate of KSh110.09 to the US dollar at the time, this works out to $6.98 billion. If the September 2020 exchange rate of KSh108.49 to the dollar is used, the debt is $7.1 billion.", "This data is what would have been publicly available when the magazine article was published. Newer quarterly treasury data published in February 2021 shows that as of December 2020, debt to China was at KSh7 billion.", "We therefore rate the claim as understated.", "China is by far Kenya\u2019s largest bilateral creditor.", "Bilateral debt generally refers to debt loaned by one state to another state. Examples would be Kenya borrowing from Uganda or, as in this case, from China.", "Treasury data shows Kenya owed China $7 billion as of December 2020, or 66% of bilateral debt.", "This is nearly five times what is owed to the next nearest creditor, Japan, or twice what is owed to the next seven countries put together.", "In 2018, when we fact-checked a similar claim, China accounted for 72% of Kenya\u2019s bilateral debt.", "China \u201caccounts for less than 10%\u201d of Kenya\u2019s external debt.", "External debt is the total public and private debt that a country owes foreign creditors. Bilateral debt is just one component of external debt \u2013 others are multilateral debt and commercial debt.", "Kenya\u2019s KSh3.8 trillion external public debt as of December 2020 comprised:", "Bilateral debt at KSh1.2 trillion", "Multilateral debt at KSh1.5 trillion", "Commercial debt at KSh1.1 trillion", "The treasury summed this up in dollar terms as $34.75 billion. China\u2019s $7 billion in loans to Kenya translates to 20% of this. In September 2020 this share was 19.9%.", "The claim by the Africa Report is therefore incorrect.", "The article had erroneously used the word \u201cexternal\u201d instead of \u201ctotal\u201d in reference to Kenya\u2019s debt, Olander told Africa Check.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad you brought this to my attention,\u201d he said, adding that he would follow up with the magazine. As of the date of publishing this report however, the article remained unchanged.", "Against Kenya\u2019s total public debt of KSh7.3 trillion ($66.1 billion), China\u2019s share was 10.6%. (Note: Central bank data also showed total public debt as $66.3 billion as of November 2020.)", "Olander said the source of his $76 billion figure were two reports in Kenyan papers, published in November 2020 and January 2021. Citing an official report, both gave a figure of KSh8.41 trillion.", "The report said this constituted KSh7.06 trillion in August 2020, and \u201ccommitted undisbursed debt of KSh1.35 [trillion]\u201d.", "But committed undisbursed debt was not yet available for public spending, Owino of the Institute for Economic Affairs, Kenya told Africa Check.
