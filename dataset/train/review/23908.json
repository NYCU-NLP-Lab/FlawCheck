Scott Walker have promised billions in investments and thousands in jobs. (Mike De Sisti/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)", "When Republican Gov. Scott Walker said iPhone manufacturer Foxconn was bringing 13,000 jobs to Wisconsin, we drew the line on his exuberance at Half True.", "Even the Taiwanese company itself has said only there is potential for 13,000 jobs, and that its initial plans call for 3,000.", "But some Democrats, including state Rep. Melissa Sargent of Madison, have also been overly effusive in criticizing the up to $3 billion in incentives Walker wants to give Foxconn.", "Sargent, who made news in early 2017 for proposals to legalize marijuana and eliminate the state\u2019s \"tampon tax,\" posted this tweet on Aug. 2, 2017 -- a week after Foxconn announced in the East Room at the White House that it had chosen Wisconsin for its first major American factory:", "3,000 jobs cost #WI taxpayers more than $3 billion in tax giveaways. Break it down: more than $1 million in taxpayer dollars per job. #foxconn", "She had already made the claim in her official newsletter.", "The idea that the state would pay incentives to Foxconn worth more than $1 million per job might sound absurd on its face.", "And as we\u2019ll see, Sargent took down her tweet.", "But we are talking some colossal numbers here.", "Half-a-million dollars per job, anyone?", "No, it\u2019s not $1 million per job", "Under the deal it made with the state, Foxconn agrees to invest $10 billion to construct a facility in Wisconsin and create up to 13,000 jobs. Wisconsin agrees to, among other things, provide up to $3 billion in incentives.", "Sargent\u2019s staff told us her $1 million-per-job claim was based on a column posted on the Bloomberg Businessweek website that was written by Tim Culpan. Culpan is a Taiwan-based technology columnist for Bloomberg Gadfly, a commentary site. He wrote that Wisconsin \"is paying as much as $1 million per job.\"", "Culpan\u2019s $1 million claim was widely circulated -- by state Superintendent of Schools Tony Evers, who is weighing a run for governor in 2018; state Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse; and a host of national media, including Vanity Fair, a Washington Post columnist, The Atlantic and others.", "If you take $3 billion in incentives -- the amount cited in Sargent\u2019s tweet -- and divide it by 3,000 jobs, you get $1 million per job.", "But the $3 billion is the maximum -- to be paid only if Foxconn meets several requirements, including creating 13,000 jobs.", "If fewer jobs are created, the incentives paid are less.", "So, what is the cost per job?", "What the per-job cost might be", "The $3 billion -- up to $200 million per year for 15 years -- would amount to nearly 50 times the previous record paid by Wisconsin taxpayers, when the state in 2010 offered $65 million in subsidies to keep Mercury Marine from moving a factory from Fond du Lac to Oklahoma.", "The nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates it would take 25 years for taxpayers to recover the bulk of that -- the $2.85 billion the state would be paying Foxconn in cash.
