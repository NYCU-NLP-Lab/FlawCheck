["The photograph shows a barefoot\u00a0man surrounded by a\u00a0group in uniform.\u00a0It was published in this Facebook post on March 23, 2020, and has since been viewed nearly 350,000 times in Liberia and Nigeria, according to data provided by Facebook.", "The post alleges that pastors were beaten in Liberia\u2019s capital Monrovia and their churches shut as part of restrictions to contain the spread of coronavirus.", "\u201cThis was a clear diabolical, satanic, demonic, and Antichrist attempt. It's also a highest degree of treachery, conspiracy and betrayal (like Juda Iscarot did to our Lord) of the local grassroot churches by our so-called spiritual leaders and some members of the council of churches of Liberia (sic),\u201d the post reads.", "\u201cDespite of the 5000 deaths, threats, fears, and truma caused by Ebola in 2014, President Sirleaf did not closed any worship center, but she asked them for persistent prayers because she knew better (sic).\u201d", "Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is Liberia\u2019s former president and Africa\u2019s first woman\u00a0elected head of state who presided over the 2014-16 Ebola crisis during which more than 4,000 Liberians died. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic late last year, Liberia has recorded 10 cases of the virus\u00a0as of April 5, 2020.", "Although no agreement on suspending church activities was reached when Liberian President George Weah met with\u00a0members of the Liberia Council Churches (LCC) on March 20, 2020, the country's\u00a0health ministry declared a national health emergency the next day as part of the\u00a0measures to contain the\u00a0spread of coronavirus.", "Health Minister Wilhelmina Jallah said several rules would apply in\u00a0Liberia's infected areas\u00a0--\u00a0Montserrado and Margibi counties -- including\u00a0the closure of churches, mosques, and other religious centres,\u00a0for a period of at least 21 days from March 21, 2020.", "\u201cOn Sunday morning, March 22, 2020, armed police were seen at many churches enforcing a mandate from the Minister of Health ordering the immediate closure of churches. As a result of the police action, many services were disrupted. This was amazing and shocking!\u201d\u00a0LCC said in a statement.", "While the claim about police enforcement appears to have some merit, the picture used in the post\u00a0has nothing to do with COVID-19 nor does it depict a pastor. It was snapped by AFP photographer Zoom Dosso on September 7, 2006, and shows Liberia's national police force arresting a former combatant in the capital Monrovia.", "A reverse image search on Yandex found that the AFP photo was published on the website of photo news agency Getty Images.", "\u201cArmed robberies, hijackings, killings and rapes by Liberia's former combatants -- notorious for their brutality during a 14-year civil war -- have rekindled old memories, terrorising residents here under the eyes of the government and thousands of UN peacekeepers,\u201d the caption of the original photo partly reads. \u201cFor several months armed gangs have raided homes at night robbing residents around Monrovia of cash, food and other valuables.\u201d", "COVID-19 was first confirmed in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, but the virus has spread globally, infecting\u00a0more than 1.3\u00a0million worldwide and killing\u00a0more than 75,000 people.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
