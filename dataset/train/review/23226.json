["In his speeches and his TV ads, Barack Obama criticizes the influence of lobbyists.", "\"I know that I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington,\" he says in the television spot. \"But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.\"", "The announcer says, \"He's leading by example, refusing contributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists who have too much power today.\"", "But his anti-lobbyist policy includes one caveat and a few loopholes that weaken his claim to be funding his political campaign in a way that's truly different from his competitors.", "He almost always qualifies his statement to note that he won't take money from federal lobbyists, a distinction that allows him to accept money from well-connected state lobbyists.", "For example, South Florida lobbyist Russ Klenet and his wife will host a fundraising event in Broward County for Obama on August 25. Klenet represents state groups such as the Florida Association of Mortgage Brokers, but also companies such as Match.com and Election Systems & Software.", "And Obama still accepts tens of thousands of dollars from people who work for Washington firms that do substantial lobbying. Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is an Obama contributor who isn't a registered lobbyist, but works as a consultant for Alston & Bird, a lobbying firm in Washington.", "The Center for Responsive Politics found that Obama accepted $55,019 from employees at lobbying firms, and much more from companies that are not classified as lobbying firms but have lobbying divisions.", "So we give Obama's statement a Half-True on the Truth-O-Meter. While Obama can accurately say that he does not accept money from federally registered lobbyists, he still accepts thousands from people in the influence industry.", "Chicago Sun-Times Editorial, March 5, 2003", "Los Angeles Times, April 22, 2007", "Los Angeles Times, August 4, 2007", "The Hill,\n\nObama's K Street Project, March 28, 2007", "Chicago Sun-Times Editorial, January 12, 2004", "Washington Post Editorial, January 20, 2007", "Washington Post, April 15, 2007", "New York Times, July 30, 2007", "Transcript of AFL-CIO Forum", "St. Petersburg Times,\n\nObama follow fine line, August 16, 2007", "Associated Press, August 17, 2007\n\nObama says he swims in 'muddy waters' polluting Washington, pledges cleanup", "Center for Responsive Politics", "Obama campaign Web site,\n\nObama Says that as President, He'll Continue Life-Long Commitment to Ethics Reform", "Campaign Finance Institute,\n\nBig, $1,000+ Donations Supply 79% of Presidential Candidates' Early Money", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
