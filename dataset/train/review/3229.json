They argue the meeting may have violated election laws or could have amounted to conspiracy to defraud the government.", "Trump\u2019s tweet on Aug. 5 pushed back against a Washington Post story that said the president was privately fretting that his son, Donald Trump Jr., \u201cinadvertently may have wandered into legal \u00adjeopardy.\u201d", "Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics \u2013 and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!", "\u2014 Donald J.

This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d The younger Trump responded, saying, \u201c[I]f it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\u201d", "The following year, on July 8, 2017, when the New York Times broke the story of Donald Trump Jr. arranging the Trump Tower meeting, the younger Trump released a statement saying it was a \u201cshort introductory meeting.\u201d He said, \u201cWe primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.\u201d", "The following day, when the Goldstone emails came to light, Donald Trump Jr. said, \u201c[T]he woman [Veselnitskaya] stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs. Clinton. Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.\u201d", "On ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Aug. 5, Jay Sekulow, one of the president\u2019s attorneys, was asked about Trump\u2019s tweet that the meeting was legal.", "\u201cWell, the question is, how would it be illegal? I mean, the real question here is, would a meeting of that nature constitute a violation \u2014 the meeting itself constitute a violation of the law?\u201d Sekulow asked. \u201cThe question is what law, statute or rule or regulation\u2019s been violated? Nobody\u2019s pointed to one.\u201d", "The Federal Election Campaign Act, enshrined in the federal code, prohibits foreign nationals, either \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from making \u201ca contribution or donation of money or other thing of value\u201d to a campaign. It also makes it illegal for a person to \u201csolicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation\u201d from a foreign national.", "The key part regarding the Trump Tower meeting may hinge on the phrase \u201cother thing of value.\u201d", "\u201cYes, there could be crimes here,\u201d\u00a0David Sklansky, who teaches criminal law at Stanford, told us. \u201cSoliciting campaign assistance from a foreign agent is illegal, although it is unclear whether opposition research counts as assistance for this purpose.\u201d", "Bob Bauer, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama who now teaches at New York University Law School, argued in the Washington Post that it does, in this case, count as a \u201cthing of value.\u201d", "\u201cThe statute\u2019s written very, very broadly. It applies to promises of support \u2014 promises express or implied,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cIt applies to independent expenditures, meaning those with express advocacy. It applies to any expenditure, meaning those that may not be express advocacy expenditures but are for the purpose of influencing the federal election. It applies to disbursements. It is extremely broad.\u201d", "But not all legal experts agree that damaging information on Clinton would be deemed a \u201cthing of value\u201d for legal purposes. In a blog post for the Washington Post, Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA, argues that if \u201cpolitically useful information about a candidate\u2019s opponent is in general a thing of value\u201d then the law is legally \u201csubstantially overbroad\u201d and unconstitutional. And if, he argues, a \u201cthing of value\u201d does not include information, \u201cthen Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s expression of willingness to accept such information from foreigners (including ones linked to foreign governments) wouldn\u2019t be covered by the statute.\u201d", "\u201cThe phrase \u2018contribution or donation\u2019 sounds like a gift to help fund the campaign or give them something they otherwise would buy,\u201d Orin Kerr, a University of Southern California professor and former federal prosecutor,\u00a0told the New York Times.", "Even if it were determined that the opposition research offered by the Russians did not amount to a \u201cthing of value,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean Trump Jr. and others are in the clear, Sklansky told us.", "\u201cConspiring to hide campaign activity from the FEC [Federal Election Commission], or conspiring to hide the activities of a foreign agent from the DOJ [Department of Justice], could be a conspiracy to defraud the United States, depending on the details,\u201d he said.", "The special counsel\u2019s office charged three Russian organizations and 13 Russian nationals in February with violating U.S. criminal laws to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections, which included spending \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d on a pro-Trump social media campaign. The indictment specifically alleged the defendants conspired to defraud the United States \u201cby impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of State in administering federal requirements for disclosure of foreign involvement in certain domestic activities.\u201d", "With regard to the FEC, the \u201clawful functions\u201d the conspirators were alleged to have interfered with, the indictment states, were its \u201cstatutory duties of providing the American public with accurate data about the financial activities of individuals and entities supporting federal candidates, and enforcing FECA\u2019s limits and prohibitions, including the ban on foreign expenditures.\u201d", "And then there is the question of obstruction, and whether Trump Jr.\u2019s initial, misleading response to the media about the purpose of the meeting \u2014 which Trump\u2019s legal team later acknowledged\u00a0the president \u201cdictated\u201d \u2014 could be construed as part of a pattern of obstruction.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a crime to corruptly attempt to obstruct a lawful criminal investigation,\u201d Sklansky said. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that President Trump has tried repeatedly to derail the investigation into ties between his campaign and Russia; the question has been why \u2014 was it because he honestly believed there was nothing there, or because he knew there was something there? The fact that the meeting was really an effort to get dirt from the Russians on Clinton, and that Trump had his son to lie about it, is strong evidence that it\u2019s the latter\u2013which is to say, it\u2019s strong that President Trump is guilty of obstruction of justice.\u201d", "That\u2019s a legal opinion, and as we said, there are other legal experts who disagree. But suffice to say Trump\u2019s proclamation that the meeting was \u201ctotally legal\u201d is a matter of dispute among legal scholars.", "Almost all legal scholars, however, warn not to put much stock in the recent claims by Trump and his attorneys that \u201ccollusion is not a crime.\u201d", "\u201cI have been sitting here looking in the federal code trying to find collusion as a crime,\u201d Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said in a July 30 \u201cFox & Friends\u201d interview. \u201cCollusion is not a crime.\u201d The same day, on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d Giuliani said, \u201cYou start analyzing the crime \u2014 the hacking is the crime.\u201d", "(Giuliani was referring to the July 13 indictment that charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with hacking into \u201cthe computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee, and the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.\u201d)", "In a tweet, the president repeated Giuliani\u2019s claim that \u201ccollusion is not a crime.\u201d", "Collusion is not a crime, but that doesn\u2019t matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats)!", "\u2014 Donald J.

If you agree to kill someone and take a step toward that (hired the killer, or encouraged the killer, met with the killer) you are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.", "\u201cSo, if you agree to defraud the U.S. or disrupt the elections (even if it\u2019s not with the Russians) and you take a step forward (any step\u2026.meetings, payments etc.), that\u2019s conspiracy,\u201d Nourse said.", "Stephen Schulhofer, a law professor at New York University, said the act of collusion can be either benign or criminal, depending on the circumstance.", "\u201cOne of the most commonly used provisions of the U.S. Code, 18 USC \u00a7371, makes it a federal crime for two or more people to conspire \u2018to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose,'\u201d Schulhofer told us via email. \u201cAgreeing (colluding) with someone for a perfectly lawful purpose, like arranging a game of golf or tennis, is not a crime.
