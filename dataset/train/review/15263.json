["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on January 17, 2017", "On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Rep. John Lewis\u00a0said he will boycott President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, claiming it will be the first time he has missed a presidential inauguration since joining Congress 30 years ago. In fact, Lewis also skipped George W. Bush\u2019s 2001 inauguration in protest.", "In an interview taped Jan. 14, Lewis\u00a0told Chuck Todd, the host of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d that he did not consider Trump to be \u201ca legitimate president.\u201d Lewis cited a U.S. intelligence report that said\u00a0Russia had waged a broad \u201cinfluence campaign\u201d in the U.S. to help elect Trump.", "Lewis, Jan. 14:\u00a0I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. I don\u2019t plan to attend the inauguration. It will be the first one that I miss since I\u2019ve been in the Congress. You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right.", "It turns out that Lewis forgot where he was on Jan. 20, 2001.", "As pointed out by a few news organizations, including the Blaze, Lewis boycotted\u00a0Bush\u2019s 2001 inauguration. The Blaze quoted from a Jan. 21, 2001, story in the Washington\u00a0Post\u2019s\u00a0Style section that said: \u201cSome members of the Black Caucus decided to boycott Inauguration Day; John Lewis, for instance, spent the day in his Atlanta district. He thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush\u2019s swearing-in because he doesn\u2019t believe Bush is the true elected president.\u201d", "We contacted Brenda Jones, the congressman\u2019s spokeswoman, who confirmed in a statement that Lewis boycotted the 2001 inauguration. In that case,\u00a0Bush was not declared the winner until mid-December of 2000, when the U.S. Supreme Court ordered an end to the Florida recount and Democratic nominee Al Gore gave his concession speech.", "\u201cRep. Lewis also missed one other inauguration, the first inauguration of President George W. Bush,\u201d Jones said in a statement emailed to us. \u201cHis absence at that time was also a form of dissent. He did not believe the outcome of that election, including the controversies around the results in Florida and the unprecedented intervention of the US Supreme Court, reflected a free, fair and open democratic process.\u201d", "Lewis represents Georgia\u2019s 5th Congressional District, and has been a member of Congress since 1987. He is also a civil rights icon.\u00a0Lewis suffered a skull fracture when state and local police attacked\u00a0civil rights marchers who tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, on March 7, 1965.", "Trump responded to the congressman\u2019s snub by accusing\u00a0Lewis of neglecting his district. In a couple of tweets posted Jan. 14, Trump said Lewis is \u201call talk, talk, talk \u2013 no action or results.\u201d", "The president-elect\u2019s criticism of Lewis triggered a backlash on Martin Luther King Day weekend, as other Democrats announced that they, too, would boycott the inauguration.", "But Trump got the last word in this dispute with Lewis.", "John Lewis said about my inauguration, \"It will be the first one that I've missed.\" WRONG (or lie)! He boycotted Bush 43 also because he\u2026", "\u2014 Donald J.
