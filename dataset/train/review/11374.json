["The 14th of February is recognised as Valentine\u2019s Day in many countries across the world. However, a bunch of messages circulating on social media are appealing to Indians that they ought not celebrate the occasion because Indian freedom fighters \u2013 Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru \u2013 were martyred on this day. Indian wrestler Babita Phogat was among those who tweeted the claim with #JaiHind.", "Ironically, the image on the left in Phogat\u2019s tweet carried \u201927 Sep 1907 \u2013 23 March 1931\u2032 datestamp below Bhagat Singh\u2019s photograph, yet the image on the right claimed that his death anniversary falls on February 14.", "Many other social media users made similar claims and urged Indians to pay tribute to the country\u2019s martyrs. The message seems to be viral on WhatsApp as well.", "A simple Google search is enough to reveal that the messages viral on social media are untrue. Revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged in Lahore jail on March 23, 1931, after they were tried in a series of conspiracy cases. The execution was widely reported in the media. Alt News found the March 25, 1931 publication of The Tribunewith this headline on the front page \u2013 \u201cBhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev executed.\u201d", "Several books have been written on the martyred revolutionaries which corroborate the date of their execution. The excerpt below is taken from Bipin Chandra\u2019s \u2018India\u2019s struggle for independence\u2019 (pg 240).", "A book on Rajguru describes the day the trio was hanged. The chapter \u2018Martyrs\u2019 march into the history\u2019 in \u2018Rajguru: The invincible revolutionary\u2019 reads \u2013 \u201cCentral Jail, Lahore. March 23, 1931: This was an astonishing sight for jail authorities as everybody knew their hanging has been scheduled at 7 am sharp on 24th March\u2026The magistrate looked at his watch: 7:33 pm and raised his hand. Bolts were drawn, the trapdoors jerked open. The bodies shot downwards and then stopped abruptly.\u201d", "On February 14, 1931, freedom fighter Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya had sent a telegram to the viceroy of British India with an appeal to stop the execution of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru. An excerpt of the telegram is available in the book \u2018Revolutionaries and the British Raj\u2019 where Malviya said, \u201cMay I appeal to Your Excellency to exercise your prerogative of mercy in cases of Bhagat Singh, Raj Guru and Sukhdev to commute sentences of death passed upon them into those of transportation of life.\u201d", "The above-stated information is also available on the website of Bombay Sarvodaya Mandal/ Gandhi Book Centre. \u201cOn Feb 14, Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya appealed to the viceroy for mercy in the case of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, and to commute the death sentence into that of transportation for life. According to him, their lives should be spared not only on grounds of humanity but also in view of the fact that their action was not prompted by any personal or selfish consideration but by a patriotic impulse. Moreover, the execution would be a great shock to the public and the commutation, in contrast, would have a very beneficial effect on it,\u201d says the site.", "Despite expansive literature on the execution of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, the misinformation that they were martyred/ awarded death sentences on Valentine\u2019s Day is widespread on social media.", "In the morning of February 14, the \u2018Martyrs\u2019 Day (India)\u2019 page on Wikipedia reflected that the country observes Martyrs\u2019 Day on five days, including February 14. The information might have been mischievously edited to support fake news.", "The false information, however, has now been rectified.", "On a Facebook group, We Support Indian Army, the claim that the trio was martyred on February 14, 1931, received 10,000 shares.", "From a Facebook page \u0938\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0924\u0947\u0902 +, the claim attracted 1,200 shares. On I Support Modi, the fake news attracted nearly 900 shares in merely two hours.", "The misinformation, in fact, resurfaces almost every Valentine\u2019s Day.", "Such tampering with history has often been noticed by Alt News. Whether it glorifies revolutionaries or targets them, the underlying propaganda cannot be ignored. It is, thus, pertinent that social media users verify unsourced information.", "Donate Now", "Pooja Chaudhuri is a senior editor at Alt News.", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
