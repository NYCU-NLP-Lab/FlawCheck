Davis Has A Lot To Answer For,\" Abbott said Davis, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, campaigned with U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Chicago, a liberal initially elected to Congress in 1998. \u00a0Abbott\u2019s campaign manager, Wayne Hamilton, said in the release: \"Sen. Davis\u2019 fundraising on behalf of an extreme liberal Chicago congresswoman \u2013 a member of the Democratic Socialists For America no less \u2013 is merely the latest in a series of questions Sen. Davis has refused to answer about her ethics and her judgment.\"", "It\u2019s not unheard of for someone to assert a foe is a socialist. But such claims haven\u2019t held up in our past fact checks and Abbott\u2019s statement ultimately lacked confirmation as well.", "In 2011, we rated as Pants on Fire a claim that U.S. Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston and Eddie Berniece Johnson of Dallas were among Socialists in Congress. At the time, a leader of the Democratic Socialists of America said no members of Congress were members of its party. The next year, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., \u00a0gave the same rating to a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that President Barack Obama was a socialist.", "Abbott\u2019s May 6, 2014, release pointed out that a May 5, 2014, Chicago Sun-Times news blog post said Davis, who had raised money for her own campaign in Chicago May 4, was going to be among featured guests for Schakowsky\u2019s annual \"Ultimate Women's Power Lunch\" at midday along with Lizz Winstead, co-creator of the Daily Show, and Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, Sweet wrote.", "Abbott\u2019s offered basis for the socialist claim was an Oct. 16, 2010, National Review blog post on \"The Corner,\" a National Review Online blog that describes itself as a \"web-leading source of real-time conservative opinion.\" The 2010 post, by Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Ethics & Public Policy Center, said Kurtz had earlier come across \"documentary evidence\" that Schakowsky was a member of the the Democratic Socialists of America (not the Democratic Socialists For America) at the start of her political career. Kurtz\u2019s post closed by saying the \"idea of socialist politicians working openly or quietly within the Democratic Party is not a wild impossibility but a real phenomenon.\"", "No documents were included in the blog post to back up his claim that Schakowsky had been a member of the socialist group. So we followed up with Kurtz, who said by email that Schakowsky was an \"active member\" of Chicago\u2019s DSA chapter in the 1980s, a conclusion he said he based on chapter newsletters from 1983 and 1986 that he said he viewed in archives at New York University.", "\"I do not know how long\" Schakowsky \"remained a member of the DSA,\" Kurtz wrote.", "After we published this fact check, Kurtz told us by email that he sent Breitbart Texas copies of the relevant newsletter pages. The February/March 1983 issue of the Chicago Socialist, published by the Chicago chapter, credits Schakowsky as the author of an article recapping a meeting of the Illinois Public Action Council, a mix of progressive groups. A June 1986 newsletter item, headlined \"DSAers on the move,\" states that on the local political scene, Schakowsky\u2019s bid \"for Cook County Board got a boost when she drew 2nd ballot position among 14 candidates.\" The Cook County Board of Commissioners is the county\u2019s legislative body. By email, Bob Roman, secretary of the Chicago DSA chapter, told us the posted newsletter excerpts were authentic.", "Schakowsky\u2019s House spokesman, Lee Whack, referred us to her campaign political director, Alex Armour, who didn\u2019t engage.", "By telephone, Maria Svart, the national director of the DSA, noted the group is an activist and educational group and not a political party. She also reaffirmed what a predecessor in that role, Frank Llewellyn, told us in 2011. To join the group, a person must fill out a form and pay dues, Llewellyn said, adding that the last member of Congress who was a card-carrying member was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998.", "Svart also said that while the group doesn\u2019t announce its members, as far as she knows, Schakowsky isn\u2019t a member and never was.", "Separately, we spotted a web post by the Chicago chapter of the DSA showing Schakowsky spoke at the group\u2019s May 13, 2011, Eugene V. Debs-Norman Thomas-Michael Harrington dinner celebrating union organizers and other activists on the left. A May-June 2011 DSA recap said Schakowsky told guests that despite Democrats being the House minority, she was optimistic in that conservatives in Congress had over-reached. A DSA web page on the history of the annual dinner lists Schakowsky as the 2000 dinner\u2019s honoree. That listing led to another web post detailing why Schakowsky was honored, touching on her actions as a consumer advocate and state and federal legislator. It didn\u2019t speak to her membership (or not) in the DSA.", "By phone, Roman said Schakowsky is \"not somebody that we claim as a member.\" He also said he generally doesn\u2019t comment on whether anyone is current or former member. \"Once you say \u2018so and so\u2019 is a member, was a member or was never a member, then you open yourself to queries about any single person who has ever been a member,\" Roman said.", "To our inquiry, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas emailed us a copy of the invitation to the Schakowsky event attended by Davis. The invitation \u00a0lacks mention of Davis--and lists Winstead as the star attraction. Petkanas also provided what he described as the prepared text of Davis\u2019 remarks at the event, which do not include an appeal for donations to Schakowsky\u2019s political kitty. \"Davis stopped by the event to talk about Texas and give an update on her campaign,\" Petkanas said.", "Our ruling", "Abbott said Davis raised money for a member of a socialist group.", "Davis appeared at a Chicago fund-raiser for Schakowsky, who may have once participated in the Chicago chapter of the DSA and has been saluted by it.
