While NDTV included the clip in a bloopers video, a reporter attempting to save himself from a terror attack is hardly amusing.", "Alt News also reached out to Ravish Kumar who informed that multiple people have inquired about the video. \u201cIt is the person circulating the video who should be questioned. They would\u2019ve known the context had they asked for the complete video. I was not at the spot. Had I been there, I would\u2019ve tried to find out the reporter\u2019s reasons [for rolling on the ground]. You cannot share this video and veil the antics of Arnab Goswami and pliable journalists who follow his suit. I knew the clip featured Mr Fayaz Bukhari from Srinagar. What should the people who fell for the video do? They should at least think about how the ones who release such clips consider them gullible enough to believe anything. This is the entire model. Keep bluffing and confusing people. I am both amused and feel a sense of pity for the ones who fell for the clip. They must be exposed to countless such misleading videos. May God give them wisdom.\u201d", "The video was shared on social media to mock journalist Ravish Kumar who often finds himself in the crosshairs of misinformation. But another point worthy of mention is NDTV\u2019s insensitivity toward journalist Fayaz Bukhari reporting on the aftermath of a terror attack. That NDTV picked up a clip of his attempts to save himself from gunfire is unfortunate.
