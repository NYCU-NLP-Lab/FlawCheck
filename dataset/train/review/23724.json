["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on May 31, 2019", "A picture of a cow used for a research project in 2008 has been circulating on social media with a false claim that \u201cfringe leftist[s] are now advocating for cow fart bags to capture farts as a way to help prevent \u2018global warming.'\u201d", "A cow used in an Argentine research project in 2008 has become the star of a misleading post on social media in 2019.", "The cow, which is shown wearing an inflatable pink cylinder on its back, has had its picture shared more than 35,000 times on Facebook with this text: \u201cI wish this was a joke but fringe leftist [sic] are now advocating for cow fart bags to capture farts as a way to help prevent \u2018global warming.\u2019 You can\u2019t make this stuff up folks.\u201d", "But that claim is made up.", "The backpack was used to collect gas produced during the cow\u2019s digestive process so that scientists could study the effect its diet has on the production of methane and other volatile organic compounds in ruminants that contribute to climate change. The backpack was connected to the cow\u2019s stomach through a hole in its ribs, and was collecting what would have been burps, not \u201cfarts,\u201d as the Facebook post claims.", "But, most importantly, the backpack was not intended as a device to keep methane out of the atmosphere. Rather, it was used to help scientists study how cow\u2019s digest what they eat.", "The same researchers who worked on that project used a similar gas collection system a year earlier to study the methane produced in the digestion of dairy cows. That study, which lasted 28 days and included six cows, found that the addition of tannins (an additive derived from plants) to the cows\u2019 diet led to a 28 percent decrease in methane production.", "A later project by the same researchers, done in 2013, used the collection system to transform the methane into biofuel.", "According to the Environmental Protection Agency, between 50 percent and 65 percent of methane emissions around the world come from human activity, including the use of livestock, and the impact on the global climate is 25 times greater than the impact of carbon dioxide over 100 years.", "The agriculture sector was responsible for about 9 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, according to the EPA.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
